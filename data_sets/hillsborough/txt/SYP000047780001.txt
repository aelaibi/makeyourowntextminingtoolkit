                                 - Secretary


 I           The Chairman opened the meeting by stating its intention of assessing the
             planning, action and incidents relating to the FA Cup Semi-Final between

 I           Tottenham Hotspur and Wolverhampton Wanderers held atHillsborough on
             Saturday ii April 1981.

             Certain problems had occurred but in his and the Chief Constable’s opinion
 I           we had acted correctly. One letter of complaint had been received from a member
             of the public as well as one letter praising the police action in a dangerous
             situation. Chief Superintendent Herold mentioned that other letters

 I           congratulating the police on their actions had also been received.
             Mr Goslin said that it was his decision to remove soectators from the Leppings
             Lane end of the ground to the other side in order to ease a dangerous situation
 I           where serious injuries or even fatalities were a real possibility. He then
             read the letter of complaint, which contained an allegation that the police
             herded more and more people into the Leppings Lane enclosure when it wa{ obvious
I0           that it was full.                    4~’

            The Chairman invited views on thispoint. Superintendent Chaoman said that the
i           entrances to Leppings Lane were controlled to ensure an even distribution of
            fans. However, as the gorund filled up the usual packing problems occurred.
            There was space in the centre of the enclosure but fans refused to move over

i           and fill it. Police officers were placed into the crowd to ensure that the
            best use was made of the availa_hle space. The Mounted Department also assisted
            at the-rear of the crowd to prevent more people entering that part of the
            ground.
I           Chief Superintendent Herold pointed out that t~e problem was exacerbated by a
            series of incidents Which culminated in the late arrival of a large number of
i           fans. This meant that instead of arriving over a period, they all’arrived
            together very closeto kick-off time.
                                                                                                          _." ........
            At 11.25 am an accident occurred on the M1 Moto~ay involving 13 cars, causing
            two of the t.hree lanes to be closed down for one ind a half hours. Just north
            of this, and at about the same time, a PSV broke down. Passengers alighted from

i                                                                            Continued/.,

      it and caused problems on the motorway. The pontoon bridges and extensive
      roadworks on the motorway in the Derbyshire Police Area also created delays.
      This 90 minute delay resulted in a sudden flood of vehicles, all of them
      ~Spurs supporters, into Sheffield. Acting Chief Superintendent Thompson took
      up this point and said that he accepted that the traffic route, designed to
      dividethe football supporters from the city centre shoppers, was too tortuous,
      although this may not have proved a problem had there been a steady f!ow of
      spectators rather than the sudden influx caused by the incidents described by
      Mr Herold.

I     The Chairman then sought the views of the meeting over the crushing incidents
      when several spectators were injured and which necessitated the removal of
      some spectators from the Leppings Lane enclosure.
                                                                           t~

 I    Mr Herold said that the capacity for the Leppings Lane enclosure, stated in
      the certificate issued under the Safety of Sports Grounds Act, is i0,i00°
      This must, of necessity, contain a safety margin. The actual turnstile
I©    reading~was 10,435 to which must be added the 70 Spurs supporters who had
      managed to obtain tickets which put them amongst the 9blves supporters. These
      had been moved to Leppings Lane from the Kop for their own safety. This made
 I    a total of 405 spectators over the authorised limit. Inspector Calvert pointed
      out that this created a similar situation to last year when about 400 forged
      tickets were printed for the Leppings Lane end, although the same problem was

 I    ¯ not experienced ~hen.

      Mr Herold had already referred to the late arrival of a large number of           \

 I    spectators who were still waiting to enter the Leppings Lane enclosure when
      the match s~arted. The flashpoint occurred when Tottenham scored after only
      three minutes. The spectators just entering pushed forward to see what was     |
      happening and caused a crush, which resulted in the injuries. InsPector
 I    Greenwood also mentioned that there had been two or three fights, albeit of
      a minor nature, at the same time. This had resulted in the order from Mr Goslin \
      to open the gates at the front of Leppings Lane in order to release some          1
 I    spectators onto the pitch surround. This was done by opening the gates,
      releasing a few spectators and then c!osing them to allow a steady flow.
      was difficult~ to maintain because as soon as pressure was relieved at the
                                                                                  This
                                                                                         |


      front the crush from the back filled the void.
Io    The lack of a reserve serial between’the South Stand and the Leppings Lane
      stand (where one has normally been situated) caused a few minutes delay in
 I    the deplo~ent of officers to police this situation but this problem was soon
      overcome. Superintendent Chapman stressed that there was still room in the
      centre of the Leppings Lane enclosure although it :~-as quite full. This was
I     only to be expected when there was a capacity crowd, but the refusal of
      spectators to fill spaces had caused difficulties elsewhere in the enclosure.

      The discussion progressed to the construction of the Leppings Lane enclosure.
I     Mr Goslin felt that it was inadequate and required more divisions~so that
      spectators are not in such a solid mass. He also felt that the limit of
     i0,i00 was to~ high, although Superintendent Chapman disagreed with this.
I     The Chairman disagreedwith Mr Herold’s suggestion of a 6 ft to 8 ft wide
      channel down the centre of the enclosure to divide spectators and segregate
      opposing fans on the grounds that such a small segregation gap only encouraged
      opposing spectators to throw articles at each other and at police officers
      in the middle. Inspector Calvert expressed concern about the central


I                                                                      Continued/ ......

           entrance to the Leppings Lane area because it always causes delays and
I          blockages. It would benefit from reconstruction.

           .The Chairman said that talks would take place with Sheffield Wednesday
!           Footbal! Club on the ground capacities and for any reconstruction thought to
            be necessary.


I          The discussion progressed to the fans who ran onto the pitch during the half
           time interva!.


I          Mr Herold said that the trouble stemmed from the front central gate being
           opened from where about 150 young fans were led onto the pitch surround.
           These were the ones who eventually ran onto the pitch although at the time
            it was necessary for the gate to be opened to relieve crowd pressure. The
I          match referee, Clive Thomas, had said t_hat he was unable to start the match
           when he wanted to. This was, however, based on a five minute half-time
           interval and not on the norma! ten minute one. It was unfair to suggest

I©          that the match was held up as a result of the fans on the pitch.
                  L
           ~ir Goslin said that he may have made a %.~ong decision at half-time to try

I          and get the fans from the pitch surround onto the Kop. They had not been
           causing any trouble ~here they were, yet the decision to move them onto the
           Kop precipitated a minor pitch invasion. The half-time interval was, on
           reflection, insufficient to carry out the necessary manoeuvre. Some of the
I          people who were being shepherded into the Kop refused to go in, resulting in
           a minor ’break-out’ which was quickly controlled. Mr Herold said that it was
           apparent, for future reference, that when people have to be moved from the

I          Kop the area behind the hoardings is an ideal position to put them into. Chief
           Inspector Smith also pointed out that 50-100 fans had been successfully removed
           from the pitch and placed into the centre of the Kop. Mr Herold said that

I          this situation prompted the only criticism of the police by the club in that
           we seemed to be helping fans to climb over the railings. Insoector Sykes
           replied to this criticism by saying that only.the fans who had become stuck
           whilst attempting to climb over the railings to avoid the crush had been
I          helped by police officers so they did not injure themselves. The other fans
           were released, in small groups through a police controlled gate.


    II o   One problem which was totally unnecessary was that caused by the sale of
           unwanted tickets by Wolverhampton Wan-derers direct to Tottenham Hotspur. This
           is contrary to FA directions and neither the FA, Sheffield Wednesday FC nor

I          the police were told of this decision. This made a nonsense of the
           segregation arraneementis and was a contributing factor to the difficulties
           which occurred. Discussions were to take place about this situation.

I          The Chairman then asked for any comments or criticisms which could prove
           useful for future occasions. The following points were raised:

           The route for traffic from the motorway was too tortuous and the more direct

I          route, the Parkway, should be considered in the future. Chief Superintendent
           Herold pointed out tha~ this would bring the fans through the city centre
           and into .direct conflict with the bus routes for walking spectators.

         Mr Thompson also relayed criticisms that officers outside the ground had
         made no attempt to direct traffic at blocked up junctions. This cricitism
        ¯~tas not accepted because with the size of the crowd some delay must be
         accepted and anticipated.

         Superintendent Chapman

I        The absence of a reserve serial between the South Stand and West Stand caused
         a slight delay in the deployment of officers to the disorder situation and

I        there should be a reserve stationed there in future.

         There should be female officers available at the turnstiles to assist in any
         necessary searches. There was a marked absence of female officer~at the
I        gates.

         The back to back radios are not useful in the situation when there is

I        extensive media coverage at the ground. There is a high degree of inter-
         ference.

I        Acting Superintendent Ruddy

         The communications had proved successful with three channels being used
          (i, 2 and 4). The splitting of the ground control and the public order control
I        meant that the caravan for public order control need no longer be situated
         inside the ground and could be moved about outside for optimum reception.

I        Mr Ruddy also pointed out that the supervisory officers from foreign
         forces had made many complimentary remarks about the planning, organisation
         and operational aspects of this event. He felt that we were being over

I        critical of ourselves.

         Inspector Calvert

I       Mr Calvert suggested the inclusion of a de-brief chart so that the comments
        of any officers at the ground could be included for discussion.

II0     Inspector Sykes

        On this occasion officers from foreign forces had been employed on duties

I       inside the ground. Mr Sykes felt that this should be the duty of the reqular
        officers (’F’ Division)° who are familiar with the territory.

        Mr Herold pointed out that the reverse situation had applied last year and
I       there were still difficulties. Ln fact, the local knowledge of the visiting
        officers who were inside had helped to overcome situationswhich our own
        policemen may not have been able to deal with easily. There are also
I       logistical difficulties with the deployment of foreign officers outside the
        ground.


I       Sergeant

        Difficulties were experienced because officers from foreign forces had not

I       read or understood the correspondence sent to them. Despite having maps and
        being taker, on a tour of the ground, some had gone to a different part of
                                                                        s



I                                                                           Continued/ ......

        the ground to where they had been deployed. This could have had serious
I .._
        consequences w/hen_ assistance was urgently needed.
        ¯The local call signs (eg Sierra 5 - Sergeant) should be stressed to visiting

I        officers as the lack of this knowledge could lead to confusion.

        There had been too many people inside the control room -a maximum of nine

l       persons during the critical stages in a room designed for three, and this
        had shown that the ventilation was inadequate. On this point Superintendent
        Chapman said that the number of senior officers in the control room at this

I       time had caused confusion because on occasions conflicting instructions had
        been given and the control room staff did not know which particular
        instruction to accept and relay.

I       The Assistant Chief Constable (Operations) agreed to consider all the points
        raised for future occasions and thanked all present for their attendance.

        The meeting closed at 7.20 pm.

I               Members of the Fire Service and Buildings Department were in
                attendance and the only reservations expressed were by the Fire
                Service, who indicated that the security gates - which will be

!               open during ,football matches - should not in any way restrict the
                egress routes, which they feel are of minimum width as it is.


!               The Buildings. representative indicated he would seek further
                information regarding the construction materials to be used but
                this would pose no problem.

      Dear ~. Vaughan,
I                                Sheffield Wednesday Football Club Ltd.

I                                   Radial Fences at Leppings Lane End

                We have been instructed by the Club to organise the

I     installation of two radial fences on the terrace at the
     Leppings lane end of the ground.


I                       It is intended that these fences are so positioned
     that they divide this section of the terrace into
     a~proximately three equal areas~ each served by its own
I    entr ance.


I                   By dividing the.terrace more control over supporters
    should result. A visiting team with only a few followers
    will be allocated one section, with the other two sections
I   retained by the home supporters.


I         Larger contingents of visiting spectators could be
    accommodated in two or all three areas as their numbers
    dictate.
I                 A 1.15 metre wide gate is proposed at the rear of
    each fence to give access for maintenance and also policing
I   during a game. The gate could be left open, but fastened
    back, to connect the areas during a game if adjacent ones

I                                                      Registered in England - No. 1134531

I
I         are zccupied by supporters of the same team. When establishing
          the height we have considered that the views to the corner

I         flags should not be restricted any further than they are at
          present by the perimeter fence. We therefore propose that the

I         top of the fence should be approximately 168Omm above the
          terr ace.

I              This may not prevent the odd spectator climbing the fence
          but should eliminate z mass inv.zsion from one area to the other.
          Fences this height appear to work successfully at St. Jzmes’s
I         Park, the home of Newcastle United.
               We would be pleased if this specific point can be discussed
I         within the Working Party and your comments forwarded to us.

I              Also to be included in the same contract are Some gates at
          various locations around the north stand. Now the gymnasium is
          open to the general public security to cther parts of the ground
I         must be maintained. It is proposed that gates are provided at
          the top of the ramps at both ends of the stand with additional
I         gates at ground floor level at the Penistone Road end of the
          stand. A separate gate will be placed behind the west ramp to
I         prevent people going round the rear of the gymnasium towards
          Leppings Lane.

I              Six copies of our drawing-3563/1 together with two copies
          of our drawings 3563/2 and 3 (for reference only) are enclosed.

I     Dear Sir,

      Safety of Soorts Grounds Act, 1975

I     Sheffield Wednesday Football Club

      Referring to your letter of 9th September, the Officer Working Party

I     (Sheffield District) has considered the proposals referred to in your
      letter of 2nd September and accompanying plans¯

     I.     Radial Barriers on West Terrace
I    ~nilst welcoming the increased control on the Terrace which should
     result, concer~, was expressed as to the problems which could occur with

I    opposing fans mixing at the rear of the West Stand and/or at the entry!
     exit gates. However, it was felt that only experience would show
     whether this would prove to be a reality and, if realised, whether the

I    problem was of. such a small scale that it could be easily coped with by
     the police¯



I
     Accordingly, the Officer Working Party at this stage sees no objection
     to the proposals to instal m¢o 1680 ~m high radial barriers, with 1.15
     metre gates at the rear, on the West Terrace, subject to:-


I    (a)   the further calculations required by the Building Authority being
           satisfactory (Mr. Sheriff to contact you direct);


I    (b)   confirmation that adequate headroom will be available at the rear
           of the Terrace after installation of the barriers and gates, and



I    (c)   the new gates at the rear of the Terrace also being under police
           control.

           Security Gates around North Stand

I     Q


     The Officer Working Party fully recognises the Club’s need to provide
     security for the remainder of the stadium when only the gy=masium is in

I    use.

     Provided that the gates and/or their supports, hinges, etc. do not

I    impinge on the existing critical ramp widthsand the gates are secured
     in the .fully open position on match days, the Officer Working Party
     sees no objection to the erection of security gates around the North Stand

!    Dr. W. Eastwood                 - 2 -                 14th September, 1981.


!    3.    Other Matters

     Two other matters were also ~aised by the Officer Working Party relating
     to the Police and First Aid Facilities and the siting of certain of the
     Lottery Ticket Boxes.

!    (a) Police and First Aid Facilities

           It was recalled that the existing unsatisfactory police and first

!          aid facilities under the North Stand had been accepted on an interim
           basis on the understanding that the Club would provide purpose built
           replacement facilities in the 1980 close season.

!          It is appreciated that discussions on the detailed requirements are
           still continuing, but it is fglt that the Club should be asked to give
           a firm indication when the new police and first aid facilities are to’.
!    (b)
           be provided.
           Lottery Ticket Boxes


!          Concern was expressed as to the blocked egress which could result if
           the timber lottery ticket boxes presently sited close to the ramps
           were to be tipped over or ignited, either accidentally or deliberately°

!          The Officer Working Party felt that the Club should be requested to
           re-site the boxes in a less critical position.

!   I attach an additional copy of this letter for your use.

                                             Yours faithfully,
!

I        I.     Purpose of Meeting

         The purpose of the meeting was to consider the
i                                                       letter dated 2nd September
         and plans submitted by Messrs. Eastwood and Partners on behalf of the
         Sheffield Wednesday Football Club Ltd. relating to the proposed erection
         of Radial Barriers on the West Terrace for crowd control purposes and
         Security Gates at various locations around the North Stand now that the
         g~-~nasium was open to the general pu51iQ.


I       2.     Radial Barriers on West Terrace

        Whilst there were drawbacks to the division of the terrace into
        approximately three equal areas, each served by its own entrance, the
        Working Party felt that increased control on the Terrace should result
        from the proposals. For instance there could well be problems with
        opposing fans mixing at the rear of the West Stand and/or the final exit
        gates, but the police considered that ~ey could cope with any problems
        of this nature.

        The adequacy and positioning of the gates to be
                                                      installed at the rear of
        the radial barriers was also discussed, as well as the use of the
        existing gates in the pitch perimeter security fence at the front of the
        Terrace.

        It was noted that the plans submitted did not indicate the amount of head-
        room which would be available at the rear of the Terrace should the
        radial barriers and gates be installed.

        IT WAS AGREED that Mr. Vaughan should notify Messrs. Eastwood and Partners
        tha~ the Officer Working Party sees no objection to the proposals to instal
        two 1680~ high radial barriers, with 1.15 metre w4de gates at the rear,
        on the West Terrace at the Hillsborough Stadium, subject to:-

I             (i)      the further calculations required by the Building
                       Authority being satisfactory;

I             (ii)    confirmation that adequate headroom will be
                      available at the rear of the Terrace, and

              (iii)   the new gates at the rear of the Terrace also being
I
         ~"           under police control.

!     3.     Security Gates around North Stand

      Now that the gymnasium was open to ,the general public, the Club wished to

IIQ   erect security gates at the top of ~the ramps at both ends of the North
      Stand, with additional gates at ground floor level at the Penistone Road
      end of the Stand. A separate gate would also be placed behind the West

!
      Ramp to prevent people going round the rear of the gymnasium towards
      Leppin~ Lane.

      These gates ~uld.be fastened when the gymnasium only was in use so as to

!     provide security for the rest of t~e ground. However, on match days they
      would be secured in the fully open position to allow unrestricted access.


!     IT WAS AGREED that ~. Vaughan should notify Messrs. Eastwood and Partners
      that the Officer Working Party sees no objection to the erection of security
      gates around the North Stand, subject t~ the gates and/or their supports,

!
      hinges, etc not implngingon the existing critical ramp widths, and to the
      gates being secured in the fully open position on match days.

      4.    Police and First Aid Facilities

!     It was recalled that the existing unsatisfactory police and first aid
      facilities under the North Stand had keen accepted on an interim basis.

!     The Club had undertaken to provide purpose built facilities in a similar
      position to t~e existing tim~ered facilLties during the 1980 close
      season. ~nilst some progress had been made in discussing details of the
      facilities, no firm indication had yet Been given as to when they would
      actually be provided.

      IT WAS AGREED that Mr..D. Vaughan should press the Club and/or its
      Consultant~    for a fi~ indication as to when the new police and first
      aid facilities are to+~e provided.

      5.    Lotted Ticket Boxes

      Attention was drawn to the blocked egress which could result if the
      timber lottery ticket boxes presently sited close to the ramps were to
      be tipped over or ignited, either accidentally or deliberately,

      IT WAS AGF~ED that Mr. Vaughan s~ould draw the Club’s attention to the
      desirability of re-siting the lottery ticket boxes.

I                  Messrs. Eastwood & Partners (the Club’s Consultants) relating

                   two staircases at the rear of the West Stand at the Hillsborough

I                  Stadium.

                   Perhaps you will let me have your comments on the proposa| from

I                  a policing point of view, as well as confirming that the radial
                   fences and security gates already installed are proving to be
                   satisfactory.

                   An additional copy of this letter and enclosures is atrnch,d for
                   Divisional use.

I       OurRef: DV/SY/583/5            YourRef: W-E/JAS/SR!3563   Date: 2Oth January, 1982.


       Dear Sir,
I      Safety of Sports Grounds Act, 1975
       Sheffield Wednesday Footbal! Club Ltd.

I       In reply to your letter dated 14th December, 1981, I understand that
        the Building Authority has contacted your office direct for clarification

I     __ on a sma!! nu~mer of points regarding the proposed installation of pairs
        of gates at the bottom of the two staircases at the back of the West
        Stand. Subject to the satisfactory resolution of these points and, of
        course, to the gates being secured in the fully open position during the
I       time the public parts of the stadium are occupied when matches are
        bein~ played, the Officer Working Party has no objection to the proposals.


I      As regards the radia! fences installed on the West Terrace and the
       security==ares around the North Stand, the Officer Working_ ParTy wishes
       to make the fo!!owing comments:-

I      (a)       Radia! Barriers on West Terrace

       The matches played at the stadium since the installation o~ the barriers
I      confirm that they appear to be working wel! and satisfactori!v effect the
       segregation of opposing groups of fans. However, the entire section of
       the Terrace has yet to be given to one group of fans.
I      The Police inform me that, on installation of the new radia! barriers,
       the existing crush barriers have been extended in some places uD to and

I      com~leteiv through the new madiai barriers at a height of 4’6" or so
       frc: the ground. The effect is to make it very easy for fans to climb
       from one pen to another. In other places the existing crush barrier

I      rails have been cut off short of the radial barriers in a manner which
       leaves ~angerous pieces protruding ~nto some of the gangways.

       (b)      Security Gates around the North Stand
I     You will recal! that mv         letter of 14th September, 1981 snared that,
      provided that the gates         and/or their supports, hinges, etc., do not

I     impinge on the existing
      saw no objection to the
                                      critica! ramp widths, the Officer Workin~ Party
                                      erection of the securiny gates.


I     I am informed that the manner in which the gates have been installed
      has resulted in each gate’s hinge impinging a~ least 7~" into the width
      of the ramp. This means that there is a 15" reduction in width of the

        As the Annual winter inspection of the Hillsborough Stadium is due
        to take place anytime around now, I would sugges~ the opportunity be
        taken to discuss these matters at the inspection.

I       Perhaps you would contact x~

          Purpose of Meeting
                                     (South Yorkshire County Fire Setice)




I   The purpose of the meeting was to discuss-ahe apparent difference of opinion
    on certain aspects of the radia! barriers installed on the West Terrace

I
    and the security gates at the top of the North stand r~os, as wel! as to
    carry out the usua! winter inspection of the Stadium.

    2.    Ground inspection

I   A.    West Terrace


I   ~Fnilst the whole Terrace had yet to be used, the matches played since the
    erection of the radia! barriers indicated that generally they worked wel! and
    satisfactorily effected the segregation of opposing groups of fans.

I   However, the police pointed out that in places the existing crush barriers
    had been extended up to and, in some cases, completely through the new
    radial barriers, which ha~ the effect of making it relatively easy for anyone

I   who wished to do so to Climb from one pen to another. Also, in the pen
    nearest to the South Stand, a smal! length of existing crush barrier had been
    left unsupported.

I   IT WAS AGREED -



I   (i)    That, on balance, it was preferable from a safety point of view to
    prevent crowd surge by the existing barriers being extended up t¢ and/or
    through the new radia! barriers than to completely prevent persons being
    able to climb from one pen to another, subject to reviewat the end of the

I   current season.

    (ii) That the unsupported smal! length of existing crush barrier would

I   be cut off.

                                             -!-

I
i’O      B.     West Stand"


I        One of the security gates which the Club wished to insta! at the bottom of
         the two staircases had now been erected.

ii IT WAS AGF~ED that this could be regarded as satisfactory. -- (~p~ IO,~~
J      C. North Stand                                                    ;m~~ ~ ~~

I      The Fire Service felt that the manner in which the security gates had been
       installed at the top of the ramps unduly restricted the exit width available.


I      The Club’s Consultants and the Fire Service disagreed on the interpretation
       of paragraph 16 of the "Green Guide", and consequently on the figure to be
       applied in the calculation for assessing whether the exit width lost at the top
       of the ramps by the method of security gate installation was critical or not.
I      IT WAS AGREED    that, as the point might well have been covered in the
       initial consideration of the Club’s application for a General Safety

I      Certificate, the point would not be pursued at the moment.

              NOTE - A search of the file subsequently revealed that, as

I                    suspected, the point had been considered at a
                     meeting of the Officer Working Party on 12.2.79,
                     the relevant part of the Note of the meeting reading:-

I                          "the construction and width of fhe ramps being
                            such that they could quite~properly be
                                                                       ~ ~ ~

I     De      S~ion Koo


I     It was noted that the infilling of the step adjacent to the handrail on
      the left of the original exit at the cop of the Kop had taken place; that
      the boundary fence a= the top of the Kop had been reinforced, and that the
      exisnin~ barriers had been permanently extended and the area at the foot
I     of the nero Kop exit (adjacent to the brick built refreshment point)
      levelled off as agreed.                                                ~/

     F.       Items of General Maintenance

I    IT L~S A~=~=D thai the ~i!owing items of general malntenanae required
     attention:-


I    (i)    The rounding off of the corners on the steelwork of the underside of
     the e:<it at the southerl- end of the West Stand (~o be done that day), as /
     well as the rounding off of the brackets to the North Stand security gates.

I    (ii) The repair or replacement of the corroding stanchions supporting the
     fencing and sheeting above the boundary wall on the right hand side of
     Gate "O".

I        (v)   The brick wall between the South Stand and the Spion Kop (nearest
         to the South Stand) to be pointed.

         (vi) The concrete supporting strut to the wall between the Spion Kop and
i        the South Stand (nearest to the Spion Kop) to be protected (cracks and
         exposed bar).

I   ¯    G.     Temporary Structures

         Concern was ex-pressed as to the possibility of inadequate structural stability

I        of temporary structures, such as scaffolding used in connection with
         television transmissions.

         Paragraph 20 of the Club’s General Safety Certifi care required T.V. cameras
i        and portable equipment to 5e placed only in suchpositions as may be
         between the Police and the Club. The Club also were generally req uired to
                                                                                       agreed

         ensure that the Stadium complied with good engineering and bui iding practices
I        and with the relevant British Standard Specification orCode         of Practice.

         I T WAS AGREED that the question of temporary structures should be kept

    I   "It was likely that, following continuing consultations with the Police, the
         Club would shortly be in a position to formally notify the County Council          J
         that the new Police and First Aid Facilities ~ould be°provided in the

        B.      Additional Tu~.stiles and Exit Gate in Penis~one Read

    I   The Club hoped to fo~--maiiy notify the "County Council shortly of their
        intention to proceed in the forthcoming close season wi~h the demolition of
        some of the existing toilets on the Penistone Road side of the Stadium in/
    I   order to provide additional turnstiles and exit gate on that side of the
        Stadium.          ""

        Because of drainage problems, the existing concrete panel fence to the)

    i   rear of the Spion Kop (nearest to the 0wls Club) had had to be removed.~
        ~nen settlement was complete, it was in~ended to widen the existing
        walkway and erect a new fence on the revised line.

I Dear Mr Vaughan,
I              Sheffield Wednesday Football Club Ltd
      Segregation of Visiting Spectators at Leppings Lane End

I                  The club is anxious to segregate the visiting team’s supporters
      as they enter the ground, and also to enable the police to control
      their exit at the end of a game.
I         We have prepared the scheme shown on the attached print of our
      drawing 6705/9. This involves the construction of two new banks of
I     turnstiles (Nos 17 - 91 and 99 _ 99), and various runs of fencing
      and new gates.

I         It would be appreciated if t~ Working Party could consider this
      proposal at an early date. Mr Chester has already given a copy of

I     the drawing to the police so that they have had some advance notice.




I                                                                       Yours sincerely,

I       I.    Purpose of Meeting


I       The purpose of the meeting was to consider the letter dated 9th April
        and plan from Messrs. Eastwood & Partners relating to the proposals of
        the Sheffield Wednesday Football Club to construct two new banks of


I
        turnstiles and various runs of fencing and new gates in order to achieve
        segregation of visiting supporters at the Leppings Lane end of the
        Hillsborough Stadium.


I       2.    Consideration of Proposals

        The Police representatives pointed out that the proposals had been

I       prompted in the main by comments they had made to the Club. At one
        time, both the West Stand and Terrace had been regarded as exclusively
        for the use of visiting supporters, but recent patterns of attendances
        at the Stadium made it necessary to allow for some element of use by
I       home supporters as well.

        The proposals now outlined by the Club were generally acceptable to the

I       Police representatives, subject to:-

        (a)   additional gates being provided between the turnstile numbered 16

I       (b)
              and the wall of the inner access~ road;

              the central area of the Terrace (indicated as the neutral area or
              visiting supporters’ terrace) being divided in half by a new
I             central radial fence running from the tunnel entrance to the
              pitchside security fence with gates erected so as to permit entry
              to be diverted to either half as appropriate (the proposed new

I             secondary radial fence adjacent to the existing fence indicated
              on the plan to be abandoned);


I       (c)   the right hand area of the Terrace (indicated as home supporters’
              terrace) also to be divided in half by a new central radial fence
              running from back to front with two gates (the existing radial
              fence dividing the present two Terrace areas - neutral area and
I             home supporters - to have a second gate installed;

        (d)   the existing pitch perimeter fence to haveadditional exit gates

I             installed - one in the neutral area and one in the home supporters
              area


I                                               Io
I   0
I       The County Fire Service saw no objection in principle to the proposals,
        subject to more detailed investigation of the means of escape aspects,
        and the Building Authority similarly saw no objection, subject to
I       submission of detailed plans and calculations under both the Safety of
        Sports Grounds Act and Building Regulations.


I       3.   Action

        IT WAS AGREED :-

I       (a) That R. Grimshaw should investigate as a matter of urgency the means
        of escape aspects of the proposals and let D. I. Vaughan know the
        outcome.
I       (b) That, subject to satisfactory clearance of these aspects by the
        County Fire Service, the outline proposals submitted by Messrs. Eastwood

I       & Partners be agreed as now amended by the suggestions of the South
        Yorkshire Police, also subject, of course, to the submission of the
        necessary detailed plans and calculations under both the Safety of Sports

          Dear Sirs,

                                                                                   /


          Sheffield Wednesday Football Club PLC

I         In reply to your letter dated 9th April, whilst a meeting of the
          Officer Working Party (Sheffield District) was held on 18th April

I         to consider the proposals which you outlined, the County Fire
          Service requested additional time to consider the means of escape
          aspects.


I         I am now able to say that, subject to the incorporation of the
          following points and to the submission of detailed plans and
          calculations under both the Safety of Sports Grounds Act and

I         Building Regulations, the proposals outlined are regarded as
          generally acceptable:-

          (a)

                numbered 16 and the wall of the inner access road;

I               area or visiting supporters’ terrace) being divided in
                half by a new central radial .fence running from the tunnel
                entrance to the pitchside security fence with gates erected

I               so as to permit entry to b~ diverted to either half as
                appropriate (the proposed new secondary radial fence
                adjacent to the existing fence indicated on the plan to be

I        (c)
                abandoned) ;

                the right hand area of the Terrace (indicated as home supporters’
                terrace) also to be divided in half by a new central radial

I               fence running from back to front with two gates (the existing
                radial fence dividing the present two Terrace areas - neutral
                area and home supporters - to have a second gate installed):

           For the attention of Mr. D. Vaughan


I          Dear Mr. Vaughan,
                            Safety of Sportsground Act, 1975

I                        Sheffield Wednesday Footbal! Club PLC
                  Thank you very much for your letter of 30 July giving the
           outcome of the Working Party meeting on 29 July.    We note
I          the genera! comment that the calcul~tions have to be approved
           by the Building Surveyors Department. We believe that al! the
I          calculations which are likely to be required have been sent for
           checking and comment.

I                 With regard to your detailed observations our response
           is as follows .-

I           (a)     We are not sure of the location on the West terrace of
           the proposed extra security gate. There is already a gate in
           the 2m wide gap formed by the new radial fence for use by the
I          police. This same gate will still be available for the spectators
           in emergency as there are gates into the ~2m gap from the terrace
I          which will be under the control of the police.     This point may
           perhaps be clarified during the Working Party rs visit on 7 August.
I          (b)            The foundations-for thi~ fence are in fact already aligned in
                                         An Unlimited Company, Registered in England - No. 1833144

I
I                                                                      SHEET 2.


I   EASTWOOD ~ PARTNERS


I
I
     the way you suggest.
I     (c) and (d)

I            We are a little surprised by the suggestion that a
     single block thickness is not sufficient for the cubicle
     walls. The inside of a toilet cubicle is not a very
I    vulnerable area and the walls are braced by the door frame.
     Studding is not at all suitable in terms of strength or
I    durability, and would probably invite vandalism.
     (e)     The refreshment area is under the most westerly
I    staircase up to the north west corner terrace. There will
     be an opportunity to inspect on 7 August.

I    (f)     The handrail is to be at a height of 125Omm (4’1")
     above the horizontal step, measured at the face of the vertical
I    step.
     (g)     The stepping of the face of the wall is achieved by 45°

I    chamfers which will not form good footholds.

     (h)    Mr. Chester says that the club will certainly not
I   object to the provision of another gate at this point, and
    the precise location can be discussed on 7 August.
I   (i)     As with point (a), we are not sure what is intended,
    and the matter can be discussed on 7 August.
I   (j)     Your comment regarding stewarding will no doubt, be
    taken care of by Mr. Chester.
I
           It will be much easier for your Working Party to
I   appreciate what is intended when they see the works under
    construction. There will also be an opportunity to see

I   the metal decking Of the South stand.

                               Yours sinc ereiy,



    c.c.    Mr. R.H. Chester

I               F.   Waterhouse (South Yorkshire County Fire Service)

     i.    Purpose of Meeting.


I    The purpose of the meeting was to carry out the "summer" inspection of the
     Stadium with particular reference to the Leppings Lane end improvements and
     the metal sheeting of the upper seated area of the South Stand.

I   2.     Ground Inspection.

    A.    Leppings Lane End
I   The progress of the works to segregate visiting supporters behind and on the
    West Terrace and Stand were inspected with particular reference to the

I   points raised at the Officer Working Party’s meeting held on 29th July,
    (forwarded to Messrs. Eastwood and Partners by the Chief Executive’s letter
    of 30th July) and Messrs. Eastwood & Partners reply of ist August.

I   Messrs. Eastwood & Partners had confirmed that all the calculations which
    were likely to be required had now been sent to the Building Authority for
    checking and comment.
I                       r
    On the inspection, the Building Authority pointed out what they considered
    to be the poor standard of workmanship in the construction of the new

I   dividing wall which was being built behind the Stand. The position of the
    Police Personnel access gate and the stepping of the face of the wall by
    45° chamfers so as not to form footholds were acceptable.

I   The foundations of the new handrail by Turnstile 23 had actually been
    aligned so as to maintain the exit width between the outer (river) wall
    and the Turnstile (unlike the indication on the plan submitted).
I   As regards the single block thickness of the internal walls of the cubicles
    in the new male and female toilet facilities at the rear of the stand,
I   Messrs. Eastwood and Partners considered that the inside of a toilet cubicle
    was not a very vulnerable area, and pointed out that the walls were braced
    by both the outer walls and the door frames. The Building Authority noted

I   the assurances given by Dr. Eastwood, but expressed concern that the
I
I    dividing walls in the new toilet facilities evidently did not have any
     foundations, apparently having beem built straight onto the existing

I    concrete slabs. It was noted that there were some 9 inch thick brick walls
     in the Male Toilets, it being considered that any hooliganism or vandalism
     would be more likely to occur there than in the Female Toilets.

I    The Club pointed out that the new toilet facilities would not be completely
     finished by the first match of the season (on 17th August) but that
     temporary facilities would be available and that no building material would

I    be left on site.

     The position of the new refreshment area under the most westerly staircase

I    up to the North-West corner terrace was noted. This again had been built
     straight onto the existing co=crete slabs.

    On the Terrace itself, it was noted that there was an existing gate in the
I   new 2 m. wide gap formed by the new radial fence for use by the Police.
    This gate would still be available for the use of spectators in an
    emergency as the gates at the top of the Terrace under the control of the

I   Police would enable spectators to be directed down the 2 m. wide gap.
    However, it was agreed that steps or a longer gate would be required. It
    was also agreed that a new gate would be required from the new South

I   Central Terrace Pen.

    As regards the upper seated stand area, Messrs. Eastwood and Partners had
    sent by letter dated 2nd August plans of the new fences and barriers in
I   both the Stand and at the Access level.

     IT WAS AGREED:-

I   (a)    that the condition of the internal walls in the new male and female
    toilet facilities at the rear of the Stand should be monitored;

I   (b)    that the existing gate in the pitch perimeter fence should either be
    extended or have steps to provide easier access from the new 2 m. wide gap
    formed by the new radial fence;
I   (c)    that a new gate in the pitch perimeter fence should be provided from
    the new South Central Terrace Pen;

I   (d)    that the advertising hoardings at the front of the upper seated stand
    area should be securely fixed to the concrete wall;

I   (e)
                            ,.

          that the spalling of the concrete of the wall at the front of the
    upper seated stand area should receive attention as a matter of maintenance;

I   (f)    that the corrosion of the steel columns at the rear of the Stand
    should receive attention on a maintenance basis.


I   B.     South Stand

    Messrs. Eastwood & Partners reported that the condition of the upper

I   concrete outer portion of the exterior wall of the Stand had been
    investigated and was considered to be satisfactory.

    It was noted that the metal sheeting of the wooden upper portion of the
I   Stand had been largely completed, and the spraying of the non-slip
    surface was to conwaence very shortly (and certainly be completed by the
    start of the season).

I
I   IT WAS AGREED that the metal sheeting of the wooden upper portion of the
    Stand should largely overcome the flammability problems inherent in such

I   timber structures, and the Club stated that they would ensure that the
    wooden intermediate steps were securely replaced upon completion of the
    laying of the metal sheeting.

I   C.     Spion Kop

    Messrs. Eastwood & Partners recalled that outline details of the Club’s
I   proposal to cover the Spion Kop had been sent for the information of the
    Officer Working Party by letter dated 22nd July. As part of that scheme,
    the bridge portion of the Kop would be removed. Its present condition

I   remained acceptable with continuing maintenance.

    In view of experiences last season, the Club were requested to provide an

I   additional gate in the pitch perimeter fence in the front corner nearest
    to the South Stand to overcome the lateral crushing hazard which could
    occur when large crowds were present.

I   IT WAS ~GREED that the Club would provide a new Bate in the pitch perimeter
    fence in the front corner nearest to the South Stand with a stepped
    arrangement to assist access and egress.

I   D.     North Stand



I   The temporary storage facilities created by the erection of a timber wall
    (in front of the Ladies’ Changing Facilities in the Sports Hall) were
    inspected.


I   IT WAS AGREED that so long as light combustibles (such as paint) were not
    stored in this area, its use continued to be acceptable on a temporary
    basis.

I   E.     Closed Circuit Television Facilities



I   The advantages for general crowd control and security (both in and outside
    the Stadium) which would be given by the recently installed Closed Circuit
    Television System were explained to the Officer Working Party.

I   rf WAS AGREED--

    (a)    that a 2~ kg. CO2 Fire Extinguisher should be installed in both the

I   Police Control Box and-the Disc Jockey Box;

    (b)     that loose external wires on the outside of the Boxes should be made

I   secure.

!      The purpose of the meeting was to consider the response to be given to the
       proposals outlined in the letter dated 25th October, 1985 and plans received
       from Messrs. Eastwood & Partners relating to facilities for the disabled, an
I      increased capacity for the Spion Kop.and consequent additional exit routes.
       Outline details of the roo’f to be erected over the Spion Kop had also been

1     The Officer Working Party exvressed reservations on both of the suggestions
      proposed by Messrs. Eastwood & Partners for the disabled. If the disabled
      continued to be accommodated in front of the North Stand, they would still
                                                                                       -i11-’J



l     be in the "firing line" of mis-aimed shots and any clear sheeting over the//     ,4
      top of the area they occupied could constitute an unacceptable hazard to ~I;./~---
      persons who might vacate the North Stand in an emergency situation by         /~wv~/J
      climbing over the front wa~ of the stand onto the pitch perimeter. It was
l     accepted that the means of escape did not provide for this to be done, but
      it had to be recognised that in practice this was a real possibility. The ~.~,
                                                                                     Io       ./

      structural strengthofsuch a structure would also be something of a problem./U/lV’~’-’; "
i     The other suggestion of accommodating the disabled in front of the perimeter
      fence along the front of the Spion Kop (nearest to the North Stand) was also
      unacceptable for the reasons stated by Messrs. Eastwood & Partners.

l     The suggestion of the Police representa{ives was that the front area of the
      lower Spion Kop (nearest to the North Stand) should have the terracing levelled
      to provide, say, a two-tier level landing on which to accommodate the disabled,

l     with a substantial fence at the rear. The existing pitch perimeter fence in
      front of this area could be removed, and the disabled would continue to gain
      access from the ramp between the Spion Kop and the North Stand as at present.

I     This would also enable free access by the disabled to the proposed disabled
      toilets under the rebuilt terracing of the Spion Kop.



I     The current legislation relating to the disabled was also discussed.

      IT WAS AGREED that the proposals for the disabled, as now
     .outlined by the Police representatives, should be supported and

I     ¯transmitted to Messrs. Eastwood & Partners as the Views of
      the Officer Working Party, subject to there being no obstruction of exit
      routes and flows.

I     3.     Enlarged Spion Kop

      The Fire Service and the Building Authority agreed that calculations showed
                                                                   ...........          ° " ¯ ....   I




i     "that the enlarged Spion Kop would provide for an increase of some 5,000
     ~ spectators on the present capacity of 16,850, and that the number of exit
       widths required to achieve evacuation was 46. The proposals to increase the

I      tunnel exit on the north side of the Kop to 8 clear units and to provide a
       complete new Six unit staircase on the south side were regarded as acceptable.
       As when the original calculations had been made, the units of exit width
       included the emergency gates in the pitch perimeter fence, but it was cons-
I      idered that landings in front of these gates should be constructed (as has
      been done at Bramall Lane).


I.    IT WAS AGREED that, subject to the following points, the proposals from the
      enlarged Spion Kop submitted by Messrs. Eastwood & Partners were generally
      acceptable:-

I          (a)   adequate headroom being provided between the new roof and the
                 upper rear and the new south side exit routes;
           (b)   to barriers being provided adjacent to the refurbished gents’
I                toilets and the new ladies’ toilets in the new six unit staircase
                 on the south side;
           (c) to landings being constructed in front of the existing emergency
               ~’gates in the pitch perimeter fence;
           (d) to confirmation of the number of new turnstiles to be provided on
                 the south side and on the Penlstone Road side;

I          (e) until acceptable alternatives are available, the new exit gates to
                be fitted with a turn-bar arrangement under the control of
                 stewards.


I    4.     Roofing of Spion Kop

     Whilst it was accepted that only an outline of the roofing proposals had been

I    supplied to date, the Building Authority pointed out that the plans showed
     that the gables were not lined.



I    IT WAS AGREED that this should be pointed out to Messrs. Eastwood & Partners,
     as well as the fact that should any of the proposed works on enlarging or
     roofing the Spion Kop take place other than in the close season, it will be
     a requirement that the areas concerned will have to be secured to prevent

I    unauthorised access.

           Crowd Flow at the Leppings Lane End of the Stadium

I
      .


     The Police reported on the continuing problems caused by the merging of
     spectators from all parts of the Stadium at the Leppings Lane end.

I
                               ,,

     It was difficult to see how this could be overcome, as the physical restraints
     to achieve this could conceivably be more of a danger than allowing the present
     position to continue.

I    6.    Duties of Stewards Booklet


I    IT WAS AGREED that the draft of a Booklet prepared by the South Yorkshire Police
     outlining the duties of safety stewards was acceptable and should be distributed
     to designated grounds for the information and guidance of stewards employed at
     such grounds. Factors peculiar to particular grounds could, of course, be
I    added if considered appropriate.

     7.    Spot Checks at Designated Grounds         -"
I    The Fire Service reported on the success of the recent spot check carried out


I                                              .2.
I
I   at the Oakwell Ground of the Barnsley Football Club in conjunction with the
    Police and the Building Authority, and reported that the Divisions of the

I   Brigade were being asked to carry out similar spot checks at designated
    grounds in their areas.

    IT WAS AGREED that such spot checks were essential to ensure that the required
I   standards were being maintained by the Clubs.

         For the attention of Mr. D. Vaughan

         Dear Mr. Vaughan,
                        Safety of Sports Grounds Act, 1975
                        Sheffield Wednesday Football Club pl¢
              Thank you for your letter of 14 November setting out the
         comments of the officer working party of~ the proposals for the
         new roof over the Kop. Our respon.se is as follows

        i.   Disabled Facilities
             First it should be emphasised that the disabled will have
        to be accommodated at ground level. No other arrangement is
        possible at reasonable expense.    The choice is between putting
        them in front of the North stand or in front of the Kop.
             Considering firs5 the Kop, you will know that the terracing
        drops down below the level of the perimeter track.   It would
        therefore be necessary to place the disabled slabbing and seating
        behind the line of the present perimeter fence. Each disabled
        chair including manoeuvring space and also i runway in front
    I   of the chairs occupies the same space as about 20 standing
        spectators. It would therefore be necessary to sacrifice the

I                                   An Unlimited Company, Registered In England- No. 1833144
                                                                         SHEET 2.

            EASTWOOD ~ PARTNERS




I            equivalent of about i000 standing spectator places to accommodate
             50 disabled people and their attendants.   This would be
            extremely costly. The Club has decided to increase the
I           capacity of the Kop by 5000 people and the additional cost
            compared with merely roofing over the present Kop is in
I           excess of £500,000.   Thus, if i000 standing places were
            sacrificed, the cost to the Club would be £i00,000 at least.

I           Ancillary expenses would include moving the boundary fence
            and reconstructing it to safety barrier standards plus the

I           cost of the concrete hardstanding.    We also have to keep in
           mind that not only would the spectators be in the firing
            line if anywhere near the goal but that in addition the new
I          Kop roof only extends to the front of the terracing so that
           the disabled would be virtually unprotected from rain.
I                The alternative proposal of leaving the disabled in front
           of the North stand has the advantage that the cantilevered

I          roof extends some way in front of the seating so that there
           is some protection from rain except when the wind is blowing

I          from the South.     The Club would like to give complete
           protection from rain and is prepared to consider the cost of
           the glazed roofing which we have suggested as a possible way
I          of-increasing the comfort of the disabled.    The glazing
          would of °course be o~ toughened glass.
I               If the working party has strong reservations about the
          glazing then obviously it will not be carried out.      However

I         I should stress that there is no possibility of the disabled
          being placed in front of the Kop because of the exorbitant

I         cost.     The Club will continue to use the present location and
          the only question to be decided is whether it should be under

I         cover or not.
               I should add that new toilet facilities for the disabled
          are an integral part of the scheme for the Kop and will be
I         conveniently placed under the North end of the Kop.

I        ¯    Enlarged Spion Kop
I             (a) All exit routes will have 2.4m clear head room
              (approximately 8ft.).

I             (b) We will need to discuss the proposed barrier
             adjacent to the new ladies toilet¯    The exit route
I            widens out very considerably from 4.1m wide at the
             location where the six unit width has been calculated
I            and is approximately 6m wide alongside the toilet block.
             We,~therefore believe that there is no bottleneck effect
I            and that a barrier might merely provide an unseen
             obstruction which could crea~difficulty.    We will

I            forward a larger scale drawing of the area so that
             our comments can be considered in more detail.

I             (c) We will of course provide the landings in front
             of the existing emergency gates in the pitch perimeter
I            fence but you will know that there have been changes of
             view on this particular matter in the past and we would
I            not wish the Club to be put to the expense of taking
             them out again when members of the present officer working

I            party are replaced with the passage of time.


I            (d) Ther~will be four new turnstiles on Penistone
             Road and six new turnstiles at the South end of the Kop.

I             (e) Gates with a turn-bar arrangement will be provided
             at the exits and the Club will of course provide stewards
I            to control them.


I   3.   Roofing of Spion Kop
         The gables will be sheeted on the outside face only and

I   will not be lined¯ This is normal in Kop buildings and we
    think it extremely unlikely that there will be any difficulty
    with hooligans climbing¯ The horizontal rails are at such
I   wide spacings that it would be difficult for even the most
    agile to climb up.

I         We are very mindful of the need to complete the areas
     open to spectators before the start of the new season. It
I    is conceivable that the contractors will have difficulty
     in completing the new terrace steps at the rear of the Kop
I    before the first game. In that event secure fencing will
     have to be provided as a temporary measure. However we

I    are reasonably confident that the whole of the terrace
     area of the Kop will be complete by the due date.    We

I    also intend to have all the new exit arrangements completed
     but it is possible that work will still be going on in toilet
     areas, particularly the new toilet for the disabled¯
I
     4.   Crowd Flow at the Leppings Lane End of the Stadilam
I         The Club is aware of the difficulties which the Police
     have to contend with at the Leppings Lane end and has of

I    course been very pleased to help the problem by the major
     works which were undertaken during the last close season.

I    We find it very difficulty to envisage anything more which
     could be done at reasonable expense.

I   5.    Fire Brigate Access to the Front of all Stands
     =~   As part of the works on the Kop, we are completely
I    remodelling the area around the existing tunnel.    The
    head room is being :increased to 2.4m and the width of the
I   tunnel is being increased also. A considerable amount of
    earth shifting will have to take place and this

I   presents an opportunity to widen the gangway so as to
    enable say a fire engine to pass between the North stand

I   and the retaining wall of the Kop.     If the Fire Service
    think this is of value, I should be pleased to know the
    width they would like so that we can see whether it can
I   be provided at reasonable cost and without sacrificing too
    many standing spaces.                 -"
I                           Yours sincerely,

I

            I.       Welcome and Introduction

!           Mr. Vaughan pointed out that the Local Government Act, 1985, would abolish
            the South Yorkshire County Council (and the other Metropolitan County Councils)


!
            on 31st March, 1986. From Ist April, 1986, the Certificating Authority under
            the Safety of Sports Grounds Act, 1975, would be the appropriate District
            Council. In the case of the Hillsborough Stadium this would naturally be
            the Sheffield City Council. For this reason, it had beensuggested to the

!           City Council that appropriate representatives in addition to the Building
            Surveyors’ Division might find it useful to be present at the meeting, and
            Mrs. L. Bashforth and Mr. J. Derricott were welcomed an~ introduced to the

!           remainder of the representatives present.

           Mr. Vaughan took the opportunity of expressing appreciation and thanks to
          : the representatives for the help and assistance which they had given to him
!          in his role as Co-ordinator of the Officer Working Parties since 1978. There
           had obviously been occasions when differences of opinion and interpretation
           had occurred but, in ~he main, these had been resolved both amicably and

!          constructively.

           For the Club, Dr. Eastwood thanked Mr. Vaughan for his services and wished

!          him well for the future. Other representatives endorsed Dr. Eastwood’s
           remarks.

            .... rp Pu ose of e
    ...... ~"::’;:2.          Me ring
!          The purpose of the meeting was two-fold; firstly to discuss the further
           details of development proposals at the stadium forwarded with the letter

!          dated 23rd December, 1985, from Messrs. Eastwood and Partners and, secondly,
           to carry out the "winter" inspection of the Stadium.


!          A.       Development Proposals for the Splon Kop ""

           The further details were inaddition to the comments set out in the letter


!
           dated 29th November, 1985, on the observations made following the Officer
           Working Party meeting held on 13th November.
I               (i)   Sheeting of Outer Face

               Dr. Eastwood reported that the sheeting of the enlarged Spion Kop at

I              the rear and sides would result in the structure being Virtually
               sealed. In reply to queries "from the County Fire Service, he confirmed
               that no storage would be allowed under the structure and that checks

I              for any accumulations of rubbish would be undertaken on a regular basis.

               (ii) Climbing of the~Inner Steel Frame

I              As regards the possiblity of unruly spectators climbing the inner steel
               frame of the new. structure, Dr. Eastwood reported that the bottom boom
               member was now to be omitted. The resultant height of ove~ I0 feet

I              would make it very difficult far spectators to climb the structure.

               (iii) New Step and Barrier Layout

I             Drawing No. 6648/56 was .circulated and considered. This related to the
              new step and barrier layout on the Spion Kop, and Dr. Eastwood repo~ted
              in particular on the discussions which h~ had had with the Planning
I             Authority as to the height of an intermediate or a low second rail to
              the barriers.where the drop to the gangway below could
              in places. He sou~ ~^ ~: .......... be over one metre

I              _ _       .          6~,~ ~= u~uer wormlng ~arty’s vlews~ and the merits
              oz the optlons were considered.

              IT WAS AGREED that, in the view of the Officer Working Party, the best

I             option for a second rail in the areas described was a low toe rail at
              a height of some 200 mm.

        B. .Eacilities for the Disabled
I       To illustrate that the figures originally quoted to provide facilities for the
        disabled at the foot of the SpionKop (nearest to the North Stand)were not

I       unrealistic, Dr. Eastwood reported on the breakdown of the tender figures
        (opened on Monday) for the enlarged, roofed Spion Kop. He still considered
        that any such proposals would involve the loss of up to%l,O00 of the extra

I      5,000 spectator places which would be provided by the enlarged Spion Kop.
       Other areas of the Stadium hadalso been considered and investigated, but
       none could provide as large a flat, easily accessible area as that in front of


I
      ~the North Stand, which had been successfully used for so long without any major
       problems. Up to 80 disabled persons, plus attendants, used the area. The only
       major drawback he saw was that when there was a strong southerly wind, rain
       could be blown onto the disabled, despite the cantilever roof of the North

I      Stand extending virtu~lly to the pitch. For this reason, the Club were willing
       to roof an area from approximately the letter "0" =n the results board to the
       end.of the Stand (nearest to the Spion Kop) with a substantial roof, including

I     armoured glass where there might be a visibility problem, provided that this
      was supported by the Officer Working Party.
                                                             ~
    --’Whxlst acce tih ~dh~" ~-:~ ~" .................. ~"            """
I                   P g      of what      Dr. Eastwood’said~   the Offi’cer     - ~- Party
                                                                            Working
       (and the Police representatives in particular) still expressed some concern as
       to whether making semi-permanent facilities for the disabled in front of the
       North Stand was the appropriate and Correct thing to do.

I     The Building Authority confirmed =hat, after further investigations, it was
      considered that the disabled facilities requirements of the Building

I     Regulations 1985 didnot appear to strictly apply to the roofing of the
      enlarged Spion Kop.


I
I
     IT WAS AGREED that, in the first instance, Dr. Eastwood would prepare sketch
     plans of the suggested roofed disabled facilities in front of the North Stand
     for consideration by the Officer Working Party.

            Ground Inspection
            (i)    West Terrace and Stand

     The Police representatives confirmed that the revised segregation arrangements
     to the rear of the Stand wo{ked well on by far the majority of occaslons.
                                                                                .-
       Eastwood pointed out that the segregation rail in the upper seated area "
     Dr.
     of the stand could be moved within certain limits if the Police considered
     that this would achieve a Useful purpose.                        --

     IT WAS AGREED:-

     (a)    that the additional advertisement hoardings at the front of the upper
     seated stand area (nearest to the North-West Terrace) should also be securely
     fixed to concrete wall;

     (b)    that further areas of spalled concrete at the front of the upper
     seated stand area should received’attention as matters of maintenance.

            (ii) North-West Terrace

     IT WAS AGREED that the advertisement hoardings erected on the upper North-
     West Terrace should be securely fixed.

            (iii) North Stand
I    The area for the suggested covered disabled facilities was inspected.


I    As previously mentioned by Dr. Eastwood, the possibility of providing an
     increased width access to the pitch area (between the North Stand and the
     Spion Kop) for possible use by emergency vehicles, as well as f¢~ maintenance

I    by the Club was discussed. The facility could be incorporated into the
     enlarged Spion Kop proposals relatively easily.

    It WAS AGREED that, whilst the County Fire Service felt that such a facility
I   was not essential for their purposes, it could be useful for use by emergency
    vehicles in certain situations and generally should be supported.


I          (iv) Spion Kop°

    Dr. Eastwood indicated the extent of the work to construct the enlarged,

I   roofed, Spion Kop, and confirmed that steps would be taken to prevent
    unauthorised access to areas where work might be in progress during the
    course of the season.

I   It was noted that the additional gate in the pitch perimeter fence in the
    front corner nearest to the South Stand, with a stepped arrangemenn to
    assist access and egress, had been provided.

I          (v)   South Stand

    It was noted that the metal sheeting of the wooden floor of the upper
    portion of the Stand (with sprayed non-slip surface) had proved to be of an
    acceptable appearance in use, and generally appeared to provide a compromise
    solution to the flammability problems inherent in such wooden structures.

    IT WAS AGREED that its condition would continue to be monitored.

start of the seas:n to a standard acceptable to the
p~iice, fire ant ambulance services and Local
Authority,

Refresher traininc should be given by a competent

a~ove,

The above list of Quties is by no means exhaustive and

                   Introduction
        1.1       "This document has been compiled for the purpose of providing
                   general advice to officers given the responsibility of arranging
                   operational police planning for sporting occasions. The level
                   and degree of advance planning must necessarily depend to a large
                   extent on the particular fixture and the mount of trouble that
                   may reasonably be expected as a result of Intelligence gathered
                   by the pol tce.
                                                                             -°
                  Intelligence       ""
        1.2        Intelligence concerning the likelihood of crowd disturbance or


I   ¯              hooliganism occurring 411 necessarily be obtained from a variety
                   of sources and should be interpreted through experience and
                   common sense. It t s recogntsed that the degree of advance
                   planntng for a particular game depends upon both the interest tn
                   the fixture and the amount of trouble anticipated, based upon
                   Intelligence available to the poltce. Aside from the importance
i                  of the fixture tn term of league position or ’cup’ prospects,
                   football matches are often used by hooligans to celebrate
                   previous encounters wtth particular sets of fans. It ts
                   therefore particularly important to be aware of the history of
                   that ftxtu re.

i           1.3    The pr.ime source of football intelligence is the Poltce National
                   Intelligence System which ts based 2.~ the network of Poltce
                   Ltaison Officers (see paragraphs          to 2.11 et. seq.).

i                  Summaries completed by police officers of the home club Force are
                   forwarded to the visiting club’s liaison officer, making
                   available intelligence about fans hehaviour at both home and away
                   fixtures. This Information will be collated and made available
i       _
        "1.4
                   for.future matches involving that club.
                    The summary includes details of those arrested, charged or
i                   ejected and complaints of misbehaviour both Inside and outside
                    the ground,’including public houses, railway/coach stations and
                    other places where football supporters gather. This allows for
                    regular offenders to be identified and targeted, resulting in a
                    systematic build-up of intelligence. To ensure the maximum
                    benefit of such intelligence it is essential that the match
                    summary is coq~leted accurately and comprehensively, and
                    forwarded promptly to the Police Force concerned.
            1.5     Misbehaviour by football supporters whilst travelling on trains,
                    London Underground, or ferries, or whil~;t on British Rail
                    property fs collated by British Transport Police as part of a
                   "national intelligence system operated by that Force. This
                    information Is available to Force ltaison officers through their

                    2.20 et. seq.).
            1.6     Sources of intelligence may be smmarised as. follows:-

           (a)    Match summaries o~tled by the ’home’ club v111 provide

           (g)    The development of Intelligence ~ill take into account
                  the history of the fixture, the anticipated stze of the
                  crowd, importance of result to either club, strength of
                  ’away’ following, absence of other games in the area,
                  whether or not a ’.derby’ fixture, press coverage.
           Pre-I~tch Planntng
    1.7    Depending on the fixture football matches will tnvolve the use of
           various branches of the Force (the mounted, traffic, special             |
           constabulary, etc.).       It Is important that the officer
           responsible for policing the match determines the pre-match
           planntng in the ltght of the intelligence at hand. In many cases
                                                                                    !
           an officer vrill be delegated the planning task and tt ts
           recommended that as a routine the planning officer, Intelligence
           officer and the officer tn charge of policing the match confer to
           analyse ’Intelligence’ and detemine tactics.
           Use of ’kay’ Off|cers (Spotters)
    1.8    The use of ’spotters’ fE~om the Force area frol which fans are
-          travelling to ’away’ ga, les may be of benefit, but there are
           difficulties, particularly if the officers travel with the
           supporters. A distinction has to be drawn between, on the one
           hand, routih’e ’spotters’ who seek to provide regular Intelligence
           to the ’home’ Force and, on the other, covert Intelligence
           gathering
    1.9    In the former case tt is recomended that arrangements be made
           beforehand with the ’home’ police; that the officers do not
           travel with the visiting supporters as police officers; that the);
           report to and liaise with the ’home’ police to assist with
           intelligence.. Whenever possible their role should be solely to
           provide Intelligence and not to be dtrectly tnvolved tn the
           policing. -
    1.10   In the latter case (covert o;~rat.lons) it Is important that a
           means of contact be established prior to the game and that the
           officers handltng the comunications, and the officer tn charge
           of the game, know exactly what arrangements have been made.
           Briefing

           common practices of disturbance should be carefully outlined.

             .Jamy Supporters
     1.17    Intelligence officers should provide clear instructions to coach
             operators as to routes and parking facilities. Car and coach
             parks should be clearly signed and a poltce presence maintained
             to ensure security and prevent interference. The presence of
             poltce at such locations may also enable the early gathering of
             tntellt~nceon the numbers and behavtour.of visiting supporters.
     1.18    It may be prudent for police to escort supporters from coach
             parks to the sports stadium in order to ensure that they do not
             become the subject of, nor engage tn, hooliganism. Similarly,
             ratlway stations should be ,mnttored by poltce and supporters
             escorted to the stadium where the match is to be played. Close
             liaison with British Transport Police is recommended. Most fans
             are familiar with escort arrangements and where possible police
             should stick to routines which become familiar.
     1.19    After a match coaches leaving the area may require a police
             escort until they are away from trouble.
             Flashpoinl:s       °
     1.20    Special attention should be given to any public house or other
             unofficial assembly point, and to the routes taken in general by
             supporters where confrontation between rival fans may occur.
             Also attention should be given to waste ground and derelict
             property along any such routes where mssiles or offensive

|,           weapons may be gathered by hooligans. Bridges have often been
             used by hooligans and s~uld be monitored.
              Stadium Searches

|    1.21     Before spectators are admitted into the stadium a physical search
              should be made of the ground and terraces by the officer in

|             charge of policing the game to ensure that all fences and gates
              are sufficiently secure and that no objects which may be used as
              offensive weapons or missiles are to hand. There should be an
              arrangement with the club for an official   to be available when
              the inspection is carried out to    put right anything which is
              amiss.

             ¯ Entry Into the Ground,
      1.22    Approaches to the ground are themselves flashpoints and need to
              be well monitored. Careful planning to co-ordinate as far as
              possible the routes taken by different groups of supporters to
              relevant turnstiles may reduce the opportunity of conflict.
1 .Z3        Clear mrk|ng of turnstiles |s essent|aland ell officers on
        ..... ?i~t~all duties should be briefed Is to the segregation
             arrangements.

1.24       The searching of spectators depends on circumstances. The terms
           of the Police and Criminal Evidence Act afford a right of search
           only where there are grounds to suspect an offence ts being
           committed, and the suspicion must relate dtrectl  Y    the
                                                                  to person
           searched. The Codes of Practice, however, exempt the need to
           make customary records if in the circumstances it Is not
           practicable to do so. Ground regulations reserve the right of
           the club to decltne admission to any person who "refuses to be
           searched by a police officer, and this my allow for routine
           searching on entry to grounds, but poltce officers need to know
           the ltmrits of this provision. Refusal to be.. s~.arched may ent~tl
           a refucal to allow entry.
1.2.~      Within the limitations officers should seek to prevent supporters
           entering the ground with weapons, missiles, flag poles etc.
I .26      Drunkenness is recognised as a major cause of hooliganism and
           supporters may attempt to enter sports grounds whtlst in a
           drunken condition or carrying alcohol. Where the conditions of
           the Sporting Events’ (Control of Alcohol Etc.) Act, 1985, apply
           the provisions should be enforced. The main conditions are as
           follows :-

                              A crucial factor in the enforcement of orders is the availability
                               of photographs of those subject to them. Section 35 of the Act,
m                              makes provision for the cou~t, onapplication of the prosecution,
                               to order a photograph to be taken. However, where possible,
                               persons arrested for any offence which might result in the
m                              imposition of an order should be photographed at the time of
                  charging. Photographs taken at this tim are likely to be of
               - ~m~-~rat~,~ for subsequent identification purposes than those
                  taken at or following a court appearance.

        Entrance to the Ground
        1.40      Stadium entrances must be stgned to tndJcate clearly the stands
                  and terraces to be used by home and vtsiting suppo.rters.
        1.41      Officers with local knowledge should be posted to turnstiles to
                  prevent supporters entering a section of the stadium allocated to
                  supporters of the:opposJng team. When p~ssJble, the"s~


F
                  officers should be regularly used at locations considered to-be
                  of particular JRportance, e.g. main entrance, points of potenti81
                  trouble etc.


F       I .42     It Is ~haslsed that effectlve turnstile policing is the key to
                  prevention of disorder Inslde the ground. Offlce~ should be
                  encouraged to U1k to those waltlng to enter In order to identify

f       1.43
                  non-1~al accents, drunks, etc.
                  Queues forming at turnstlles should be closely monitored by
                  police and stewards. It ts recommended that mounted officers,
                  where available, are used for this purpose. There is often
                  frustration at turnstiles If queues remain afterthe game has
                  started. OrderTy control will ~nimise the risks.

f       1.44      All ticket matches also need turnstile control as supporters in
                  possession of tickets for a particular section of the ground may

f                 seek to gain entry to another section of the ground, which could
                  result tn some sections of the ground exceeding the limit
                  specified tn the safety certificate. Where limits are critical
                  police should make arrangements to monitor turnstile counts.
~   -   1.45      High interest ’al1 ticket’ fixtures have the effect of generating
                  a black market in tickets and ’touting’. This will likely
f                 undermine .segregation. It is therefore recommended that some
                  section of the ground be set apart to accommodate identified fans
                  who support one side and have tickets for opposing supporters’
                  area. If circumstances warrant ’ticket it    touts’ should be
                  arrested, and efforts made to discover where the tickets came
                  from. For all ticket games every effort must be made to tighten
                  up the sales procedure to assist segregation policy, preferably
                  by restricting sale of tickets to those attending home fixtures
                  and selling tickets within the ’home) enclosures.
                  Team Nanagers, Referees and Etnesmen
        1.46      All officials concerned tn controlling the game should be aware
                  of the police action that will betaken tf there ts any invasion
                  of the playtng pitch, or serious disorder occurring within the
                  crowd. All officials concerned tn controlling the game should be
                  aware of any planned emergency procedure that may be taken tn t~,e
                  event of an emergency or bomb threat.
1.47     The conduct of players on the fteld can have a marked impact on
       --cro~-behavtour. Particularly where the fixture ts Judged
         volattle the club should be encouraged to arrange for players to
         leave the tunnel together and to shake hands at the end of the
         game. They may also be reminded of the importance of good
         behavtour on the pitch. It rests with the match commander to
         take up with the club any utsbehavtour by players.
        Entertainment
1.48    The club should be encouraged to provide some form of
        entertainment to take place during the half hour preceding ktck
        off, for example bands, displays and recorded music. A good
         ’announcer’ using the public address system can establish a
        rapport with the crowd and influence behaviour. Thought should
        be gtcen to liaisin9 with ":announcers: ~o make sutteble ~
        interventions if appropriate. This means way be used to advise
         ’.away’ supporters as to arrangements for their leaving the
        ground, changed travel instructions etc.

        Crowd Distributions
1.49    It is omphasised that stewards should ensure that all sections of
        terraces and stands are filled to capacity before allowing access
        to further sections where possible. Dis will require monitoring
        turnstile totallsers and the use of public address systems in
        some instances. This operation is greatly assisted by the
        compartmentalisation of grounds, each compartment being filled in
        sequence.
        Segregation
1.50    Home and visiting supporters shou)d be segregated inside the
        stadium by means of segregation fencing and/or sterile zones, and
        steps should be taken to impose segregation before they enter and
        after they leave the stadium. Each section of the stadium
        designated for the use of particular supporters should have its
        own toilet and refreshment facilities. Barriers and doors should
        be provided so as to segregate home and visiting supporters and
        thus avoid confrontation at entrances/exits. Experience has
        shown that policing segregated areas is best achieved by placing
        officers ’inside’ the segregation if this ts possible.
         Stewards
1.51     Good liaison between stewards and police should be established.
         (See Duties of Stewards - paragraph 14.1 et. seq.) The officer
         in charge of the match should make periodic inspections of
         stewarding standards and report results to the club’s management.
         The police control must be able to contact the Chief Steward and
         Head Fire St~vard at all times.
         Disposition of Flanpower
1.52     Where no pitch perimeter fence extsts a presence may be required
         by police and stewards in order to tsolate the playing area. In
        such circumstances police officers should take up standing
         positions away from and facing the crowd when incidents occur to
                         arouse the crowd. Where fencing has been erected police officers
                         and stewards must have keys for the gates and a universal locktng
                         system should be used¯ Pitch perimeter gates should remain
                         unlocked and manned at all times the public have access to the
                         ground.
            1 ¯53        All bars, refreshment and toilet areas should be poltced in order
f           1 ¯54
                         to prevent hooliganism occurring.
                         At the onclusion of the ~tch consideration should also be given
                         to deploying police tn appropriate areas to mtntndse a sudden
                         stampede or pushing wtthtn the crowd in their endeavour to leave
                         the stadium quickly.

                       --~rsons Arrested or Ejected From the Ground
                         Ejection is an option which can be used where behaviour is poor,
                         but falls short of an actual offence (e.g. contravention of
                         ground regulations). However, ejection should not be used as an
                         alternative to arrest; where there ts sufficient evidence the
                         offender should be arrested and charged¯
            1 ¯57        It is recommended, where possible, that in vtolent situations
                         police officers" in groups should enter the affected section of

f                        the stadium from above the incident, making arrests where
                         necessary, and then making their way onto the perimeter of the
                         pitch. Officers should not enter from the perimeter if this can
                         be avoided. Arrest operations should be planned and controlled
                         to avoid officers being isolated or over~helmed.
            1.58         A standard procedure should be adopted~th regard to arrests and
I       -                ejections. Prisoners .should be taken to a forward reception
                         point mere details are recorded (including ~ections), and
                         prisoners photographed together~th arresting officer.
            1.59         Persons ejected from the ground or supporters who are not
                         admitted for whatever reason should- be carefully policed¯
                         Experience indicates that such persons often gain further entry
                         to the ground either at half. time or immediately before the end
                         of the match, and provoke confrontation.
            1.60          In the event of a football match generating a large number of .
                          arrests it is worth considering bailing prisoners to special
                          courts In order that Magistrates may be fully aware of all the
                          circumstances appertaining to the events of that game. Early
                          liaison with the Crown Prosecution Service is advisable to inform
                          them of the intention to hold special courts, in order that they
J   .                     can be fully acquainted with the background facts.                -
                 Conttngency Planntn9
      1.61       Pre-detemtned plans should be available 1;o control such
                 contingencies as sertobs disorder, pitch incursion and locked out
                 spectators. Because of the great divergence tn ground and crowd
                 factors these plans lust be ground specific. However, these
                 plans mus t take tnto const deratt on the ’. Popplewel I ’
                 recommendations with regard to the transmission of coded messages
                 over the publtc address system, the availability of emergency
                 telephones and a factltty for the poltce to intercept the public
                 address system.
                 FJergency Evacuation
      1.62       Stewards must be famlllar with the action to be taken in the
                 event of in evacuatlorl of the whole or part of the stadium,
                 Police should assist in the rapid evacuation of a stadium in such
                 circumstances, Stadia should have a universal 1ocklng system and
                 a11 stewards should be in possession of keys for the exit gates,
                 They should wear a distinctive tabard or other means of easy
                 identification,!t must be uade clear to both the club
                 management and to the Indlvidual stewards that they must not
                 leave their post without being relleved. It is essentlal that
                 exit gates can be opened without delay inthe event of an
                 emergency, Sluulated emergency evacuation exercises for the
                 staff eBployed by the club must be held at least twice each
                 season to test the emergency evacuation procedure. The crowd
                 ~11 not be Involved but depending upon circumstances it could be
                 an advantage to .explaln to the crowd that an emergency evacuation
                 exercise is taking place, Experience has revealed that in an
                 actual evacuation it is essential to monitor exit doors when the
                 crowd has left the stadium to prevent them wandering back into
                 the stadium before the reason for the evacuation has been
                 cumpleted.
                 Retentt on of V| st1;1 ng Suppor~rs
    - 1.63       In some circumstances the officer tn charge may decide to hold
                 the visiting supporters in the Found until he considers it
                 appropriate to release them, If such a tactic is mployed then
t                the situation will be greatly eased if the visiting fans are kept
                 informed.
             ¯
                 Early R~Deploym~nt of Police Officers
      1.64       Police officers should be deployed outside the ground, in key
                 positions, early enough to be seen in these positions by the
                 crowd as tt leaves the ground. This gives an appearance of good
                 order and police control. At critical points the use of police
                 officers in groups under the command of a sergeant should be
                 considered. The effective after-ml~h deployment of police
                 officers is dependent on the pre-m~ briefing and allocation of
                 tasks.
                 Veh|cular and Pedestrian Trafftc
      i.65       At the end of the game early dispersal of supporters is clearly
                  beneficial. Most Police Forces will develop a traffic control
            plan to facilitate this. Particular attention should be given to
           ~-outes used          ’ supporters. Supporters who are not local
                             .away,
            most alvays     able to ftnd coaches where they got off them and
            generally tt ts good practice to convoy and escort coaches away
            from the general area. Many grounds are in heavily built-up
            areas of old industrial towns and it is extremely difficult to

             Emergency Procedures - Stewards Role
      3.7    Fomal emergency procedures at each ground          require Joint
             consultation between poltce, the management of the ground, fire,
             mbulance and other services.

      3.8    It ts essential ’ at :f~r,     et
                                    that stewards andabe fully
                                                      their supervisors
             aware of the part they have to play tn the plans which are
             produced. The management of the ground should ensure that
             mitten instructions concerning the action to be taken tn the
             event of an emergency are mde readtly available to all staff and
             stewards and, in particular, that all the staff and stewards
             should receive practical instruction and training appropriate to
             their responsibilities In the event of an emergency. Exercises
             for the staff and stewards should be carrie out regularly to
             ensure the mooth operation of the procedure for dealing with an
             emergency.
      3.9    A record should be kept by the club authorities containing
             devils of the training and Instructlon given and the exercises
             held, and should inclu~ the following matters:-

             (a)    date and time of the instruction or exercise;
             (b)    duration;
             (c)    nme of the person giving the instructions;
             (d)    names of the pe~ns receiving the instructions;

             (e)    nature of instruction or exercise.
             Consideration should be given to the inclusion of these
             conditions in any safety, or special safety certificate.
      3.10   After initial practical instruction all members OfaStaff and
             stewards should receive verbal instruction, given by competent
             person, at least once In every period of three months at regular
             intervals. Stewards should be given briefing cards relevant to
             particular points.
           FOLICIHG FACILITIES AT FOOTEN.L GROUICDS
    4.1    T~ are mrked differences fn the facilities provtded by dubs
           and (t I~st reRtn a mttar for lo¢al ne~jottatton between pollce
           and dubs as to the standard of facilities, beartng tn mtnd
           average attendance and a need for pollce presence. It ts
           recommended that General Safety Certificates are revtewed on in
           annual basts tn an effort to achteve continuing tmprovoment.
           Prisoner Reception Point irithtn the Ground
    "4.2   It ts considered essential that a prtsoner reception potnt should
           be available at the Found. The office should be sttad, tf
           possible, so that there ts adequate access for the unobtrusive
           removal of prisoners. There should be etl~er a G.P.O. telephone
           11ne or a direct line to the neares~ pollce station. Ideally the

k          ~ollce
            home,accommodation   should have two detention rooms to separate
                  and ’away’ supporters.
           Parading and Briefing
    4.3    It ts desirable that pollce officers to be deployed tn the ground
           are briefed on stte. This can usually be done under cover tn
           most grounds. A standardised form of stadium grid reference used
           by police and club personnel will facilitate brtefing and
           evacuation.

           Control Room                           j


$   4.4    It ts desirable,o and tn some cases essential, that a control room
           ts provtded to oversee police operations in the ground.
           Provision should be made for a base station to control the U.H.F.
           police radio. It should have a direct access to the ground
           public address system and either a G.P.O. or direct telephone
           line to the local pollce station, and the police office within
           the ground. The room should be of adequate st ze to acco~odate
           C.C.T.V. m~nitors and ancillary equipment. It ts desirable to be
           able to operate, tn addition, high intensity lighting systems
           from the police controljvhich may be switched on when there ts
           trouble or emergency.                                   -
    4.5    The control room should be sited to give an over ~ of the
           ground and to a11~ the match pollce commander ready access from
           the ’ 1~ouch I i ne’.
    4.6    The costs of the provision of the police office and control room
           and facilities should be borne by the club. The police generally
           provlde radio communication and addltional It~s such as loud
           hal le. and bi noculars.
    4.7    Safety~. at Sports Grounds5 Act, 1975, by providing for
           consultation between the local authority"and poltce (Section
           3(ilt)) on conditions to be tncluded on safety certificates has
           had a clear effect on improving ground facilities. Full use
           should be made of these provisions to ensure adequate pollce
           fad ltttes.
           C.C.T.V. ~ STXLL I~T~
    4.8    The guidance offered tn thts section ts intended to assist
           Commanders havtng operational responsibility for poltctng
           football. Xt ts not a definitive work and should be read tn
           conjunction with the report of the A.C.P.O. Working Party,
           entitled, ’Use of Video and Stt11 Photography.
            Xntr~<luc~lon
    4.9    The use of C.C.T.V. and stt11 photography as an atd to the
           effective poltctng of football ts a recent developmnt. At the
           present time, all First and Second Division foo~a11 grounds are
           provided vith static video cameras and recording facilities,
           which enable the poltce to monitor crowd behavtour within and in
           the .immediate vicinity of stadia. ..lt.ts-anticipated that-.~..-,~
           vtdeotng facilities rill be extended to all Third and Fourth
           Dtvston grounds tn the near future but not necessarily of the
           same type as tn the two higher Divisions.
           The qualtty of the equipment and re-production of tinge presently
           available tn foot~a11 grounds ts now always compatible with its
           adequate presentation before the courts, and tts use has resulted
           tn some confusion beWeen its function tn relation to ’command
           and control’ and to evidence gathering. Experience to date
           indicates the greatest value ltes tn developing a system for the
           use of C.C.T.Y. and sttll photography within stadia for the
           purposes of Intelligence and evidence gathering.
           All systems at present tn use at football grounds are capable of
           being enhanced and developed. When these changes are made tt
           should be ensured that the replacement equipment ts of sufficient
           standard that the quality of recording ts such as to be
           acceptable for use as evidence tn court.
t          Accepting the need for identification and evidence gathering for
           prosecution to be the primary function of the system, the
           following points are worthy of consideration  llm   the use of
           development of existing ~nd anticipated facilities.


I   4.1o
            Technical Considerations
           (a)    -.At the time of installation, consideration should be given
                    to the siting of cameras and cables so as to prevent

i           (b)
                    interference or damage.
                   As good video recording requires good light and as most

I                  football fixtures are played during winter months, the
                   need for adequate lighting ~thin and around football
                   stadia Is essential to eliminate areas of darkness ~Ich

#                  may be used as cover for disorderly behavlour. Fans are
                   Increasingly aware that such behaviour Is menlto~ by
                   C.C.T.V. and they will attempt to evade de~tlon by
                   seeking whatever cover is avallabl      It is therefore
                   important that cameras are st ted fn such a way as to
                   mrintmise bltnd spots and that facilities are provided to
                   increase ltghttng intensities tn stands, etc. The siting
                   of video cameras should take account of sloping roofs, to
                        enable recording at the rear of stands. Thts problem can
                        be overcome by the use of hand-hel d cameras.
                        Consideration must be given to all foreseeable problems
                        that may affect the performance of vtdeo equipment. A
                        good example that ts easily overlooked ts the path of the
                        setttng sun. A vtdeo camera would be tneffecttve tf the
                        sun was shining directly tnto the lens.

                 (c)    Pollce Control Rooms contain valuable equipment and are
                        often vulnerable. Consideration should be given to taking
                        protective measures to Increase security.
                 (d)    Control Rooms should beroundPlaCedvlew Infao theP°Siti°n which

                        provlslon of glass partltlons should be given I:o prevent
                        reflection or distortion. The Control Room should have
                        adequate background heating to protect the electrical
                        equipment and for the comfort of personnel employed ~thin
                        the room. Heating should remain switched on 24 hours a
                        day during cold weather.

                        camera. Even If this damage is not permanent, the video
                        camera would be unable to function for some time. As a
                        general Fule flash equipment should not be used in the

                (g)     Police Control Rooms must be provided with multi-recording
                        facilities in order that the opportunity exists to capture
                        all incidents which may occur in different areas Within
                        the stadium.

                        Operational Considerations
    4.11        (a)     It Is important that police officers are made aware that
                        their actions in dealing with disorderly behaviour Within
                        the stadium will also be recorded on C.C.T.V.
                (b)     Consideration should be given to the preparation of a
                        ground specific video, to be used in briefing officers who
                        may not be familiar With the stadium.
                (c)     It is Impo~nt whenever possible to use- the same
                        personnel tn police ground control room operations. They
                        will rare readily identify regular troublemakers and
                        :target’ them within the .ground. Over a period of time
                        they will develop similar abilities in relation to
                        visiting supporters.
                (d)     Imediately following a fixture where arrests for
                        misconduct have occurred, arresting officers should be
                        allowed an opportunity to view any recording of the
             incidents concerned to establish (1) the evidence for
             ¯hetr arrest and (2) whether the offender has omttted
             any further acts not wttoessed by the arresting officer.

             Zntelltgence Gathering
4.12   (a)   Away fans arriving at grounds may be vtdeoed as they come
             through turnstiles, get off buses or leave ratlway
             stations. Thts helps with Identification and the tracing
             of those responsible for causing trouble, It also makes
             the fans aware that they are on record.
             When grounds are full, the crowd may be filmed all round,
             so that tf trouble starts, Identification ~11 be
             assisted. It ~111 also make the crowd aware that they are
             on record." ;To assist this procedure; tt Js always useful "
             to have identification marks around the ground so that the
             fans’ location within the stadium can be pin-pointed with
             accuracy.
       (b)   Some clubs have follovrings from areas of the country many
             miles from their home base. Therefore, when it is
             necessary to identify persons from the crowd, photographs
             and video recordings should be circulated to Forces who
             have supporters’, clubs of that particular football club tn
             their area.

       (c)   Each Force should compile sets of photographs and/or
             videos of its own clubs’ hooligans and either (i) forward
             on such l:o~ilation to each J:orce that is likely to host
             the club during the forthcoming season, or (ti) one such
             c~ilation be taken to each awa, game by officers
             travelling with the club’s supporters.
             Each host Force should supply the visiting team’s home
             Force ~th photograph~ and video recordings of the
             visiting teams supporl~rs, if their conduct is such as to
             warrant this. ~is ~ll keep Forces aware of how their
             own club’s supporters behave away from home.

       (d)   Some clubs have a section of supporters who are notorious
             for hooligan behaviour. It would assist in future
             investigations into serious disorder at other grcunds if
             the host Forces of these clubs prepared video recordings
             and photographs of their hooligan element and established
             the identity of those involved. Then by comparing this
             recording and the photographs with those of the incident
             under investigation, identification should be greatly
             assisted.
       (e)   Known hooligans should be targetted and followed in video.
             This requires local officers operating the video who can
             be assisted by officers from the visiting team’s home
             Force.
       (f)   Identified fans displaying consistently aggressive
             behavtour, not amounting to a chargeable offence on a
             single occasion, but who ~n be identified, on other video
                      recordings displaying stmrllar conduct, should be traced
           ........ 4nd Charged on thts evidence of system.
            (g)    The video recording of a footbe11 fixture ts a valuable
                   source of intelligence which ts often overlooked tn the
                   absence of identified disorder.             It ts strongly
                   recommended that all video .recordings be viewed for
                   Intelligence purposes, and that tapes be retained unttl
                   the corresponding fixture tn the follo~ing season has been
                   pl ayed.


    4.13    In the event of large-scale and serious disorder at a sporting
                                                                                         !
            fixture, there will be a need to develop a strategy to identify
            and arrest offenders; ~ using the evidence obtained - by " video " ".. ? i
            recording and still photography. Practical guidance in this
            process is as follows:-
            (a)    Photographs or sttlls from vtdeo recordings should be
                   displayed for public vtew and identification wherever
                   possible, e.g. T.V., newspapers, match program.s,
                   posters, etc.
            (b)   A viewing studio should be created not only for the use of
                  poltce officers, but for the public as well as such


t
                  organtsattons as supporters’ clubs, stewards, residents’
                  associations, social workers, probation officers, etc.
            (c)   Immediately after the incident, all press photographs and
                  other media evidence should be obtained and statements
                  taken from those responsible for taking the photographs,
                  video recordings, etc. Attempts should also be made to

|                 obtain all a~ur videos and photographs, and the
                  appropriate statements taken. All this material, together
                  ruth police photographs and video recordings, should then


l
                  form part of the vie~ng studio exhibits.
            (d)   Officers from ~e host Force should visit the visiting
                  team’s area and other areas containing supporters’ clubs

l                 of the visiting team, where they should exhibit
                  pho~graphs and video ~ordings for identifiation
                  purposes as at (b) above.°
            (e)   The size of the police team working on identification is
                  critical. There should be sufficient to do the work, but
                  it should be kept small enough to be cohesive.
            if) The task of viewing video recordings and photographs many
                  ttmes ts tedious, therefore tt ts recommended that staff
                   should be selected who are Interested tn the sport
                   Involved.

j           (g)   Once Identified and traced, ,offenders should be invite( to
                  view the video recordings and tf they are able, to
                  identify theuselves whilst In non controversial
                  circumstances before being questioned about alleged
j                 offences on video recordings and photographs.

                            by Superintendent Marshall, Chief Inspector Beal and Inspector
!                           Sewell, Deputy Chief Ambulance Officer Hopkins and Assistant
                            Chief Ambulance Officer (Operations) Jones, South Yorkshire
                            Ambulance Service and Assistant Divisional Officer Rowlands
                            of the South Yorkshire Fire Service

                            A senior ambulance officer already attends all home matches

i                           at the Sheffield Wednesday Ground and is allocated a compli-
                            mentary ticket for the South Stand. He is in direct radio
                            contact with ambulance control and in the event of a major
                            disaster at the ground, he would be the first line contact
i                           with ambulance control. Contingency plans are already in hand
                            for the South Yorkshire Ambulance Service to rendezvous with
                            their vehicles at Herries Road bus garage and the senior

i                           ambulance officer already, at the Wednesday Ground would control
                            the ambulance vehicles in and out of the Wednesday Ground.

                            Arrangements have been made for the senior ambulance officer
i                           who attends the Wednesday Ground to meetthe ’FI’ Liaison
                            Inspector outside the players’ entrance at 2.15 pm, before
                            each home match to re-establish contact and also contact will
i                           be maintained with Mr Lock, the security officer at the
                            Wednesday Ground. In the event of an evening kick off,
                            further arrangements will be made to establish contact time

i                           with the ambulance service.

                            In the event of a ma3or disaster occurring, the senior

i                           ambulance officer at the ground would, where possible, make
                            his way to the gymnasium to direct his operations.

                            It was considered that this ambulance officer would be better
I                           based in the North Stand so he could get to the gymnasium
                            without problems. However, the senior ambulance officer who
                            attends is off duty and the Sheffield Wednesday Football Club

i                           only wish to allocate the complimentary tickets to the ambulance
                            service for use in the South Stand, so that the club physio,
                            Alan Smith, can signal straight away to the ambulance officer

I                           if an ambulance is required for a Wednesday player.

          Chief Superintendent HEROLD                 DATE: llth April 1988
I ’1"0:


            S~       Items for de-briefing re F.A. Semi-final 9th April 1988
I           On Saturday 9th April I was duty sergeant in the Operations
            Room and I would like to submit my observations concerning
!           the football match.

            i. Operational Orders
!                Traffic        - no problems with this order other than the
                 fact that no call signs had been allocated to the three

!                public order patrols at Woodall Services, MI. It was not
                 unti! they came on the air that we knew who was on this
                 detail. It was necessary to then create a duty rota on the
                 computer and allocate callsigns (XI01,XI02,XI03). It would
I                have been much better if this had been catered for in the
                 order.

I             -’F’ Division - no problems, other than the fact that Operations
               Room did not receive a copy of the order. One was obviously
              copied from another held at headquarters.

!                ’D’ Division - this order catered very well with ’D’ Division
                 involvement, the precise details of primary and secondar~
                 routes being useful. One problem encountered was that the
!                traffic signals on the M1 exit slip roads at Catcliffe
                 were not turned off; officers were working traffic against
                 the lights. This matter was subsequently resolved but should
I                be catered for in any similar operation.

                 Dog Section - Operations Room did not receive a copy of any

!                order or duties in relation to duties at the match. It was
                 a fairly lengthy task creating a duty rota on the computer
                 for all the dog handlers involved and in future advance
                 duties for such operations should be supplied in advance.
!          2. Use of spotter plane

!             As you know we did have ~roblems initially with air to
              ground communications, but once these problems had been
              resolved the assistance cf the spotter plane became
!             invaluable. Pgior to the match, Operations Room were given
              good accounts of traffic flow into Hillsborough and traffic
              hold ups were reported. It was then possible to give
              instructions to officers on point duty,via other match
!             controls, to ease the hold ups.

              Ironically, there was a two mile tailback reported on the
!             A616 at Oughtibridge - traffic building up through Warncliffe
              Side to Deepcar. The hold up was on Low Road,Oughtibridge
              where public order patrols manned by the Underwater Search
!             Unit were stopping and searching vehicles travelling into
              city.                            -            "


!
                               -2-


I       After the match, the spotter plane was of great assistance
        in identifying why traffic could not leave the area of the
        ground.

!       One major problem highlighted, and rectified by the air
        observer, was that officers on point duty were working
        against each other. One would have released traffic whilst
!       the next officer in line would be stopping it. It was then
        possible to synchronise their instructions to traffic to
        keep the traffic flowing. One point that should be made to
I       beat officers on traffic points is that after the match they
        should give priority to football traffic leaving Sheffield,
        giving long runs through junctions. This was not the case

!       on Saturday and I had to make repeated requests,via Match
        controls, for this to be done.
    3. Radio Procedure and Transmissions
!       Unfortunately there was some confusion regarding which Force
       Radio Channel was being used for the match. As far as Operations
!       Room was concerned, Force Channe! 1 was reserved for all
        mobiles engaged on the football duty. ’D’ and ’F’ Division
        were expecting channel 2. This matter was rectified and channel

!       one was used.
       Channel 1 monitored all motorway patrols and any vehicle with
       specific duties in relation to the match. A total of 87 mobiles
I      were working on this channel and obviously at this level
       transmission time is at a premium. P.C. Ragg was the controller
       in Operations Room and I choose this point to state what an
I      excellent job he did.

       As always some officers were suffering from ’verbal diarrohea’

I      making life very difficult for the radio operator. Officers
       persisted in telling Operations Room every time they saw a
       coach or took up escort of it. In my view this type of
       transmission is unnecessary as it is virtually impossible for
I      this type of information to be recorded and retransmitted
       when coming in thick and fast. The only transmission of this
       type required is where we’-have a coach containing unruly
!      supporters, etc. or where~specific instructions or enquiries
       are given. Perhaps this point should be made at future briefings
       and included in orers.
!   4. Press Officer


I      I am aware that Superintendent Pratt had been detailed to
       deal with the media concerning the match, and we had speech
       with Mr. Pratt thoughout the day, but it would have been
       useful if there had been a press officer on duty at Headquarters
I      throughout the day to take care of all the press calls.

       The Operations Room Inspector and Sergeant act as press
I      officers out of hours and like any other Saturday numerous
       press calls were being received. Some were in relation to the
       match, others were routine press halls about incidents that

I      had occurred Friday night - Saturday morning.
                        -3-


I   A press officer on duty at headquarters would have allowed
    both the Sergeant and Inspector to give total supervision
I   t~-t~~ning of the Operations Room and football detail
    instead of having to keep breaking off to answer press
    enquiries.

I   Generally, the operation went well and was certainly an
    improvement on last year’s operation. This report is

I   respecZfully submit.ted for your information.

!    There is one aspect that Sergeant Hoyland spoke to me about which he has not
     included in his comments and that was his request to the SY~S Control Room at

!    Rotherham to be more seleczive in passing 9,,
                                                oo Ambulance calls to us during the
     Saturday afternoon. Our impression on the day was that they had reduced the
     number of calls passed in contravention of their normal policy and we felt that


I
     was very beneficial. In fact, we now know - fol!owing our meeting earlier this
     week - that in face it just happened that 999 calls were very low that day and
     they passed them all. As you know that reques~ of ours was one of their gripes
     at our recent meeting. However, by next year our revised joint policies wi!l

!    obviate that area of difficulty.

     I have a few comments of my own concerning the policing that day as fol!ows:-

!    You wi!l appreciate this was m}" first semi ’outside the ground’, with the
     responsibility for Operations & Traffic. By and large it was okay, but I think

!
     the managemen: of traffic flow can be improved. Many of the officers deputed to
     traffic points in both ’D’ and ’F’ Divisions really had little idea of what they
    were expected to do. Many appeared never to have worked traffic before and
     their signals were sloppy and gave a poor impression. Many I spoke to had no

I   idea of the overall traffic srraregy and had been deputed to a particular
     traffic pa!nt both before and after the match with no understanding of how their
    actions might influence the overall situation. I consider that one way to

!   ¯ mprove that might be for Divisions {O perhaps be a little more se!ec~ive in who
    they choose to depute to key traffic points, and once those persons have been
    nominated, then I feel that for the purposes of the operation they should come

!
    under the aegis of Traffic and all attend a pre-match briefing by ourselves so
    that all know just-what is what. I would envisage the use of maps and aerial
    photographs and videos to illustrate the overall picture. That would leave
    Divisional Commanders and Sector Commanders outside the ground to deal with the
!   crowd control, public order, liquor, etc., etc., with the control of traffic
    under a single co-ordinated command.


I   Staying with traffic, you will be aware that at one stage we had a tail back of
    some 2) miles from Tinsley to Catcliffe on the MI. Had we not adopted a one-off
    course of action tO resolve that, many Notts fans would.have missed the start of

!   the match. We would need to cater for such a contingency next year.




!                                                                  continued ....

          The match ’signing’ on the motorway was pathetic, as was the route signing for
          both se sets
                   ~ .= of fans. We need to consider the acquisition of LARGE CLEqR and
          easily ~or portable signs as a matter of urgency. We were trying to encourage
          Nort hbotn£ match traffic to use only the nearside lane of the MI North after
          Norrhbo~ud
          Catcliffe and the only signs we had were 18" square propped up at !ntervals on
          Catcliffe
              hard shoulder where no one could see them. We should consider flexible
_~~ theJ signs
          signs
           har(that
                 that
                   s we could attach ’gantry s=yle’ to the overhead bridge a~ the A57
         junction NNorth (and also bridges on the motorway for Southbound spectators which
         junction
         give c!ear instructions to visiting fans and which they cannot fai! to see).
         Subj ec t to your agreement, I wi!l arrange for Superintendent Brougham to
          research that area and report relative to cost etc. I do not envisage any great
          sum being involved.

         The spotter plane was - as always - a real asset, but although we thought we had
         it right this time and the communications worked at rehearsal, they failed us on
         the day. We will try again on Spring Bank Holiday when Middlesborough come to
         Oakwell versus Barnsley.

         If you agree in principle with these very general comments, I would intend to
         circulate these papers to the Divisional Commanders concerned for their
         information and future discussion.

 Assistant Chief Constable (Operations) I-D
  Sir.
  In respect of your Ine-norandurn concernin~ the above subject. I for-,~’ard
  here.vith a report by Superintendent Murray and endorse the ccranenls
  made therein.
  ~- only additional comment concerns traffiC, and I would a~ree with
  the ccrnTents made by Superintendent Anderson that in future at such
  events, i.e. su=ni finals, there may we!l be merit in traffic bein~
  dealt with separately fror. the policing of the football match. I
  would not be adverse to this suggestion and feel that it would be
  beneficial to all concerned. H~vever. I ~u!d not wish to see similar
  action at normal football matches and feel that our zxistin8
  arr~n~n, ents are completely adequate.
  I sub’nit this report for your info.mnation please.

            1. Informatlon/Intentlon.
I           1.1
                The match will attract a capacity crowd of approximately
            55p000 spectators. A large percentage of the crowd will travel by
I           roadp either by coach or priv ate car. Special trains will also
            convey Liverpool fans to Wadsley Bridge station and Nottingham
            Forrest supporters to Sheffield Midland station. A convoy of
I           buses will transport fans arriving at Sheffield Midland to the
            ground. The gates at the ground will be open from 11am.

I           1.2
                  It is the intention of the Road Traffic Division to assist
            the free movement of traffic and the segregation of supporters

I           both before and after the game so as to cause as little
            inconvenience as possible both to persons attending the match and
            to the general public.

I
            2. Method.
i           2.1
                Superintendent Brougham will be   in overall command assisted
I           by Inspector Scholey. Chief Inspector
            the sector north of the
                                                    Shaw will be in command of
                                      ground i.e. the Liverpool routes and
            Chief Inspector Lax will be in command of the sector south of the
            ground i.e. the Nottingham Forest routes.

            2.2
                 Traffic Division night staff on Friday 14th April 1989 will
            remain on duty until 8.00am. Unless instructed otherwise the 6
            - 2d staff on 15th April and all officers involved on duties re
            the match will work from 08.00 until approximately 20.00. No
            officer will retire from duty unless authorised by a supervisory
            officer.

I           2.3
                   All intersections on the motorway and all key traffic points
             will be manned from lOam. There will be car patrols detailed to
I            sections of the motorway and motorcycle patrols covering other
             routes. AII officers must ensure that footba I I traffic is
             correctly directed. Officers on static points must ensure that
             priority is given to the heaviest traffic flow which will
i            obviously be the football traffic. All officers at locations
             controled by automatic traffic signals will be issued with a key
             to turn off the lights as and when necessary. There are bound to
I            be locations will
                            where
                               build and occur. This
                                   traffic             up     delays
             could lead to frustration particularly by anyone not attending
            ¯ the match. Officers should therefore deal firmly but friendly
I            with any complaints re traffic movement.
I   2.4                           !
         There arm no car park ir~   facilities at Hi llsbovo football
    ground and al~ drivers should be encouraged to park up when
l   ~It~i~ walkie~; dista~om of the ground. There will no doubt come a
    stage when supporters will make more progress by walking.



         Eight personnel carriers have been squired and will be
    driven by officers shown at Appendix’B’. These vehicles will be.
    used to transport officers on static points, delivery of packed
    meals etc.

I   2.6
         There is a remote possibility that some supporters will
    travel on the A57 from Hyde to Sheffield via the Snake Pass. To
    reduce the possibility of this, during the night of 14th April
    1989, Barnsley Traffic Section will collect a diversion sign from

I   F 1 sub-d°ivision and transport it to the Junction of the A57 and
    A628 at Hyde where it will be positioned    to divert traffic away
    from the A57 and along the Ab28. The officers detailed for this
    task will_ inform the police at Glossop of their intention. After
    the kick off, Chief Inspector Shaw will arrange for the sign to
    be re-collected and returned to F1.
                      Q


    2.7
         Coaches will not be searched en    route   but will be searched
    on arrival at the parking area


    2.8 A public order detail will be present at Woodhall Services

    to prevent any disorder at that location. The detail will consist
    of officers shown at Appendix "B’.


    3. Briefinqs:

     3.1
          A briefing will be held at driving school at 9.00am for all
     those officers on static points and all motorcycle wing officers

     3.2
          A briefing will be held at Woodhall polict post at 8.30am
     for all officers shown on Appendix’B   with    he exception of
     Inspector Walker and the Transit drivers who will attend the
     driving school briefing.


     4. Communications:

I    4.1
          All mobiles equipped with VHF radio will operate on channel
     one. Personal radios will not be issued to those officers on
     static points shown in Appendix "D" except at certain strategic
     locations, in these cases portable VHF sets will be issued.
    will travel via the M62 MI
                             m    m A&I  and On the A&28 - M1.   Theme
    eupporters travelling down the M1    will exit at Junction 36 and
    will be directed on the    A&I   to the  ground. In the event of
I   Junction 36 ~coming heavily conJeBted, Liverpool traffic will
    redirected to Junction 35 and follow the emergency route shown in
    Appendix "A’.This diversion will ~t ~ taken into use without
I   instruction from a supervimory officer.

    5.2
I        The Liverpool coaches will be parked
    Halifax Road by beat personnel.
                                                on Claywheels Lane and



i   5.3 Notti nqham Forest

         The Nottingham supporters are expected to travel north on
    the M1 motorway where they will be directed to leave at junction
I   34, Tinsley. From there all traffic will travel along Attercliffe
    Common - Weedon Street - Brightside Lane. At the junction with
    Upwell Street traffic will be split. Private cars will continue

I   along Brightside Lane - Saville Street - Sutherland Street -
    Gower Street -    Burngreave Road -    Rutland Road - to Neepsend
    Lane where they will be advised to find parking. Coaches

I   mini-buses and vans will be turned right at Upwell Street and
    will then travel via Owler Lane to Herries Road. These vehicles
    will then be parked at the Herries bus depot.

I   5.4
         I n the event of the primary route for cars becoming
I   over-conjested there are four secondary routes available shown at
    appendix "A’. Some traffic may be sent on the coach route. None
    of the alternative routes will be used without consulting a
I   supervisory officer.



m   5.5 Despite the above instructions any Nottingham supporter

     travelling by car and particularly wishing to leave the motorway
     a t junction 33, Catcl£ffe, and travel via the Parkway will be
I    allowed to do so.


I    5.6 Supervisory officers must ensure Operations room are kept
     informed of any traffic diversions effected.

I         5.7
          A reserve of eight officers shown in appendix D will remain
     on standby at Driving school. If implementing the emergency
     routes necessitates further manpower these officers plus the
     motorcycle wing should be used.

     Dear Sir,
I    Hillsborough Stadium Inquiry


I    On behalf of the Chief Constable of the South Yorkshire Police, we
     enclose written background material, which our clients wish now to
     place before the inquiry. Bundles of photographs and of the

I    principal documents referred to in this material are also enclosed.

     In preparing this written material, our clients have attempted to
     concentrate on matters which will be of relevance to the inquiry,
     but which are unlikely to be the subject of substantial controversy.

     Our clients are considering what, if any, oral evidence might assist

I    the inquiry and would appreciate hearing from you as to which, if
     any, Officers of the South Yorkshire Police are to be called by
     Counsel to the inquiry.

I    Our clients wish to assist the inquiry and, to that end, we would

I                              PART 1

I          THE SOUTH YORKSHIRE POLICE: HISTORY, GEOGRAPHICAL
                    AREA, MANNING AND ORGANISATION

I
    1.1    The South Yorkshire Police was formed in
I         April 1974 by amalgamation of the Sheffield
          and Rotherham Constabulary and part of the
I         West Yorkshire Constabulary.

I   1.2   The force was originally coterminous with

I         the boundaries of the former South Yorkshire
          Metropolitan County Council.         In 1985 the
I         council   was      abolished   and     the South

I         Yorkshire Police now serves the four local
          authority areas of Sheffield, Doncaster,

I         Barnsley and Rotherham.


I   1.3   The South Yorkshire Police has a police
          establishment of 2978 officers and, on 15th
I         April 1989, an actual strength of 2929.

I         This equates to a population ratio per
          officer of 440, and a ratio of one officer
I         per 53 hectares.


I   1.4   The Chief Constable of the Force is Mr Peter

I         Wright and he has held the post since Ist
          January 1983.      To assist in the overall
I         management of the Force there is a Deputy
          Chief Constable and three Assistant Chief
I         Constables, each of whom has been allocated

I                                 3

I
!
!          specific     responsibilities          by the Chief
           Constable.
!
!   1.5   The Deputy      Chief Constable Mr Peter Hayes,

          QPM LLB        MA     deputises   in      the Chief

!         Constable’s     absence from the Force.         He
          hears minor charges laid against any member
!         of the Force under the Police (Discipline)

!         Regulations
          responsibility
                              1985    and    he      also has a
                                     for Communications and
          Computer Development within the Force. He
          has held this post since Ist March 1985 and
!         prior to this held the post of Assistant

!         Chief Constable from Ist May 1978.
          The Assistant Chief Constable (Operations)

!         Mr Walter William Wilson Jackson, is
          responsible         for     all police operational
!         matters, including the policing arrangements


!         for any major event occurring within the
          county.     He has held this post since Ist May

!         1985. ....


!   1.6   The two remaining Assistant Chief Constables
          are       Mr Terence Watson, BA, who has a
!         responsibility for Management and Financial

!         Services, and Mr Kenneth Stuart Anderson,
          who is responsible for the Staff Services

!         function of recruiting, training, personnel,
          career development and welfare. Mr Anderson
!
!
!
I
I         has also undertaken temporary responsibility

I         for complaints and discipline matters. Mr
          Watson      was       appointed     Assistant   Chief

I         Constable on 25th March 1984 and Mr Anderson
          on 3rd April 1985.
I
          The Force has six divisions. ’A’ ’B’ and
I   1.7

          ’C’      Divisions are coterminous with the

I         local authority boundaries of Doncaster,
          Barnsley and Rotherham respectively. The
I         city,     and     local authority district of
          Sheffield       are      served      by three police
I         divisions.        ’D’ Division incorporates the

I         city centre and the East of the city, ’E’
          Division is to the South, and ’F’ Division

I         covers      the   North           and West areas of
          Sheffield.
I
I         ’F’ Division has two sub-divisions. ’FI’ is
          known locally as Hillsborough Sub-Division

I         and Sub-Divisional Headquarters are located
          at the Hammerton Road Police station. ’F2’
I         is referred to as Ecclesfield Sub-Division

I         and is based at Ecclesfield Police Station.
          On       15th April 1989 the ’F’ Divisional

I         Headquarters were sited at Hammerton Road.
          However, on Monday 24th April 1989 the
I         Divisional Headquarters were transferred,

I         along with ’F2’ Sub-Divisional Headquarters,



I                                       5

I               South Yorkshire Police at The Common,
                Ecclesfield.


        1.9    Hillsborough     football stadium is situated
    I          within ’F’ Division.            It is approximately

    I          one mile north of Hammerton Road Police
               Station.

    I
        i.i0   Hillsborough is the home ground of Sheffield
    I          Wednesday Football Club who play in the
               First Division of the football league.
    I          Hillsborough has also been used on many

    I          occasions in the past as a neutral venue for
               FA Cup Semi-Final games.             There are four

    I          other Football League clubs within the South
               Yorkshire Police area. There is therefore
    I          substantial      collective football policing

    I          experience within the
               Police.
                                                 South Yorkshire


I
        i.ii   In addition, large crowds are attracted to
    I          horse racing at Doncaster where the St Leger

    I          Classic is run, to the venues for rugby
               league,      speedway,     the world snooker

    I          championship at the Crucible Theatre, and
               many more.            Furthermore,    the R.A.F.
    I          Finningley Air Display is attended each year


    I          by   in      excess      of 140,000 spectators.

    I
I
I           The Sheffield Marathon, and the National

I           Milk Cycle Race are also significant annual
            events requiring police supervision.

I
    1.12   The South Yorkshire Police has a broad
I          experience of controlling situations in

I          which crowds, sometimes hostile towards the
           police or a third party, gather together in

I          a confined area.


I   1,13   At the beginning of 1980 Sheffield became
           the focal point of a 13 week national steel
I          strike.         On 14th February of that year

I          massed demonstrations occurred at Vulcan
           Road, Sheffield and, at the height of the

I          demonstration         approximately        1500
           demonstrators      confronted the     police.
I          Despite this       concentrated   crowd,   the

I     J
           workforce of Hadfield’s steel company were
           enabled   safe passage into the factory.

I          During    the whole 13 weeks there was no
           notable   injury or damage caused during the
I          demonstrations.

I   1.14     Similarly, during the extended industrial

I          dispute between the National Union of
           Mineworkers and their employers over a 12
I          months period 1984/85, the South Yorkshire
           Police experienced some of the most intense,
I
I                                   7



I
I
I           and violent, crowd demonstrations in the

I           country.           Despite       the         size and, on
            occasions,    ferocity of the crowds, no fatal
            injuries were sustained in South Yorkshire
            as a result of the demonstrations throughout
I           the twelve months of the dispute.


    i. 15   Each South Yorkshire Police Division is
I           commanded by a Chief Superintendent. Chief
            Superintendent David Godfrey Duckenfield was
I           promoted to his present rank on 27th March

I           1989, to take over the command of ’F’
            Division.      Mr Duckenfield has over 25 years

I           police service and was a Superintendent for
            5% years before his latest promotion.
I
I   1.16    Each Divisional Commander is supported by a
            deputy divisional commander who carries the

I           rank of Superintendent.            The ’F’ Division

            Deputy is Superintendent Roger Marshall who
I           has held the post for 1% years.
            During       his       time at         ’F’      Division,
I           Superintendent Marshall has been involved in

I           the policing of the 1988 F.A. Cup semi-final
            match and many first division football
I           league matches involving Sheffield Wednesday
            at Hillsborough.
I
I
I
I
I
I   1.17    ’FI’     Sub-Division     is      commanded       by a

I          Superintendent
           Superintendent
                                who   is
                                  Marshall
                                              responsible
                                                   and
                                                                to
                                                            Chief
I          Superintendent Duckenfield.             The present
           sub-divisonal commander is Superintendent
I          Bernard Murray who took up the post on 14th

I          March 1988.          Like Mr Marshall he has had
           experience of one previous F.A. Cup semi-

i          final event at Hillsborough, in April 1988,
           but has regularly been involved in the
i          policing         arrangements      at         Sheffield

i          Wednesday’s first division home games.



i   1.18   ’F’     Division is normally policed by 299

           officers,     131      stationed        at "FI" Sub-
i          Division.


I   1.19   In addition to the territorial divisions of

I          the Force there are also police departments
           such as Operations and traffic which have a
I          functional       responsibility.         Operations
           Division Controls the deployment of officers
l          in Dog Section, Mounted Section, and other

I          operational support staff. The Division is
           commanded by Chief Superintendent John

l          Arthur Nesbit QPM, who is responsible to the
           ACC, (Operations).
l
I   1.20   Whilst Operations Division has a Forcewide
           responsibility       for    the     provision       of

I
I
I
I   operational support services, the direct
    policing arrangements for major sporting
    events are usually retained under the
I   control of the Division hosting the event.
    This was the case in respect of the F.A.
I   Challenge    Cup     semi-final    match at

I   Hillsborough on 15th April 1989.

            being reluctant to fill the centre of the
 I          terraced enclosure.              This problem was

 I          exacerbated by the late arrival~:of many
            spectators who were still making their way

I   2.51    It is worthy of note that this letter also

I          expressed the view that the accepted crowd
           capacity of i0,i00 at Leppings Lane terrace
I          offered no safety margin. Such concerns had
           previously been passed to Mr England, the
I          Club secretary, in a telephone conversation

i          with Chief Superintendent Herold who
           suggested that "... our (the South Yorkshire

I          Police) consensus view is that the i0,i00
           crowd        figure specified           in the safety
I          certificate       is         too high." The response

I          of the Clu~ was that the terraces had

I          all ticket matches.               The report of Chief

I          segregation of opposing supporters.         The
           Leppings       Lane end of the stadium has
I          traditionally been used for accommodating

I          ’away’ supporters. In the past, however, the
           seating enclosure and terracing was shared

I          with      season     ticket     holding   ’home’ ~
           supporters.        There has grown, over time, a
I          need at       football grounds       for total
           segregation of ’home’ and ’away’ supporters
I          and the barriers ensured that segregation

I          could be achieved by creating separate pens
           for each element. This reason for having the

I          segregated pens disappeared in the ’close
           season’ of 1987 when the newly appointed
I          Club    secretary    of Sheffield Wednesday

I          Football Club PLC, Graham McKrell, at the
           request of the police, re-allocated the

I          season ticket holders from the West Stand to
           other parts of the ground. Since that time
I          the West Stand and terraces have been

I          reserved for the use of away supporters

I          spectators, at the bigger games, on the

I          not a police one.


I   2.55   The   historical background to the Leppings

I          Lane turnstiles is as follows.



I   2.56   During the early 1980’s both the West stand
           and terraces were exclusively utilised by
I          away supporters.

I   2.57   In 1984     Sheffield Wednesday Football Club

I          returned to first division football and
           increased     attendances made it necessary for
I          the    club    to      make provislon for home

I          supporters to share the West Stand and
           terrace area facilities.

I    2.58    It was drawn to the clubs attention that

!           mixed use would cause problems with regard
            to segregating opposing fans as they entered

I           the   Stadium.      Inspector Clive Calvert was
            the   Football    Liaison Officer at that time
I           and   brought      this potential problem to

I           attention.



I   2.59    At that time the entrances to the West Stand
            consisted of a crescent shaped bank of
I           turnstiles occupying basically the same
            position as they do now but were numbered 1
I           to 18.       Five turnstiles numbered 19 to 23

I           occupied the same position as the current
            turnstiles ’A’ to ’G’.
I
    2.60. As a result of the representation made by
I           the police,      the bank of turnstiles 1 to 18

I           were reduced to their current numbers 1 to
            16.    Turnstiles 19 to 23 were increased by

I           two and renamed "A" to "G"

           point where the South Stand meets the Spion

I          Kop, giving access to the South Stand (lower
           level - East end).
I
           The boundary between the Spion Kop and the

           perimeter track is maintained by high metal

I          fencing.       This fencing has 6 access/egress
           gates which are served by a hinged and

I          spring loaded bar.


I          Leppinqs Lane Terraces

I   2.69   The boundary between the Leppings Lane
           terraces and the perimeter track is

I          delineated by a low concrete wall surrounded
           by high wire fencing. This fencing has 7
I          access/egress gates each approximetely one

I          metre wide which are secured by hinged and
           spring    loaded bars. Six of the gates are

I
    2.70   Whilst these gates open outwards onto the

I          in level at the point where the terracing
           meets the perimeter track fencing on the

I          supporters side. The terracing drops below
           the level of the playing area with the first
I          (lowest)      step being deeper than the

I          remainder so that there is a ’well’ on the
           spectators side of the perimeter wall. The

I          depth of the ’well’ varies from North to
           South and is greater at the North end. The
I          perimeter track gates will open only to 90°
           due to support stanchions on the track side
I          preventing them opening further.        The

I          location of gates and dimensions are shown

I         provided for courts to make Exclusion Orders

I         upon conviction of offenders for certain
          types of offences set out in the Act. These
I         offences include any offence involving the
          use or threat of violence, or disorderly
I         conduct     by      individuals       at       prescribed

I         football matches, or travelling thereto, as
          well       as offences committed against the

I         provisions of the Sports Events (Control of
          Alcohol) Act 1985.

        3.8    As far as the police are concerned, this Act
               places an obligation upon the police to

    I          the        necessary administrative support in
               respect of the photographs, the retention
               and dissemination of Exclusion Orders within
               their own force, and to other interested
    I          forces.

          HISTORY
    4.1   Hillsborough has during the past 15 years
          been the venue for semi finals on eight
          occasions, as follows:
          1974    Burnley -v- Newcastle

I         1975    Birmingham -v- Fulham

!         1988      Liverpool -v- Nottingham Forest
                    Liverpool -v- Nottingham Forest
          1989

I
          PLANNING - GENERAL
I   4.2   As with all major events being policed in

I         the South Yorkshire area the responsibility
          for planning falls to the Commander of the
I         Division where the event takes place. The
          Assistant Chief Constable (Operations) has
i         an overall responsibility and oversees the
          planning of these events.         Hillsborough
          falls within ’F’ Division.

I
    4.3   In the planning of such events reference has
I         to be made to the ’Standing Instructions for

I         the Policing of Football Matches’ issued as


i                                52
i
i         a Force Policy document (SYP Document ii),
          previous events staged at the same location
i         and intelligence concerning the forthcoming

i         event.       All matters contained in the ’ACPO
          Sub Committee on Hooliganism at Sporting
I         Events -     Guide to Policing Football’ (SYP


l         Document       12)         are considered and where
          relevant are incorporated in the plan.

I
    4.4   ’Standing Instructions for the Policing of

I         Football Matches’ is regularly assessed by
          the Superintendent (Operations) and is also
I         discussed       at         Senior officers’ meetings

I         during the season and at the end of the
          season, when any necessary amendments or

I         improvements         are       identified.          The
          instructions contain the following headings

I         PLANNING 1988 SEMI FINAL
    4.5   The 1988 semi final staged at Hillsborough
I         involved Liverpool and Nottingham Forest.

I         Coincidentally,     the 1989 scheduled Semi
          Final involved the same clubs. In view of
I         this    it    was possible to draw on the
          experience of the previous year and to make
I         particular    reference to the Operational

I         Order prepared for the event in 1988 and the


                                   54


I
          Intelligence Report prepared for that year.
          The two Operational Orders are available as
          SYP Documents 13 and 14 (the latter of which
          also includes Inspectors Briefing Notes to
          the Operational Order).


    4.6   The   1988 Intelligence            stated that when

          Liverpool played at Tottenham 2000 Liverpool
          fans were locked out and ran riot outside
          the ground, stealing from shops and causing
          public annoyance.                For this reason, the
          Serials included officers giving special

!         attention to shopping areas, to counter such
          eventualities.                This contingency plan was
!         repeated in the 1989 Order.


    4.7   The planning of the 1988 semi final was
          under the direction of the then Divisional
          Commander, Chief Superintendent Mole. This
          officer had also been in command of the
          Division the previous year when the 1987
!         semi final between Coventry and Leeds was

!         held at Hillsborough.                  The Deputy at ’F’
          Division         in     1988      was      Superintendent
          Marshall,   who        was still the Deputy in ’F’
          Division    in        1989.      Both officers took an
          active part in the 1988 semi final, in that
          Chief Superintendent Mole was in overall
          command of the operation and Superintendent
          Marshall was the Commander responsible for
          policing the ground sector.
                                            55
 I
 I   4.8    In   planning terms it is important to liaise
            with all    interested parties, including the
 I          Football    Association, The Club, Fire and
            Ambulance      Services,        The     Transport
            Representatives and Traffic Management. In
 I          addition there is continuous liaison with
            other Divisions of the Force who will be
ii
            affected by the operation, and with support

 I          services      such
            administration.
                                    as       catering     and



 I
     4.9    On 9th August 1988, Superintendent Murray,
 I          ’FI’ Sub Divisional Commander, had a meeting

 I          with the Deputy Chief Ambulance officer, Mr
            Hopkins, Assistant Chief Ambulance Officer

 I          (Operations)         Mr Jones,        of the South
            Yorkshire Ambulance Service and Assistant
 I          Divisional Officer, Mr Rowlands, of the

 I          South Yorkshire Fire Service. The purpose
            of the meeting was to further liaison in the

 I          event of a major disaster occurring at the
            Sheffield Wednesday Football Club Ground.
 I          The report of this meeting is available as


 I          SYP Document 15.



 I   4.10   Because of the manner in which semi finals
            are determined, there is often little time
 I          to plan these operations. The usual time


 I
                                       56



 I
I          period is 3 - 4 weeks. In view of this it
           is essential that early action is taken to
           determine the manpower level required to
           police the Stadium and this is one of the
           first priorities in planning.


    4.11   Following consultation with all interested
           parties,    the     examination of available
           intelligence and the drawing together of
           experience of policing other similar events

I          the manpower level for policing the 1988
           semi final inside and outside the ground was
I          determined and set at 928 officers.

I   4.12   In the course of a de-brief following the

I          1988 match, certain aspects were identified
           which may have a bearing on future events
I          and these were noted. The de-brief notes

I          are available as SYP Document 16. Some
           resources were under employed in and around

I          the ground,i particularly in peripheral
           areas. Much of this was as a result of the
I          general change in policy for policing Semi

I          Finals     in     that during normal matches
           officers are used for more than one role and
           are moved to different locations during the
           various phases of the match. In the case of
I          Semi Finals it was decided all officers

I          would be allocated a specific task and would



I                              57



I
!
           remain with that task throughout the
           operation, the intention being to ensure
           that the police had control both inside and
           outside    the ground throughout the operation
           in an effort to thwart those individuals
           intent    on causing disorder or attempting to
           enter     the ground without tickets.     This
           policy was     found to be sound in that it
           prevented     anticipated roaming gangs of
           disappointed       supporters causing disorder
           during the match. However, as stated, the
           levels of officers available was found to
           be excessive, particularly at the Liverpool
           end of the Stadium where this type of
           activity had been expected as a consequence
           of their        reputation and considerable
           following of supporters. Additionally, the
           number of CID officers outside the ground
           was found to have been excessive.


!          SEGREGATION - STRATEGY AND REASONS
    4.13   The   main arterial roads (A61 and A616) and
I          the   exits from the M1 motorway (junctions

I          36,
           the
                 35A and 35) for traffic travelling from
                 north, all feed the north side of the
I          ground.      Similarly, the main arterial roads
           (A616 and A57) and the motorway exits (29,




!                                  58


i
I           30, 31 and 34) for traffic travelling from
            the south, all feed the south side of the
            ground.       The natural arrival routes of

I           supporters therefore lend themselves to a
            Middlewood Road and Halifax Road approach to
I           the ground from Liverpool and Herries Road
            or Penistone Road approach from Nottingham.


     4.14   The       area within the ground having the
            largest capacities are the Spion Kop (21000)
 I          and the West Stand and Terraces (14565).
            The former is accessed via Penistone Road
 I          North turnstiles and South Stand car park

 I          turnstiles and the latter via Leppings Lane
            turnstiles.

 I
     4.15   With natural approach routes in mind, the
I           Spion Kop lends itself to Nottingham Forest

I           supporters with the West        Stand and
            Terraces to the Liverpool supporters.

I
     4.16   Giving priority to segregation and the fact
I           that Nottingham Forest supporters will

I           utilise South Stand car park turnstiles for
            the Spion Kop, it logically follows that

I           they should also occupy the South Stand as
            turnstiles to that area are also in that
I           location.

I                                  59

I
I
I
I   4.17   The    North Stand is accessed via turnstiles
           both in Leppings Lane and Penistone Road
           North,      therefore   by    closing those in
           Penistone Road North, the stand could be
           used by Liverpool supporters and optimum
I          segregation maintained.


    4.18   This     division of the ground resulted in the

I          combined capacities for the two segregated
           areas being:-
I          LIVERPOOL
           West Stand                      4465
I          Leppings Lane Terraces         i0100

I   4.19   The decision to segregate was made in accord
           with the recommendations of the Popplewell

           Green Guide’, recommendation 57.

I
I
I   4.20    The areas were therefore allocated on the
            basis       stated       in paragraph 4.19.      Any
            alteration would have resulted in opposing

I           fans        crossing           each other therefore
            increasing the likelihood of disorder and in
            addition excessive disruption to the
            residents of Sheffield and traffic choas
            both      before             and after the event.

            The     segregation plan attracted              some
I
            criticism from both Liverpool supporters and

I           Liverpool       Football       Club,     in that, of

            necessity,       it meant that Liverpool had a
I           smaller         allocation       of tickets     than

I           Nottingham.
             earlier,
                                   Nevertheless,      as

                         the 1988 event went off without
                                                           stated



I            difficulty and was considered a successful
             operation.
I
I    4.21
             PLANNING 1989 SEMI FINAL
             On 20th March 1989, the South Yorkshire

I            Police were again approached with a view to
                                                   staged at the
             the     Semi        Final     being
I            Hillsborough Ground on 15th April 1989,
             coincidentally with the same             teams being
I            involved.           Bearing in mind     the previous

I            years experience, Chief Superintendent Mole,
             ’F’ Divisional Commander, agreed that the
             event could be staged on the same basis as


I            1988.          The same segregation plan was


                                             61



I
I
I          intended and this brought a protest, via the
           Football      Association,           from Liverpool
I          Football     Club.       The same arguments as the

I          previous     year pertained and the Football
           Association were advised that the game could

I          be staged, but on the same terms as the
           previous year.           After consideration the
I          Football Association decided that they would

I          stage the event at Hillsborough under these
           conditions.

I
    4.22   An initial meeting of all interested parties
I          took place at Hammerton Road Police Station

I          on Wednesday 22nd March 1989. The meeting
           was chaired by Chief Superintendent Mole but

I          he was accompanied by then Superintendent
           Duckenfield, who was to be promoted on
I          Monday 27th March 1989 and assume command of


I          ’F’ Division.        Also present at the meeting
           were Superintendent Marshall, Superintendent

I          Murray,        Superintendent        Chapman    and
           Superintendent          Greenwood,      who    were
I          identified as the sector Commanders for the


I          match on the 15th April 1989. The sector
           Commanders       were       selected    by Chief

I          Superintendent Mole due to their experience
           in policing          football matches          and in
I          particular their previous involvement at the
           Hillsborough Stadium.             All the officers
I
I                                       62



I
i          concerned had been involved in the 1988 Semi
           Final.    In general they were given the same
i          command positions with the exception of
           Superintendent Marshall and Superintendent
           Greenwood, whose roles were reversed. In

i          1988 Superintendent Marshall had been the
           Ground       Commander        and      Superintendent
           Greenwood had been in command of the
           Leppings Lane end of the Stadium.
!
I   4.23   In   addition to the Sector Commanders each
           Superintendent     was        allocated     2   Chief
I          Inspectors as Sub Sector Commanders. Again
           these officers were specially selected for
I          their knowledge of policing football and in

I          particular       their          knowledge       of the
           Hillsborough Stadium.               At the meeting
i          discussions once again took place concerning
           the allocation of areas to supporters but,
I          for the reasons previously explained, it was

I          agreed that the allocations should be as the
           previous year.     In dealing with this aspect

I          consideration     had to be given to the
           intelligence     then available as to the
I          current attitude of the fans from Liverpool
           and Nottingham. In both cases the behaviour
           during the season had been relatively good
           in respect of both sets of supporters with
           the exception of the tendency for pitch
                                    63
 I               invasion in the case of the Nottingham
                 supporters.


          4.24   There was a pitch invasion by Liverpool
                 supporters at the end of the 1988 semi final

 |i
 i    i          and for this reason contingency plans were
                 written into the 1989 serial instructions to
                 increase the manpower on the perimeter track
                 at ’full time’.


          4.25   A particular area of concern at the meeting
                 was the method of travel adopted by visiting
 I               supporters and experience indicated that the
                 use    of trains and particularly special
 I               trains was diminishing. It was felt in this

 I               connection that supporters knew that when
                 travelling by special trains they would be

 I               met by police resources, escorted to the
                 Stadium and made to enter straight away. It
 I               is clear that this is the greatest form of

 I               control on those spectators and to a large
                 extent prevents hooliganism. In past years

  I              the use of trains has been more predominant.
                 This is somewhat important particularly with
 I               regard to the Liverpool supporters to whom

 I               the Wadsley Bridge Railway Station on the
                 north side of the ground is made available.

!                The    number of supporters      using this
                 facility, the number of trains and times of


                                        64
I
I          trains    were   not known at this planning

I          stage.


I   4.26   Subsequent       planning    meetings under the
           chairmanship       of       Chief   Superintendent
I          Duckenfield took place on the 29th March

I          1989 and       10th April 1989.       The actual
           planning team who prepared the Operational

I          Order comprised Superintendent Murray, Chief
           Inspector Beal and Inspector Sewell under
I          the       supervision of Chief Superintendent


I          Duckenfield.



I          MANPOWER
    4.27   In view of the need to urgently identify
I          manpower    requirements the task was embarked~
           upon taking        into account the following
I          areas:-

I          i)       The need for a level of manpower
I                   capable of policing the match and
                    maintaining public order
I          ii)      The experience of the previous year

I                   and any lessons learned
           iii)     The       responsibility of ensuring
I                   effective and efficient policing
           iv)      The cost of the operation
!
I                                        65

I
I
    4.28   In the light of all these aspects manpower
           requirements were      identified and the
           necessary manpower level was determined to

I          be 801

           27% of
                    officers representing approximately
                    the entire South Yorkshire Police
I          Force.


I   4.29   The total deployment of officers of all

I          ranks in the various roles for 1989 were as

I   4.30   The manpower referred to in this report

I          involves that utilized in policing the
           actual events at Hillsborough under the
I          command of the Divisional Officer. There


I          were also officers deployed to Traffic
           Control duties and officers deployed in the

I          city centre.       These officers work to
           separate Operational Orders prepared by the
I          Commanders of Operations and Traffic and of
           ’D’ Division respectively (SYP Documents 17
I          and    18).    Allocated manpower was 154

I          officers and 167 officers respectively.


I   4.31   Taking into account the three aspects of
           policing the total manpower available for
I          deployment was 1122 being just over 38% of

I          the South Yorkshire Police.



I   4.32   The   three areas of command maintain contact
           through radio and land line communications
I          in order to cater for flexibility in re-

I          deployment.



I   4 33   An example of the flexibility of the plan
           can be drawn from the fact that in the ’D’
I          Division Order officers are allocated to

I          escort duties of public transport vehicles,



I                               70
I
I          travelling from the Midland Station to the

I          Hillsborough ground, and a contingency is
           incorporated for those arriving at 2.45 pm
           to remain at the Hillsborough Stadium in the
           Gymnasium as      a   standby   reserve    for
I          deployment as and when required.          This
           contingency was adopted in 1988 and on
           completion of the match the officers are

I          again used for escort duties back to the
           railway station in the city centre. The
I          same contingency plan       was incorporated

I          in the 1989 Order.



I   4.34   The method of raising manpower for events
           such        as the Semi Final and all other
I          operational matters within the            South
           Yorkshire Police area is based on policy
I          which reflects that the Division upon which

I          the event is to take place should identify
           the manpower it can raise and then inform
I          Operations    Division at Force Headquarters

I          of that
           required.
                         additional manpower which is
                         The additional manpower is then

I          raised from across the Force area from duty
           and off duty time officers and is notified
I          to the    host Division for allocation of


I          duties.



I
I                                 71


I
I
I   4.35   In view of the fact that Hillsborough hosts

I          First Division Football Matches on a regular
           basis, the vast majority of officers in the
I          Force have at some time or another been
           involved in policing at the Ground. Every
           effort is made to ensure that officers are

I          deployed
           familiar
                       to those areas with which they are
                       or if they have not been regularly

I          involved    are deployed on duties Where they
           may take up a static point and carry out a
I          specific role.       The actual deployment of

I          officers was undertaken by the Control Room
           Commander Superintendent Murray and his

I          Deputy Chief Inspector Beal, assisted by the
           Support Inspector, Inspector Sewell. These
I          officers all have experience of deployment

I          of manpower at Hillsborough Stadium and can
           recognise those individuals with particular

I          knowledge.      The manpower provided to police
           such events reflects the general age and
I          experience of the Force and deployment is
           based upon Serials under the command of a
I          Sergeant    with 5, 6, 8 or i0 officers at his

I          disposal.    The experience amongst these
           officers    ranges across the board from none
I          to a vast      experience of policing similar
           events.

I          SEGREGATION - ADDITIONAL FACTORS

I   4.36   In connection with segregation much effort

|          was put into the total segregation of fans
           working on the North/South divide. In the
I          first place, as indicated, the command

I          structure was based upon this segregation.
           In addition as in 1988 through liaison with

I          the FA and the Club, it was agreed that
           Sectors of the North Stand adjacent to the
I          Kop and the South Stand adjacent to the

I          Leppings Lane Terraces would be reserved for
           neutral supporters in the form of FA Members

I          and their club representatives. This was
           intended to act as a buffer between opposing
I          fans who were likely to come into conflict
           at those two locations.        Furthermore, to
I          prevent throwing between opposing fans a

I          fine net was erected on the end of the North
           Stand     adjacent    to the    Kop   through

I          consultation with the club.


I   4.37   The number of turnstiles giving access to

I          the North Stand was reduced as a consequence
           of the closure of the 12 turnstiles in
I          Penistone Road North.      For the purpose of
           segregation these were not utilized in an
I          effort to prevent clashes between rival

I          supporters.     Entrance to the North Stand


I                                73


I
           was,     therefore,      via   Leppings   Lane,
           turnstiles i-i0.        Normally, Leppings Lane
           access to the North Stand is via turnstiles

i          1--8.

           Semi
                   It was a club decision in hosting the
                   Final to allocate two extra turnstiles

!          to compensate          for the loss of twelve
           turnstiles in Penistone Road North.          A
           further means          of segregation was the

I          introduction of a sterile area in the
           service road behind the            South Stand

I          extending from the Leppings Lane terraces to
           the Police Control Box.
I
I   4.38   This was done in 1988 and was effective
           in ensuring that Liverpool supporters did

I          not have the ability to confront Nottingham
           supporters in the South Stand area.
I
I   4.39   A further point which had been identified in
           1987 at the match between Coventry and Leeds

I          concerned     the housing of lost property
           offices.      In 1987 the property had been
I          taken to the gymnasium from all areas of the
           ground,       consequently resulting in some
I          difficulty       and       confrontation between

I          opposing fans when they went to collect
           their property after the match. In 1988,
I          and again in      1989, arrangements were made

           with the club for property stores to be
I          utilized at both ends of the Stadium. For

i                                    74

i
I
I          the Liverpool supporters a portacabin was

I          erected in the West Stand enclosure whilst
           Nottingham Forest supporters were allocated

I          the souvenir shop situate behind the Spion
           Kop.        With the agreement of the club the
I          gymnasium was             identified as being the


I          logistical centre for operations in that the
           allocation of radios and other equipment

I          would be dealt with at that location.
           Additionally, the gymnasium was identified

I          as     a   venue     for lost children or other
           messages which            had to be responded to by
I          visitors to the Stadium.

I   4.40   Particular emphasis was placed upon the

I          accommodation and separation of vehicular
           traffic for both sets of supporters. Some
I          supporters travel by rail, some by coach,

I          mini bus and their own modes of transport.
           In view of this arrangements were made for

I          ’special        trains’       carrying    Liverpool
           supporters to be brought to Wadsley Bridge
I          Station,    a      station which is only used for

I          football
           supporters
                         supporters.         For Nottingham
                           the trains were scheduled to go

I          into the Midland Station in the centre of
           Sheffield.      Contingency plans were also made
I          to deal with Liverpool supporters arriving

I          at Midland Station on scheduled trains.



I                                       75


I
I
I          They were to go by public transport buses

I          direct from the station to the Leppings Lane
           end of the ground. So far as coaches are
I          concerned, the coaches from Liverpool were
           to be accommodated at the North of the
I          Stadium    in Claywheels Lane and Halifax Road

I          and the coaches from Nottingham in Herries
           Road.      Mini buses and private cars were

I          likewise     accommodated in the North/South
           divide.
I
I   4.41   These plans were identical to those for the
           1988 Semi Final and would have the added

I          advantage of ensuring that supporters who
           had attended the previous year would be
I          familiar with the arrangements.

I          TICKETS

I   4.42   Previous experience regarding the allocation
           of tickets had indicated some difficulties,
I          both in the identification of the areas

I          where ticket holders should attend and in
           respect of forgery.       Efforts were made to

I          combat both these problems. In relation to
           forgeries,      special material was used for
I          printing so that they could quickly be
           identified.      The tickets were colour coded
I
I
I                               76


I
I
I          and      over    printed with Liverpool             or

I          Nottingham dependent upon the area to which
           they    were allocated.           This procedure had
I          been    embarked upon in 1988, but at the de-
           brief     for that match it was felt that the
I          colour    coding was not prominent enough and

I          was

           the
                  not linked to a colour code system at
                  turnstiles. In 1989, the club arranged
I          for    the colour code to be made much bolder
           and respective colours were shown at the
I          turnstiles where those tickets should be

I          surrendered.


I   4.43   Additionally,       tickets for the Spion Kop and
           Leppings        Lane Terraces were overprinted
I          showing         ’Nottingham     Forest   area’     and

I          ’Liverpool area’ respectively.
           done to try and overcome the difficulties
                                                        This was



I          experienced in the 1988 Semi Final when
           Liverpool supporters purchased Spion Kop
I          tickets, gained access, claiming ignorance

I          of the fact that they had purchased tickets
           for the ’wrong end’ and created segregation

I          problems.


I   4.44   On     the Spion Kop near to the North Stand

I          there is        a small area with limited access
           which can be used to isolate Liverpool

I          supporters          from        Nottingham       Forest


I                                     77


I
I          supporters.          This contingency plan was put

I          into effect utilizing police officers to
           ensure segregation between the two.
I
           A   similar contingency plan for the Leppings
I   4.45

           Lane     Terraces in respect of Nottingham

I          Forest   supporters is not viable because
           there    is         no natural      small area for
I          segregation.


I   4.46   It will be noted that the rear of each Semi

I          Final ticket requests that supporters take
           up position 15 minutes before kick off.

I          Publicity circulated both locally and to the
           Liverpool and Nottingham areas (available as
I          SYP Document         19)    asks supporters to time

I          their      journey
           10.30 am. and 2.00 pm.
                                       to    arrive   between



I
           NON TICKET HOLDERS
I
I   4.47   Whilst        the      colour coding of tickets
           described at paragraph 4.42 was intended to

I          expedite entry into the Stadium, there is
           always the possibility as in previous years
I          of spectators attending without tickets. To

I          this end such persons loitering in the
           immediate vicinity of the ground, after kick

I          off, would be collected together and, in the


I
                                  78
I
I
I          case of Liverpool supporters, taken to Coal

I          Road, an area adjacent to Wadsley Bridge
           Station dispersal or to await for transport
I          after the match. Nottingham supporters were


I          to be taken to Hillsborough Park where the
           same procedure would apply.

I   4.48   This course was intended to deal with the
I          nuisance problem    caused by non-ticket
           holders loitering in the area whilst the
I          game was in progress. In 1988, whilst there

I          were a number who attended without tickets,
           the number was not excessive and they were

I          simply dispersed from the area.


           All ticket games have been discussed in the
    4.49
I          past at pre-season meetings held each year
           between Senior Officers       of the South

I          Yorkshire Police and the club officials
           (usually the Secretary and Chairman or
I          Representative Director).

I
4.50       At one of their meetings held on the 24 July

I          1987, the club representative asked whether
           or not the police would permit entry to non
I          ticket holders rather than have them milling

I          about the streets around the ground. They
           were told that entry would not be allowed as

I
                                 79

I
I
i
I          the long term effect would be to encourage

I          non     ticket      holders    to travel in the
           knowledge that they would be admitted.

I
           PUBLICITY
I   4.51   During planning stages it was agreed that

I          the information concerning the arrangements
           for     the match would be promulgated to

I          supporters through the media and through
           their       club programmes.       This task was
I          undertaken by the Football Intelligence

I          Office under the directions of the Chief
           Superintendent       (Operations     and Traffic

I          Division).        Emphasis was made on the need
           for supporters to attend in good time and,
I          to accommodate this, arrangements were made
           with the club for turnstiles to be opened at
i          12 noon,      that is 3 hours before kick off.

I          Detective     Superintendent McKay made a
           broadcast on Radio Merseyside on Friday 14
I          April 1989, stressing that as this was an

           COMMUNICATIONS
I
           In terms of communication the ground has a

           base station which can operate on UHF for

 I           with
             the
                     the event. The Control Room was under
                     command      of        Superintendent Murray,

 I           assisted by a Sergeant and 2 Constables all
             with previous Control Box experience. In

 I           Control Box also have landline facilities to
             the club, Hammerton Road Police Station and
 I           a direct outside line. The club have their
             own personal         radio system for use by
 I           stewards.         The Police Control staff link

 I           into this by way of one of the clubs radio
             sets.         The Police Control Room has a

i          EMERGENCY EVACUATION

I   4.55   At all sporting events emergency evacuation
           procedures        are    essential       and,     at

I          Hillsbrough, these are tested on a regular
           basis.         The procedures have in fact been
I          tested twice during this season, on the ist

I          February
           the      18
                         1989 at the Symod Cup Match and on
                         February   1989 when Sheffield

I          Wednesday       played    Southampton.          The
           procedures were found be effective.             In
I          accordance with the guidance contained in
           the Guide to Safety at Sports Grounds the
I          management of the club are required to

I          consult with the Fire Authority regarding
           the      suitability       of        the evacuation

I          procedures.        Details of the evacuation
           procedures are included in the Operation
I          Order (SYP Document 14) and are issued to

I          all Supervisory officers of the rank of
           Sergeant and above.

I
    4.56   In brief, the plan requires, on a pre-
I          arranged signal, officers being deployed to

I          gates, gangways and doors in readiness for
           evacuation and specific officers are briefed

I          prior to the event on their function. Should
           it be necessary to implement evacuation then
I          instructions, particular to the problem in

I          hand, are given to officers through the


i                                    82



!
I
I          Police     Control Box.    In essence,~ the plan

I          caters     for egress into identifiable safe
           areas of the ground such as the pitch and

I          enclosures     behind each of the respective
           stands.        These plans are arranged in
I          consultation       with   the   Fire   Service,

I          Ambulance
           Stewards.
                          Service,   Club officials and



I
    4.57   The    ground public address system is brought
I          into   use to advise the crowd or sections of
           the
I                 crowd to       leave the Stadium once
           contingency plans have been formulated. It

I          should be mentioned that regular testing of
           this system, using the police over-ride
I          facility revealed that one of the speakers
           (adjacent to turnstile 73) was defective.
I          It has taken repeated requests to the club

I          to have this repaired, this being achieved a
           matter of weeks before the Semi Final was

I          scheduled to take place.


I   4.58   By way of comparison the need has been

I          identified in the past for a system of
           speakers    actually outside the turnstiles in

I          Leppings       Lane to enable the spectators
           awaiting entry to be addressed should be
I          need arise.        The club implemented this

I          change without undue delay.

I          INTELLIGENCE

I   4.59   Whilst the majority of planning can be taken
           in advance of the event, changes do occur

!          and the      role of the Football Intelligence
           Officer      cannot be underestimated.        His
I          liaison      with the clubs          involved and
           assessment       of     background      information
I          concerning their behaviour is considered in

I          depth and it can dictate the need for change
           to plans right up to kick off.
I
           Additional reference was made to the ’match
I   4.60
           summary’ (SYP Document 20) completed and

!          submitted following the 1988 Semi Final.


I   4.61   In   terms     of Intelligence, Liverpool had
           played at Hillsborough against Sheffield
I          Wednesday      Football Club on Saturday 14

I          January
           Liverpool
                        1989.     On that occasion the
                         supporters totalled 6,100 and the

I          home supporters 25,424.        The total at the
           ground was therefore 31,524. The attitude
I          of all supporters can best be described as

I          good and in fact there were only 4 arrests,
           all involving the visiting supporters from

I          Liverpool, 2 being inside the ground and two
           outside the ground. In addition, there were
I          29 ejections from the ground under the

I
I
I          Ground Regulations, 25 being in connection

I          with home supporters and 4 being visitors
           from Liverpool.

I
    4.62   In terms of transport, it was noted that
I          there were no special trains from Liverpool.

I          On scheduled service trains approximately
           900       attended and on buses and coaches

I          i,i00.      Therefore, some 4,100 travelled in
           their own transport. The manpower committed
I          to policing that              event totalled 313
                                         Operational
I          officers.            An
           (available as SYP Document 21) was produced

I          and took the same format as at all league
           matches      staged       at Sheffield Wednesday
I          Football Ground.


I          ALCOHOL

I   4.63   The role of the Divisional Intelligence
           Officer has also been enlarged to include
I          liaison with licensees in the area of the
           ground with a view to encouraging closure or
I          the      operation        of ’selective doors’ to

I          prevent clashes of rival supporters inside
           the premises.         This is done as a matter of
I          course for each match day and was also done
           pre Semi Final day.

                           application by South Yorkshire

I          Police     to     the Licensing Bench of the
           Sheffield Magistrates’ Court. The effect of
I          this is that those wishing to drink have to

           ground.
                           licensed premises outside the
                           The police seek to control this,

I          utilizing the         procedures       outlined   in
           paragraph 4.63.
I
I   4.65   Consideration was given to applying to the
           Magistrates Court for a Restriction Order

I          under Section 67 of the Licensing Act 1964
           as amended by Section 3 of the Licensing Act
I          1988.          However any Restriction Order can
           only specify closure between 2.30 pm and
I          5.30 pm. As ’drinking up time’ of 20 minutes

I          would result in public houses closing only
           i0 minutes before kick off, it was not
I          considered that a Restriction Order would be
           of any benefit.

           BRIEFING
           Following the arrangements for planning of
I          any   major event it is essential that plans,
           and   the policies determined, are explained
I          to    all officers involved. To achieve this,

I          briefings are arranged and, because of the


I                                      86


I
!
           wide        spread of people involved in the
           operation, it was decided that briefings
           would be held at the Stadium on the day

I          prior to the event for officers of Inspector
           and above to allow them to familiarize
I          themselves    with the ground and surrounding

i          locations.      Prior to the briefing, each
           Inspector is issued with relevant details of

I          the Order and specific details of the
           Serials under his command (SYP Document 14).
I          This course of action was followed in both


I          1988 and 1989.



I   4.67   A   full briefing took place at Hillsborough
           at i0.00 am on Friday 14 April 1989 and full
I          details of the plan were discussed. The
           briefing       was    undertaken    by     Chief
I          Superintendent       Duckenfield,   followed by

I          Superintendent Murray.
           briefed
                                          Sector Commanders
                       all the Inspectors. Following that
I          briefing,     arrangements were made        for
           officers     to report for duty at the Stadium
I          at 9.45 am on the day of the event.

I          STEWARDS
I   4.68   On each match day stewards are briefed by
           supervisory officers.
I
I
I                                 87


I
I
I   4.69   During     actual games, at ad hoc meetings on

I          other than match days and at the annual
           briefing    of stewards held at the club and

I          to which the police attend certain matters
           relating to stewards have been raised. Two
I          such meetings were held on the 15 and 23

I          August 1988 and at those meetings stewards
           were reminded of their duties. A copy of

I          ’Instructions        for Match Day Staff’ and
           ’Instruction to Stewards’ which are issued
I          by the club are SYP Documents 22 and 23.


I   4.70   In practice, the police have the ability to

I          perform some        stewarding duties.
           particular, Inspectors and above are issued
                                                      In


I          with a key to the padlocks which either lock
           or fasten back spectator gates, all padlocks
I          being identical and requiring the use of one

I          ’common key’.


I          OTHER MATTERS
           Sunday Match
I
I   4.71   In considering the possibility of staging
           the Semi Final on a Sunday, the following

I          applied:


I
I                                  88

I
I
I          (i)          The   Football Association express a

I                    wish for both Semi Finals to be
                        played on the same day with the

I                       caveat that they would consider
                        changing to a Sunday        if live
I                       television cover was offered.     No

I                       such offer was made.



I          (ii)         As this was an all ticket game, the
                        day on which it was staged would make
I                       no difference to the capacity.


I          (iii)        Licensed premises were open until

I                       kick off on both dates.


I          TURNSTILE COUNTING SYSTEM


I   4.72   The club has control facilities whereby they

I          monitor through CCTV all the turnstiles at
           the stadium. This monitoring is linked to a

I          computerized counting system and this has a
           warning facility when levels of supporters
I          in the various sections of the Stadium reach

I          a

                        EMERGENCY CONTINGENCY PLANS


    5.1   In the event of any major disaster in their
          area South Yorkshire Police have contingency
          plans     contained      in the Major Incident
          Manual (SYP Document 24) aimed at dealing
          with all aspects         of the results of the
          disaster being faced.


I   5.2   In definition the major incident plan
          identifies a "major incident" as
I                  "a    serious   disruption   of life,

I                  arising with little or no warning,
                   causing or      threatening death or
I                  injury to numbers of people in excess
                   of those that can be dealt with by
I                  the Public Services operating under

I                  normal conditions, and which require
                   special mobilisation and organisation

I                  of those services."


I   5.3   The plan further outlines the objectives and

I         states
                   "it is impossible to cater for every

I                  contingency which might arise in a
                   major incident situation. The major
I                  incident plan, therefore, contains a

I                                   92

I
I
I                 basic format on which the response to

I                 all major incidents should be based.
                  Whilst setting out basic principles

I                 and   responsibilities to be adhered

                  to,   it also allows for flexibility
I                 and    initiative in the prevailing


I                 circumstances".



I    5.4   The plan details full descriptions of action
           to be taken but specifically outlines police
I          duties and responsibilities as follows:-
                  Prevent further danger.
I           .


           2.     Mobilise emergency services.

I    5.5   Due to the fact that the disaster took place

I          at an event which was already being policed,
           many    of the        resources and facilities

I          required under the Major Incident Plan were
           already in being. Examples of this refer to
 I         manpower,     first      aid facilities, police

 I         control point and communications.

I                 COMMUNICATIONS - F.A. CUP SEMI FINAL AT
                        HILI~BOROUGH ON 15 APRIL 1989

I
          INTRODUCTION
I   6.1   The        following communication arrangements
          were made for the police operation at
I         Hillsborough on 15th April 1989 and the

I         subsequent emergency action.


I   6.2   PC      Claxton of the Communications staff
          attended      a   planning    meeting   at    "F"
I         Divisional Headquarters, Hammerton Road on

I         the 22nd March 1989 to note the requirements
          defined by the Division and offer advice if

!         required.


I         RADIO

I   6.3   The arrangements for radio cover for the

I         match were the same as for all other games
          at Hillsborough save that an additional
I         facility was provided at Neepsend to control

I         CID officers working on crime prevention
          duties.

I
          Radio Cover
I   6.4   Radio cover for the Hillsborough ground,

I         for both
          provided
                        internal and external patrols, is
                        by a UHF scheme operating on

I                                  97


I
I
I         channel 25 with the aerial on the floodlight
          gantry at the side of the police control
i         room inside the ground. This gives radio

I         cover over a radius of approximately 1 mile
          from the ground.

I
    6.5   The radio installation in the police control
!         room is permanent and used for all matches

!         at the ground.



I   6.6   Channel 25 is one of 4 emergency channels
          available to       all U.K.      police forces
I         (channels 19:    23:29 are the others) which

i         are regularly used for controlling activity
          at football grounds. It is a matter for the

I         force to control use to prevent interference
          between police operations working on the
I         same channel. There was nothing else taking


I         place in-force on 15th April 1989 to cause
          interference.      Because of the hilly terrain

I         between the ground and adjacent police force
          areas   interference      from    other force’s
I         communication is highly unlikely. There was
          none reported on the day.
I
I   6.7   In addition to the UHF scheme at the ground
          channel 19 was used by CID officers working
I         on security duties in the designated parking
          areas at Neepsend and Parson Cross. The
!
I                                 98

I
I          aerial for this is on Shirecliffe College

I          which is high enough to provide cover of
           approximately 3 miles radius which includes

!          Hillsborough.        This use of channel 19 is
           similar to the arrangement in previous years
I          for semi-final matches.

!   6.8    Finally the F1 Sub-Division Regular Channel
           35 was available to officers with the Pye
           Multi-channel radios.
I
           Radio Issue
I
!   6.9    Paragraph
           (available
                         4.11.4 of the Operational Order
                           as SYP Document 14) identifies
I          radio issue to all supervisory officers
           on the detail.
I
I   6.10   On the morning of the 15th April 1989
           Communications       Department delivered i00

I          Burndept 3 channel radios, tuned to channels
           19: 25:      29, and 120 Pye PFX multi-channel
I          sets to      the police room at the ground. In

I          addition,    36 earpieces were delivered which
           would fit either of the radio types. Spare

I          batteries were also provided, but no battery
           chargers.
I
I   6.11   Allocation and distribution of the sets and
           earpieces was effected by PC Fiddler.

I                                   99


I
I   6.12   Two radio issue books were used which are
           now      at      Headquarters    Communications
           Department.       76 PFX sets and 63 Burndept
           sets are shown to have been issued. Four
           earpieces     are booked out to serial 21 (see
           operational      order). More earpieces were in
           fact taken       for use because at 24.4.89 20
           were     still    outstanding    for return to
           Headquarters.


I          Radio Equipment

I   6.13   There         is a permanent UHF radio scheme

I          installed at the ground for policing all
           football matches. This scheme was used for
I          the F.A. Cup semi-final on 15th April 1989.

I   6.14   The radio set is provided by the Directorate

I          of Telecommunications and referred to as a
           WI5U portable base station. It is in fact a
I          Pye Westminster Mobile radio adapted for use

I          as a temporary fixed base station. This
           type    of installation is in frequent use at
i          all    football grounds in the Force and by
           most     other    forces who have      similar
I          requirements.       The set is powered by mains
           electricity and is located in the police
I          control room.

I
I                                    i00


I
I
I          Method of Operation


!   6.15   The WI5U can be operated in either ’talk-

I          thro’ or ’non talk-thro’ mode by pressing or
           releasing a button on the radio set. The
I          choice is with the radio control operator.


I   6.16   The radio operator in the control room uses

i          a handset with a ’press to talk’ switch and
           a    speaker for incoming messages.      The

I          installation at Hillsborough has a ’tulip’
           microphone which stands on the desk in front
I          of    the controller and an in-car radio

I          speaker, also desk mounted.



I   6.17   It is normal practice at Hillsborough to use
           the UHF radio scheme on ’talk-thro’ and this
!          was the case on the 15th April 1989. Talk-


!          thro’ is also used at other grounds in the
           force for policing football matches.

I
    6.18   Even with the use of an earpiece, noise
I          levels in crowd situations, particularly in


I          the confines of a football ground, can reach
           a level where the volume of the radio output

I          is not sufficient for the user to be able to
           receive transmissions.
!

I
I
I          Effect of Talk-thro’ Choices

I          Talk-Thro’ on


I   6.19   Everyone with a radio, turned on to the
           appropriate
I                           channel,         can   hear
           transmissions by anyone else, including the
                                                          all



I          control room.


I   6.20   If more than one radio transmits at any one
           time all other sets including the control
I          room, get all the messages. However, it

I          becomes increasingly difficult to understand
           individual messages when several officers

I          are speaking.


i   6.21   If the controller is transmitting on the
           handset and one of the personal radios
           transmits at the same time, then the control
           output is cut off. All the users, including
           the controller, will receive the message
I          from the personal radio. This arrangement

I          is electrically built into the equipment.
           It can only be overcome by de-selecting

I          talk-thro’.


I          Talk-Thro’ Off


I   6.22   If the controller transmits, all sets

I          switched on to the channel will receive.


                                       102
I
I   6.23   A   message transmitted from a personal radio
           is only heard on the controllers set.
i
I   6.24   Whilst the controller is transmitting any of
           the personal radios can transmit and the

I          message will be received on the controllers
           set.       The transmitting personal radio will
I          not        receive the message being sent by

I          control.



I          Radio Control Operational Order


I   6.25   Paragraph 4.11 of the          operational order

I          (SYP Document 14) deals with radio control
           on the day.

I
    6.26   In connection with paragraph 4.11.5 of the
I          Operational Order transmissions cannot be
           cut-off unless talk-thro’ is de-selected.
!
i          Radio Equipment Supervision


I   6.27   One member of Communications Department was
           on stand-by at the ground from the briefing
I          onwards.

I   6.28   At the request of the Division the Force
I          Communications      caravan and Stonefield
           Communications     Vehicle were located at
I
I                                   103


I
I
I          Hillfoot          Bridge on Penistone Road and

I          staffed by a further 2 officers from the
           Department.          A fourth member was on mobile
!          patrol to deal with communication demands as
           they arose.
I
I   6.29   Activity on channel 19 and 25, and channel
           29,     which was being used by West Bar for

I          city centre football crowd policing was
           monitored in the communications caravan.
I          Channel         25 was monitored in the Force

I          Operations Room by using a portable UHF set
           in         a vehicle adaptor,        without any

I          difficulty.


I   6.30   The following contingency plans were in
           place in the event of equipment failure:-
I
I                A stand-by base station was located in
                 the control room. This was in fact taken
I                into use.

I                The mobile       Stonefield Communications

I                Vehicle was on stand-by at Hillfoot
                 Bridge.      If both base stations or aerial
I                installation at the ground fail then the
                 vehicle could take over. It is equipped
I                with a pump-up aerial and base station

I                and would restore communications on the


I                                      104


I
i             same    UHF channel (25).      It would take


I             about
             plus
                       i0 minutes to bring into operation
                      the journey time to the ground. In

!             the pre-match planning this year, as in
             previous years, decisions were made not
I             to park the vehicle at the ground, whilst
              on stand-by, because of congestion.
i
I             The third option available is to change
              the ground operation from channel 25 to

I             channel    19 by using the communications
              caravan   which was located at Hillfoot
i             Bridge.         This would mean that control

I             could either be from the
              using     the
                                                caravan, or
                                talk-thro’ by the police

i             control room using a portable UHF set.
              The difficulty with this option is
I             informing patrols of the channel change.

I             The caravan would not have to be moved
              because the base station/aerial site at

I             Shirecliffe gives cover at the ground.


I          VHF Cover

I   6.31   Force channel 1 was dedicated to patrols

I          operating on route supervision prior to the
           match.       This channel is controlled from
I          Force Operations Room.


I
i                                    105


I
I   6.32   A portable VHF set was used in the ground

I          control room to monitor activity on the
           Force     channel      one,      and   provide     a

I          communication link if required.

I   6.36   Following the incident both 570800 and

I          570700 became known to the public, so from
           the time the Casualty Bureau went into
I          operation 7 incoming lines were available to

I          receive public calls.

I     7.1   Weather

I           7.1.1   The    weather on Saturday 15 April 1989

I                   was      extremely good. Indeed, it was
                    probably one of the first ’Spring
I                   days’      of 1989, with a total of ii
                    hours     sunshine out of a maximum of
 I                  13-14     hours available. The air was

 I                  dry,    humidity was low and the maximum
                    temperature      recorded at the Leeds
 I                  Weather Centre was 13Oc (55°F).


 I    7.2   Stadium

 I          7.2.1   The North Stand is normally accessed

 I                  by turnstiles      numbers   77-88   on
                    Penistone Road and turnstiles 1-8 on
 I                  Leppings Lane but, on this occasion,

 I                  to      ensure segregation of opposing
                    fans, the turnstiles on Penistone Road

 I                  were closed and the turnstiles on
                    Leppings Lane were increased by two,
 I                  turnstiles i-i0 now accommodated all

  I                 spectators entering the North Stand.

I         7.2.2   The    West Stand is accessed via the
                  same     bank of turnstiles in Leppings
                  Lane     at turnstiles 9-16, but the

I                 actions of the club in increasing the
                  North      Stand       allocation     by two,
I                 effectively reduced the West Stand

I                 number to 6, with only turnstiles ii-
                  16 admitting fans into the West Stand

I                 seating area. The 7 turnstiles giving
                  admittance to spectators for the
I                 West Stand, Leppings Lane terraces


I                 are also situated in Leppings Lane,
                  they are letterered A-G and this is

I                 the normal turnstile allocation for
                  the terrace area.

                                   are      served by      five
I                 connecting gates, located at the rear


I                 of the dividing barriers, in order
                  that      spectators may move between

I                 ’pens’.


I         7.3.2   Inspector H. White (the officer in
                  charge      of     Serials     14 and 15),
I                 ensured that these 5 terrace ’pen’

I                 gates were padlocked in the ’open’
                  position.

I   7.5.6. With a      view to avoiding comment

I        prejudicial      to the Enquiry this
         background material does not seek to
I        cover the tragic events which followed
         thereafter.
I
I
I
          The entire South Yorkshire Police force
I        has been deeply involved with the tragic

I         events which occurred on Saturday 15
         April 1989.     Police officers, special

I         constables      and     civilian personnel
          involved in the operation have been
I        much       grieved     by the death    and


I        suffering which they witnessed on an
         occasion      which should have been an

I        enjoyable sporting event. Many have had
         to seek professional counselling.
I
         For those involved, memories and a deep
I        sense of sorrow will remain with them

I                               117


I
I
I
I   for     the     rest of their    lives,

I   particularly those officers who tried so
    desperately to save the lives of men,
I   women and children.


I   The    Force    extends    its   sincere

I   condolences to the relatives and loved
    ones of those who died.

    1.0      INFORMATION

I   i.I      On  Saturday 15 April 1989 Liverpool will play Nottingham
             Forest in the F.A. Cup semi final at Hillsborough. This is an
            all ticket match and a capacity crowd of 54,281 is expected.
I            Copies of tickets and stand allocation is at Appendix "C".

    I.I.i    In the event of a draw at full time 30 minutes of extra time
I   1.2
             will be played.

             F Division will be policing the match itself and the environs

I            of Hillsborough. D Division responsibilities are limited to
             the additional demands placed upon the Division by the
             arrival and departure of supporters of both clubs who wil!
             use the city centre. Both have similar red/white colours.
I   1,3      Traffic Division are assuming responsibility for all match
             traffic which will enter and leave the South Yorkshire Police
I            area. To that end each affected Division is supplying a number
             of officers to Traffic. 35 D officers will be seconded to
             Traffic on 15 April 1989. Traffic Order being produced.

I   1.3.1    The seconded officers will work from 0800 to 2000 and will be
             briefed at the Driving School, Brightside Lane at 0900 on 15
             April 1989. They, under She contro! of Traffic, will police
I            the traffic routes in D Division. D1 contro! room will
             maintain a close liaison with the traffic contro!lers.

I   1.3.2    Traffic Div 5ave undertaken the task of publicising the
             traffic routes and parkinK areas via the Press Liaison
             Department

I   1.4     The major demand on D policing resources will occur on 15
            April 1989, however past experience has shown that problems do
            occur on the evenings which precede and follow the match
I           hence the long time span of the operation.
    1.5     The majority of supporters wil! travel to Hillsborough by
I           various means on 15 April IS89, however it is likely that

             designed to maximise segregation. D1 Control room have maps
I            and will be able to advise. Private cars from Liverpool will
             be encouraged to park in the Parson Cross area and those from
             Nottingham in the Neepsend area.
I   1.7      RAIL TRAVEL


I            The Liverpool Special Train will arrive and depart from
             Wadsley-Bridge. The Special Trains from Nottingham will arrive
             and depart from Sheffield Midland. For timings and platforms
             see Appendix "’D".
I   1.7.!    There are 4 Special Trains laid on to transport supporters to
             and from Nottingham. The combined capacity of the trains is
I            2,140 in each direction. Additionally there are a number of
             service trains from Nottingham.

    ! .7.2
I            ~There is 1 Special Train laid on to transport supporters to
             and from Liverpool (into Wadsley Bridge) with a capacity of
             350. Many Liverpool supporters will travel by scheduled
             services into and out of Sheffield Midland.
I   1.7.5    Liverpool enjoys widespread support and supporters from
             all over the UK can be expected to travel into Sheffield

I            Midland on service trains. The train times from destinations
             where Liverpool are known to have a strong fo!lowing
             are shown at Appendix "D".

I   !.7.4    Supporters traveling to and from Sheffield on the Nottingham
             Special Trains will be using the North End Gate    All other
             visitors will be using the normal ticket barrier gates. See

             will be required to hive the Liverpool~nd Notts supporters
             from ~he travelling public.
I   1.7.5    Sheffield United are playing at Northampton on 15 April 1989
             and, although there are no special trains, it is probable that

I            a number will travel to and from Northampton by rail.
             The major threat will be from the Liverpool supporters whose
             hard core are..well known for causing disorder and committing
I            crime (especially snoptheft) on such occasions.
             PSV ARRANGEMENTS
I            Supporters arriving at Sheffield Midland will be transported
             to and from the ground on a dedicated fleet of SYT buses. To

I            maintain segregation different routes will be used for each
             group as follows;
             NOTTINGHAM FABS Depart from North End Gate then board SYT
I            buses in Sheaf Street. Travel to SWFC via ; SHEAF SQUARE,

              UPPERTHORPE, ALBERT TERRACE ROAD MIDDLEWOOD ROAD AND’LEPPINGS
              LANE.
              A total of 35 PSVs are available for the day. From 0930 on
              15.4.89 6 will be parked at each exit. The remainder will
              be stacked on East Bank Road and will be called up by the SYT
 I    J. 3
              Inspector on duty at the Midland Station when required.


 ~            The fare is 100p return and fans will know of this before
              arriving at Sheffield. They will receive a yellow return
              ticket on boarding which will speed the return loading. Each
              vehicle will hold 80 passengers.

              2 officers will accompany each PSV and, once they have
              dropped their passengers, the officers will return        to
              Sheffield Midland for another load. Officers arriving at SWFC
 I            after 2:45pm will not return but will report to the Gym at
              SWFC and re form into serials to act as a reserve.

|5            After the match the same procedure will be adopted to
              return the fans to Sheffield Midland. The serials will
              accompany the same groups as the inward journey. Once fans

 i            are inside the station then officers may be required to
              return on the empty PSVs for return loads.
             After the match Liverpool fans will load in Penistone Road
             North from Wardsend Road North to Leppings Lane roundabout.
             Nottingham fans will load in Pensitone Road North outside the
             ground facing city.

|o           Buses returning with Liverpool fans will return via St Mary’s
             Road, enter the one way system and then Fornham Street.

 I           Serials 1 - 2 will be deployed.~-to line the parking area to
             ensure that no one dis embarks. The buses ~i!l unload one
             as a time. SYT drivers have been briefed.

 !           Buses returning with Nottingham fans will approach the
             Sheffield Midland from Sheaf Street. Serials 3 - 4 wi!!          be
             4ep!oyed to line the arriva! area to ensure that orly one PSV
 I           at a time dis embarks. The fans wi!! enter thorough the North
             End Gate.


 !           It is imperative that buses do not travel in convoy and that
             only one bus at a time (the lead bus) either loads or unloads.
             This will assist the searching serials at the ground and will
             assist with segregation at the Sheffield Midland.
!            Supporters (mainly from Nottingham ) will be arriving and
             departing on service coaches at Pond Street. Serials 17 - 18

                      Penistone Road. Serial 19 will patrol the area after the
                      match until all PSVs have passed that point.
I       1.13,1        The bus station is new and the serials deployed there wi!l
                      familiarise themselves with the layout and relevant platforms.

                                             MAJOR INCIDENT
I    DEFINITION

I   A major incident is defined as a serious disruption of life, arising with little or no warning,
    causing or threatening death or injury to numbers of people in excess of those that can be dealt          ¯ XR 200


I   with by the public services operating under normal conditions and which require special mobil-
    isation and organisation of those services.

                              OBJECTIVES OF THE MAJOR INCIDENT PLAN
I   It is impossible to cater for every contingency which might arise in a major incident situation.
                                                                                                              XR 201
    The Major Incident Plan, therefore, contains a basic format on which all major incidents should

I   be based.

    Whilst setting out basic principles and responsibilities to be adhered to, it also allows for flexibil-

I   ity and initiative in the prevailing circumstances.

I                     BASIC PRINCIPLES OF MAJOR INCIDENT OPERATIONS


I   The initial objectives of all services involved in a major incident are:-                            XR 202

I        (a)
         (b)
                To ensure that those who can assist, get to the scene as soon as possible.
                To safeguard all persons and property from further danger.

I        (c)
         (d)
         (e)
                To release casualties from the wreckage as soon as possible.
                To quickly and accurately assess and treat injuries.
                To transport casualties to hospital with the minimum of delay.
         (f)
I        (g)
         (h)
                To provide prompt and skilled treatment on arrival at hospital.
                To inform the relatives of casualties of their condition and whereabouts.
                To re-establish normal Conditions as soon as possible.

I   These objectives cannot be met by any one service. A major incident will invariably require the
    full involvement of all three primary emergency services - ie police, fire and ambulance. These
    serviceswill be supported by the local authority and a number of other agencies.
I   To deal effectively with a major incident there must be a common policy and a complete under-        XR 203
    standing between all three services. This will necessitate:-

I         i.    The establishment of lines of control and communication at the earliest
                possible stage.

I         ii.
         iii.
                The establishment of liaison between all services for effective co-ordination.
                The provision of facilities to enable each service to operate to maximum
                efficiency.

I        iv.    The co-ordination of requests for, and allocation of resources in order of
                priority.


I   The overall control and co-ordination of the effort of all the services involved in dealing with a
    major incident is a POLICE responsibility.

                                                   THE ALERT


          Initial notification that a large scale emergency may have occurred within the Force area may        XR 209

I        come to the police by various means. Whether it comes from Air Traffic Control, British Rail,
         Fire Control, from a patrolling officer, a member of the public or any other source, it is possible
         that the available information may not immediately indicate the exact extent of the incident.

I        It is imperative that no delay should arise while confirmation or further information is being
         sought, but action must be taken immediately on whatever information is available. Circum-
         stances will soon indicate if a large scale response is not required.
I        If notification is received, the information must be passed immediately to the Force Operations
         Room who will alert the other emergency services that a major incident may have occurred and
I        that the police are implementing the "Major Incident" plan.

         The recognised codeword between the emergency services is:-
I                                              "CATASTROPHE"

                                  FIRST POLICE OFFICER AT THE SCENE


        The first police officer at the scene will be faced with enormous demands and his initial reaction   XR 211
        may well be to render assistance to survivors. This temptation must be resisted if co-ordinated
        rescue plans are to be brought into operation.

        The following guidelines may be most effective in the circumstances:-

I   NOTE: IF A MAJOR INCIDENT OCCURS ON A MOTORWAY, THE FOLLOWING NOTES
    DO NOT APPLY. PLEASE REFER TO THE SECTION ON "MOTORWAY ACCIDENTS".

I    If a major incident occurs within the Force area, elsewhere than on the motorway, police              XR 216
    personnel at the site of the incident will be working to their normal local radio control using
I   personal UHF sets. It would be wrong for Operations Room to seek to take over the direction of
    operations at the site, although circumstances may make this desirable in the later stages, in order
    to allow sub-divisions to carry on with normal policing.
I   The RESPONSIBILITIES of the OPERATIONS ROOM are:-


I        (a}    to ensure that the necessary action is taken in respect of special safety measures
                demanded by the circumstances of the incident;


I        (b)    to alert the emergency services and other authorities and departments whose
                facilities and expertise will be needed;


I       (c)

        (d)
                to deal with the possible Forcewide problem of traffic congestion;

                to direct the Forcewide deployment of manpower and equipment.

    From the information obtained the officer in charge of Force Operations Room must decide
    whether to implement the Major Incident Plan. The only advice that can be offered in making the

    the first officer at the scene. Having decided to implement the plan, the following action should
    be taken :-

I                        DUTIES OF OTHER SUB-DIVISIONAL CONTROL ROOMS

I       On being informed that a major incident has occurred on another sub-division the following XR 231
        action will be taken:-
I       1    LOCATION OF MAJOR INCIDENT

I           Consider the location of the incident and what routes between that site and hospitals, mor-
            tuaries, fire stations, etc. are likely to be used. The vital junctions along these routes, par-
            ticularly those close to hospitals must be manned. (See SECTION 20.)
I           Consider whether the proximity of the site will affect any road or ground within the sub-
            division and take the appropriate action.

I           Where the incident occurs on a MOTORWAY the sub-divisional control will deploy available
            personnel to man the motorway diversionary routes and ensure that the relevant signs are

I           displayed. This must receive the highest priority.



I           HOSPITALS

            Send officers to the casualty departments of affected hospitals to assist in control of traffic

I           and crowds.

            able manpower to their respective sub-divisional stations to form a reserve. ClD officers will
I           also form part of this reserve. Operations Room may call upon this reserve to be deployed
            anywhere in the Force area and the necessary transport should be arranged.

I       4   ADD ITIONAL MANPOWER


I           Sub-divisions may need to call out off’duty personnel and special constables in order to
            meet their commitments. Records should be keot of which officers are deployed where.

I        INSTRUCTION CARD - PARKING ARRANGEMENTS


I       The indiscriminate parking of vehicles will cause serious problems at the site and may well
        obstruct rescue and fire fighting operations. The proper marshalling and disposal of all vehicles
                                                                                                          XR 242

        not actively being employed for fire fighting, rescue or ambulance purposes is vital and will be
I       given immediate attention when the police first arrive at the scene.

        The aim is to establish separate parking areas for police, fire and ambulance vehicles. Each
l       parking area should be located preferably off the roadway but on the approach route to the site
        and convenient for personnel to park their vehicles and report to the Police Incident Post, Fire
        Control Point or Ambulance Control Point before entering the site. Each area must be suf-
l       ficiently large to enable vehicles to turn around. Ambulances will also park prior to the driver
        being summoned to the Ambulance Loading Area to receive casualties and obviously it is more
        important that the Ambulance Parking Area should be more conveniently located than the Police

l       Police Parking Area.

        Parking will need to be supervised to ensure that available space is sensibly utilised and it may be    XR 243

l       practicable for ignition keys to be left with the vehicle or with the member of the service in
        charge of that parking area.


I        It can be anticipated that continual use will cause parking surfaces to deteriorate, particularly if
        the weather conditions are bad. At an early stage arrangements will have to be made to reinforce
        parking surfaces with hard core, gravel, grit or timber. Since these arrangements may take some
        time it is imperative that this need should be anticipated.
I       The parking areas will need to be well signed and particular attention given to indicating their
        position on the approaches.
i       Parking areas may need to be illuminated.


I       Although a member of the service will remain at the entrance to the parking area to supervise
        vehicles and give information, the responsibility for establishing the parking areas and marshalling
        vehicles rests with the police.

I    INSTRUCTION CARD - TRAFFIC ROUTES AT SITE


I   Traffic at the scene travelling to and from the site and between the parking areas, loading points, XR 245
    etc. should be marshalled to adopt routes which cause the minimum interference with other
    routes. Where routes do meet it will be necessary to establish control by a police officer
I   performing traffic duty, although as soon as possible police officers should be replaced by
    civilians or by mechanical apparatus. Although in the initial stages traffic routes at the site will
    have been one of the priority tasks of the police, it is likely that traffic will soon have adopted a
I   workable flow pattern in and around the site and the need for police to actively marshall traffic
    will diminish. Routes may need to be signed using sign boards, cones, roadlamps, tape, rope, etc.


I   Lighting will be required if operations may continue during darkness and it is important that
    arrangements are made in advance if emergency equipment is to be available ready for when it is
    needed.

I   It can be anticipated that continual use will cause routes and standing areas to deteriorate, par-
    ticularly if the weather conditions are bad. At an early stage arrangements will have to be made
                                                                                                          XR 246


I   to reinforce routes and standing areas with hard core, gravel, grit or timber. Since these arrange-
    ments may take some time it is imperative that this need should be anticipated.


I   The terrain might be such that a bulldozer could improve parts of the route.

    Routes must be kept clear of parked or broken down vehicles and arrangements should be made

I   to bring the necessary towing vehicles, tractors, breakdown equipment, mechanics, towing gear,
    etc. to the scene via sub-divisional control or Force Operations Room.

    A regular inspection and supervision of routes at and around the scene will be necessary.

I   INSTRUCTION CARD - POLICE INCIDENT POST

i   PURPOSE

    The Police Incident Post should be established so that it can service and control the entire
    incident. Initially the post is likely to be a motor vehicle but as additional personnel arrive at the
I   scene the post should be staffed and moved if necessary to fulfil the following roles:-

         (a)    Location of the Site Commander and his staff.
I        (b)    The Administration Office for police at the site, which will include:-
                  (i) Personnel office - to record the arrival, deployment and departure of

I                      police staff.
                 (ii) Communications office -- to maintain permanent contact with sub-
                       divisional control, Force Operations Room and other service commanders.

I               (iii) Equipment office - to obtain and record the arrival and disposal of stores
                       and equipment for use at the site.

         (c)
I   LOCATION
               The information centre for all police activity.

                                                                                                             XR 249

I   The decision as to the location of the Police Incident Post should be taken in consultation with
    the senior fire and ambulance officers at the scene to ensure that the total layout of the site is
    compatible with the requirements of all services. If circumstances should indicate that the initial
I   locations are wrong, they must be corrected.

    The Police Incident Post should be located well clear of operations in a prominent place near the
I   roadway forming the approach route to the site. Ideally it should be in the proximity of Fire
    Control Point and Ambulance Control Point but not so close as to affect radio reception.


I   {n considering where to establish the Police li~:ident Post attention should be given to the pos-
    sibility of locating nearby the Welfare and Assembly Centre, Lost and Found Property Office and
    the Police Parking Area.

I   The best place for the Police Incident Post is in a building having furniture, heating, lighting,
    toilets, telephones, etc.


I   Force Operations Room will have sent the mobile police station to the scene and this vehicle has
    the necessary office equipment if no building is available and is distinctive and well signed. It
    should be utilised as part of the Police Incident Post in addition to any building. At the very start

I   of the incident Force Operations Room wil! direct a Traffic Department vehicle to the site and
    this should be used pending the arrival of the mobile police station to provide radio commun-
    ication with Force Operations Room.

I        SIGNS

         The effectiveness of the Police Incident Post will depend considerably on how prominently it is XR 251
         located and how well it is signed. Sub-divisional control and Operations Room will broadcast
I        details of its location to personnel at the site and such messages may need to be repeated. Every
         effort should be made via sub~livisional control to obtain the necessary signs. It is particularly
         important that the route from the Police Parking Area to Police Incident Post be well marked and
I        while signs are being erected officers should be deployed to direct persons arriving at the site.

         COMMUNICATIONS
I        The necessary personal, telephone or radio links with Fire and Ambulance Control Points, the XR 252
         Assembly and Welfare Centre, Force Operations Room, sub-divisional control and Casualty

I        Enquiry Bureau should be established. Force Operations Room will call out the Communications
         Officer to provide all possible assistance. Sub-divisional control will send any additional personal
         radios to the Police Incident Post.

I       As far as possible communications between Police Incident Post and other positions should beby
        telephone where the message is a request for equipment, information, etc. This will leave the

I       radio clear for urgent messages, broadcasts, deployment of personnel, traffic regulation, etc.

        Officers in charge of teams carrying out tasks at the site should be equipped with radios to com-

I       municate with the Police Incident Post. Other key personnel at the site, including the site medical
        officer and commanders of other services will each be assisted by a police officer who will be
        responsible for dealing with communications.

I       EQUIPMENT                                                                                             XR 253

        The sub-divisional major incident box will have been sent immediately to the Police Incident Post
I       by sub-divisional control. Force Operations Room will have arranged for the Force Major
         Incident Box to be sent from Headquarters. Other sub-divisions will send their major incident
        boxes if requested. The contents of the boxes are shown in Section 25. The mobile police station
I       ~ontains a great dea! of office equipment and-maps.

        Sub-divisional control and Force Operations Room will be sending equipment to the site either

I       on their own initiative or as ~equested by the Site Commander.

        It is likely that much of the equipment will be only partly used or not immediately required. All

I       such spare equipment should be stored and supervised near to the Police Incident Post so that it
        is readily available when needed.

     ADMINISTRATIVE TASKS
I    The following tasks should be dealt with by personnel at the Police Incident Post:-
                                                                                                          XR 254




I         (a)   Maintain a log of the incident. This should be in chronological order, giving
                details of problems, conferences, decisions, action taken, persons concerned, res-
                ponsibilities of particular persons, identity of prominent personalities and times
I               of arrival at site, etc.

          (b)   Maintain record of police officers present at site, tj~eir hours of duty, postings,
I               etc. Care should be taken to ensure that the record includes ALL officers, as
                there will be cases when an officer - eg an off-duty officer - attends the site
                without first reporting to the Post. Arrange reliefs as appropriate. Anticipate

I               what manpower and related equipment might be required at future stages of the
                incident.


I        (c)    Maintain record of personal radios, telephone numbers of other method of com-
                munication with particular police officers or other persons, points or areas at the
                site. Organise any necessary redistribution of radios and batteries. Sub-divisional

I        (d)
                control can assist.

                Prepare a plan of the site, showing the location of Police Incident Post, parking
                areas, salient features, high risk areas, etc.
I        (e)    Maintain record of police vehicles at the site, officers bringing them, station
                where garaged. It may be expedient for the Police Incident Post to retain
I               possession of vehicle keys. Police Incident Post staff may organise transport
                leaving the site to return vehicles and officers to their originating stations.

I        (f)    Maintain a record of all equipment at site, including its use and whereabouts so
                that such equipment can be quickly located if necessary.

I    INSTRUCTION CARD -- SITE SECURITY


I    For reasons of safety, security or in the interests of proper investigation, it is extremely impor- XR 258
     tant that no unauthorised person should be allowed to enter or remain within the site area. This

I    is particularly so in the case of crashed military aircraft incidents, in relation to which the police
     have a duty to guard the site and any wreckage until relieved of that responsibility by the
     military authorities.

I    The task of sealing off the vicinity of the site TO VEHICLES is the responsibility of Force
     Operations Room using Traffic Department and other personnel.

I    The task of clearing the site and preventing access TO PEDESTRIANS is one of the respon-
     sibilities of the Site Commander and the swift deployment of sufficient personnel to accomplish
     this task may save a great deal of effort and manpower beiny used at a later stage.
I    Loudhailers and public address equipment will be useful.


I    It will be necessary to tape or rope off the limits of the site, placing barriers at roadways and v.ul- XR 259
     nerable points.


I    Suitable signs prohibiting access or warning of danger if appropriate should be placed.

     It will be necessary to man the points in the perimeter through which the routes for emergency

I    vehicles pass and post officers to suitable points around the boundary.

     It may be appropriate to arrange that the perimeter of the area prohibited to unauthorised pedes-

I    trians should correspond with that prohibited to traffic and thereby reduce the need for barriers,
     personnel, etc. This will depend on the topography of the site and may not be practicable.


I    In addition to preventing access and guarding the perimeter of the site it will be necessary to XR 260
     patrol areas of the site to deal with persons who have gained access. It may also be expedient to
     mount guard over particular places, wreckage, bodies, property, etc. within the site to prevent
     .interference from persons properly present at the site.
I                                                  -o_


     Consideration should be given to the need to equip persons engaged on security tasks with pro-
     tective clothing, torches, etc..
I    Dog handlers wil! be uiefully employed on such duty.

I    INSTRUCTION CARD -- MEDICAL ARRANGEMENTS AT SITE


    The officers responsible for police action relating to medical arrangements must ensure the XR 262
I   smooth working of the arrangements outlined below, with particular attention to facilitating the
    loading and despatch of ambulances according to the medical priorities of casualties. It would be
    wrong for the police to become involved in giving first aid to the relatively less injured instead
I   of carrying out the more vital responsibility.

    In particular every effort should be made to ensure that ambulance crews are able to load the
I   priority patients rather than the relatively slightly injured. In a very short period sufficient
    vehicles will be available at the scene to transport all the injured to hospitals throughout the
    region.

I   In the event of a major incident occurring, the ambulance service will send ambulances to the
    scene, all of which will be in radio contact with Ambulance Control whether or not they

I   normally operate in the South Yorkshire area. Ambulance crews will be under the control of a
    senior ambulance officer at the site.


I   One or more medical teams, suitably equipped, may be sent to the site by the hospitals to assist XR 263
    in the treatment of casualties and to advise the ambulance service which casualties need priority
    for removal to hospital. It is anticipated that circumstances will indicate that casualties should be

I   removed to hospital rather than being treated at the scene.

    One of the hospitals will send a doctor to be the ’Site Medical Officer’ in charge of medical
    arrangements at the site. Until his arrival, the senior ambulance service officer will act as Site
I   Medical Officer, supported by whatever medical expertise is available. The Site Medical Officer
    shouid be accompanied by a constable equipped with personal radio in contact with Sub-
    Divisional Control. When the UHF station is set up at the site, the Site Medical Officer should be
I   accompanied by a police officer equipped with a portable radio on that local frequency. This will
    provide a link between him and the Site Commander.


I   The Site Commander in consultation with thesenior officers of the other emergency services at XR 264
    the scene, will have indicated the proposed location of an ’Ambulance Parking Area’. Police
    action necessary for organising the Ambulance Parking Area and directing ambulances to it will
I   be taken by the police ’Parking Arrangements’ team but for the sake of clarity details are set out
    there. The Ambulance Parking Area should be on the route being taken by ambulances
    approaching the site and the police should create sufficient space for ambulances to enter, park

I   and leave. Whether this will best be on a series of routes along which the police can create a one
    way system or on open ground, will depend on the location of the incident. The police will need
    to indicate to ambulances the location of this area until it can be signed, and direct ambulances

I   to it. Ambulance Control will broadcast this location via ambulance radio.

    The Site Commander, in consultation with the senior officers of the other emergency services at XR 265

I   the scene, will have indicated the proposed location of the ’Ambulance Loading Area’. This will
    be in a safe place accessible to ambulances and to the rescue parties bringing casualties to it. The
    police will have to clear sufficient space for the ambulances to attend, load up and depart. There

I   must be additional space for the less serious casualties to await transport, and shelter is obviously
    an important factor. If requested by the ambulance service, the police will do what they can to
    establish communications between the Ambulance Loading Area and the Ambulance Parking
    Area.

     In the vicinity of the Ambulance Loading Area, casualties awaiting transport will be receiving XR 265
I    first aid treatment from the medical teams, ambulance personnel, fire service personnel and
     perhaps other trained persons who have volunteered their services.


!    The police will assist in equipping this area by obtaining via Sub-Divisional Control any necessary XR 266
     resources such as lighting, blankets, first aid equipment, etc. The amount of these resources will
     depend on how long the incident is likely to extend before all casualties can be removed to

I    hospital. It is anticipated that the medical authorities will normally have sufficient resources of
     their own.


!     It is not intended that documentation of casualties should take place prior to their removal to
     hospital. It may be that uninjured persons who were involved in the incident will accompany
     their injured friends to the Ambulance Loading Area. Such persons should be discouraged from
     congregating there and instead be marshalled to the Assembly and Welfare Centre (established by
I    another of the police teams) where they willl be cared for.

      INSTRUCTION CARD - ASSEMBLY AND WELFARE OF PERSONS INVOLVED
I
      The action indicated below may require radical adjustment dependent on the circumstances of         XR269

I     the particular incident and is suggested for general guidance only.

      There may be present at or near the site a number of persons who were involved but are not

I     injured or who have been treated at the scene, witnesses and persons temporarily displaced by
      rescue operations or safety measures. So that their welfare requirements can be attended to and
      so that they may be quickly re-united with their friends, families and property, an effort should

I     be made to marshall all such persons to an Assembly and Welfare Centre.

      LOCATION

I    The Centre should be in a safe place, out of the way of operations but not far from the site,
     ideally in the vicinity of the Police Incident Post. As soon as possible arrangements should be
     made to remove such persons from the scene to a police station or other suitable place. However,
I    arrangements as to documentation and persons reported missing will need to be made wherever
     the location of the welfare accommodation may be.


I    ACCOMMODATION                                                                                        XR 270

     The most comfortable and convenient place. It may be that more than one building, PSV or place
I    will need to be used. Shelter, warmth, toilets and catering should be considered.

     SIGNS

I    The location of the Centre at the site should be broadcast by Force Operations Room and Sub-
     Divisional Control as soon as it is established and arrangements to provide signs for it will be

I    made via Sub-Divisional Control where necessary.

     It may be appropriate to publish details of the Assembly and Welfare Centre to the site by using

I    leudhailers or public address equipment. ..-_.

     PERSONS REPORTED MISSING

I    Enquiries should be made of Casualty Enquiry Bureau, if practicable by the person from whom
     the enquiry originates. Casualty Enquiry Bureau may be contacted by telephone using the
     number supplied by Force Operations Room.
I    DOCUMENTATION                                                                                        XR 271

I    Using stationery available from the major incident boxes, full details should be taken of all
     persons attending the Centre, including whether or not they were involved or witnessed the
     incident, their exact location at the time of the incident, etc. Casualty Record Forms should be
I    completed in respect of persons injured and details telephoned to Casualty Enquiry Bureau as
     soon as possible using the number supplied by Force Operations Room. Details of persons
     involved but uninjured should also be given to Casualty Enquiry Bureau. it might be practicable

I    to obtain witness statements.

I    A lost and found property office will be established at the Assembly and Welfare Centre where
     details of property lost or found will be ~corded and property stored using the books, bags and

     set up near the Police Incident Post and the officer in charge of that office will arrange for
     property to be collected from the Assembly and Welfare Centre.

I    Radio and telephone communications will be needed to make the necessary welfare arrangements
     and provide equipment for the Centre. It may be feasible to have a ’runner’ system operating
     between the Assembly and Welfare Centre and the Police Incident Post.

I    TRANSPORT


I    Police vehicles may be usefully employed to collect up persons and to transport property and
     equipment. Longer term arrangements for the dispersal of these persons from the site will be
     made via Sub-Divisional Control or Force Operations Room as appropriate.

I    A Lost and Found Property Office will be established near to the Police Incident Post where XR 274
     enquiries and property will be dealt with as at any police station, using the books, labels,
     envelopes, etc. contained in the major incident boxes.

I    A senior police officer will be responsible for arrangements and for the safe custody of the prop-
     erty. He will also supervise the lost and found property offices at the Assembly and Welfare

I    Centre and any of the Refreshment Points and arrange to remove property handed in at these
     places to the custody of,the main Lost and Found Property Office at the site.


I    Articles of property may provide evidence material to the investigation and vital to the iden- XR 275
     tification of victims so particular attention must be paid to obtaining exact details of the place
     where they were found.

I    Articles subject of customs and excise involved in air-crashes may be handed over to Customs and
     Excise officials.

I    Particular attention should be paid to articles which might be mail in transit.

     At a later stage a search of the site will be organised and the officer in charge of Lost and Found
I    Property Office will detail personnel to accompany the searchers and deal with property found.

     When the decision is made to discontinue the Lost and Found Property Office at the site the
I    property will be taken to the local sub-divisional headquarters.

            INSTRUCTION CARD - PRESS LIAISON
    I       Any major incident will attract a great deal of press activity at the site and it is important that
                                                                                                                XR 277
            liaison between police and representatives of the press is quickly established so that information
    I       can be made available through authorised channels. Otherwise some people may act irresponsibly
            by seeking to give or receive information individually.

    I      The Force Press Liaison Department will contact the news media via normal channels and arrange
           for a press conference, addressed by one of the Chief Officers, to take place at a stated time at
           Police Headquarters. Subsequent similar press conferences will take place there at regular stated

    I      times.

           The Site Commander will depute a senior officer assisted by press liaison department personnel

    I      to be responsible for dealing with the press at the site. Officers so designated will wear the ’Police
           Press’ armbands contained in the major incident boxes. Members of the press have been
           instructed to look for this identification.


.
    I       it is vital that emergency measures at the site should not be hampered by the activities of
           irresponsible members of the press or public. Members of the press are not entitled to enter the
                                                                                                                XR 278
           area to which the police are restricting unauthorised pedestrian access. Where, however, it is clear
    I      that emergency measures would not be jeopardised, the police will give every assistance to enable
           accredited members of the press to do their work.

    I      If possible representatives of the press at the size shou Id be dealt with collectively and given infor-
           mation and facilities including:-

    I           (a)
                (b)
                        the essential facts of the incident avoiding any statement as to causes;
                        the arrangements that have been made for the press conference at Force
                        Headquarters;
    I           (c)     facilities to televise and photograph appropriate areas of the site.

          The details of any information released at the site must be telephoned to Force Operations Room

    I     fo~ general distribution to the press.         .:L
                                                                                                                      XR 279


           It may be possible for the police to arrange for witnesses to be made available to the press con-

    I     ference at Force Headquarters~

           In the event of any incident happening on private property, facilities for the press should be by

    I     agreement with the owner’s representative. In the case of railway property, this will probably be
          the senior British Transport Police officer present.


    I     Enquiries on technical matters may be referred direct by the police, as appropriate, to such estab-
          lishments as the Atomic Energy Authority, the Central Electricity Generating Board, or relevant
          government or other department.

          So that a proper investigation can be made of the cause of the incident it is vital that the scene

    dangerous, in cases involving military equipment the taking of photographs may be against the XR 280
I   interests of security. For these reasons it is clear that as far as practicable all persons should be
    prevented from taking photographs at the site.

I   Police action at the scene of the incident will lead to the clearing of the site of all unauthorised
    persons including members of the press. As soon as possible, however, every facility will be
    afforded to such authorised representatives of the press and television as the senior officer
I   responsible for liaison with the press deems appropriate in the circumstances of the incident.

    It will clearly be less disruptive to emergency services working at the site if arrangements could be   XR281

I   made with the press that representatives take photographs as a party at a particular time rather
    than indiscriminately.


I   A crashed military aircraft is a ’prohibited place’ within the meaning of the Official Secrets Act
    and in relation to such incidents, press photographers and television and film cameramen wishing
    to photograph or film wreckage should be invited in the interests of security voluntarily to

I   refrain from doing so until the appropriate service personnel have examined the scene of the
    accident and covered or removed any classified material. If, however, they are not prepared to
    comply with such a request, they should be permitted to take photographs or films provided this

I   does not involve disturbance to the wreckage, interfere with rescue work or the observance of
    any safety precautions in force at the time, or create an additional fire hazard by the use of flash
    bu Ibs or electronic flashes near to free gasolene vapou r.

I   Before they leave the scene of the accident, however, the police should take their names, XR282
    addresses and telephone numbers, and those of the newspaper, agency or television or film
    company which they represent. This information should be given to the senior member of the
I   Service ’Crash Party’ on arrival who will thereafter be responsible for reporting as necessary direct
    to the Ministry of Defence.


I   Where the accident involves USAF and RCAF aircraft, then until members of the USAF or
    RCAF arrive a similar procedure to that outlined in the previous paragraph should be carried out
    but the information obtained should be passed to the USAF or RCAF authorities on their arrival.
I   Persons other than authorised representatives of the press, television, police and appropriate
    services, should be reminded that a crashed service aircraft is a ’prohibited place’ within the

I   meaning of the Official Secrets Act, and if photographs are taken before approval has been given
    by the senior member of the Service "Crash Party’, the photographer will be required to hand
    over the camera or negatives to the police.

I   INSTRUCTION CARD - SEARCH OF SCENE


I   As soon as it is safe and practicable to do so, and bearing in mind the needs of investigation, the XR 285
    police should liaise with the other services and organise a full scale search of the scene to ensure
    that all casualties have been found, all sources of danger properly disposed of, and all bodies, high
    value property and equipment are located and properly dealt with.
I   It is imperative that persons undertaking the search are properly equipped and briefed that they
    must not move or touch anything unnecessarily but should report anything they find to the
I   medical teams or the teams of police officers detailed to deal with bodies, property, etc., who
    will accompany the search. The searchers should be warned of any areas into which they should
    not go for reasons of safety and security.
I   The search must be carefully supervised with all personnel divided into teams headed by officers XR 286
    responsible for searching specified areas of the site. Each team leader should prepare a plan of the

I   area of-~search for which he is responsible and note on it anything found. These plans will be
    handed to the officer in overall command of the search as they are completed.


I   It is envisaged that use will be made of fully trained exhibits officers from the Criminal
    Investigation Department. He could use the Record of Exhibits Book provided for the purpose,
    and ensure fu II continuity shou Id this be necessary for evidential purposes.

I      INSTRUCTION CARD - FATALITIES

       The officer in charge of duties relating to the dead should consult the section of the Major XR 287
I      Incident Scheme Manual "Fatalities’. He should ensure that a reconnaissance is made of the site to
       obtain information as to how many dead bodies are involved, their whereabouts and whether any
       special problems arise because of dismemberment, contamination, etc. If necessary, this officer
I      will get Force Operations Room to send Police Surgeons to the scene. When an accurate overall
       assessment of the problems has been made details should be given to the Site Commander.


I     The Site Commander will consult with the Coroner and Force Operations Room as to what
      arrangements should be made with regard to bodies and parts of bodies at the site. Circumstances
      will indicate whether they should be left in situ pending necessary viewing by a pathologist as

I     part of the investigation. When it is decided that the bodies should be removed whether from the
      site or to a central point prior to being moved elsewhere, they will first be labelled, photographed
      and their position, condition and location recorded in accordance with the procedure set out

I     below. -.

      The ’body book’ contained in the major incident box will be used in connection with this task. XR288

I     A plan of the site should be prepared.

      Sufficient stocks of books, labels, string, bags, stretchers, markers, hammers, stakes, etc. should
I     be obtained.

      Selected officers will be formed into one or more teams equipped with protective clothing. A
I     photographer should accompany each team.

      One senior officer in charge will alone be responsible for allocating a number for each body or
l     part found at the site and recording its position on the site plan. The team will label the body and
      related property and mark the location before taking the necessary action to remove it to await
      transportation from the site.

I     A senior officer will be responsible to the Site Commander for transport arrangements and will XR 289
      obtain confirmation from Force Operations Room that the proposed destination is suitable

i     5efore authorising removal of each body fron4the s{te. Transport will be arranged via Operations

I    INSTRUCTION CARD - INCIDENT INVESTIGATION


I   Once it is safe to do so and before any evidence is lost or disturbed it may be desirable at an early XR 291
    stage to commence obtaining photographic evidence at the site and to record salient information
    which will be needed for subsequent investigations and report purposes. This may include an
    estimate of damage and if necessary a surveyor should be contacted.
i   Expert investigators will attend the site of air and rail accidents but their arrival may be delayed
    and the needs of the investigation may demand urgent action. However, if circumstances permit
I   it will be better to await the arrival of expert investigators before carrying out any sort of
    inspection of wreckage and great care should be taken not to disturb any wreckage or other
    evidence which may not be meaningful to police but which is significant to expert investigators.
I   Officers should be nominated to liaise with each of the experts during their investigations.

     it will be valuable if a tour is made of the site area using a tape-recorder to record impressions XR 292

I   and salient details. Binoculars may be useful to view contaminated areas or parts where access is
    difficult. The scale of the incident might suggest that a helicopter should be used to do aerial
    reconnaissance and obtain aerial photographs of the site. A plan drawer will be sent to the site

I   and if practicable he should accompany the officer concerned in order that he may produce a
    rough working plan if appropriate and include on any plan details of significance. As well as iden-
    tifying relevant material evidence, ultimate positions, extent of damage, etc., evidence should be

I   considered which might indicate speed, direction travelled, wind direction, obstruction to view,
    etc.

    it is essential that the Site Commander is kept informed of significant evidence obtained which
I   may require to be preserved by taking special measures.

    Details should be obtained of all police, fire and ambulance and civilian personnel who may be
I   witnesses in relation to the incident.

    in consultation with the Site Commander, the liaison officer will arrange for officers at the site to
I   be relieved of duty in order to take refreshments. Dependent upon the feeding arrangements
    made, it may be necessary for officers to be transported to a nearby police station for more sub-
    stantial refreshments.
I    It is better to locate refreshment points at different locations rather than one central point,
    although a central refreshment centre will be needed near the Assembly and Welfare Centre and
I   the Police Incident Post.

    Refreshment points shou Id be signed.

I   The Liaison Officer should make provision at each refreshment point for:-                               XR 294


I        (a)

                providing minor first aid to persons working on the site;

I        (d)    supplying small items of equipment.

    It may be expedient to do this using one or more police vehicles, which will provide accom-

I   modation for equipment, property and stationery as well as giving communications and emer-
    gency transport facilities.

     (Motorways and Multiple Accidents)

I   The ’Vehicle Clearance Officer’ is responsible to the Site Commander for all matters relating to XR 298
    vehicles AT THE SITE which are actually involved. He will nominate, instruct and supervise
    teams of officers in the recording of vehicles and drivers involved. These teams will also search
I   vehicles and deal with property found in or forming part of them; such property being placed in
    suitable bags and labelled prior to storage. When vehicles have been searched, a label indicating
    that this has been done will be completed and affixed to the vehicle. (The property bags,
I   property tie-on labels and ’searched vehicles’ gummed labels are in major incident boxes and
    should be collected together with the ’Vehicle Record Book’ and the ’Vehicle Clearance Officer’
    armband.) The ’Vehicle Clearance Officer’ will not normally approve the removal from the scene

I   until the vehicle has been colour photographed and where necessary, searched and labelled.

    The Vehicle Clearance Officer will consult Accident Investigation Branch officers and Ministry

I   Examiners on their arrival regarding the question of inspection and removal of vehicles from the
    scene.

    If a Casualty Enquiry Bureau has been activated, the Vehicle Clearance Officer should, as soon as
I   practicable, notify the Bureau of the make, colour and, if possible the registration number of the
    vehicles involved.

!   Drivers of civilian breakdown vehicles will be instructed to report to the Police Incident Post on
    their arrival. The ’Vehicle Clearance Officer" should designate officers to receive these drivers and
    direct them and their vehicles to a convenient place on the motorway clear of the main crash area
I   until their services are required by the ’Vehicle Clearance Officer’.

    The ’Vehicle Clearance Officer’ will maintain a composite record of the details of despatch and
I   disposal of all vehicles at the scene in accordance with the ’Vehicle Record Book’.

      (Motorways and Multiple Accidents)

I    It is expected that if a major incident occurs on a motorway there will be a large number of XR 298
     vehicles involved and it will be necessary to set up one or more ’Recovered Vehicles Areas’ to
     which all broken down, accident damaged, etc. vehicles will be removed from the scene along
I    with other vehicles required to be stored for safe-keeping or inspection. The Vehicle Pound
     Officer will obtain the Vehicle Pound Book and the ’Recovered Vehicles Area’ signs from the

                       vision will be necessary to ensure that routes are kept clear for emergency vehicles.
I              (b)     During daylight hours, where traffic problems are likely to be greater, the use of
                       Police motorcycles for supervision of routes should be considered. Such vehicles
!                      have obvious advantages for many purposes - eg dispatch.

               ESCORT DUTIES
I             ¯ Where civilian vehicles have been employed as ambulances and life is in danger, Police
                vehicle escort will be undertaken.

I             One mobile will be directed to the site, the crew will be responsible for establishing a tem-
              porary base station. This can be achieved by utilising the VHF/UHF repeater radio. UHF
              Channel 25 should be used and communication to Operations Room will be on Force

I     4
              Channel 2. A telephone link should be established if possible.

              TRANSPORTATION OF MAJOR INCIDENT BOXES

I             On receipt of instructions from Operations Room, will transport the Force major incident
              boxes from Force Headquarters to the site.

I             SECURITY OF THE SITE

              Together with other available personnel will seal off the site for reasons of safety, security,
I             or in the interests of the investigation. Such action will be carried out under the direction of
              Operations Room.


I     6       TRANSPORT

              The supply of suitable transport (including drivers where available) for persons, property or

!             equipment is a primary responsibility of the department.

I                   DUTIES OF THE CRIMINAL INVESTIGATION DEPARTMENT

I    In any Major Incident members of this department will have a role to play. The actual role they XR 302

I   will be called upon to fulfil will of course depend upon the nature of the incident. In the event of
    the incident being caused by terrorist activities, then it would clearly be the responsibility of the
    department to carry out a full scale investigation with the aim of bringing the perpetrators to
    justice.
I   In other types of incident such as a rail or air crash, their role would be entirely different. The
    exact nature of it would be decided by the senior officer in charge of the incident. The depart-
I   ment would probably be involved in the interrogation of witnesses and the taking of statements,
    being responsible for lost and found property and its documentation.


I   When it is known that a major incident has occurred, and that the Major Incident Plan has been
    implemented, all detectives should immediately report to the senior detective in their respective
                                                                                                          XR 303

    sub-division. They will form a small reserve available for deployment by the Operations Room in

I   liaison with the Site Commander.

    Additionally, when such an incident occurs, all members of the HOLMES Incident Room staff

I   and operational detectives attached to Headquarters will report to Force Headquarters. The
    senior officer in charge will report to the officer in charge of Operations Room the fact that this
    team is ready for deployment.

I   In the event of this incident being non-criminal, some detectives may be usefully employed at the
    Police Incident Post, etc.

I                      DUTIES OF THE COMMUNICATIONS DEPARTMENT

I   The Communications Department will be responsible for providing an adequate communications    XR 305

!   system both on and off-site.

    On receiving information of a major incident, the officer in charge of Operations Room will
    contact the duty Communications Officer who will then be responsible for:-
I       (a)    the collection, delivery and set up of the mobile police station at the site;
        (b)    the provision of radios and ancillary equipment;

I                                                                                                                  Page 1
                                                              FATALITIES
I                GENERAL PRINCIPLES

                 Dealing with fatalities is a second priority to be considered after the protection and preservation
                 of the living. If it is practicable, it is in the interests of proper investigation and identification that
I               dead bodies and parts Should be disturbed as little as possible in the first stage of attending to the
                incident. This is especially important when the incident is an air crash. Whatever the incident
               much time and trouble can be saved if all matters relating to the dead are dealt with methodically
I              and carefully. HM Coroner and his staff are responsible for dealing with the dead and everything
               possible should be done to enable them to carry out their tasks as normally as possible, in accor-
              dance with the Usual procedures. They have been asked to contact Operations Room Should they
I             require any type of assistance.

             HM CORONER

I            Where a major incident OCcurs involving a large number of victims the Coroner for the area and XR334
            his staff will be informed by Operations Room as SOon as possible. A list of personnel to be called

I           is maintained at Operations Room.

           The Coroner will inform Operations Room as to what premises he intends to use and if necessary
           will send a representative to liaise with the police COmmander at the site of the incident.
I          TEMPORARY MORTUARY ARRANGEMENTS

I         There is no need for the police
          the temporary                    to obtain the approval of the Coroner regarding arrangements for
                          accommodation
          mortuary accommodation     of of bodies
                                        a more     at the site.
                                                permanent       Should
                                                            nature       it be necessary
                                                                   consultation             to set
                                                                                will take place      up temporary
                                                                                                with the
I         Coroner for the necessary arrangements to be made.

         It is essential that premises used as temporary mortuaries Should have good access from the road XR335
I       and ideally Should be such as to enable a vehicle to be driven into the building and away from
        public view. A telephone is essential but if necessary a telephone can be quickly installed by
        arrangement through Operation Room. Emergency lighting can be arranged if required.
I       It is important that a ’waiting area’ Should exist, with telephone, toilet facilities, etc.,
       but not too distant from the mortuary. It is"to this area that relatives will be directed, separate,

I      of the public will not be directed to, nor permitted to attend at temporary mortuaries. Members

       As far as possible, temporary.mortuaries and premises used for post mortems, etc., will be staffed

I      by members of HM Coroners’ Departments, SUpported by additional personnel as necessary.
       Arrangements for personnel to staff mortuaries will be done through Operations Room. Mortuary
      personnel will be responsible for searching and preparing bodies, dOCUmentation, etc. Stocks of

I     identification forms, casualty record forms, etc., are kept at HM Coroners’ offices.

     Supplies of clothing and equiPment suitable for use in COnnection with temporary mortuaries are XR336
     held at all Coroners, offices in the area. Supplies of rubber gloves, sheeting, coffins, etc., can be
I    obtained when required via Operations Room.

     Separate instructions for personnel working at mortuaries have been prepared and copies are
I    available at all Coroners’ offices in South Yorkshire.

I     UNDERTAKERS


I     It will be the responsibility of Operations Room to arrange for undertakers to assist in the trans- XR 336
      port of bodies from the site to mortuary accommodation, should such service be appropriate. It
      is desirable that bodies should be accompanied by a police officer, but circumstances may make
      this impossible.
I     The Coroner may request Operations Room to arrange for the assistance of undertakers to
      provide accommodation, personnel or transport.
!     J H Kenyon Ltd are a firm of international undertakers able to attend the scene of a major XR 337
      incident in less than four hours. Further information concerning this firm is given at Appendix
I     ’A’. In consultation with HM Coroners and the police, the firm will deal with all matters relating
      to the dead, including the removal of bodies, identification, the return of property to relatives,
      funeral arrangements, etc. The firm is retained by all the large civil aviation companies and will

!     deal With all air disasters involving those companies. Clearly the firm’s expertise would be
      invaluable in dealing with any type of incident where there are particular difficulties or the
      number of fatalities is large.

I     HM Coroners for South Yorkshire have agreed that the police should call upon the services of this XR 338
      firm if the circumstances of the incident justify this course. In the event of such a major incident

!     occurring the officer in charge of Operations Room, after consulting with the Site Commander,
     will be responsible for asking the firm to attend. It must be stressed that HM Coroner or his rep-
     resentative must be consulted before this action is taken unless undue delay is likely to be

I    occasioned. In cases of doubt, however, J H Kenyon Ltd should be called even without prior con-
     sent from HM Coroner, since the firm have stated that they will attend a major incident even
     though their services may ultimately not be used and that having arrived they will consult with
     the Coroner prior to taking any action.
I    LABELLING OF BODIES AT SITE

I    Bodies and parts of bodies should not be removed without first being labelled and the position in XR 339
     which the body was found being marked. Photographs will be taken. Every body and every part
     will have a separate label.
I     It is extremely important that only ONE person should be charged with the responsibility of
     allocating numbers to bodie.s,.although the labelling, marking of location, dispatching, etc. will be
!    done by a team using the specialist disposable clothing contained in the major incident boxes.
     The person allocating numbers will maintain a record of every body which is labelled, showing
     details of its condition and position at the site and the place to which it is taken. Contained in

!    the major incident boxes is a ’Body Book’ designed for this purpose.

     Body labels are contained in all major incident boxes and should be fixed as securely as possible

I    to the body or part. If practicable the number should be marked on the body using indelible
     crayon.


I    The location where the body lay should be marked with a stake or other suitable object and the
     stake labelled using the same reference number as the body.

I                                                                                                  Page 3

I      PERSONAL ITEMS FOUND WITH BODY AT THE SITE


I     Bodies should not be searched. It may be feasible to enwrap the body completely in plastic
      sheeting or in a plastic bag or place it in a coffin before removal and thus keep all personal items
      and effects together with the body to which they belong.
                                                                                                             XR 340



I     An item of personal property (eg a handbag) found lying near a body, should not be assumed to
      belong to that body. Such property should be secured in a bag labelled ’Found near body
      labelled ............. ’. This property will go with the body.
I     Larger items of property such as luggage will not go with the body but after labelling will be dealt
      with as detained property (see instruction card ’Lost and Found Property Office’.)
I     DOCUMENTATION OF BODIES FOUND AT THE SITE


I     All bodies and parts of bodies should be labelled as set out above. All bodies should be made the
      subject of a "casualty record form’, books of which are contained in the major incident boxes.
                                                                                                        XR 341
      This applies to bodies which are incomplete but does not apply to parts. In cases of doubt a

I     ’casualty record form’ should be completed. As far as possible a ’casualty record form’ should be
      completed at the mortuary accommodation as the body is being dealt with there. Property and
      effects may give valuable information as to identity.

I    Where circumstances indicate that it is desirable to complete a ’casualty record form’ before a
     body is removed to mortuary accommodation this should be done but the body should not be

I    searched. All ’casualty record forms’ should include the body label number and any othere
     reference to the body, and details forwarded to the Casualty Enquiry Bureau.


I     REMOVAL OF BODIES FROM SITE TO MORTUARY ACCOMMODATION

     When it is necessary to move bodies from the site, they will be taken to the local mortuary or to XR 342
     a temporary mortuary. Where possible bodies should be accompanied by a police officer but
I    circumstances may make this impossible.

     At the request of the Site Commander, Operations Room will make the necessary arrangements
I    for transport to be used to move bodies.

     Coroners have made arrangements with local undertakers for them to stand by in the event of
I    emergency.

     Before a body is allowed to be removed from the site, a check will be made to ensure that

I    sufficient accommodation is available at the place to which it is being sent.

     DOCUMENTATION OF BODIES AT HOSPITALS

I    Where a person is involved in a major incident and is removed to hospital but subsequently dies,
     it is anticipated that the body will be lodged at the hospital mortuary from whence it will be
                                                                                                      XR 343


I    removed only on the direction of HM Coroner.

     It is important for purposes of identification that all clothing and property accompanying the

I    body should be retained with it. The police officer acting as liaison with the hospital should point
     this out to the staff and will complete a ’casualty record form’ for every such body. The form
     should include all hospital, ambulance and other references.

I   Where large numbers of bodies are involved, or where investigation or fdentification is likely to be
    difficult or protracted, it may be that the refrigerated accommodation which is normally
    available at mortuaries, hospitals or undertakers’ establishments is fnsufficient. The Coroner will XR 343
I   make whatever arrangements are necessary regarding such accommodation and preservation.

                                             FATALITIES
I    J H KENYON LIMITED, FUNERAL DIRECTORS

I    This Company, who act on behalf of all major British Airlines and several foreign Airlines, have XR 347
     proved to be invaluable at the scene of major air disasters. They work closely with the path-
     ological team, and their wide experience dating from the R38 airship disaster has enabled them to
I    perfect their procedures.

     The Company is based at 83 Westbourne Grove, London W2 4UI. Telephone 01-229-3810.

I    Telex number 265846.

     They will arrive quickly at the scene with a field team, having been informed by the airline

I    involved, and should have with them a written authority to act on behalf of the airline to deal
     with funeral arrangements and with any property handed over to them. The field team normally
     consists of five members, but where the total number of casualties exceeds fifty an additional

I    two members are attached.

     Amongst the major problems facing Police at the scene of an air disaster are those related to XR 348
     property, identification, and the disposal of the bodies. Kenyon’s procedure is divided into five
I    main operations:

         1      recovery of the remains;
I        2
         3
                identification;
                arrangements for disposal;
         4      removal to the place of disposal, and finally disposal by burial or cremation;
I        5      recovery, renovation, cleaning and identification of personal and other effects.

     So far as the recovery of the remains is concerned, Kenyon’s are well aware that this will

I    normally be carried out by the local Police and Ambulance Services who will remove bodies to a
     mortuary, but they stress that every effort should be made to prevent personal effects and
     clothing being moved from the bodies prior to the arrival of the investigation team. Kenyon’s

I   ’staff are aware that permission must be obtained from the local Coroner and the Police before
     any examination can be carried out.


I   IDENTIFICATION OF THE REMAINS

    Much distress can be caused to relatives by delay in the identificaiton of the bodies of the XR 349

I   victims, particularly where bodies are badly mutilated, and in nearly all cases, even in relatfves are
    available to view the remains, it is undesirable. However, relatives and friends who do travel to
    the site will be dealt with very tactfully by Kenyon’s field team, who base their identification on
    the following:
I        (a)     dental;
         (b)     documents;
I        (c)
         (d)
                clothing;
                jewellery;
         (e)    physical;
I        (f)
         (g)
                photographs;
                fingerprints.

I                                                                                       APPENDIX ’A’


I                                                                                                Page 2


      ARRANGEMENTS FOR THE DISPOSAL OF THE REMAINS
I     Although Kenyon’s are primarily Funeral Directors, they will make arrangements with relatives       XR 350
      who wish to use their own Funeral Directors, but as a first step 150 metallic lined coffins are
I     always held in readiness by Kenyon’s in London and Birmingham for immediate despatch to the
      scene of the accident.


I     REMOVAL TO THE PLACE OF DISPOSAL
                                                                          1
      This is dealt with entirely by Kenyon’s after a meeting with the local Coroner.

I     RECOVERY, RENOVATION, CLEANING AND IDENTIFICATION OF PERSONAL AND
      OTHER EFFECTS

I    Before leaving the scene of operations, Kenyon’s obtain possession of all personal effects XR 351
     removed from the bodies, or salvaged from the wreckage, where this is property of a non-
     contentious nature. (Non-contentious in the sense that matters related to HM Customs or
I    suspected crimes do not arise.) This relieves the Police of the task of retaining and disposing of
     property, and dealing with the heavy bolume of correspondence in connection with the same.

!    In the matter of identification, Kenyon’s field team quite often know the pathologists concerned,
     and the field team are equipped with forms which assist in obtaining medical or dental evidence.
     It is advisable at an early stage to have a meeting between the Police Officer in charge of the
I    incident, a member of Kenyon’s field team, the pathologist, and HM Coroner, in order that
     arrangements for the disposal of the remains can be made.


I     From the foregoing it will be seen that the arrival of the Company at the scene of an air disaster, XR 352
     to act on behalf of the affected Airline, can result in the relieving of the Police from many
     otherwise burdensome tasks. However, it must be stressed that this does not remove from the

I    Police the task of making initial arrangements relating to the safeguarding, labelling and preser-
     vation of bodies and property, providing temporary mortuaries, and having available property
     lists for HM Customs and Excise.

I    It is advisable to have a Police Officer of supervisory rank available to liaise with Kenyon’s
     representative throughout the incident. Kenyon’s are well aware of the need to maintain a close

I    and friendly relationship with the local Medical/Legal and Police Authorities and naturally they
     will reouire advice in localities where they have not previously worked.

I                                    MORTUARY LIAISON OFFICERS

I     In the event of a Major Incident occurring which justifies the establishment of the Casualty XR 354
      Enquiry Bureau and which involves many dead persons, arrangements have been made with the

I     coroners for the areas of South Yorkshire that a police sergeant will go to each mortuary
      receiving bodies and there report to the coroner’s officer. (Separate arrangements have been made
      with regard to hospital mortuaries, which will be the responsibility of the Hospital Liaison

I     Officer).

      Kept at each coroner’s office is a reserve of necessary equipment which includes a wallet con-
      taining casualty record forms, deceased person’s property forms and a copy of this Section of the
I     manual.

      The Mortuary Liaison Officer will consult with the Coroner and Coroner’s Officer to establish the
I     number of additional police personnel necessary to attend to carry out the police tasks at the
      mortuary. He will inform Force Operations Room, who will make the necessary arrangements for
      staff to attend. He should also indicate to Operations Room any items of equipment needed and

I     they willmake the necessary arrangements.

      It is intended that the Coroner’s staff and the police staff should work together dealing with each XR 355

I     body in turn. The Coroner’s staff will strip, search and otherwise deal with the body. A police
     officer will complete a casualty record form in respect of all bodies. This applies to bodies which
     are incomplete, but does not apply to parts. However, in cases of doubt a casualty record form

I    should be completed. The mortuary staff will be completing their own records which will
     necessarily contain specialist details of medical or forensic importance. The casualty record form
     should not include such details but should contain information which may enable identification

I    to be established.

     Depending on the circumstances, it has been found of great benefit in previous major incidents to
     assisgn an individual police officer to each body. In this case the teams would attend at the
I    mortuary and an officer would be allocated a body t’o try and establish its identity.

     The officer would familiarise himself with the body and any property on or with it. He would XR 356
I    accompany the body through the post mortem stage, gathering further information. That officer
     would then liaise closely with the Casualty Enquiry Bureau in an effort to complete identific-
     ation.
I     It is appreciated that it is not always practicable to follow this procedure and the decision to do
     so will lie with the Mortuary Liaison Officer is to transmit the details from the completed

I    casualty record form tothe Casualty Enquiry Bureau, so the relatives and friends may be enabled
     to identify and trace injured and deceased persons as soon as possible. Thsi will be done by tele-
     phone, the telephone number of the Casualty Enquiry Bureau being obtained from Operations

I    Room.

     The second, but equally important task is to provide a line of communication between the mor-

I    tuary and Force Operations Room, and hence to the scene of the incident.

                                                                                                             XR 358
     another police area and numbers of casualties are received at hospitals within the South
I    Yorkshire Police area, it will be the responsibility of the police to trace the relatives or friends of
     persons injured or killed and inform them of their condition and whereabouts. Allied to this
     responsibility is the general police duty to investigate or assist in the investigation of circum-

I    stances giving rise to death or injury.

     In order that these duties may be efficiently carried out, the police will set up a Casualty Enquiry

I    Bureau to which all enquiries and information relating to persons involved in the incident will be
     directed, in order that collation of this information may be undertaken and, where required,
     passed to relatives etc.

I    The establishment of the Bureau will also mean that many telephone calls will be channelled to
     it which would otherwise be made to Operations Room, hospitals, etc.

I    ESTABLISHMENT

     It will be the responsibility of the Duty Officer in charge of the Force Operations Room to XR 359
I    decide when the Bureau should be activated and each incident must be assessed individually. Con-
     sideration should be given to the potential numbers of casualties, and/or enquiries regarding
     casualties, and it should be borne in mind that a long delay in implementation wilt cause
I    unnecessary pressure upon Operations Room personnel.

     It will be the responsibility of the Training Department to make the following arrangements:-
I        (a)     Prepare the Bureau for use;
         (b)     Call out the necessary personnel;
I        (c)     Inform the Hospital Administrator(s) or other responsible person that police
                 officers are attending the hospital(s) to act in their capacity as Hospital Liaison
                 Officers;

I        (d)     Circulate by message switch, a message to all s~ations setting out the arrange-
                 ments for the Casualty Enquiry Bureau and telephone number to be used by

I   CONSTITUTION AND FUNCTION OF THE BUREAU

    The Casualty Enquiry Bureau is located within the Force Training Department Communications
                                                                                                         XR $60

I   School, Ecclesfield. The staff consists of one inspector (officer in charge), two sergeants (next of
    kin clerks) and ten other personnel who may be police constables or special constables
    (operators). The staffing level of the Bureau may be modified dependent on circumstances.

I   The officer in charge of the Bureau will be responsible for the efficient operation of the Bureau
    and its staff. He will ensure that all enquiries are correctly dealt with and all necessary records
    and documents are completed and maintained.

I                                                                                                       Page 2


I         He will also be responsible for the calling out of any relief personnel, bearing in mind the period
          of duty that Bureau personnel may have completed prior to the activation of the Bureau, and the
                                                                                                              XR 36O
          length of time they may reasonably be expected to operate efficiently. His responsibilities will
I         also include the liaison between Community Liaison and Crime Prevention staff at the hospitals,
          mortuaries and incident site and the Casualty Enquiry Bureau.


I         He will also be responsible for informing the appropriate administrator(s) that police officers are
          en route to act in their capacity as Hospital Liaison Officers.                                     XR 361


I        Telephones on both the national and internal lines are provided in the Bureau. The national
         number to be used by the public will be released by the officer in charge of the Operations Room
         to pre-arranged locations, including the media, when he is advised by the officer in charge of the

I        Bureau that he is ready to receive calls.

         External unpublished national exchange lines are also provided into the Bureau for the exclusive

|        use of hospital, mortuary and incident site liaison staff. These numbers are held within the docu-
         mentation which will be made available to officers responsible for hospital and mortuary records.
         It is imperative that these latter numbers are not made public.

I        PROCEDURES FOR PASSING INFORMATION TO THE BUREAU

         Information regarding persons injured or killed in the incident will be passed to the Bureau from
I        three main sources:-
                                                                                                           XR 362

             1       the incident site;
I            2
             3
                     the hospitals;
                     the Mortuary.


I            The Incident Site

             A casualty record form should be completed in duplicate for all persons treated at the

I            scene and allowed to leave without attending the hospital as a patient.

             The Site Commander will designate officers to undertake this task at a convenient

I            assembly point. The casualty record forms"are contained in the Major Incident boxes
             with further supplies available in the Casualty Enquiry Bureau. The information on
             these completed forms should be passed by telephone to the Bureau. The national

I            number of the Bureau for I~olice use only is contained with.in the Major Incident boxes,
             but in the event of difficulty it can be obtained from Operations Room.

        2 The Hospitals and Mortuaries
I       and
        3   Inspectors in charge of community liaison departments at divisions and their deputies
                                                                                                                 XR 363

            will call out staff in accordance with pre-arranged procedures to man the receiving
I           hospizals and mortuaries when they are advised by the Casualty Enquiry Bureau that
            the Bureau is being activated and this action is required.

I           The full duties of these personnel are set out in Sections 22 and 24, but briefly they
            will pass details of all injured and dead persons, identified or otherwise, to the Bureau
            by telephone.

I        PROCEDURE FOR RECEIVING ENQUIRIES FROM THE PUBLIC

         Members of the public who telephone the Casualty Enquiry Bureau using the publicised numbers XR 364
I        will be asked to supply information to enable a casualty enquiry form to be completed. This
         information is matched up with the information relating to the casualties provided by officers at
         the various receiving points.
I        Members of the public who make a personal visit to Force Headquarters or any other police
         station to enquire about a possible casualty should be given the facility to telephone the Bureau.

I       If the Bureau is unable to immediately give them the information they require sucl~ persons
        should be advised not to wait at police stations, but to return home where they will be told of

I       any information which comes to police knowledge.

        It can be anticipated that telephone calls will be received at police stations and Force Operations XR 365

I       Room and such calls should be channelled to the Casualty Enquiry Bureau either by divisional
        or Operations Room staff, giving the Casualty Enquiry Bureau public emergency telephone num-
        ber to callers. In the event of such callers being unable or unwilling to make an additional call,
        officers should take details and notify the Bureau via message switch.
I        It is for the officer in charge of the Casualty Enquiry Bureau to decide whether or not a person
        making an enquiry should be given details of a casualty. Where it has been decided to give details,
I       but it appears inappropriate to give them over the telephone, the person enquiring will be asked
        to return to a fixed address, when arrangements will be made for the information to be passed by
        telephone or message switch to the police station near to that address in order that personal con-
I       tact can be established.

        No details will be given out from the Bureau other than by telephone or message switch on the
                                                                                                      XR 366
I       Command and Control computer, to prevent members of the public congregating at Force
        Headquarters or the Casualty Enquiry Bureau, seeking information.


I       Details of persons dead or injured will not be issued directly to the media by any member of the
        Bureau. All ~tems for publication will be issued through the Force Press Officer.


I      A detailed plan of what initial action is r.~iJired by the Inspector, Operations Room, to
       commence the Bureau is held by Operations Room. Within this plan is a list of personnel who
       maybe called upon to assist him set up the Bureau, and further lists of persons trained to operate

I      the system.

       The Superintendent, Training Department, will be responsible for maintaining the lists in
                                                                                                          XR 367
I      Training Department and Operations Room of those personnel who may be called upon to set up
       and arrange the Bureau. He will also be responsible for arranging for the training of personnel in
       the operation of the Bureau system and maintenance of the lists of persons so trained.

I       It is anticipated that prior to the Bureau being activated many calls will be received at Force
       Operations Room from persons seeking information regarding friends and relatives. Where it is
       known the Bureau will eventually be activated, callers should be requested to monitor local/
I      national radio and/or BBC and IBA Television, where the appropriate Bureau telephone number
       will be broadcast when the Bureau commences operation. This will assist to clear the 999 tele-
       phone lines and the British Telecom exchange lines into the Headquarters switchboard enabling
I      Operations Room to attend to the requirements of the incident. It is emphasised that the
       decision to activate the Casualty Enquiry Bureau must have been taken before persons enquiring
       are given the above instruction.

I      Prior to the decision to activate the Bureau being taken, enquiries will be recorded by Operations XR 368
       Room in accordance with normal procedures, obtaining sufficient details for an enquirer to be

I      contacted later if necessary, and arrangements should be made for all this documentation to be
       passed to the officer in charge of the Bureau if it becomes operational.

I                                     HOSPITAL LIAISON OFFICERS


I     In the event of a Major Incident occurring which justifies the establishment of a Casualty Enquiry
      Bureau, arrangements have been made with hospitals in the County that police officers, from
      Divisional Community Liaison and Crime Prevention Departmentss, will go to the Casualty
                                                                                                         XR 37O


      Department of the hospital and there report to the person in charge of casualty documentation.
I     Officers attending will take with them the Hospital Liaison box which is kept at their respec-
      tive offices. This box contains casualty record forms and stationery and protective clothing
I     required to administer the scheme.

     The box also contains a copy of this Section of the manual and the telephone number of the
I    Casualty Enquiry Bureau. Force Operations Room will supply this number in case of any
     difficulty. Although there may be a delay in the call being answered whilst the bureau is being set
     up, the officers need take no further action to establish communications, other than to ring this

I    number from time to time. At some hospitals there may not be a telephone available for police
     use and in these circumstances officers will have to use telephones at adjacent premises.


I    A casualty record form will be completed in duplicate for every casualty involved in the incident,
     whether the casualty is discharged, detained, moved to another hospital, found to be dead and
     moved to another mortuary etc. The information required to complete the form is largely self
                                                                                                        XR 371



I    evident but every effort should be made to obtain as much accurate detail as possible.

     This information will be supplied by the hospital staff although it may be possible for an officer
     to obtain information for himself. The work of the police officers is of a secondary importance
I    to that of the hospital and officers must use their discretion so that they obtain information
     without causing disruption to the working of the hospital.

I   Particular attention should be paid to the dead and to unconscious persons so that all details
    which may assist in the identification are obtained and preserved. This includes trying to ensure
    that hospital staff do not destroy clothing, property, etc., no matter how insignificant it may
I   appear.



I   It is also important that details of the wherea.bouts of the casualty at the time the incident XR 372
    occurred be obtained, if possible - ie whether-he was the occupant of any vehicle involved, etc.
     Inspectors in charge of divisional community liaison departments are responsibie for maintaining
I   liaison with their respective receiving hospitals, and the maintenance of the boxcontaining the
    required documents. They are also responsible for the training of their staff in their respective
    roles at rece’vl’ng hospitals. They may call upon the Force Training Department to assist in this

I   matter.

    The prime task of the hospital liaison officer at the hospital is to obtain and transmit information

I   from the hospital to the Casualty Enquiry Bureau so that relatives and friends may be enabled to
    identify and trace injured persons as soon as possible. The second, but equally important, task is
    to provide a line of communications between the hopsital and Force Operations Room, and

I   hence to the scene of the incident.

    These are vital links in the organisation and under no circumstances will the officers be diverted
    from their tasks to deal with public order problems or any other incident occurring in the vicinity     XR 373
I   of the hospital.

I       The hospital liaison officers will retain the casualty record forms for reference purposes after the
        information has been transmitted to the Casualty Enquiry Bureau. The officers should endeavour

        to obtain updated information - eg transfers, deaths, discharges - and it may be that further

I                 fire, until it is confirmed that a nuclear weapon is not involved, or there is no
                  further danger from explosion;

           (b) or if an approach is necessary, it should be made from upwind;
I         (c)     no-one should smoke and the smoke from fires should be avoided;

I     RESCUE PROCEDURES

      There are no specific guidelines in relation to rescue procedures. There are so many different
I     designs and types of aircraft that it would be ’mpossible to give such definite rescue procedures.

      Advice should be sought from the Military or Civil Aviation Authorities at an early stage.

I    SITE COMMANDER

          Arrange for Ioudhailers or public address equipment to be used to braodcast the following XR 4O5

I         safety measures, where applicable, to persons at the site:--

          (a)     No person should remain close to the aircraft longer than necessary.

I         (b)     Onlookers must remain at least 500 yards from the aircraft.

          (c)    Smoke from the aircraft must be avoided. All persons who have been subjected
I                to such smoke should seek medical assistance.

          (d)    Where radioactivity is known or suspected to be present, all persons who have
I                been within 500 yards of the aircraft or debris should report to the Assembly
                 and Welfare Centre (give location) until individual radiation checks have been
                 made. There should be no smoking, eating or drinking.

I         (e)    Any person leaving the site area must supply his name and address to the Police
                 Incident Post.

I        Where the aircraft has crashed in the immediate vicinity of buildings consider evacuation. XR 406
         Doors and windows facing the aircraft should be closed. Gas and electricity supplies should

I        be switched off and domestic fires extinguished. Details of evacuees should be recorded and
         passed to the Police Incident Post.

     3   Consider the desirability of using a helicopter to inspect the damage path and give
I        instructions to Operations Room who will make the necessary arrangements.

     4   Priority should be given to securing the site from onlookers and prevent any tampering with
I        wreckage or debris.

         When at a later stage the search of the site and crash path is organised, teams should be par-
I        ticularly briefed that they must avoid touching any wreckage, except for the purpose of
         saving life. The flight recorder should be described and personnel should be informed what
         action the investigators wish to be taken if it is found. If no more accurate description is
I        available, it should be described as being painted "’Dayglow" red or orange.

     POLICE AT THE SITE                                                                                   XR 407

I        Crashed aircraft presents danger from fire, explosions and possible radioactive materials.
         Police at the site must clear the vicinity of the aircraft or injured persons and onlookers so

I        that the risk of further casualties is reduced, and so that the Fire Service can effectively
         carry out its firefighting and rescue operations. As soon a~ possible an area of at least 500
         yards radius should be cleared.

I    2   Inform persons in the vicinity to keep uphill and upwind of the aircraft if possible. Move-
         ment of wreckage and contact with aviation fuel should, naturally, be avoided. Keep clear

I        of the aircraft engine intakes and beware of exploding cannon shells, etc. Prevent persons
         smoking and ensure that vehicle engines are switched off.

         Prevent any inspection or tampering with the bodies, wreckage or property unless it is
I        necessary to save life.

         Assist the Accident Investigation Branch by compiling lists of witnesses and initially taking
I        statements.

I                                              FLOODING


I    Flooding is rarely confined to a small area; it is usually widespread but there is invariably XR 415
     previous warning of it, and rarely does it assume Major Incident proportions. In this Force area,
     flooding is most likely to occur as a result of heavy rainfall (or snow) causing overflow of rivers
     and/or flooding of low lying areas when normal drainage systems become inadequate. It is
I    possible that East Coast high tides could result in a flooding situation in the Doncaster area.

    The rivers likely to flood in our Force area are the Rivers Don, Rother and Sheaf. There are a
I   number of flood level monitoring points where the exact water level can be established. These
    points are as follows:-


I    RIVER ROTHER, CATCLIFFE, ROTHERHAM                                                                   XR 416

    To ascertain the water level, telephone 0246-450687. Add the number of bells (feet) and buzzes

I   (inches} to 189 feet to ascertain the current water level. A preliminary warning will be issued by
    Yorkshire Water when the level reaches 198 feet and rising. An action warning will be issued by
    Yorkshire Water when the level reaches 199.5 feet. Occupants of houses adjoining Orgreave Road

I   and Sheffield Lane should be warned of possible flooding.

    RIVER DON, NEEPSEND, SHEFFIELD

I   To ascertain the water level telephone Sheffie!d 344404. The amount of water above normal is
    indicated by bells (feet) and buzzes (inches). If the height above normal exceeds 2 feet notify

I   Yorkshire Water.

    RIVER DON- RIVER SHEAF, BLONK STREET, SHEFFIELD                                                       XR 417

I   There is a marker on the wall viewed from Blonk Street across towards Castlegate indicating the
    water level. The danger level is 147.5 feet. When it exceeds this, notify Yorkshire Water.

I   RIVER DON, CHANTRY BRIDGE, ROTHERHAM

    There is a marker on the wall against Chantry. bridge indicating the water level. Inform Yorkshire
I   Water when the level reaches 75 feet and thereafter at intervals of 6 inches.

    RIVER DON, LONG SANDAL, DONCASTER
I   When the river level is 30 feet at St Mary’s Bridge, Yorkshire Water will notify the Police, giving
    one of the following warnings:-

I               River steady, no risk of flooding unless prevailing conditions worsen or a
                5reach occurs in the floodbank.

I                River rising, gives a maximum of six hours warning before overtopping of the
                floodbanks occurs.

I   Police Action:                                                                                        XR 418

I                               RAIL ACCIDENTS - SPECIAL MEASURES

      The below listed instructions are in addition, and not in substitution of the instructions con- XR 423

I     tained in the general sections of this manual.

      The prime responsibility in connection with accidents on the railway rests upon the railway

I     operating staff and the British Transport Police in accordance with their own instructions.
      However, it is likely that members of our Force will be first on scene and they must assume
      control until relieved by a responsible railway official.

I     FORCE OPERATIONS ROOM


I          Inform the Sheffield Power Box Supervisor of British Rail, Sheffield or the Divisional
           Control of the British Transport Police at Leeds about the incident, even though probably
           unconfirmed.

I     2    Sub-divisional control and officers attending the scene should be made aware of the fol-
           lowing:-

I          (a)    Action must be taken immediately to prevent further danger by warning
                  approaching trains. In addition to red flags and handlamps, canistors of deton-
                                                                                                             XR 424

                  ators are carried (usually in a black leather haversack) by all footplate crew and
I                 railway guards. Detonators are also stored in signal boxes and some platelayer
                  cabins.


I                All obstructed lines must be protected ON THE APPROACH SIDE of the scene
                 by placing detonators as follows:-


I                  i.
                  ii.
                 iii.
                        one detonator a quarter of a mile from the obstruction;
                        one detonator half a mile from the obstruction.
                        three detonators 20 yards apart, one mile from the obstruction.

I                Track circuit operating clips are carried in every driver’s cab. They comprise
                 two metal clips which are wide enough to clip onto the line and are joined by a

I                piece of yellow plastic covered wire. When fastened to the track it indicates, via
                 the signal system, that there is an obstruction on the track.

                 When the railway track consists of double lines, the adjacent line is normally
I                used by trains travelling in the opposite direction. Line protection should be
                 carried out first on the adjacent line(s) because the line on which the train
                                                                                                            XR 425


                 itself was running would normally be protected by the signalling system.
I                However, in the case of derailment this track should also be protected.

                 Although British Rail staff are responsible for carrying out these safety
I                measures, the first police officer at the scene should ensure that any necessary
                 safety action is taken, including the isolation of overhead electrified lines. Such
                 officers must keep a sharp lookout for approaching trains.
I         (b)     in each guardsvan or compartment is a ladder, a tool cupboard and an
                 ambulance box suitably marked with white lefters on a red background. The

I                tool cupboard contains hand tools and crowbars.

          (c)    Details of the best access routes should be obtained as a matter of urgency.               XR 426

        4     Special safety measures may be necessary at the site if the train was carrying a dangerous
I             load such as petrol or explosives. Nominate an officer to ascertain details of the load carried.

        5    Nominate an officer to report the position of the nearest bridge and/or signal box in relation

I       2    Establish contact and liaison with the senior British Rail official and the British Transport
             Police officer.

I       3    Arrange for a senior detective officer to investigate the incident in liaison with the British
             Transport Police, bearing in mind the possibility of sabotage, etc. Such investigation must not

I   SAFETY ON OR NEAR RAILWAY LINES                                                                         XR 428


I        For safety reasons police officers (including British Transport Poli~e officers) must not go
         on or near railway lines unless absolutely necessary.

    2     If it becomes necessary to go on or near railway lines, police officers should always be aware
I        of the hazards which can arise from the movement of trains; electrified conductor rails or
         overhead power lines; remotely operated points and restricted clearances on bridges and
         cuttings. It is essential that Officers maintain constant vigilance and avoid trains and elec-
I        trical equipment when on or near the railway.

         Whenever possible permission must be obtained from the railway authorities before going on
I        or near railway lines and a decision must be taken in conjunction with the railway auth-
         orities concerned whether trains need to be stopped.


I   4    Wlhenever circumstances permit, the police officer making the initial contact with British XR 429
         Rail must arrange for a lookout man to be provided. This can be arranged with the senior
         local railway official, or in case of difficulty with the nominated railway contact points -

I       Contact should be made with Force Operations Room who will make immediate contact
        with the nominated railway contact point as above, all of which are manned 24 hours. The
        contact points have direct telephone links with signal boxes and electric traction power
        control rooms.
I   6   The nominated contact point will need to be given a brief outline of the circumstances,
        together with reasons why it is essential for trains to be stopped or electric traction power

I       (c)    advise British Transport Police Headquarters Information Room.

        The following precautions must be taken whether or not a British Transport Police Officer

I       or a railway employee’s present, as it is appreciated that there are occasions where
        immediate access is vital"


I       (a)     If practicable, officers should walk at the side of the line facing the direction
               of oncoming trains where known. If it becomes necessary to cross over a line,
               the officer should:-

I                i.
                ii.
                      avo’d crossing at points and junctions;
                      make sure the lines are clear;

I              iii.   cross quickly avoiding stepping on any rails as on some lines a third
                      rail carries an electric current.

I                  Modern trains can approach, possibly from either direction, at high speed with
                   very little noise. Even after brakes are applied, trains may travel up to a mile
                                                                                                             XR 430


I                  before coming to a halt. Although most trains are fitted with headlights, there
                   are still some fitted with dim lights only.

           (b)     Vigilance must be maintained at all times and special care exercised in areas of

I                  train movements have been stopped, or lookout protection has been provided
                   by the railway.


I          (d)    When it becomes necessary for a police officer to go on to or in close proximity
                  to railway lines, he should (if necessary) call for the assistance of a police unit
                  carrying a high visibility tabard, in addition to asking for the assistance of rail-

I                 way staff.

          A police officer must not question or distract any signalman, driver or guard who is on duty. X,Ct 432

I         A police officer must not enter any signal box except in instances of extreme danger as
          disturbances of concentration might lead to further complications. If it is not possible to
          wait until that person concerned has finished duty, the police officer must arrange for the

I         person to be properly relieved: At the scene of an incident the officer must contact the
          senior railway official present or, in other circumstances, the British Rail Area Manager
          responsible for the person concerned.

          electric traction power will not stop all trains, as some trains using the same line may use
I         diesel traction. Trains may also continue to coast after power has been cut off. Therefore
          it is essential that adequate lookout protection be maintained and necessary precautions
          taken against electrocution.
I         Before taking further action it must be assumed that the electrical supply wil! still be ’live’ XR 433
          and that train movements are likely to continue until assurance is received from the nomin-
I         ated railway contact point that the curr~nt is off and (if necessary) all trains on that section
          of line have been halted by the railway authorities.


I    10 If it is necessary to rescue an injured person on rolling stock close to overhead electric
          power lines, an Officer should not allow (because of the dangers of arcing) any part of his
          body to come within TWO FEET of any live electrical equipment, broken or displaced

I         w’res, or foreign matter such as rope that is in contact with overhead electrical equipment.
          Officers should not climb above the interior floor level of locomotives or carriages, or into
          wagons or freight vehicles unless the overhead electrical power lines have been isolated.

I    11   If trains have been stopped, or electrical traction power switched off, it is essential that all XR 434
          parties involved are left in no doubt when trains are likely to be mov’ng again or electrical

I         power is to be restored. Before any police officer subsequently tells the senior railway
          officer at the scene, or the nominated railway contact point (when a railway official is not
          present), that trains may restart and/or the electrical traction power be restored, the police

I         officer must ensure that everyone who has been involved is clear of the lines and is told that
          normal working is being resumed. If British Transport Police are in attendance, the senior
          officer present of that Force is responsible for ensuring that these procedures are carried
          out. The officer responsible for requesting the restoration of services must also ensure that

If!                                                                                       SECTION 30
I                                                                                                Page 5

I          Operations Room is informed that normal working is being resumed. When electric traction
           power has been switched off, the request to restore power MUST be from the person who
                                                                                                           XR 434


I          requested it to be switched off.

            However, if the request to switch off the electric traction power came from a police officer, XR 435

I          but the power is unlikely to be restored for a lengthy period - eg a serious incident -
           before that police officer leaves the scene for any reason he must report to the police officer
           in charge of the incident. The police officer in charge of the incident must then liaise with

I          the senior railway official present in order to allow the officer to leave the scene without
           the electric power having been restored. When a police officer leaves an incident in circum-
           stances described above he should ensure that Operations Room is advised.

I     12 Unless there is good reason to suspect that a crime is involved, a dead body on the line must XR 436
           be moved as quickly as possible in order to enable rail services to be resumed and thus mini-
           mise disruption. If, for any reason other than crime being suspected, it is considered
I          necessary to photograph a body at the scene, it should be moved clear of the line and not
           left "n position, pending the arrival of a photographer. If crime is not suspected, a police
           officer should not require a body to be left in position on the running line.
I     13 By the very nature of fatal accidents on railway lines, bodies are often dismembered and
          parts of the body spread out over considerable distances. When bodies or limbs are moved

I         clear of the lines, train will often restart and run normally.

          ALL PERSONS ON THE TRACK MUST REMAIN VIGILANT AS TO THEIR OWN AND

I         OTHER PERSONS’ SAFETY.

          advice and help. Include in the report:-
I         (a)     the location and nature of the incident;
          (b)     as much information as can be obtained about the nature and quantities of the
I                 radioactive materials and the name, address and telephone number of the
                  consignor.
                  NOTE: The driver of any vehicle concerned and any escort may be able to
l                 assist. In addition, many vehicles are marked externally to indicate the
                  substance carried and the associated dangers. Other vehicles may have cards
                  displayed in the cab giving details of the substance and the action to be taken

I         (c)
                  in the event of an accident;
                  Ambulance and Fire Service to be informed, bearing in mind that the Fire
                  Service personnel are trained in the identification of toxic and other dangerous

l                 substances.

          Try to rescue anyone trapped in the wreckage and remove anyone injured with as little XR44I

l         physical contact as possible. Take any measures necessary to save life, including the removal
          of SERIOUSLY INJURED to hospital. (Inform the ambulance driver of the nature and
          quantity of the radio-active material, if known). Minor casualties and persons who may be

l         contaminated but are not injured should be isolated and remain at the scene until expert
          assistance is obtained.

     3    Do not attempt too much until expert help or advice is obtained.
I    4    Keep the general public as far from the scene as possible until a qualified person has made a
          survey and indicated demarcation boundaries. This area around the incident should be at
I         least 50 yards (45 metres) and anyone near the scene should be UPWIND.

          Do not allow anyone to eat, drink or smoke in the area because of the possibility of
I         ingestion of radio-active particles and tl’ie danger of explosion.

     6 Do not relax supervision.of the site until the experts have given clearance.

I     2   Inform the Ambulance and Fire Services. If the incident involves a nuclear fuel flask which
          has been involved in a fire, advise the Fire Service to cool all accessible surfaces of the flask
          by spraying with water.
I     3   Inform the Assistant Chief Constable (Operations) and the Chief Superintendent,
          Operations & Traffic.

I    4     Inform the Royal Hallamshire Hospital, Sheffield, of the incident and inform them that
          patients may be contaminated with radio-activity. All patients who are contaminated should

I         betaken to the Royal Hallamshire Hospital as this is the only hospital in the area equipped
          to deal with such incidents. However, if the patient is in immediate need of emergency
          medical treatment, he can be taken to any casualty hospital.

I         tf the incident has occurred on British Rail property, inform British Rail control, and liaise ZR 444
          with the British Rail Mishap Controller (or his representative) on site.

          by contacting:--

I         (a)    First Stage contact under the NAIR Scheme by contacting either the Royal
                 Hallamshire Hospital or Weston Park Hospital, Sheffield. The switchboard
                 operators will give details of the person to contact.
I         (b)    If the persons named cannot assist, contact surrounding forces and ask for
                 details of the First Stage contacts under NAI R. (National Arrangements for
I                Incidents involving Radio-activity).

     7    If required, arrange escort and/or transport for the expert who is attending.
I    8    Inform the District Emergency Planning Officer.


I    9 Obtain any further assistance - eg manpower, services, equipment required at the scene.

    10    Inform the Force Press Liaison Officer.

I   11    If the First Stage contact asks that the Second Stage contact be informed, contact the XR 445
          switchboards at the Royal Hallamshire Hospital or Weston Park Hospital and ask for details

I                    HAZARDOUS CHEMICALS - EMERGENCY PROCEDURES


I   The foNowing guidelines are based on training given to the Police in such incidents, and on advice XR 450
    from the Chemical Industries Association.

         When dealing with hazardous chemicals it must be borne in mind that the inhalation of
I        fumes and vapour from, or any physical contact with, any spillage of hazardous chemicals
         can have fatal or serious consequences. The Fire Service is specially trained and equipped to
         deal with this aspect and all related rescues, including the decontamination and the handing
I        over of casualties to the Ambu lance personnel.

         Should police officers suddenly find themselves in the path of a ’vapour cloud’ they should
I        take cover in enclosed premises, immediately advising members of the public to do likewise,
          If in a vehicle all windows and vents should be closed, and the heating system switched off.


I   2    or~ receiving information of such an incident, Force operations Room must be informed
         immediately and they will control all such incidents.
                                                                                                         XR 451



I       Operations Room will ensure that the Fire Service is requested to attend immediately and
        that the Ambulance Service is alerted.


I       The Operations Room Inspector will ascertain the direction and speed of the wind from the
        Leeds Meteorological Office. He will identify a Road Traffic mobile whose crew is fully
        trained in dealing with such incidents and direct that mobile to the scene via a safe route -

I       ie upwind from the incident.

        This mobile will be parked in a safe area and a member of the crew will liaise with the senior
        Fire Officer present in an attempt to identify the chemical/substance involved, and make an
I       immediate situation report to Operations Room.

        The crew will not leave the safe area and will not attempt a rescue. The crew will be desig-
I       nated as the INCIDENT CONTROLLER and will perform no other duties than:-
                                                                                                         XR 452


        (a)     control of the incident;
I       (b)
        (c)
                liaison with the Fire Service; "
                liaison/advisor to the Senior Police Officer assuming control of the incident.


I       SENIOR OFFICERS W’HO ARE NOT TRAINED IN HAZCHEM PROCEDURES SHOULD
        NOT GIVE INSTRUCTIONS WHICH CONFLICT WITH THOSE ADVISED BY THE
        INCIDENT CONTROLLER.

I       Other available Road Traffic mobiles will be directed to specified safe locations to effect
        necessary road closures, traffic diversions and to keep the public away from the scene.

I       IF THE INCIDENT IS ON A MOTORWAY, ONLY ROAD TRAFFIC PERSONNEL WILL
        BE INVOLVED ON THE MOTORWAY.

I        If not already aware, Operations Room will inform the affected sub-divisional control room XR 453
        and direct that a senior officer attend the scene by a safe route and liaise with the ’Incident

I       Controller’. Other sub-divisional personnel will only approach the scene by a safe route and
        then only as far as the communications vehicle. All personnel at’the scene will await further
        instructions.

I         Operations Room will maintain constant liaison with the Fire Service control and other XR 453
          agencies, who will attempt to ascertain from these sources such information that will
          identify the chemical/substance involved.
I        This information will usually be achieved from information contained in the hazchem
         warning panels or labels displayed on the tanker or container involved. The driver should be
I        properly trained and if available shou Id supply information about th is substance.

         If no such markings are displayed it does not necessarily mean that the substance is not XR 454
I        hazardous. The Fire Service Control are in possession of a ’Harwell’ computer which holds
         information on all known chemicals, identification numbers and action to be taken in

                              APPEND I X F
I                     ANALYSIS OF EASTWOOD TESTS

I
    l.O   DESCRIPTION OF EQUIPNENT [AS SEEN IN 1990 DEMONSTRATIONS]
I   l.l   The testing rig used by Eastwood & Partners
          consists of a series of rectangular hollow

I         section [tubular] members bolted together so
          as to produce a horizontal loading at four
          points along each span of barrier. A drawing

I         showing the details of the rig is included as
          FI and photographs of the rig are included in
          this appendix.

I   1.2   For the tests on 26th June 1990, two identical rigs
          were used so that adjacent spans of the same barrier
          could be loaded.

I   1.3   Various adjustments in the rig dimensions are possible.


I   1.4   Connections between the various steel members of the
          rig consist of welded and stiffened joints and single
          bolted joints.

I   1.5   It appears to be intended that all welded and stiffened
          connections produce a rigid joint with no relative
          rotation of members.

I   1.6   It appears to be intended that all other
          joints, i.e. the bolted connections, are

I         sufficiently free to allow rotation of the
          members connected. There is tightness in
          application.

I   2.0   1983 AND 1988 TESTING OPERATIONS

!   2.1   Deflections in 1983 tests were measured in thousandths
          of an inch. In 1988 tests were measured in
          millimetres~ It is not known how these

I         measurements were taken or with what
          frequency.


I
i
I
I
I
I   2.2    It was understood that the method of testing in 1983
          and 1988 was to load two adjacent spans of each barrier
          simultaneously and to measure the maximum deflection of

l         the mid point of the rail on one span. In the case of
          a single span barrier load was applied and deflectlon
          of the rail at mid span was measured.

I   2.3   The number of increments of loading is not known. The
          test result tables show only a deflection related to a
          slngle load increment of 6 kN/m. The duration of this

I   2.4
          load was not recorded.

          In calculating the percentage recovery each cycle of

I         loading was considered in isolation.



I   3.0   1990 TESTING DEMONSTRATIONS

    3.1   Load was applied to two adjacent spans of each barrier.
I   3.2   The deflection of the barrier was measured by means of
          gauges supported by robust free standing posts on the

I         opposite side of the barrier to the rigs. Deflection
          was measured at each support and at the mid-span
          position of each rail.

I   3.3   The load was applied in six approximately equal
          increments. The maximum load was maintained for five
          minutes.
I   3.4   In calculating the percentage recovery the deflections
          are considered by Elrond Engineering to be progressive

I         throughout the three cycles of loading [i.e. a
          complete test]. Eastwood & Partners consider
          each cycle in isolation.

I   3.5   Figure F4 shows the relationship between load and
          deflection of the top of the central support of barrier
          131. This illustrates the progressive nature of
I         deflection during a test.

    4.0     POSSIBLE INACCURACIES IN 1990 TESTING DENONSTRATIONS
I   4.1     Application of Load to Barrier Rail

I   4.1.1   The application of load to the barrier at four points
            is not a truly uniformly distributed load. The effect
            of this is to increase the support moment by
I           6% and the mid span moment by I0% compared to
            a uniformly distributed load case. It does
            not significantly affect the support

I   4.1.2
            reactions.

            The support reactions, that is the loads transferred

!           from the testing equipment by way of the barrier rail
            to the supports vary according to the condition of the
            rail relative to the supports. The support reactions
            for a double span of barrier rail are indentical to two
I           single spans only if there is no continuity of the rail
            at the central support. If there is continuity, that
            is if a single length of tube is used for both spans

I           then the support reaction is increased by 25% at the
            central support. This comparison is shown in Figure F2.


I   4.2     Fixity of Joints in Test Rig


I   4.2.1   The combination of bolted [pinned] and welded [fixed]
            connections used on the rig creates an asymmetrical
            displacement of the rig. The rig displaces away from

I           the fixed end towards the pinned end from right to left
            on plan. This will affect the load position and may
             introduce a nominal horizontal force. These effects

I           are likely to be slight. It was observed during one
            test demonstration that the rig slipped laterally along
            the barrier rail.

I   4.2.2   If some or all of the bolted connections are over-
            tightened then a fixed or partially fixed condition can
            occur.
I   4.2.3   The analysis of the rig assuming all fixed joints
            produces a radically different set of forces, moments

I           and deflections.



I                                3

I

!
    4.2.4   With all fixed joints, the loads applied to the barrier

i           are much hlgher near the ends of the barrier so that
            the reactions at the central support are less than the
            theoretical case. The reactlons are compared in Figure

I   4.2.5
            F2.

            The dlstribution of moment along the barrier is such
            ~hat higher moments are produced near the supports.
I           comparison of the maximum bending moments for the ideal
            condition and the two fixity conditions is shown in
            Figure F3.

I   4.2.6   The effect of fixing all the joints is;to reduce the
            lateral deflections of the rig. The maximum

I           theoretical lateral deflection with pinned and fixed
            joints is lO.5mm and with all fixed joints is 0.3mm.

    4.2.7   With all joints assumed fixed the deflection of the
I           barrier at right angles to the rail is drastically
            reduced since the application of load is more
            concentrated nearer the supports. The maximum

I           theoretical deflection using pinned and fixed joints is
            13.4mm whereas using all fixed joints the maximum
            theoretical deflection is 2.9mm.

I   4.2.8   From the tests carried out on 26th June 1990, allowing
            for the deflection of the supports which occurred, the
            maximum rail deflection was of the order of lOmm. This
I           suggests that the rig behaved in that instance as
            intended as a combination of pinned and fixed joints.


I   4.2.9   In practice the connections will behave as though
            partially fixed and the lateral displacement will be
            less than the fully pinned condition. The forces and

I           moments will vary between the limits calculated.


    4.3     Other Factors
I
    4.3.1   The rig is supported on the barrier and introduces
I           compressive forces into the supports of the barrier.

    4.3.2   The compressive force at each support tends to reduce

I           the tensile stress leading to failure and increases the
            capacity of the rear support leg by approximately I%.


!

i
l
!
I
    4.3.3   Because of the limited range of adjustment of the rig

I           it is not always possible to ensure that the main legs
            are perfectly horizontal. A variation from the
            horizontal would mean that the measured load applied to

I   4.3.4
            the rail could be marginally increased or decreased.

            Similarly because of the limited range of adjustment of
            the rig members in the direction parallel to the
I           barrier, it is not always possible to ensure that the
            load positions are equally spaced along the barrier and
            the loading produced is not exactly as assumed.
I   4.3.5   When the maximum load is applied to the barrier during
            testing, it is maintained for 5 minutes. However, in

I           practice because of the deflection of the barrier, it
            is difficult to maintain a constant load and the onus
            to do this rests on the pump operator.    It was
            observed on a number of tests that the
I           deflections were still increasing during the
            five minutes under the application of a
            constant load
I   4.3.6   In order to ascertain the jack force required and hence
            the gauge reading at the pump it is necessary to

I           measure the length of barrier exactly and calculate the
            necessary total force equated to the specified testing
            load of 6 kN/m run. There is clearly a possible source
            of inaccuracy in both the measurement and calculation
!           stages of this operation.

    4.3.7   The accuracy to which the deflections and loads can be

I           read is dependent upon the reader’s perception of the
            spaces between the dial graduation marks. In the case
            of the deflection gauges these can be moving rapidly

I           and a short interval of time can make a difference to
            the reading taken. The gauges are graduated to O.Olmm.


i   4.3.8   Without calibration certificates for the pump gauge
            which has so far not been made available, it is not
            possible to confirm if the recorded reading is the
            actual force applied to the main legs of the rig.
i   4.3.9   The reading§ taken on the pump gauge are expressed in
            Tons and are reported to relate directly to the load

I           in the main leg.

I
    Load calculation Eastwood and Partners’ rig

I
    We understand that the Eastwood rig has been calibrated in
I   such a way that the pressure reading shown on the hydraulic

I   pressure gauge indicated directly the force applied by each ram

    to the barrier. Therefore:-

!   Load kN/m = Pressure ~auqe readinq Tons x 9.96

I               Length of barrier per ram

    [Conversion factor of 9.96 calculated from 2240 Ibf/ton x

I   4.448 kN/Ibf

!   1.0   DESCR I PT I ON OF EQU I PNENT

!
    i.1   The testing rig used by $G$ consists of one or two
          modules which allows a single or two adjacent spans of
          the same barrier to be tested.

    1.2   Each module consists of three horizontal telescopic box
          sections which are connected to the face of a flange on
          an aluminium alloy lateral I beam. Three hydraulic rams
          are bolted to the opposite flange of the beam in the
          horizontal plane so that they make Contact with the
          barrier at rail height.

    1.3   The whole module is positioned to the rear of the
          barrier, the I beam end being supported on three
          adjustable vertical screw jacks. The free ends of the
          box sections are supported on a terrace step of
          convenient height and braced against the riser of the
          next step back.

    i.4   The relative position of each ram can be adjusted
          laterally to provide spacings along the barrier span of
          I/3 length of span commencing I/6 length of span from
          each end support.

    i.5   Load is applied to the barrier through a ’V’ shaped end
          on each ram. All rams in use are connected to a single
          hydraulic pump via. flexible hoses so that equal
          pressures are developed on the piston of each ram. The
          hydraulic pressure in the system is indicated by a dial
          gauge calibrated in pounds per square inch [psig] which
          is attached to the pump.

    i.6   The conversion of hydraulic pressure to load applied to
          the barrier is shown in the first two columns of the
          tabulated test results and the method of calculation
          addressed in the notes which precede the tables.

I
    Load Calculation SGS rig
I
I   Information regarding the calibration of the SGS rig is not

    clear. It is understood that some part of the hydraulic

I   pressure applied to the base of each ram is not transmitted

    to the barrier. Six rams were used in tests carried out on

    9th July 1990, 3 rams have been calibrated and the


I   transmission loss measured. The loss can be expressed as a

    ram efficiency and includes the effect of the ram piston area.

I   The reason for part of the loss is not understood. The

    efficiency of each ram is different and varies with the
I   hydraulic pressure applied. However, the individual


I


                                   21
I
I
I
I   figures have been averaged to give two efficiencies.



I   0.87 up to II00 psig hydraulic pressure
    0.91 from II00 psig to 1600 psig hydraulic pressure

I
    Therefore the force applied to each barrier has been
I   calculated as:-

I   Load on barrier kN/m =

    0.87 or [0.91] x No. of rams x 4.448 x I m

I                                   I000     L



I   Where 4.448 is a conversion factor Ibsf to kN and L is the
          I000
    length of barrier.


I   All rams used have not been calibrated. The ram efficiency

I   quoted is less than is attributable to the piston area.

    There is an unexplained loss in force transmission.
I   Reasons for this are not understood and some doubts must

l   exist regarding the accuracy of the tabulated applied loads.

e    This deduced barrier 124a had consisted of a continuous horizontal


II   wrought iron tube, the portion between supports 2 and 3 had

     been bent to a permanent deflection of 133mm at mid span.

II   Section 3 to 4 had been bent to a maximum permanent deflection

     of 200mm at mid span with a tensile strength of 365 MPa or
II   N/mm~ 23.6 tons f per square inch and an elastic limit


!    estimated at 150 MPa 9.7 tons f per square inch.


     Four vertical supports each made from two lengths of steel
II   angle joined at the top by a steel gusset plate, five of the


II   eight support feet reinforced by additional angle sections let

     into the concrete steps, supports I end 2 with angle braces on
i    the rear legs. The tensile strength of the mild steel angle


II   was measured at 360 MPa 23.3 tons f per square inch and a yield

     stress of 288 MPa 18.6 tons f per square inch.

    Examination of crush barriers IR/L/NN/89/ll llfh December 1989
I   The size of the sections for the supports was identified as

I   52mm (2") angles with a thickness of 6mm (I/4"). We measured

    2" x 2" x I/4, SGS measured 49.5mm x 49.8mm x 6.1mm.
i
    Each support leg had been flattened and shaped to form a foot

    which had been positioned horizontally in the ground and bolted

    to a base plate. Considerable thinning and loss of metal had

    been observed in the vicinity. The thickness of the concrete

    showed the terrace steps varying in thickness between 79mm

    (3.11") and 141mm (5.55"). The concrete associated with the

    original support feet varied between 180 (7.08") and 245mm

    (9.65").


I   The newspaper found inside tube 2/3 was dated 24th October

    1931. Up to 13 layers of paint were identified.

I   It was recognised that the tube I/2 was a low carbon steel with
i   an elastic limit of 282 - 301MPa and an rm (resilience maximum

    or maximum tensile strength) of 488 - 499 MPa. The tube 3/4
I   was recognised as wrought iron with an elastic limit of 142 -


i   159 MPa and an rm of 371 - 358 MPa. None of the test pieces

    exhibited a yield phenomenon.

    Tube fractures were recognised in areas located under metal
l   straps where there had been significant corrosion.

i   Considerable subsurface corrosion of the supports played no

    part in the collapse. Possibly explained by the raising of the

i   level of the terrace with concrete steps subsequent to the

    corrosion occurring.

     No collapse loads are reported in respect of the supports.


     Corrosion reduced the load capacity of the rail by 25% and 6%

     respectively.

     spectator weight and push height with the crowd on its toes

           and the rail in the corroded condition on span 3 - 4

l          would require a crowd depth behind the handrail of 7.5m.

           This would result in a load on the rail of 6 kN/m plus
I          22% or 7.33.


I    It is appreciated and acknowledged that there appears no


!    previous work in this type of calculation and that caution

     should be exercised in using the model. However, it appears to

I    me that with a crowd density of 5.4/m2 the load from a leaning

     crowd model is I kN/m length of rail for each metre of

i    horizontal separation between barriers.

I   The SGS test programme has established the following evidence:-



I   II     BARRIER 124A NATERIALS

i
     o     Rail 1/2, including the short 360mm insertion piece

i          welded at support 2, has been manufactured from a low-

           carbon steel tube of seam-welded design, (either
i          electric-resistance seam weld and normalised, or solid-


I          phase welded at high temperature).



!    .
           Rail 2/3 and 3/4 consist of wrought iron tubing, this

           disclosure indicating the rails substantial age.

I
           The leg supports (front and rear legs) have been
     .


           produced from rimming quality mild steel angle section.

I
     °     From the observation of the resident microstructure,

           the steel leg straps vary in carbon content between

           supports 2, 3 & 4, the latter comprising a medium/high




!
I

I
    The actual mechanism of corrosion appears to be from a

    series of shal ow pits; indeed this was imp ied from


I   the visual condition of both the outer surface of the

    tubes and the bore surfaces, particularly at support 4

I   where water has entered the end of the tube and been

    allowed to accumulate.
!
!   The relative resistance to water corros’on of wrought

    iron is very much dependent upon factors such as

!   electrolyte, method of manufacture~ surface condit’on,


i
    conditions of exposure etc but is regarded in one

    source of reference (i) as at east the equal of mild


i   steel and in certain instances the superior materiel.



I   The eg sections have also sustained corrosion of

    vary ng severity between supports, the locations
I   be ng:-



    I.   The top of the front leg (under the rail)

    2.   The gusset p ate adjacent to the front leg

    3.   The bottoms of the legs under terrace level
I        and


i   4. Adjacent to the bottom strengthening angle plate

             Advanced corrosion resulting in perforation of the

             gusset plate on leg 2 was also observed and significant

             attack of one rivet head on leg No. 3



I       13   BARRIER FAILURE


m   l


             Ultimately, with regard to the actual failures


t            sustained by the rails 2/3 and 3/4 and leg supports 3 &

             4, all fractrographic evidence is consistent with

i            mechanical overstressing; where brittle mechanisms of


!            failure have been observed, these are attributed to the

             conditions under which the loading was applied or


!            component configuration where brittleness would be

             favoured.

i
             Fracture of the wrought iron rails has eventually
I            occurred at the reduced wall thickness at support


I            points 2, 3 & 4 as would be anticipated, but only after

             substantial plastic deformation and deflection of the

!            rails. While wrought iron does not possess the


!            ductility of mild steel, mechanical testing results

             confirm the material to show reasonable elongation


!            values of 12 - 18% over a 50mm gauge length.

I      ¯     Damage to crush barriers during incident


I
     !.!       Only one crush barrier collapsed during the incident
I    on 151h April 1989. This barrier (No 124A) has been ,he


I    subjec, of laboratory examination by the Health and Safety
     Executive which has shown that the failure Involved the

I    collapse end fracture of suppor,s Nos. 3 end 4 end the frac,ure

     of the horizontal tubular rail be,wean supports 2, 3 and 4.
i    The laboratory investigations have revealed that the frac,ures


I    in the tubular rail developed in areas which had sustained

    severe wastage beneath metal retaining straps. The collapse

I   of the supports Involved bending and buckling of the legs and

    was aggravated by corrosion.
I
I   !.2       AI,hough only one barrier collapsed, o number of


I   other barriers appear 1o have been damaged either during or

    prior 1o the incident. The nature end location of these

I   damages, as described below, provides further insight into the

    condition of the barriers on the West Terrace end the likely
I   sequence of damage development in barrier 124A.

I
           i)      The tubular roll between supports I and 2 was

I                  heavily bent In e forward direction.


I          li)    The roll appeared to hove started to fracture

                  at the second support where It was retained
I                  by e welded strap.

I          Ill)   The rail was penetrated by corrosion at the

I                  Ist support.


I         Iv)     The trailing leg of the 2nd support had

I                 started to fell below the bottom edge of the

                  gusset plate.

I
I               ill)   Tubular rall renewed and new strap fitted at

                       support No.3. Insert tube fitted at support

I                      No.3.


I    1.5       Barrier 137

I              I)      Sllghf deformation of tubular rall in bay

I                      I/2; more pronounced deformation of rall In

                       bay 2/3.
l
I              ll)     Trailing leg of support No.2 bent at gusset

                       lower rivet.

I
               iii)    Forward leg of support No.2 starting to
I                      buckle.

I   1.6       The damages described above reveal two maln sources

I   of weakness in the old-style barriers. The wrought Iron rails


I   possess inadequate strength and are further weakened by severe

    corrosion at the Support positions. Where the barriers

I   comprise more than one bay, the central supports possess



I                                 3

I
I
I
I    Inadequate strength with failure initiating In the trailing leg

    at the gusset lower rivet.

I
               Previous Repairs

I
     .




    2.1
I              Inspectlon of the remaining old-style barriers
    reveals that various repairs and renewals have been carried

I   out.   These include:-


I             I)      Replacement of original wrought Iron rail by

                      mild steel rall
I
I             ii)     Replacement of rall retalnlng straps.



I            iii)     Reinforcement of bottom of legs due to severe


I                     corrosion.                             .




I            iv)     Weld repairs to tralllng leg to rectify

I                    severe wastage.



I           v)       Plated reinforcement of tralllng leg to

I                    rectify bending at gusset lower rivet

I
I                       sustained during testing in 1983 (letter from

                        Eastwood to Club dated 29.8.83 refers).

I
I               vi)     Renewal of complete support on one barrier

                        (131) by new style rectangular tubular

I                       support.


I
I    2.2       The existence of the repalrs demonstrates that the

     Club and their safety advisers were aware of the corroded and

I    weakened condition of the barriers. The degree of damage may

     have been more severe on some barriers than others. However
I    the number of repairs together with visual Inspection of the


I    remaining ’sound’ barriers should have revealed to a

     responsible engineer that all of the old-style barriers were In

I    a debilitated condition and should have been replaced.      In my

     opinion piece-meal repairs over an extended period of equipment
I    which was obviously In a deteriorated condition was not good


I    engineering practice.

                Damage to crush barr lers preced I ng I nc I dent


I
    3.1         The HSE Investigation has pointed out that in

I   addition to barrier 124A, barriers 125 and 128 in pens 3 and 4


I   contained obvious corrosion holes in the tubular rail at end

    supports.      In addition, barrier 134 in pen No.2 has been found

I   to contain a corrosion hole in the rail at support No.3. Also

    barrier 128A in pen No.5 contains a corrosion hole in the rail

I   at support No.3.


I   3.2         Several barriers exhibit severe wastage in the upper

I   part of the support, particularly in the area of the riveted or

    bolted connection of the roll retaining strap to the top of the

!   forward leg.


I   3.3         On barrier 140, support No.3 has suffered pronounced

I   bending of the trailing leg at the gusset lower rivet together

    with bending of the leading leg. The damage is covered by an
I   adherent coating of paint and obviously predated the incident


I   on 15th April 1989.



i   3.4      The damages descrlbed above are obvlous and should


I
!
!
!
I
i
     have been apparent to the Club and their safety advisers before
I    the i5th April i989.    The presence of such obvious damage


I    should have put the Club on notice that the old-style barriers

     were In a weakened condition and liable to fail if heavily

I    loeded.



!    3.5       The condition of support No.3 on barrier 140


I    demonstrates that on some previous occasion this barrier was in

     imminent damage of collapse.    Paragraph 39 of the Green Guide

I    specifies that "Following each event, a general visual

     examination of the ground should be made for signs of damage
I    which might create a potential danger to the public .......


I   Crush barriers and balustrades should be examined for

    deformation or any other signs of weakness".    Either this

I    inspection was not performed by the Club or no account was

    taken of the evidence of weakness in the barriers.
I
i   4.         Testing

!
I   4.1        The method of testing the barriers adopted by

    Eastwood and Partners has already been commented on by Elrond

i   Engineering Ltd. The practice of discounting the permanent


I
I
I
I
I
i
I   deflection recorded on the first and second load application in

    the series of three load applications was bad engineering

I   practice and gave a misleading impression of the strength of


I   the barriers.      In particular barrier 124A would have failed

    the test if it had been conducted in a proper manner.

I   4.2          Previous deficiencies in the test procedure are

I   indicated by the test performed on 26 June 1990 which resulted

    in the failure of barrier 123 which previously had been tested
I   by Eastwood and Partners and reported to be in a satisfactory


I   condition.



I   4.3          The Barrier Testing Record Sheets prepared by

    Eastwood and Partners contain data which should have put a
I   responsible engineer on notice that certain of the barriers


i   were in a deteriorated condition, even if they satisfied the

    load test requirement specified in the Green Guide.     As shown

I   by the tests on the new-style barriers, not only should the

    deflections under load be fully recoverable, but very similar
!   deflections should be recorded during each of the repeated load


I   applications. The occurrence of anomalously high deflections

    such as those recorded on barriers 124A, 133, 136, 137, 138,

I   142, 143 and 144; the occurrence of less than 100% recovery on


I
I
I
!
I    unloading such as observed on barriers 124, 124A, 129, 136,

      137, 138, 140, 141 and 144; and the occurrence of variable
I    deflections during repeated loading such as reported for


I    barriers 124A, 129, 131, 136 and 137, should have warned the
     engineer responsible for the tests that a number of the

I    barriers were performing in an abnormal manner which demanded

     further investigation. Had such investigations been carried
I    out, they would have revealed the weakened condition of the


I    barriers.

I                 THEORETICAL EVALUATION OF BARRIERS

I                       AN ELEVATION OF THE SUPPORTS



I   1.0   The construction of the 1929 vintage barriers is

I         a     a tubular straight horizontal rail


I         b     strapped to supports and fixed with two nuts and

                bolts

I               a cheek plate riveted twice to each of the legs of

                the support
I               a rear leg of 2" x 2" x I/4" angle with the forward


I               flange cut short at the top

                a front leg of the similar section forged to a

I               curve at the top the end matching into the rear leg

                cut-out
I               the bottom of both legs concreted into the terrace


I               steps and the ash fill below



I   2.0   The presumption is made that the top sections of both

          legs and the cheek plate act as a rigid section.

I   3.0   The resultant tensile force causes bending about XX and

          YY axes. The stresses are summated in Equation [I]

I         below.    The sectional area is reduced to allow for the


I         rivet hole opening.      No reduction has been made to the

          inertia about XX or YY axes thus giving a higher bound

I         conservative solution.

I
I         There are four axes about which     bending can take place,

          these are the XX, YY, UU and VV axes shown in figure LI.

I         When the barrier is restrained laterally by the top rail,


I         it has been presumed that no bending occurs around the UU

          or VV axes.    Once restraint is released bending will

I         tend to occur on the diagonal axes.



I         BARRIER 124A


I         Mathematical analysis of the centre support on Cads

          Analyse programme was made in April 1990 using HSE (yield
I         stress figures). This shows commencement of failure at


I         a horizontal rail load of 5.25 kN/m [359 Ibf/ft] which is



I                                  3
!
!
           only 87% of the Appendix C test load of 6kN/m [411

           Ibf/ft]. The initial failure at the lower rivet hole is

           at the top of the rear leg under combined tension and

           bending.



     6.0   If the rear leg was able to sustain this loading there

           would be a failure of the front leg near to its top under

           combined compression (crippling) and bending at a

           horizontal force oF 6 kN/m [411 Ib/ft].       If the rear leg

           has already failed the horizontal force required to cause

           front leg cripping is less than this figure.



     7.0      There are two further thresholds of failure at the

              bottom of the legs.       These will occur at theoretical

              loads of 6.1 kN/m and 7.0 kN/m.


I    8.0   The rail is theoretically capable of carrying up to 7


-I         kN/m without fracture in bending.       However, the

           deflections under loads substantially less than this are

I          considerable. Structural members such as this are

           usually limited by acceptab e deflections of no greater
I          than 1/125th of the span.       In a 2.2m [7’-3"] rail the

i          limiting deflection would be 0.69 inch or 17.6mm.

i         the support is theoretically 2.36mm [3/32 inches].

!   Extracts from APPRAISAL OF EXISTING STRUCTURES published in

    July 1980 by the Institution of Structural Engineers under the

I   aegis of an ad hoc Committee chaired by Professor E Happold,

    ex-officio members included Presidents in years 1976 - 1980
I
I   2.2   The Engineer will need to clarify the brief and its

          implications ....   To define the line of responsibility to

I         reach definite conclusions and to state these clearly.


l   2.3   No Engineer can avoid responsibility for his actions.


I         However, if the appraising Engineer states his opinions

          and advice clearly, gives the basis for these and can be

I         seen to have acted wholly objectively and prudently, he

          should have no need to fear legal action against him even
I         if his opinions are later proved wrong or his advice

I         unsound.



!         The duty of care and professional respons’bility of the


!         Engineer practising the profession which by its nature

          demands some special skill, ability or experience carries

!         with it a duty to exercise to a reasonable extent the



I
I
!
I
!
II         amount of skill, abi ity and experience which that

           practice demands. This duty is owed not only to those


II         parties with whom he has contractual arrangement, but

           also to all persons who are so closely or directly

II         affected by the negligent act that they ought reasonably

           to have been foreseen as likely to suffer from that act.
i
l    3.1   It may therefore occasionally be necessary to take a Code

           formula and work back using first principles to find the

I          assumptions made in its derivation. There is no absolute

           measure of adequate safety and even less of
!          serviceability. There does however exist a generally


I          accepted level of safety provided by design and

           construction in accordance with current Regulations and

I          Codes of Practice. This level of safety should be used

           as a datum, but when assessing existing structures,

           engineering judgment should take precedence over

           compliance for the detailed clauses of Codes. The

           Engineer should ....   be aware of his responsibility for

           public safety and decide whether to report factors or

           findings not covered by the original brief.
!
           The collapse of a member that could lead to loss of life
il         should be treated with an entirely different level of


!

I
!
I           concern than structural distress merely affecting

            serviceability.

I           When failures are investlgated they are usually found to

!           be caused by combinations of several factors. It is rare

            for failures to be attributable to shortcomings that
I           would be shown up by a conventional design calculation.


!           This should be borne in mind when planning the

            calculation checks.

I           For an existing structure with unchanged use, it is the

!           magnitude of the existing deflections that is important

            and whether they are likely to increase. Care should be

I           taken to distinguish between deflections caused by


I           permanent load and those arising from fluctuations in

            imposed load.

i   3.2.2    The structure should be visited to make a survey of its


I           condition. It may be necessary to determine what

            loadings the structure has been subjected to as well as

I           the intended or probable future loading. In the case of

            structural defects, damage or lack of serviceability, it
I           ~ilI also be necessary to determine the nature of these


I           situations and the parts affected. The condition will



                                  3
!
     first be assessed visually. Advice is given on this in
I   Appendix 4. (as follows)


I   Visible Defects Appendix 4 Structural Steelwork.


I   Visible Defects - excessive deformations resulting from


!   distorted or buckled members. Possible Cause -

    overloading. Investigations Suggested - structure may be

I   unsafe, therefore assess conditions and give

    consideration to closure and temporary support; check
I   original: original member design, existing load


!   conditions, effectiveness of connections.



I   Visible Defect - slight waviness or Iocalised buckling or

    bulging generally at or near points of support or

I   concentrated loads. Possible Cause - local yielding due

    to overload. Investigations Suggested - check actual

1   load, shear and bearing capacities.


I   Visible Defect - poor appearance of welds.     Possible

    Cause - unsatisfactory welding.
I   Suggested - test for adequacy.
                                       Investigations




I   Visible Defect - hairlines or slight gaps on edges of


I   material often revealed by flame cutting or near



I
I
I
!
I
!
I           weldments. Possible Cau~ - lamellar tearing.

             Investigation Suggested - non destructive testing.
!
            Visible Defect - corrosion. Possible Cause -

I           environmental attack. Investigations Suggested -

            ascertain cause. Is sufficient sound material remaining
I           to support the applied loading?


!   3.2.3     The initial assessment. Checks should be made of the

I           load carrying capacity of the structure and the margins

            of safety by calculation using the available information
I           on actual loads and on the size and strength of the


I           materials and components. In particular, the inherent

            stability and the adequacy of the construction should be

I           looked at. In these calculations it will be necessary to

            make assumptions about the distribution of loading and
!           the strength of materials. Such assumptions should be


1           conservative.



!   3.2.6     Load testing. Calculations should be carried out to

            predict as far as possible the results before the tests
I           are carried out. This is to establish approximately the


I           amount of loading required and the magnitude of



I
!
i
I
I
!
l            deflections to be measured. A calculation that predicts

             the result before the test is carried out will also carry


!            more weight than a simflar calculation performed after

             the load test.

!
     4.1.5
i              Survey condition. An important part of the survey is

             to determine the physical condition of the


li           construction ....   (which) .....   should be approached with

             an open mind without prejudging the cause of any apparent

l            defects since the complexity of each structure’s history

             prevents all possible combinations of defects and their
I            causes befng defined.

          under an overload to confirm that an adequate margin of
I         safety exists under service loads. Where there has been

          will not normally lead to collapse.

    4.2.3.4 Instrumentation. It is important to provide measuring
i         devices at the supports as well as at mid span of


l         flectural members in order to eliminate errors from

          column shortening and bearing bedding in.

    4.2.3.5 Loading. To ensure that the desired loading
I         conditions are obtained (this) restraint should be


I         minimised, for example by the use of ball seatings or

          rollers. Distributed loading may be simulated by using a

I         number of jacks or by single jacks with load bearing

          spreader beams.
I
i   4.2.3.6 The load should be applied incrementally at a

          controlled rate without impact. A full set of

I         observations should be recorded at each increment, and

          graphs should be plotted of observations at critical

          points on the structure as the test proceeds, to obtain an


!        assessment of the response and the possible onset of



I                               7

I   failure. Once any non-linearity is observed the

l   structure should be unloaded and the recovery recorded.

    At this stage it may be desirable although expensive to
!   unload and reload after every few increments. In any


I   case a careful inspection of the structure should be made

    at each increment of load and the progress of any local

I   damage noted.

I
I
I
I
          2.1     TERMS OF REFERENCE
                  The f’u~t stage is the receipt in wriffng of a brief from the client in which he states Iris
                  requirements, dates for reporting and confidentiality. It is essential to find OUt at the
                 start exactly what the client needs. ,.how .d~filed the appraisal is to be and to what use
                 the results are to be put. An apprmsmg engineer must recognize that he may be called in
                 by someone who does not understand or define his Problem. Thus it may fall to the
                 engineer to develop his own brief, together with the cheat.
                 The client will probably be in one of the following categories, each ofwhlch may require
                 a different approach to the appraisal and a different type of report:
                            ¯ government deparhnent
                            ¯ national corporation

                           ¯ property company
                           ¯ private owner
                          ¯ corporate or private tenant

                          ¯ insurance company
     2.2 POINTS TO BE ESTABLISHED
                The engineer will need:
                         ¯ to clarify the brief and its implicat/ous with the client and to state these in

    2.3     RESPONSIBILITIES
           No engineer can avoid responsibility for his actions. However, ff the appraising
           engineer states his opinions and advice clearly, gives the bases for these and can be seen
           to have acted wholly objectively and prudently, he should have no need to fear legal
           action against him even ifhis opinions are later proved wrongor his advice unsound.

I             The engineer should:
                      ¯ decide whether the brief is morally and professio~lly acceptable; decide
!                         whether to accept it, reject it or persuade the cfient to alter it
                      ¯ remain objective at all times
                      ¯ be aware ofkls responsibility for public safety and decide whether to report
                           factors or findings not covered by the original brief
I                      ¯ respect the reputations and feelings of others involved; in particular to
                          avoid defamation by irrelevant or derogatory statements even if this is
                          apparently in the cfient’s interests

I                     ¯ avoid playing too safe in the appraisal or giving undue thought to personal
                         responsibilities rather’than the client’s best interest
             A notez by Lord Justice Graham on duty of care and professional responm~oility states:

I            ’It is not possz"ole nor appropriate.., to define duty of care and professional
             responsibifity in any detail. Apart from cases where there can be shown to be breach of
             contract, this is a matter largely based on the Common Law of negligence, which is
             being developed from day to day by the Courts. The following are some general
I            principles of the law, as it stands at present, which may help to clarify the position in
             regard to negligence.
             Dm~y of care

!            The professional person has a duty, just as much as anyone else, in the particular
             circumstances to exercise reasonable care to avoid acts and omissions which can be
             reasonably foreseen to be likely to cause physical or financial injury to persons or
            property. Negligence is failure to exercise that care.

i           The practice of a profession, art or calling which, by its nature, demands some special
            skill, ability or experience, carries with it a duty to exercise, to a reasonable extent, the
            mnount of skill, ability and experience which that practice demands. If a person

I           professing to practise such a profession, art or calling fails to possess that amount of
            skill, ability and experience which is usual in that profession, art or calling or if he
            neglects to use the skill, abifity and experience which be possesses or which is
            demanded or professed, he will be liable for breach of duty. This duty is owed not only

i           to those parties with whom he has a contractual arrangement, e.g. by whom he has been
            employed or consulted, but also to all persons who are so closely ordirectly affected by
            the negligent act that they ought reasonably to have been foreseen as likely to suffer
            from that act.

!           Duty of care thus arises where there is such proximity between two persons that the
            negligence of one is likely to affect the other injuriously.
            Liability for damages
I           Liabifity attaches to negligence not only where it is the sole effective cause but where it
            is also a contributory cause of an injury.
            Negligence of a professional person thus gives rise to liability under Common Law in
i           ton, apart from the more obvious liability for breach of contract. Where an employee is
            negligent, both he and his employer will normally be liable. A person who has been sued
            for negligence, although fiable himself, may in some circumstances, be able to pass on
            his liabllty to semeone else (e.g. an independent contractor or a professional man who is
I           actually.responsible, for the particular negligent act).
            ~n all cases, it is for the courts to decide who, if anyene, is liable. The position in any
            given case will depend on the particular facts and circumstances of that case, and the
            taking oflegel advice should be considered as soon as any serious question of liability
I           seems likely to arise...
            Further information can be found in Halsbury’s Laws of England: Negligence (VOI.
            28), 3rd Edition, and 1977 Supplement.’

     2.4 REPORTING

l   2.4.1   General considerations
            The writing of the report requires much careful thought, review and redraflmg. The
            meaning of each sentence must be examined critically. The report will often be used by

I           non-technical readers and lawyers, and it must therefore be simple and clear. At the
            same time it must be technically accurate and precise, and proper weight must be given
            to interpretation. Symbols and abbreviations must be generally uv-derstod or be given
            precise meaning to avoid confusion.

I           The report should be logical, have continuity and be easy to follow. The contents must
            be relevant to the brief, nothing of importance should be leR out or any unnecessary
            materials included. The report must be based on factual data and should be objective in
            approach. Any reservations or limitations implicit in the method, technique employed
            or interpretations of results should be clearly stated.

       3.1 GENERAL
!             Structural appraisal is a different activity/tructural design. It is aimed at assessing
              the real condition of an existing structure.
              The adequacy of a structure is assessed by the exercise of engineering.judgment

           Certain phenomena require extra care in the formulation of the ntSumptions for their

          structure or member is likely to be sudden (e.g. failure
          reinforced concrete beams). Similarly, the                      of cast iron beams or over-
          of life should be treated with an entirelycollapse of a member that conkt lead to loss

I       an estimate should be made of the deflections to be expected, and the effect on the
       intended use should be assessed. Care should be taken to distinguish between
       deflections caused by Permanent load and those arising from fluctuations in imposed
       load. Similarly, the effects of creep deflections on finishes should be considered.
I     The importance of assessing loads adequately is vital especially if there is risk of
      overloading arising from change in use.

I    .The total number ofmanhours available for assessment will generally be limited, and it
     .is important that the time should be spent as effectively as possible. It is easy to get so
     revolved with the details of a particular calculation that other equally important
     calculations are given only a small amount of time or COmpletely forgotton. For

    It may therefore be useful to set out a fist of the calculations as envisaged and check the

    numerical work.
    When failures are investigated they are usually found to be caused by emnbinafions of

I   several factors. It is rare for failures to be attributable to shortcominga that would be
    shown up by a conventional design calculation. This should be borne in mind when
    planning the calculation checks.                     ..


I   THE PATH OF ASSESSMENT: THE FLOW CHARTS
    Introduction
I   The process of appraisal is cyclical as shown in the flow charts (see Figs. 1 and 2).
    Information is collected and assessed. If the result shows that the structure is adequate
    the process can stop there. If inconclusive more information can be collected, assessed
I   more thoroughly and so on. The action required should be taken in stages, each stage
    depending on the findings of the previous one.
    The stages can be as given in clauses 3.2.2 to 3.2.6 below.

I    3.2.2      Gathering of information
                Information should be gathered about the design of the structure, its construction,
I              histocy and present appearance. Documents containing this information may not still
               be in ey, istence, but an attempt should be made to locate and examine what is available.
               Suggestions for this are given in sub-section 4.1 and Appendix 1.

i              The structure should be visited to make a survey of its condition (see Appendixes 2 and
               3). Precisely what is done will depend on the reuon for the appraisal Where purchase
               or change of use is being considered the dimensions of individual members, accuracy in
               coostruction and the type and quality of the materials may be relevant. It may also be

I   3.2.3 The initial assessment
              The information to hand should now be studied and analysed. Checks should be made
              oftbe load-carrying capacity of the structure and the margins of sefety by calculation
              using the available information on actual loads and on the size and strength of the
             materiah and components. In particular, the inherent stability and the adequacy of the
             construction should be looked at. In these calculations it will be necessary to make

I            assumptions about the distribution of loading and the strength of materials. Such
             assumptions should be conservative.
             The f’ust calculation will practically always be a simple conventional design
             calculation. This may lead to one of three possible conclusions:


                                                          14
I
           (i) The calculations show that the structure has an adequate margin of safety

I               according to the relevant code of practice.
                If the engineer is satisfied that the Code reconunea~tions are adequate for
                the likely use of the structure, and if the visual examination of the strucn~e
                has not revealed any signs of distress, it shouldbe necessary only to re-
I               check the assumptions to guard against gross error before pronouncing the
                structure safe. The possibility of such modes of failure as fatigue or unseen
                corrosion should be considered. If the structure however does show signs
                of distress a more careful recheck of the survey and the calculation must be
I               undertaken.
           (fi) The calculations indicate that the structure is grossly overloaded to the
                 extent that the calculated overall factor of safety is unity or less.

I                If the structure nevertheless is carting its load without any signs of
                 overstress and generally appears in good order the basis of the calculation
                 must be examined for error.
                 If the structure has been seen to be badly crac~ad, grossly deflected or
I                collapsed, the type of failure should be compared to that predicted by the
                 calculations.
           (fii) The calculations indicate a factor of safety greater than unity but less than
                 that recommended by the codes and the structure shows little if any
                 indication of overload.
                 In this case a revised calculation is called for using a refined mathematical
                 mndel that takes account of diverging (alternative) load paths and
                 secondary load-carrying mechanisms.
    The flow charts (Pigs. 1 and 2) indicate the general sequence that the process will
    follow and show the cyclic paths along which such assessments usually proceed. They
    will not apply in toto to all appraisals and may not be complete for certain situations.
    They are, however, considered to provide to provide useful food for thought.
    There will obviously he occasions when deviations from the sequence will be
    beneficial. For example, when a member shows visible distress, a simple check on this
    member should he carried out t’~t.
    Weak point are as common at connections as in members. Where the flow charts read
    ’element’, this should therefore he interpreted as ’member and/or connections’.


            [i] A mechanism is a system that, because of the disposition and number of
                  members and/or the freedom of the joints to deform without increase in
                  moment, is inherently unstable.
            [2] At this stage the check is for overall stability.
            [3] This is equivalent to the check for Building Regulations DI7 and DI8
                  (’the 5th Amendment’). These are legally applicable only to buildings of
                  over four storeys for which building regulation approval was sought after
                  the 5th Amendment came into force in 1970.
                  ’Simple’ refers to the absence of assumptions and/or procedures beyond
             [4] those normally used in initial design. The ’frame analysis’ may at first be
             [5] no more than reasonable estimates of support moments, but a proper
                   analysis may be necessary when ’recycling’. ’Check satisfied’ means that
                   the calculation indicates (possibly by inference) that the recommend-
                   ations of the relevant Code of Practice could be shown to be observed.
                   [2"] may depend on the outcome of some of the calculations referred to
                   under [4] and [5] and these latter are obviously repeated for each element
                   in turn.
              [6] A visit to the site should be made at this stage to confirm that the
                   parameters used in the calculations are realistic.
              [7] Drastic deficiency means that the calculated overallload factor is less than
                    1.1 for dead load only.
              [8] If, for example, the element under consideration provides lateral restraint
                    on which a compression member (or just a compression flange) reties to
                    prevent it buckling, then early yielding (say, as prerequisite for load
                    sharing) could deprive the possibly more essential compression member of
                    some of its lateral restraint.

                  436014. In these acircumstances 7m may be assumed to have a value of 1.07. In other

i   3.2.5.4   Calculations requiring special consideration
              GENERAL             "
I              While most engineering calculations do not in any way represent the real structural
               behavionr they do however in most cases, when used with the customary safety factors,
               result in structures that are safe and serviceable. Certain types ofstructuraJ behaviour
              are however not amenable to accurate prediction by calculation so that safety factors
              used in calculations will not necessarily ensure safety. Uufommately the types of
              failure that are most difficult to predict accurately also tend to be the most sudden and
              therefore present the most danger to life.

I             Perhaps the greatest danger is the use of a formula in a situation where it is not directly
              applicable. If the formula is obtained from a recognized code or standard there should
              be no danger provided that the formula is used exactly as intended in the document.


!             Formulas from textbooks have usually been derived for idealized, simplified conditions
              and will give values applicable for those conditions only. The Euler formula, for
              example, will give the exact elastic critical load for a straight pin-ended bar, but does
              not include parameters such as yield strength and initial bow which are necessary to

i                                                                  19
                        ¯ Ifa Code of Practice or British Standard formula is used to check buckling
                          does the accuracy of construction of the structure corresponded to that
                          assumed in the Code or Standard?
               CONNECTIONS
              The rigorous analysis of connections is extremely difficult, and it is oRen only the
              ductifity of most engineering materials that enable calculations to give re.dis that
              predict actual failure loads.
              Certain connections have to be checked for imposed displacements caused by
              temperature movements, foundation settlement, etc. This applies particularly when the
             connection is the ’weakest link in the chain’ so that movement is concentrated at the
             connection.
             If, as is often the case connections are hidden, so that their condition cannot be fully
             ascertained by inspection, no reduction of safety factors should be comtemplated.

            BOLTED CONNECTIONS
            Bolted and riveted connections should be checked to ensure that the fasteners are in
            good condition (e.g. not loose) and of a type and number adequate to transmit the
            service loading.
            High-strength friction-group bolted joints should also be inspected for satisfactory
            contact of the laying surfaces and absence of corrosion between them. A cheek should
            also be made with a torque wrench for the existence of adequate shank tension.


I          WELDED JOINTS
           These should be checked to ensure that the welds are of a size and type adequate to
           transmit the required loads and inspected for cracking or other signs of deterioration.

I
    3.2.6 Load testing
           The real behaviour of certain structural arrangements is sometimes not amenable to

I          calculation. Ifa structure appears to be adequate but the calculations at this stage fail to
           demonstrate an acceptable margin of safety, it may be worth while to:
                     ¯ load test the structure within the elastic range to examine the manner in
                         which it actually distributes loading
I                    ¯ remove components from the structure to test to failure in the laboratory
                     ¯ isolate part of the structure and test it to failure
                     ¯ test the complete structure under an overload.

I         Advice on the decision as to testing requirements is given in sub-section 4.2.
          Calculations should be carried out to predict as far as possible the results before the
          tests are carried out. This is to establish approximately the amount of loading required

I         and the magnitude of deflections to be measured. A calculation that predicts the result
          before the test is carried out wil also carry more weight than a similar calculation
          performed after the load test.


I         The procedure to interpret the test results should be decided before the tests are
          commenced so that the instrumentation can be arranged to providethe relevant data
         necessary for the calculations.
         If calculations to predict test results are based on Codes of Practice, partial factors of

I        safety should be assumed equal to 1.0 and material strengths and stiffness adjusted to
         expected rather than minimum values.
         Load tests have the effect of reducing uncertainty. Safety factors in calculations

I        subsequent to load tests can be adjusted accordingly. Care must be taken to ensure that
         only the correct part of the safety factor is reduced, e.g. ifa water-retaining structure is
         filled with water and the induced stresses are measured accurately in various
         components then if there is no pbssibility of a denser liquid ever being stored it could be

I        argued that the factor 3’f could be reduced to 1.0 for the assessment of those
         ~mponents: This is
          ng consinered, annincorrect since "},f
                              this portion       alsomust
                                             of 3’f   has to account for the importance of the limit
                                                          remain.
         There will be occasions when it is impossible to carry out reliable calculations or
I        impractical to perform load tests to assess directly the level of safety of a structure. In
         such situations any other information that can lead to a conclusion regarding adequacy
         is of great use. Other data that could be used include:

I                  ¯ an estimate of the ratio between the maximum load taken by the structure
                      in the past and that likely in the future (= RL).
                   ¯ an estimate of the ratio between the load at which signs of distress would
                      become apparent and the load to cause collapse (=Rs); if brittle failure is
i                     possible then Rs must be taken as 1.0.

I    4.7. TESTING
    4.2.1     Determination of testing requirements
I             The requiren~.nts for testing will depend on the outcome or’ the survey.
              There is no need for testing where the survey provides sufficient information to enable
              the engineer to complete the appraisal and reach conclusions and recamm~-tions
I             with confklence. This situation will occur where:
                        s the structure is clearly in a sound condition without defects and the physical
                           dimensions found in the survey allow calculations to confirm the suitability
I                          of the structure for its intended future use
                        s visual defects or the poor condition of the struetm~ point to obvious
                           eonclusious that meet the requirements of the brief.

I             Requirements for testing will arise in other situations where, for example:
                        ¯ there is a lack of information, on what materials are present in the
                        s the presence of deteriorated or deleterious materials is suspected.
I            Where testing is needed it is necessary for the engineer to make an assessment of what
             further information is needed. The purpose of particular tests and the information that
             they can provide must be undem, cod so that the right tests are carried out.

I            Available test tec2~ques cover a wide range of cost and complexity, the engineer
             shonld ~ in a logical way. S~ne tests lead to little ~. At the other extreme
             it may be necessary to remove the structure from service while tests are undertaken. In
             some circumstances the cost of testing rnny be such that immediate remedial action will
I            provide the mint economic solution. Appropriate experience may be necessary to see
             that some types or’test are carried out successfully, and specialist advice may be needed
            to interpret the re~ts.

I           Types of test can be divided into those that give a loe~A measurement of a dimension,
            material integriW or material condition, composition or property and those that give a
            direct indication of the performance of a struct~-e or structural element. It is often
            necessary to use a combination ~ testing techniques.
I           Tests providing local measurement are described in clause 4.2.2 and Appendix 6.
            Since these tests are local it is necessary for the engineer to decide on the number oe
            tests and their locations so that representative samples are obtained. Usually there are

I           typical dimensions or material characteristics in structural elemem. If not the
            dimensioas ofthe complete strucau’e must be established, which can be used laterin the
            appraisal. Minimum values or average values may be required. In either case, several
            tests will be needed.

I           The numbers of tests and location will depend on the particular ~m~,utanc~s and
            should be decided by the engineer remembering that:
                    (i) the likely variation in material properties within and between parts ofthe
I                   (u) the probable critical locations
                   (m) the possible errors in the test procedure
I                  0v) different techniques may measure properties of different volumes, e.g. in
                                   ultrasonic-pulse-velocity measurements indicate the average
                         quality through the depth whereas core tests measure to only 100-300 ram
                         dep
I           These factors will nfi’eet the consistency (scatter) of the results and hence the strength
            obtained by standard statistical procedures, the confidence level appropriate to which
            will into’ease with the number of results. Guidance on interpretation of the results of
I           tests which give an indication of strength is available in some cases (e.g. for concrete
            structures see reference 9).
            Tests that give a direct indication of structural performance are discussed in clause

I           4.2.3.

I               The engineer carrying out an appraisal will rarely cany out the tests Hmself, but he
                should be present to observe and supervise the work. Thus this clause does not give
               detailed information on test techniques but identifies the types of test that are available,
               what information they give, and their advantages and limitations.
I              If a s.ample of .concrete is being obtained it may be posss~ele to carry out a complete
               chemical analysis of the constituents. However, this analysis can be broken down in separate
               parts depending on what information is required. For example the main interest would

I              Where steel samples are required and can be removed from a structure, all the tests
                           ¯
               descanted (including

               be carried out on a comparatively small sample of material. The largest piece required

I             is likely to be for a standard tensile test specimen. When it is possible to obtain only
              non-standard size test specimens (i.e. miniature pieces of different shape) the results
              must be carefully considered since they may not be representative nor give a true
              indication of actual properties.

I            Available test techniques are summarized in Tables 1--5, with further details of the

                                 This test would be carried out on a mass-produced stmctm-e or structural

                                     moae oz zaamre or to obtain an esthnate of the failure load of the
                                remaining similar structures or s" etural elements. Any such estimate
                                must take account of the inherent variation between structures and the

I                               variabilhy of the strength of materials, arishag from the processes of
                                manufacture and construction. Non-destructive measurements, as des-
                               ca’/bed in clause 4.2.2 and Appendix 6, can assist in this.

I                              Such a test may be carried out by isolating the structure or element and
                               testing it to failure in situ or by removing it to the laboratory. The choice
                               will be governed by relative costs and consideration of the praotical
                               difficulties.

I                     (iv) Dynamic testing
                              It is sometimes necessary to ascertain the dynamic behavionr of a
                              structure or to assess its remaining fatigue life. The dynamic behaviour can
                              be assessed on the basis of measurements of vibration ampfitudes at
I                             different frequencies in service conditions or under imposed dynamic test
                              loads. Fatigue fife may be assessed, when many identical components
                             have been subjected to similar fatigue loading, by removing a number of

I                            components for fatigue testing to failure in a laboratory.
                             Alternatively, the st~sses at the stress raiser in the component may be
                             calculated and the fatigue life estimated from data on specimens with the
                             same stress concentration factor. 74

I          Free-standing structures, e.g. unclad frames,must be stayed against lateral collapse.
           Provision must be made to restrict movement at failure. This may be done with chocks
           or layers of timber, which can be removed progressively as the test proceeds.

I          For load tests on beam or slab structures, scaffolding or loose props that do not interfere
           with the observed deflections but which are strong enough to withstand the impact of the
          structure in the event of collapse should be provided.

I         As the collapse load will usually exceed the safe capacity of the floor below this will
          have to be ’propped through’ to the next and perhaps the third floor below. (If tbe test
          load is applied by dead weight the impact load of the collapsing floor could be about
          twice its total static load.)

I   A5.4.5 Remedial measures
             In some situations, replacement of a damaged member may be the most practical and
i            economic solution. Elsewhere, reinstatement will be justified in order to avoid
             inconvenience and loss or damage to other structural members.
             Where new members are connected to existing ones, monolithic action must be

I           ensured; this calls for careful preparation of the concrete surfaces and continniW of
            steel. For reinstatement, the removal ofall loose friable concrete is essential, to ensure
            adequate bonding. Extra reinforcement should be fixed by experienced welders.
            New concrete may be placed either by casting with formwork or by the gnnite method;g°
I           with the latter it may be possible to avoid increasing the original dimensions of the
            member. The choice of method will depend on the thickness of the new concrete, the
            surface finish required, the possibility of placing and compacting concrete in the aw~a.~  91. A~ ef~ amm~

     A5.5   ANALYSIS AND REPAIR OF STEEL STRUCTURES
I           In general, a structural steel member remaining in place, with negligible or minor
            distortions to the web, flanges or end connections should be considered satisfactory for
            further service. The exception will be for the relatively small number of structures in

I           cold-worked or tempered steel where there may be permanent loss of strength. The
            change in strength may be assessed using estimates of the maximum temperatures
            attained or on-site tests; if necessary, the steel should be replaced. Microscopy can be
            used to determine changes in microstrucmre. Since this is a specialized field, the

I           services of a metallurgist are essential.

     A5.6 ANALYSIS AND REPAIR OF BRICK STRUCTURES
I           It will be possible to determine from the culour change of the mortar or of the bricks
            themselves the degree of beating of the wall. For solid brickwaib without undue
            distortion the portion beyond the pink or red boundary may be considered as
            serviceable and calculations made accordingly, Perforated and hollow brick walls
I           should be inspected carefully for the effects of thermal shock and may need
            replacement. Plastered bricks sometimes suffer little damage and may need replace-
            ment of the surface treatment only.

i    A5.7 ANALYSIS AND REPAIR OF TIMBER STRUCTURES
            BS 5268: Part 4: Section 4.1 can be used to analyse the residual strength ofmembers
            that have been subjected to a fire. Generally, any wood that has not charred could be
I           considered to have full strength. It may be possible to show by calculation that a timber
            section or structure which has been subjected to f’u’e still has adequate strength once the
            affected surfaces are cleaned off(by planing, sanding etc.). Where additional strength is

I           required it may be possible to provide this by gluing on strengthening pieces or
            otherwise replacing lost strength. Joints that may have opened and metal fixings that
            may have conducted heat to the interior are points of weakness that should be carefully
            examined.
I
     A5.8 TEST LOADING
            Analysis of the damage and assessment of the necessary repairs may be possible within
I           a reasonable degree of accuracy, but final acceptance may depend on proofby load test.
            Performance is generally judged in terms of recovery of deflection after removal of the
            load.

      anomalous response to welding.

      T25 Drillings and spectrographic analysis- ’spot’ tests
      These tests will enable material composition to be ascertained. A small amount of
      drillings can usually be taken from non-critical areas in most steel plates, sections and,
      with care, even reinforcement. These can be submitted for full chemical analysis by wet
      methods, or for selective analysis by spectrography.
     In situ ’spot’ tests of an elementary nature can sometimes identify some elements, but
     this is a crude method and not recommended.

I    The objective of this test is to determine the value of the critical crack opening
     displacement at the tip of the defect at the onset of stable and or unstable orck extension.

I    1"27 Wrought iron and cast iron
     The presence of wrought iron and cast iron should be expected in all 19th Century
     structures. The structural use of these materials diminished with the introduction of
I    steel in the 1880s and effectively ceased by the 1930s.
    (a) Wrought iron
    Although not easily distinguishable chemically from a low-carbon steel, wrought iron
I   may readily be identified by its characteristic laminated struclxu-e. If a small patch is
    ground on the surface to remove scale and expose the clean metal, which is then
    polished with f’me abrasive paper, the filaments of slag, which are visible through a hand
    magnifying glass, will identify the material as wrought iron. In longed elements -- such
I   as clevises, brackets, eye-bars -- the direction of the lamination should be checked to
    identify areas in which tension stress occurs normal to the plane of lamination.
    Forge welding was a common practice in fabricating structural elements. The presence
I   of welds in, for example, eye-bar ends, large bars with threaded ends, or where there is a
    marked change in section, should be suspected and non-destructive tests made to verify
    the soundness of the weld. As the laminations of wrought iron constitute internal flaws,
    crack detection techniques are of little use in determining its integrity. Visual
I   examination, if possible supplemented by tension test samples, must be used. The
    surface of the sample should also be examined for stamp marks that identify its quality.
    Co) Cast iron
i   Cast iron may sometimes be identified by the apearance on its surface of evidence of the
    casting process -- sand marks, mould joints. The reaction of the metal to cutting with a
    sharp file will normally distinguish it from steel. It may also be identified by drilling,
    which will result in fragmented swaff. Beams with unequal flanges, or of unusually thick
I   section, should be suspected as being made of cast iron.
    Cast-iron members must be examined for cracks and for soundness (i.e. casting defects)
    by any of the NDT methods previously described. Additionally, dimensional aocura~
i   (e.g. constancy of wall thickness) should be checked.

    T28 Cables
    The comments below refer to structural cables and not to those used in lifting gear or
    other mechanical equipment,
    If the original specification is available a check shou~d be made to see if the cable was

I   prestretched (normally by the manufacturer). Subsequent stretching in service, which
    may be checked by measuring the sag or alignment of adjacent structural elements and
    comparison with the original design, will normally indicate significant damage.

i   Appraisal is generally by visual examination, beating in mind that:

                          damage is most likely to occur at the ends (terminations), the
                          outer wires generally falling before the inner ones
I                         examination of the ends for signs of relative movement between
                          the cable and socket or end ~onnection, which indicates pulling

I    This highlights at paragraph 18 the suggestion that there

     should have been at least one turnstile for each 1,000
I    spectators. Even that on the basis of 750 persons per hour per

     turnstile still leaves the I0, I00 spectators for the West

     Terrace an hour and 20 minutes to gain access at a free smooth

     flow.



!    Paragraph 17 considers the prime cause of death was due to

     overcrowding. However, the estimate of capacity in paragraph

     18 on the basis of 5.4 persons per square metre was 2,000 for


!    the central pens. These numbers are closely related to the

     number of persons shown in the relevant photograph as being in


I    occupation at kick off time. Thus, the overcrowding issue is

     not as great a significance as the failure of the barrier 124a.
I    This is a subject which is not addressed.


I    The subject that is addressed is that it is necessary if there

     is to be fencing between the spectators and the pitch, then
i    there should be the opportunity for the fence to be opened


It   quickly. In other words, a proper means of escape.

         HILLSBOROUGH STADIUM DISASTER INQUIRY
i
         June 1989
I        INTRODUCTION

1        J     The Secretary to     the Inquiry wrote on behalf of the Rt Hon Lord


I              Justice Taylor to
               Committee on the
                                     the Secretary of the Institute’s Building Control
                                    23 May 1989 inviting the submission of written


1             material.


     2.        Lord Justice Taylor’s terms of reference were stated to be:

1             "To inquire into the events at Sheffield Wednesday Football Ground on

1             15 April 1989 and to make recommendations about the needs of crowd
              control and safety at sports grounds."

!        .    The ,Committee, Chairman Sydney E Bell, Dip Arch (Birm) RIBA, Acting

1             County Architect Nottinghamshire County Council, met at the RIBA on 8
              June 1989.     It had before it the Secretary’s letter dated 23 May 1989


1             and general
             Hillsborough
                             plans and sections of the Sheffield Wednesday ground at
                             which had been provided through the Secretary’s office.
             The Chairman subsequently went to look at the ground and whilst unable
1            to gain access was able to look at the external spaces around the
             ground.       The capacity figures for each stand have been obtained from

!            the Club.



I   4.       We are aware of the general background to the disaster as reported by
             the news media but not of detailed evidence provided to the inquiry

I            and our evidence is therefore limited to observations on the planning
             layout and detail design considerations which may have influenced the
             course of events and suggestions on how these considerations might
!            affect decisions in the future so as to prevent a recurrence.

       SPACE OUTSIDE THE GROUND AND KNCLOSED ARKA
!
       5. We consider the fundamental cause of the disaster to be due to
g           overcrowding.      By overcrowding we mean the number of people within a
            confined space are in excess of the maximum number that space is

i           designed to hold safely.         Overcrowding in any space can be a
            distressing experience for some people but rarely leads to multiple

II          fatalities, nevertheless movement can create local pressures and lead
            to people being crushed.       Where however the floor of the space is

II          sloping
            exerted
                       or stepped the force of gravity will increase the pressure
                       by a crowd on those people at the bottom of the slope, l~e


il          greater    the depth of the slope, i.e. from pitch to the back of the
            crowd, the greater the potential pressure.          Crush barriers are
            therefore frequently introduced to try and        reduce the build up of
ii         pressure.


!     6.    We look at four aspects of crowd control
           admittance to the ground;
                                                               in this paper. First,
                                           secondly, admittance to any enclosure;

!          third, communication and fourth, general safety considerations.



II    7.   The Sheffield Wednesday ground at Hillsborough, like many other club
           grounas situated in an urban environment, is ii~ a builL-u~ area
           surrounded by residential housing, main and residential roads. The
II         ground is hemmed in by the surrounding development and whilst the
           pitch and stands are of a high standard befitting a club of the
i!         stature of Sheffield Wednesday the surrounding space outside the club
           ground is inadequate to provide for the effective supervision and

i          marshalling of large crowds of spectators.


      8.   In particular, while turnstiles serving the North Stand, Spion Cop and
           the whole of the South Stand are dispersed along a length ef 4OOm; the

!          turnstiles serving the remainder of the North Stand and ~he whole of
           the West Stand are all contained within a length of 40m. Furthermore
           the width of the access from Leppings Lane is only 22m and the depth
           of space in front of the turnstiles to the road edge is only in the
           order of 25m.

!
!
I
I
            The dispersal of turnstiles on the east and south boundaries of the
I     .

           ground does provide some space to marshal the crowd but even here
           space is limited, particularly adjacent to Penistone Road North where

l          the pavement is only 5m wide and the road must become obstructed by
           spectators.

l    i0. At the Leppings Lane entrance the confined area does not provide any

!          space where orderly queues at the turnstiles can be formed and would
           appear to provide no opportunity for thee police to exercise any


I          effective control.       For example, 23 turnstiles admitting i0 persons
           per minute would admit 230 people in 1 minute. Ten minutes queuing
           time would result in a crowd outside thee turnstiles of 2,300 which in
I          the space available means they would be packed as tightly as a
           capacity crowd on the terrace. These turnstiles serve half the North

I         Stand and the West Stand and terrace with a capacity of 19,416. It
          therefore would take 1 to 1.5 hours to admit all spectators.

!   ii. The latest edition of the Home Office ’Guide to Safety at Sports


I         Grounds’ is an excellent publication but only makes brief reference in
          para 46 to the need to have contingency plans to deal with situations
          where available entrances at a ground have proved insufficient to stop
I         unduly large crowds from gathering outside. No guidance is given to
          what external space outside turnstiles is desirable and where space is

|         inadequate.
          plans could be.
                            It would be difficult to imagine what those contingency


I   12. The handbook of ’Sports and Recreation Building Design’ published by

I         The Sports Council states "As pedestrian traffic approaches the
          stadium there is much to be said for segregating it from vehicular


I         traffic and immediately surrounding the building there should be a
          clear circulation so as to allow spectators to walk unimpeded around
          the entire stadium. Clearly visible from this ambulatory there should
I         be regularly spaced turnstile positions, sufficient in number to admit
          at a rate fast enough to avoid large admission queues and yet slow
I         enough for the comfortable distribution of spectators within the
          ground." .... "If site dimensions inhibit an external ambulatory, it

l         should be incorporated within the perimeter of the stadium." The



I
!
I
         Hillsborough ground does not fulfil those conditions and we believe
I        the selection of this neutral ground to be unfortunate. In defence of
         those who made the decision we must say that they may have had little
!       alternative and that conditions surrounding other venues might have
        been equally bad.

I    13. We  would recommend that games with this emotional content should only

I       be staged at venues where there are adequate ~ccess and facilities to
        enable effective crowd management to be obtained. For example, The
        Sports Council’s handbook refers to the close proximity’of a railway
I       station and coach parking. Provision for car parking (on street or in
        parks) within a reasonable distance, the ability to obtain access to
!       the entire perimeter   of the enclosed ground and the dispersal of
                                          perimeter adjacent to the particular stand or
        turnstiles around the
I       enclosure they serve.


I   14. Few existing grounds are likely to meet these criteria and if they are
        not available we suggest that a number of regional football stadia may

I       need to be provided in suitable locations where major football events
        could be staged.             We do not recommend multipurpose stadia because
        provision for other sports, and particularly athletics, reduces the
I       quality of experience that a good ~^~.~.I~.~~ s.~,,m ~o.           ~---~=   That
        does not inhibit the use of the stadia for other activities including
I       pop concerts, megastores and specialised supermarkets which could use
       many of the same facilities.

1   15. Although we are advocating the use of stadia which meet the necessary

i      criteria for crowd management for special events we do not see a
       wholesale need for clubs to move from their current sites. The police

!      should advise clubs of the size of crowd they can effectively control
       outside the ground and this should be an additional criteria in


I      determining a ground’s capacity - this may necessitate some clubs with
       a large following moving to more appropriate accommodation and some
       events which will attract a larger than normal crowd being staged away
I      from the home ground.


!                First set of observations are principally concerned with space
                    the enclosed area oF the ground and stands. We would now like

!
I
I
          to comment on the control of crowds in terms of access to terraces and
I         grandstands.



!    ADMITTANCE TO ENCLOSURES



!    17. In our view the prime cause of death on the west central terrace was
         due to overcrowding, i.e. an excessive number of people having
         obtained access to the ground were able to gain uncontrolled access to
I        the prime viewing spot behind the goal.


     18. The ’Handbook of Sports and Recreational Building Design’ recommends
         one turnstile for each 1,000 spectators and that turnstiles should in

I        addition control the dispersal within the ground.             It further
         recommends that standing spectators should be divided into pens with a

I        capacity of about 2,000 and that each pen should have its own pair of
        turnstiles and exits to the perimeter. The-capacity of the central

!       pens on the west terrace is of this order (i.e. 370m2 x 54 persons/lOm
        = 2,000).        However,   there is no separate control to this section at


I       Hillsborough
        more people
                         and the
                         into an
                                    turnstiles would appear to allow considerably
                                    area which serves several enclosures. In that,
        the ground does not conform with good practice.
I
    19. We would agree with the recommendation in the handbook by the Sports

l       Council -      and with that contained in paragraph i01 of the ’Guide to
        Safety at Sports Grounds’ that access to any compound or section of

i       stand should be independently controlled. This should be done so as
        to count the number gaining entry to any compound and stop access once

l       capacity is reached.        It is possible to control access to the ground
        separately from access to individual enclosures and tickets can be


I       collected at either point.         Individual enclosures should, however,
        ideally be equipped with toilet facilities at the minimum and
        refreshment facilities are also desirable.
I
    20. The provision of individual seats is another way of exercising control

I       on numbers and we would recommend seated provision be expanded as more
        in keeping with modern life-styles but not to the exclusion of al!

I      standing provision.          As control in the form we are suggesting will
       cost money it may be acceptable in existing grounds to impose it only


I       tn the most popular areas where pressure on space is always high.


                                                                                      6
!
II
      COMMUNICATIONS
!1    21. The third issue on which we would comment is that of communication.

II        Emergencies happen quickly.     It is difficult for people outside a
          crowd to realise that a serious emergency is developing. The police

I!        outside the ground, in the crowd, realised they had an emergency and
          took some action.     To our knowledge no one in authority was in the

ll        crowd in the enclosures and we suggest that consideration should be
          given  to stewards with radio communication being placed in the most

g         popular" enclosures
          informed.
                               to monitor the situation and keep ground control



!l   22. Most grounds have public announcement facilities and in our view this
         is a tool which if use’d effectively could help in most emergencies. A

II       large crowd will react with sympathy if they know what is happening
         and instructions can    be given to a large number of people, including

!l       officials, very quickly
         facility.     Time is of
                                      by
                                      the
                                            effective use of the public announcement
                                             essence -   it only takes 3 minutes for


B        someone to suffocate.
         system is set out in the
                                      The   requirements of a good communications
                                            ’Guide to Safety at Sports Grounds’.
         Effective communication is, however, not an end in itself - it is an
II       ~d t~ effective m~no~m~n~       The guide ~e~s o,,~ the d,,t~ ~nd
         responsibilities of management in Chapter 2. The guide however does
         not lay enough stress - in fact it hardly mentions - the need to have
         someone in total management control once spectators have entered the
         ground until they have all left. The manager is responsible not only
         for the game but also the ground, staff and all spectators, he must
         have the ability to appraise a situation, make (often unpopular)
        decisions quickly and above all give instructions as they ape
        necessary.
!
     23. On detailed design matters, not having been inside the ground, we have
II       little comment.     If the crush barriers were of adequate strength we
        would have expected them to have prevented the crowd pressure that

If      resulted in so many deaths.         Medical evidence might be useful in
        ascertaining if the crush barriers were of safe design or if they were

!!      the cause of some injuries.



!
II
II
      GENERAL SAFETY

!1    24. We must express some concern about safety at football grounds. There

II        is always a conflict between security and safety but safety should be
          paramount.     Whenever an emergency occurs in a football ground with so

II        many people there is frequently only one safe space to go to and that
          is on the pitch. The current practice on so many grounds of erecting
         fencing between the crowd and the pitch creates a hazardous situation
I        whenever an emergency occurs and we deplore the practice. Emergencies
         can t~ke many forms -       fire, bomb scare, structural failure, maniac
!        behaviour, or overcrowding - all require the quick movement of people
         away from the danger.


     25. ~f no other way can be found to prevent pitch invasions than fencing
,!       (and there must be better ways in the interest of football) it must be
         possible for 50 to 100% of that fence to be opened quickly in an

!        emergency.      The operation can be by a number of means but local
         pressure sensors and both local and remote automatic release should be


B        possible.     Other forms of barrier which prevent escape onto the pitch
         should also be avoided.


I!   26. It is easy to be wise after the event but we believe the available
         space outside the    ground was such that the police had an impossible

i        job in trying to
         spectators inside
                              control the crowd there.      Lack of control of
                            the ground led to overcrowding of the central pens

!       and the fence erected to prevent access to the pitch by the crowd was
        the reason this emergency turned into a disaster.

l    27. We would recommend that research should be carried out to establish
        what space is desirable for marshalling crowds outside turnstiles and
II      standards determined.      These would be a further limitation on ground
        capacity and this should be included in the ’Guide to Safety at Sports

II      Grounds’

             On Saturday,      15th April,   1989together with                  and his mouner

             I went to the semi-final at Hi 11 bo rough,       between Liverpool and

             Nottingham Forest.       We hadt i ckets for the North Stand.

             We arrived at the ground at about 2.15 pm.           We were checking which

             turnstile we had to use.        We found it was one on the left of the

             ground,     (as you look at the ground, at the Lepping Lane end).

             Whilst we were checking our tickets          I was stood next to

             when     I saw a supporter walk up to a concertina gate which was/close to

                where we were stood and knock on the g a t e .     A window i"n the/ gate was

             opened, and I saw th*s supporter pass what          I took to be a Five Pound

             note to a Policemap who was on the other side of the gate.              The
                             V ‘               f
             suporter then signalled to three o/ther supporters and the four of them

             were then allowed through the gat/e, whi ch had been opened si ightly

                                                                                S3483

         from the inside.    I could see it was a P o 1i ceaan, because I saw this

         badge and helmet when he bent down at the window.

         There were others near to us, and I heard one of them say “They're

         letting them in for money" Just then a crowd of supporters who had

         been stood near to the shops rushed forward and tried to get in

         through the gate which the other four had got through.

         The gate was shut and they didn't get in.      We then queued to get in.

         It took about five minutes.     Once in the ground,   I didnt   look at the

         gate which had been opened so I could not say how many Policemen or

         stewards were on the inside of the gate.      We went to   the North Stand

         and found our seats without any    problems. Everything    was all   right,

         until just after kick off, when    there was a surge of     people into the

         North Stand.   There was so many   people,   some were just sat on the

         steps between the seats.    I could not really describe the Policeman I

         saw opening the gate to allow those four supporters        in, except to say

         he was clean shaven.    I would not recognise him again.



                                                                              SIGNED

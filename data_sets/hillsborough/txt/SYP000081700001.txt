              We    left N o t t i n g h a m at about                1.15    pm <1315 hrs)                  and t r a v e ll e d by car-

We a r r i v e d    in S h e f f i e l d at about 2 .1 5         pm <1415 hrs)           and    parked the         car-

on a hill a p p r o x i m a t e l y ten m i n u t e s ’ walk             from the Ground.

I n ot i ce d that        the re were a few P o l i c e m e n a bout as we w a l k e d a l o ng and

as we a p p r o a c h e d the Ground,             I saw a lot more P o l i c e m e n about.

I f ound my w ay to the tur ns t il e s                  for the S S t a n d without               any

d i f f i c u l t y and saw some M o u n t e d P ol ic e a bout as well as a few O ff ic er s

on foot      outside        the tur ns ti le area.

E n route        to the G r o u n d      I did notice         several      fans who were            drunk     in the

street.          T he y were    s t a g ge ri n g a bout and jumping             on top of one another.

As   I passed t hrough the turns ti le                     I h an de d    in my ticket a nd f ound my

s e a t / w it h ou t any    problem.           I took up my m a t ch view in g              point at about

2. 5 0   prn <1450 hrs).            Just    prior       to taking        up my seat         I can     remember

h e ar in g an a n n o u n c e m e n t   on the        public a dd re ss       system,      telling        the

people      in the       crowd that        there was        crowd    p ro blem and a s ki n g            people to

please move            back a nd that       there was         plenty of        room.        I cannot       remember

to w h ic h area the a n n o u n c e m e n t           was d i re c t e d to.     As we        passed thro ug h

were     swaying about.             H owever      I d i d n ’t think too unusual               as     I have      been

climbing         the    perimeter        fence at       the L ep p in g s Ln end.            I was       under    the

i m p r es s io n for quite         some    time       that they were          invading the           pitch.       I

saw some Police             urging       fans    in that area to get             back.         I think

i n it ia ll y     I thought      they were        pushing      them back        but       I think they were

pr o ba b ly telling         them to move back.

                                                                                                      S 2396

G r a d u a l l y more and more        fans    spilled onto        the    pitch and b egan s it ti ng

on the grass,           I still     had no      idea of what was             happening.        There was

no l oudspeaker a n n o u n c e m e n t made to tell              us what was going            on.

I then saw a person being                 laid out on the          pitch below us,            being      given

cardiac massage.            E ve n then,       I thought      he had just fainted.                T he n as a

few more       people were        laid down on the           pitch    I thought       some th in g

strange was          h appening a nd A nd y s u g g es t ed that we s ho ul d go down onto

the    pitch and see        if we      could be of any assi st an ce .

Myself,       A nd y and            made      our way to the back of the S S t an d and

f ou nd a marshall         who    e sc or t e d us t hr o ug h the       catering     d ep ar t me n t     and

onto    the    pitch.               who    is not a doctor,           r e ma in ed   in his     seat.

Once    on the       p i tc h we all     split up a nd       1 looked a bout and           c o u l d n ’t see

a nyone who       needed    imffiediate medical           a ss ist an ce .     I did ask a bout            three

people    if there was a n y t hi ng           I could do as a doctor,               but   no-one        told

me that       there was       a crush or         people being k il le d or injured               in

Leppings       Ln end.        There were         people m il l in g      about at that end behind

the    goal    but    I still    wasn't aware          that a d i sa st er was occurring.

I a s k e d someone where          the    injured were        being      t aken to,     and    I was

d i r e ct ed to a tunnel         leading      b et we en the W S t a n d and the S Stand.                      I

went along and a s ke d           two or three         people     in the      cour ty ar d a r e a    if I

could help there,           but they were         tySi ng t en de d t o .

A P o l i c e m a n then received a mes/age               via his     personal       radio     that a

doctor was        required       in the gyr^pasium,           I didn't       know where        the gym was

so a young        lad a ged      in his    twenties       ran round to the gym w it h me.

Once    inside the gym,           I a s k e d a m an     if I could be of a s s i st a nc e           as    I

was a doctor.           He told me        that the dead jwere being               p ar ti t io n ed off

from the       injured.          I saw about       four qt/ f i v e      people dead       in the one

area.     I left that a rea and went                to     /end    to the      injured.

T here were       no drugs       or medical      eqi^/pment avai labl e for me                to u s e .        I

then saw to a young              lad who wasn't          badly    injured and who a p p e a r e d
vacant,                                 UCf                                 *

I then a t t e n d e d to a chap who had f r a c t u r e d his                    leg and      I then saw a

fan who was drunk but who was                     quite d is tressed.              He kept saying              that

his     friend had been k illed and then he kept                        falling a s le e p and then

w o u ld wake        up and    cry.     I then saw a m an who             had been          c ru shed but he

left     of his own accord.                 I then saw a P o l i c e m a n who had b ee n hit on

the head.            Out of all       those    I saw n o ~ o m    died.           A bo ut   t we nt y m in utes

later a hospital              team who a r r i v e d w i/'n drugs and medical                   equipment.

I did tend to a m an who was                   quit^yoadly       i n j u r e d.      he had been c ru shed

a nd    I believe       that    he may have        had a pneumo t ho r ax            (pun ct ur ed    lung).

He     needed to be rushed to hospital                   but w a s n ’t.          It was all      quite

d iff ic ul t     because as      I was       examini ng   him     I d i d n ’t have a s t e th a sc o pe

to     listen to his          chest at       this stage.

Eventually           I found Dr.       BYRNE.      I had    lost all        track of time.             He told

me     that    he had been       certifying        deaths and s ho we d me about                 fifty dead

people        in the a dj o i n i n g area.        I was   quite s h o c k e d by how m an y there

were as        I still     had no      idea of the extent           of the         incident a nd          I

w o n d e r e d where     they had all         come from.

We     stood about        for a time         talking and there was about                    t w en ty more

do ctors       now    in the gym.           Eventuall y,   most     of the         injured were           taken

away     in a m b ul an ce s    so myself and A nd y d e ci d e d that                there was       nothing

else     that we       could do a nd that we s ho ul d go a nd                    look for             and



We then w a l k e d a cross           the    pitch to the S S t a n d and saw that                   they had

gone.         We then w a l k e d straight         back to the               and      rejoined them and

made     our way home.
                                                                        a tzU>v^.CcH                  .
I was     quite       s u r p ri se d by the    lack of F irst A id equi pm en t a nd drugs

available        for those       people       on the    pitch.      I w o u ld have thought                   that

the a m b u l a n c e m e n w o ul d have      had d e f i b r al a to r s a nd drugs.           The o xy ge n

s upply       ran out for the m an            I was    tending    to w it h the s u s p ec t ed

               p u n c t ur ed    lung and there was             none      to replace     it until     the hospital

              m ed ic al       crew a r r i v e d at the

               I feel        there was       no overall         o rg a n i s a t i o n of the    incident a fter       the

              m a t c h was       stopped-          I feel     that    I could have       been d ir ec te d better           to

               the back of the goal m o u t h or the back of the W S t a nd                            rather than to

               the g y m n a s i u m to deal w it h the               injured.      I feel       i nitially    no-one was

              aware       of what was         going on e;<aetly,

               I feel        that an a n n o u n c e m e n t    for medical       aid w o u ld have      c on fi r me d that

              there was a serious                   problem.       I was    still    unaware       of extent     of the

               t ra ge dy     until     I had s een the fifty bodies                 in the gym.

               I feel        s t r o n g l y that   there      should have       been medical        provis ions for

              such an e me r g e n c y because               there were so m a n y doctors and                nurses

               p repared to give medical                 aid but w i th no basic equipment.

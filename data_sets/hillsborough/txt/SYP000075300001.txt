               support         of Liverpool.                In 1988 I a t t e n ^ M a the FA cup s e m i ^ ^ / n a l

     unable        to,/dfo so,     therefore,            I decided that         together wit h a friend,

     o utside       the stadium.            I know this         is a common         practice and that             I

     stood a good           chance       of buying a ticket             outside     the ground.




     friend                   th together with                                   and a lad      called                , we

     travelled         in             s F or d Escort        van,    I know that         b o t h ____________           and

              had tickets          in their        posse ss io n for the Leppings Ln terraces.                           We

     left W a r r i n g t o n at a bout          10.30 am       (1030 hrs)        that    day we     left     that

     tickets,         we a r r i v e d    in S h e f f i e l d at about         12.40 pm (1240 hrs)           a nd

     parked about            half a mile         from H i l l s b o r o u g h   ground.      We had no travel

     journey.          As we drove          into Shef^xt'eld,          I noticed a large number of

     L iv er po o l    s upporters         drinking        in the    car    parks and       in the    roads

     outside        public houses, j / a l s o             saw groups       of s upporters       drinking         on

     A fter     parking       the vehicle myself and Lee made                       our way to the L ep pi ng s

              as    they had tickets.               We     received     no directions         on how to get to

     the Lep pings          Ln entrance          but knew where            it was    from    last year.           We

                one      else      in the tunnel        but at       the end of the tunnel we            could not         get

                out      due to the         crowds    being            ight ly packed        in, we turned         round and

            w ou l d say there were about 3 00 people on the              pitch.    We stayed    in our

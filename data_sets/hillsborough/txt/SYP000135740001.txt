7th September 1990




Dear

I hope you don't mind me writing to you but I didn't know who else to
ask. Now that the D.P.P. has made his decision not to bring charges
against the South Yorkshire police or anyone else I would like a few
questions answered, as I think we have kept quiet long enough and now
feel ready for a few explanations. I hope either you or Insp. Mike
Leighton may be able to help.

Why didn't anyone take any notice of the fans when before 2.30pm
they were asking for no more to be let into the enclosures?

Why weren't their many or no stewards at the Lepplngs Lane end?

Why did Carl & Nick seem to have a good   deal of room at 2.50pm (so my
husband tells me from the photograph he   identified) yet were in the
crush when it happened?

Why did so many Liverpool fans arrive so late?

Why wasn't the match delayed to let the   fans in safely?

Why didn't anyone monitor the crowd? It   must have been obvious   that
too many were in one area.

Was it Peter Beardsley's early near miss at goal that started it?

Why was the supporters bus told to leave the ground when they knew
two boys were missing without giving them the chance to inform us?

Accidents don't just happen, they are caused. This was no accident.


These are just a few of many, many WKY'SJI!!




Yours sincerely

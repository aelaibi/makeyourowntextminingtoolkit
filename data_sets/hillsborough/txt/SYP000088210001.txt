      getting          worse       and      worse        and     it     was      obvious                that       something                was    going

      wrong.                          was     getting          worse         and      we          decided          to    move          him       toward             the

      small       pen       (5).        The    other         lads       moved         h im ,         but      I stayed             where          I was.

      At    about       £.55pm          (142-5)        the     pressure              really             came       on    and       it       was

      impossible             to    move.          It     was     then        that         I noticed                an    old       man       in    front                of

      me.        He    was       being      supported            by     a man         cm          either          side       who       were       keeping

      him    up.        I think          he    was       conscious,              but          only        just      and       I d o n ’t k n o w

      whether          he    was      talking          or    no t.         He    was          a    short          man,       stocky          build,             aged

      between          5 0 —60     years,         w i t h da rk is h g r e y in g h a r                           and    clean             shaven.              I

      d o n ’t    recall          whether         he     had     glasses             on       or     no t .        1 remember                seeing             the

      teams       come       o ut ,     but    I d o n ’t        recall          any          of     the      game.           O n e jjf          the      men

      who    was       supporting             the      old     man      was      snouting                 lor      the       cj^JWd         io    pusn

      even       move       my    arms.        We      were      shouting             to          the     copper         on       the       gate       to       let

      us    out,       but       there      was     no      reaction,            thv§             was     a y about           3    o'clock             ( 15 0 0 )

      and    it       was    a    few    minutes            later,         maybe          5       c a s t / 10     past       3    (1505)           (1510),

      that       I saw       the      old     man      slide       to      the       t l o o r yand           disappear,                   the    crowd

      just       closed          over    him      and       I never          saw      o t tr       again.           The       moment             before             he

standing       up.     He was bright            red,   his eyes were          closed and he was            just

I became aware           of my friends at              the   railings       between pens 4 and 5 and

tney were          calling      to ms to       come to thernr but           triers was     no way       I could

move.       At some stage           there was a drop           in the       pressure and        I fell

sideways and would have ended up on the ground,                                 except     for a chap who

caught      hold of me          from the back and            pulled me up and--then other                 people

were    pulling at me and helping me to the                         fence     aye r to where my

friends      had been,           I tried to get out of              pen/^T into       pen 5,      but   d i d n ’t

have    the strength and e ve n t u a l l y two bio/tads                     pushed me over and             I was

s u b s e q u e n t l y helped     out onto      the    piAj?n»     There was a lot of             people

falling       down everywhere            and a lot of         injured and a p p a r e n t l y dead

people      on the     pitch.          I me t up wit h my b r o t he r a n d f r i end s e v e n t u a l l y

and we stayed          there       until      almost all      the terraces were            empty because

we were all          there       except     for Gary.        We hung around for a long time and

even went          back to       the   van hoping he was            there,     but he w a s n ’t.



E v e n t u a 11y we made         our way to where           the bodies were and it must                 have

When the whole           i n c 1d e n t was     really s t a r t i ng      and we were shouting            to

the Police at the fences                   to open the gates              they just     ignored us and

saw one of the first                supporters         over th       fence     onto the pitch get

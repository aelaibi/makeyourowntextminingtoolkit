Dear Sir,

Fire Safety and Safety of Places of Sport Act 1987 ;
Implementation of Part II (Safety of Sports Groun^g) —
Effect on General Safety Certificate

You may be aware that the Home Secretary has recently made a
Commencement Order bringing Part II of the above Act into
effect from 1st January 1988. This Act amends the Safety of
Sports Grounds Act 1975 in line with the Government's
proposals in response to the recommendations of the Popplewell
Inquiry and deals with such matters as removing the
distinction between a sports ground and stadium, empowering
the Secretary of State to vary the designation threshold of
10,000, Police presence at a ground, arrangements for appeals
machinery and prohibition notices and arrangements for annual
inspections of designated grounds.

It is with regard to Section 21 of the new Act concerning
Police presence that I am now writing to you about. Briefly,
this Section says that where General Safety Certificates
contain conditions relating to Police presence at the specified
activity, then the extent of this presence shall be determined
by the Chief Constable.  In the light of this new legislation,
I have looked at the appropriate condition of your General
Safety Certificate and I should be pleased, therefore, if you
would note that the existing Condition 5(4) of Part I of your
Certificate is now replaced with the following:-

     "5(4)   The extent of the provision of the services of
             Police Officers at the specified activity shall be
             determined by the Chief Constable at least 14 days
             or as soon as possible thereafter before a
             specified activity takes place."

I should be pleased if you would keep this letter with your
Certificate.

Yours faithfully



Clerk of the County Counci;
and Chief Executive

     6       The general appearance of the barriers on the Northern
             Terrace is poor. Rust is evident, particularly on the
             non-galvanised sections (N.B. some of the new tubular
             barriers are not galvanised and are rusting).
             The equipment used to test the barriers is by necessity
             quite heavy and damage to the barriers' protective coating
             is inevitable* We recommend that a maintenance programme
             be instigated and that barries tested each year are repainted.
             This would result in a barrier being repainted every 5 years.

     7       We consider the scaffolding segregation barriers on the
             Northern Terrace to be ineffective and dangerous. We
             recommend it be removed and if necessary replaced by a
             proper segregation fence.

     8     The scaffolding segregation barriers on the South Western
           Terrace have dangerous protrusions on which people could
         j^>ecome impaled. These should also be removed or replaced
         ^P<u above.

     9       For the purpose of this document the following result
             sheets are titled as follows.

                              O       - Start Point
                              F       - Fully loaded
                              R       - Load Off
                              DEF     - Deflection
                              RET     - Return

    10       When first tested there were several barriers which failed
             to achieve the required standard, these were re tested
             and are marksd sudh in the report.
             It was generally found that the reason for failure was
             the ilaidrk of and defective grout at the base of the
             §tanchions. We would recommend that where the grouting is
             defective the stanchion base be scraped of all loose or
             defective debris and the core repacked with concrete to
             fill all voids and achieve a reasonably water tight seal
             around base of stanchions.

      This method is used at Odaal Stadium, Bradford.


1.    Determine the load to be applied.

2.    Measure the length barrier to be tested.

3.    Calculate the load to be applied.

4.    Set up the rig and zero the scales.

5.    Apply the load.

6.    Measure the deflection.

7.    Wait 5 minutes and release the load.

3.    l^J^sure the return.

9.    Apply the load.

10.   Measure the deflection from new start point.

1 1 . Wait 5 minutes and release the load.

12.   Measure the return.

13. Apply the load.

14.   Measure the deflection from new start point.

15.   Wait 5 minutes and release the load.

16.   Measure the return.

17.   Do a calculation based on the final return over the total
      deflection as a percentage.

18.   If less than 75% retest as 4 to 17.

19.   Move the rig so that each stanchion receives a full load,

20.   Whilst the l^sts axe being carried out the lulluwing observations
      are made:

               a) Watch for cracking o f concrete around stanchion
                  bases.

               b) Inspect welds for defects.

               c) Look for defects on barriers such as rust, holes
                  in tubular sections and poor base plate details
                    where applicable.

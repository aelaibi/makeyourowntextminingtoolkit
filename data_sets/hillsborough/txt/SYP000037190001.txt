   Dear Sir

   I refer to your letter of 3 August 1989, concerning the returning of your
   departmental files and plans in relation to Sheffield Wednesday Football
   Club. In reply I would advise you that we are currently bringing together
   all details for the Coroner’s Inquests and until these have been concluded,
   or until our enquiries have established that your records are of no further
   relevance, then I must retain the originals.

   Having said that, I am quite happy for you or a member of your staff to
   have free and regular access and if needs be for copies to be taken.
   Perhaps you would be so good as to let me know if you would like to take
   copies so that we can put arrangements in hand to our mutual satisfaction.

   Yours Faithfully

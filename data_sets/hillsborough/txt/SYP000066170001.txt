             I am a married woman and live with my hus                  at the above address.

             attended the Liverpool          v Notts Forest'T'ootbal 1 match at Hillsborough

             Football Ground that took place on 15th Apr^I               1989.

             I confirm that I have          read my husbandsv^Ctatement dated 12th May 1989,

             and that    I recall the incidents as outlined by him in his statement,

             I would    like to add my experience at the turnstile at Leppings Lane

             where    I became separated from my husband for a short time.

             I was handed a ticket for turnstile B by my husbands friend

O r T                 whilst   in the crowd waiting to get in at Leppings

         ^   became separated and found m y s c r u s h e d        against       1 ue metal    barns

                       right of the turrisj^fles.      It dug into         right hand side and

             caused considerable discomfort at the time,                  did become very

             frightened in the crowd,         and have never experienced anything         like it

         saw I was distressed                   I managed to (get under the barrier with

                   help.       When I got on the^€f€her side only a few yards away I saw
                                        ^ V T
          the gate called             ’C " was ofen by about 7-8 feet widey*         I was one of the

         first     people throu;           I think               :ome>mh     me.     I waited just

          inside the gal^r for my husband who came^xh rough the turnsti l e .                   By

         this tinieytThere was a steady flow^eff people all heading towards the

         tunne^.        I d i d n ’t see anybody checking tickets or giving

         directions.           I didn't see any stewards or police near the gate.

         Once on the other side,                the crush was ok.   My husbands statement

         confirms the rest, I did not see G*    ’C ; closed.                    1 J*#^e   today handed

         been sent to the Hillsborough Disaster Appeal                  fund,    via a friend.On

         the day I was wearing a green T-shirt,                 navy j a c e k t , and blue jeans.

         I did not see any bad behaviour on the day,                  it was generally a very

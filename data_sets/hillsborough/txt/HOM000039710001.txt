                 I           refer to our earlier correspondence in relation to the above case and, in particular,
         your letter of today.
                  The proceedings in respect of the defendants Duckenfield and Murray were brought
          before the court this afternoon and the magistrates agreed that they should be withdrawn. The
          courtmade an order that the defendants' costs should be taxed and made payable fromcentral
          funds in accordance with Section 16 of the Prosecution of Offences Act 1985,




                                                 Yours faithfully,



                                              Clerk to the Justices.

Dear Sirs

ADLINGTON -V- DUCKENFIELD AND MURRAY

We refer to your letter of the 9th July. We have spoken to and now faxed the Clerk
to the South Sefton Magistrates Court indicating that we have no objection to the
withdrawal of the Summonses in absence.

Although in our view we undoubtedly would have been entitled to a Costs Order
against the Prosecution, we have not sought such Order from the Court.


Yours faithfully

   Dear Sir,

   Adlington -v- David Duckenfield

   We have received the enclosed letter from Watts Leather Solicitors dated 9th July 1998.

   Accordingly, we write to confirm our agreement that the Summons be withdrawn as
   requested, in the absence of the parties.

   As the Information is not being proceeded with, we request that the Court make an Order in
   accordance with Section 16 of the Prosecution of Offences Act 1985, in favour of Mr
   Duckenfield for payment out of Central Funds in respect of his costs incurred relating to the
   Summons, such costs to be determined. If the Court is not inclined to agree such an order
   we request the opportunity to be heard on the question of costs.

    We look forward to hearing from you in regard to the Order made as requested, and if you
    wish to clarify any matters, please do not hesitate to contact Nicholas Owston or Simon
    Eastwood of our office.

    Yours faithfully

  We are in receipt of your letter of 8th July. We are profoundly disappointed by your failure to deal with
  the substance of the matters raised in our letter of 3rd July, in particular, the factors of convenience to
  which we referred.

  We have been in touch with the Clerk to the South Sefton Justices and he is willing to contact the
  Magistrates to request that the summonses be withdrawn in absence. He has indicated that this matter
  can be placed before the Court tomorrow 10th July or Monday 13th July. We have made formal
  application that this be done.

^ W e make it clear that our withdrawal of these summons is done in an attempt to avoid protracted and
^sterile judicial review proceedings and in order to advance the prosecution as quickly as possible. We
   shall be applying for summonses elsewhere.

  We note that in your letter of 8th July you say that it does seem sensible for the informations to be
  withdrawn at the earliest time. We invite you therefore to fax the Clerk to South Sefton Magistrates
  immediately agreeing that these summonses be withdrawn as outlined above and that parties be excused
  attendance.

Dear Sirs

Adlington -v- Duckenfield and Murray

We refer to your letter of 3rd July which responds to our letter of 1st July 1998 to the Clerk
to the South Sefton Justices.

We note your comments but are bound to confirm, our instructions are to proceed to argue
the question of jurisdiction at the earliest time. We have contacted South Sefton again, and
understand that the Clerk to the Justices is awaiting for your further advice once you are
aware of the Defendants’ approach. We are aware that the solicitors for Mr Murray, Walker
Morris, have responded in similar terms.

In the circumstances it does seem sensible for the informations to be withdrawn at the earliest
time. If you do not agree, in any event it seems desirable for the 17th July date to be
vacated, with a new date to be fixed, without undue delay, to allow for the question of
jurisdiction to be argued fully at South Sefton. Liaison with the various parties would be
required to allow for counsels’ availability to be taken account of and we will naturally liaise
with the court in this regard.

We have sent a copy of this letter to the court so that they appreciate the position and hope
that matters can be resolved quickly and in a pragmatic fashion. We look forward to hearing
from you.

Yours faithfully

Dear Sirs

ADLINGTON -V- DUCKENFIELD AND MURRAY

Thank you for your letter of the 8th July. We had understood that Mr. Duckenfield’s
Solicitors had been in touch with you to indicate that they took similar objection to
the issue of the Summons in the South Sefton Magistrates Court, and that neither
Defendant did submit to the jurisdiction of that Magistrates Court.

The Writer will be out of the Office on the 9th July, but noting your wish for a
response by the 10th July, will give this matter urgent attention on that day,
transmitting any further letter by fax to you.

 Dear Sirs

 Adlington v Duckenfield and Murray

 We have received your letter of 6th July and are disappointed by your failure to respond to the
 substance of our letter of # July and to our invitation to you to put forward what you
 contend would be a suitable court. We note that you have “very carefully considered” our
 letter.

 You will have understood our contention that, if either defendant submits to the jurisdiction,
 the court has power to hear the committal proceedings, whether your construction of the
 enactment is correct or not. Since we have not yet heard from Mr Duckenfield’s solicitors, we
 cannot obviously advance matters or add significantly to our previous letter. As you know,
 we have asked them to reply by Friday 10th July, so that we can take decisions before the 17th
 July.

  In the meantime, may we have a reply to the substance of our last letter.

  Yours faithfully

Dear Sirs

ADLINGTON -V- DUCKENFIELD AND MURRAY

We acknowledge your letter of the 3rd July providing us with a copy of the letter of
the same date to Winckworth & Pemberton. We have very carefully considered the
various points that you have set out. At this moment we intend to confine ourselves
simply to the fundamental starting point. The Summonses have not been validly issued
and therefore must be quashed.

We believe that the reason that the Clerk to the Justices at South Sefton has copied
you with the correspondence, is to invite you to agree that the Summonses have not
been validly issued. We would invite that course of action, and seek your confirmation
as quickly as possible.

If you persist with the view that South Sefton Magistrates Court have validly issued
the Summonses, then if the Clerk to the Justices is not himself to quash the
Summonses upon the submissions before him, there is no alternative but to make an
application to the Divisional Court.

We do regret the fact that you have copied your letter to the Clerk to the South Sefton
Justices and the Director of Public Prosecutions, since it contains so many matters
which are wholly extraneous to the single point which must be decided by the Clerk
to the Justices as to the law. In the circumstances, we have similarly copied this letter.


 Jours faithfully

     Dear Sirs

     Adlington v Duckenfield and M urray

     1.       We act for the prosecutor in this case who has laid the informations with the support
             of the Hillsborough Family Support Group (“HFSG”). The Clerk to the South Sefton
            justices has sent us a copy of your letter of 1st July 1998. The point you make is not
             that the court has no jurisdiction to hear the case if either defendant were to appear
             before it; it is rather the technical jurisdictional argument, which has nothing to do with
             the substance of the allegations, that the court has no means of compelling Mr
             Duckenfield and Mr Murray to appear before it. We do not agree with your
            construction of the sections or your interpretation of R v Blctndford. The evident
            purpose of section 1(2) and 2(3) of the 1980 Act is to deal with practicalities and there
            is clear acknowledgment of this in Blandford. We have instructed counsel to advise
            further on the point. However, we regard it as essential to set out the practical reasons
            that led us to commence these proceedings in Liverpool and we invite Mr Duckenfield,
            through you, to appear at the court so that, on either view of the law, the court has
            power to hear the matter.

    The reasonfo r commencing proceedmgs in Liverpool

    2.      In the last nineteen months, we have been in regular contact with the Home Office on
            matters relating to the disaster which formed the subject matter of the “Scrutiny”
            conducted by Lord Justice Stuart-Smith, of which you are no doubt aware. In this
            period the Group have been supplied with a large number of witness and other
            statements about the events of 15th April 1989, which its members had never seen
            before. The witnesses who made these statements will form a very substantial part of
            the evidence which we intend to present against Mr Duckenfield and Mr Murray.

                                                      -   1
                                                          -




1ST Floor Central Buildings 41 North John Street Liverpool L2 9RR. Tel 0151 236 1919. Fax 0151 236 1936
 3.    A large proportion of these witnesses come from Liverpool. We intend to call them to
       prove that the decision to open Gate C at the ground was the responsibility of both
        defendants; was causative of the deaths of 96 people; and was grossly negligent. The
       two named victims are representative of all. The prosecution case will be simple, but
       many witnesses will be tendered. The allegation of misfeasance is based on the same
       facts. The allegation of attempting to pervert the course of justice refers to Mr
       Duckenfield’s allegation that the Liverpool supporters forced the gate.

 4.    The committal proceedings will of course be held at the court at which the proceedings
       are instituted. It is strongly arguable that those proceedings fall within the old
       committal scheme. The amendments in Schedule 1 to the Criminal Procedure and
       Investigations Act 1996 were brought into effect on 1st April (“the appointed day”) by
       virtue of the Criminal Procedure and Investigations Act 1996 (Commencement)
       (Section 65 and Schedules 1 and 2) Order 1997, and apply to any alleged offence in
       relation to which Part 1 of that Act applies. Section 1(3) of that Act makes provision
       in respect of “alleged offences into which no criminal investigation has begun before
       the appointed day”.

5.     It seems to us the better view is that the present proceedings fall within the exception.
        Although no police investigation was in progress in April 1997, a police investigation
        “began” in 1989, and it would therefore appear that either of the defendants, or indeed
        the prosecution, would be entitled to call live evidence at committal. If either
        defendant required us to prove a prima facie case, we should have the task of calling a
        large number of eye witnesses whose statements will form part of the substantial
        bundle of evidence that we shall serve on you in due course in order to iustifv
        committal for trial.

6.     It will therefore be apparent to you that the factor of convenience tells overwhelmingly
        in favour of committal proceedings in Liverpool. Among our witnesses, some are in
        dubious health. Not all are young. Many have little money, and would need the
        reimbursement of travel and accommodation expenses if the proceedings are held
        outside Liverpool. We doubt that we would be required to call evidence of forensic
       pathologists, or the witnesses who produce the transcripts of the evidence that the two
       defendants gave to the inquest or the Taylor Inquiry.

Submission to the jurisdiction

7.    Whatever the court chosen, there will be inconvenience to some. We accept of course,
      that attendance at committal proceedings will be inconvenient for Mr Duckenfield if
      held anywhere other than near his home. Your client may decide to submit to the
      South Sefton jurisdiction in the interests of saving time and money. It is undoubtedly
      open to him, or Mr Murray to do so. If either “appears” or is “brought before” the
      court by virtue of section 2(3), and seeks to join issue with the other party on the
      merits, as opposed to some arid technicality as to the efficacy of the summons, the
      court has jurisdiction on any basis; and by virtue of section l(2)(b) the court would
      have jurisdiction over the other defendant, however widely or narrowly the two

                                             -2 -
         subsections fall to be construed.

 8.     In a matter of such importance as the Hillsborough disaster, surely it is essential that
         prosecution and defence concentrate on the substance of the case rather than captious
         technicalities. Do you suggest that South Sefton is an inappropriate court?

 Alternatives to Liverpool

 9.    If, contrary to our view, section 1 of the Magistrates Court Act 1980 is to be
        construed as you contend, it would be open to the informant to commence
        proceedings in the County of South Yorkshire, where the alleged offences were
        committed (section l(2)(a); or where either defendant resides, that is, West Yorkshire
        in the case of Mr Murray, and Dorset in the case of Mr Duckenfield (section l(2)(c).
        We are inclined not to lay the informations in Sheffield, because, among other reasons;
        (a) proceedings in that city would revive painful memories for relatives of the victims,'
        (b) it is unlikely that many witnesses from Sheffield would be called at the committal,'
        and (c) neither defendant lives there.

 10.   The options would appear to be, therefore, Sheffield or some other part of South
       Yorkshire, even though neither defendant resides in that area, and few witnesses do;
       Pontefract or some other part of West Yorkshire; or Dorset. It is hard to imagine
       another location in Dorset, if Dorset were chosen, more suitable than Bournemouth.
       An important factor would be cost. We should wish the proceedings to be held in a
       place where hotel accommodation would be cheap and plentiful. For this reason,
       Bournemouth, out of season, seems an obvious possibility, and there may be other
       locals in Yorkshire which may be suitable on the same grounds.

 11.   There would be the further advantage that a court at Bournemouth would commit for
       trial to a sitting of the Crown Court on the Western Circuit; and no doubt both
       prosecution and defence would argue that it would be fairer to all parties if the trial
       were held at some venue outside Yorkshire, Merseyside and Lancashire. We should
       tell you that we would not resist an argument by the defence in due course that, in the
       interests of fairness, wherever the committal were held, the trial itself should not take
       place in Merseyside.

12 .   These ideas are no more than suggestions. We have not yet weighed the pros and cons
       finely. We will consider constructively any suggestions you or Mr Murray might wish
       to make as to venues for committal proceedings away from Sheffield, where
       informations might sensibly be laid.

13.     We invite you to keep us informed of your intentions. If you decide to apply for
       judicial review of the South Sefton summonses, we shall have to consider whether it is
       right to allow the matter to be delayed for several months, so that a technicality can be
       determined at great expense, when we could be proceeding expeditiously at another
       venue to which your argument cannot apply.
14.    We are sending a copy of this letter, with uncontroversial covering letters, to the

                                              -3 -
solicitors for Mr Murray, who support your position, to the Clerk to the South Sefton

    Dear Sirs

    OUR CLIENT : BERNARD MURRAY

    We write to advise you that we have been instructed to act on behalf of Mr Bernard
    Murray in relation to a summons purportedly issued on 26 June 1998 in your Court.

    We have been made aware of a letter written to you by Winkworth and Pemberton
    ■who act on behalf of Mr David Duckenfield. The three summons5 against our Client
    are identical to three of the four summons’ against Mr Duckenfield. Although we
    have only been instructed very recently, we wish to say immediately that we associate
    ourselves with the views that have been put forward by Winkworth and Pemberton.
    We shall be considering the matter urgently over the course of the next few days and
    it is likely that we shall then write to you again, although the need for such further
    submission would obviated if you promptly agree that you must quash this summons.

    Yours faithfully

   Dear Sirs

    David Duckenfield

    We. are enclosing a copy of a Summons purportedly issued on 26th June 1998 in your Court'
    bearing the'number 2270.

    In- our submission this Summons was not validly issued. Under the Magistrates Courts Act
    1980 $.1(2) -

                "A Justice of the Peace for an area to which this section applies may issue, a
              • summons...under this section -  • .

                  (a)    If the offence was committed or is suspected to have been committed within
                         the area, or

                  CO-    It-appears to the Justice necessary or expedient, with a view to the better
                         administration of justice, that the person charged should be tried jointly with,
                         or in the same place as, some other person who is charged with an offence, or
                         who is in custody, or who is being or is to be proceeded against, within the
                         area...'


    We act for Mr Duckenfield who we understand has been summoned with Mr. Murray. ifi<
    connection with allegations of offences in Sheffield. Consequently the proviso at-s.l(2XbT
    does'.'not apply.-

    The Summons should not ha.ve been issued as on its face it is clear that the allegation is. that
    M r Duckenfield committed the offence at a place outside the jurisdiction or area of the
    County of Merseyside.

    We also have regard to s.2(3) of the Magistrates Courts Act 1980 -

        "A magistrates court for a county...sha.ll have jurisdiction as examining justices over
        any offence committed by a person who appears or is brought before the court,
        whether or not the offence was committed within the county..."

 The-words "appears...before the court" have been considered in the case of Blandford (1955s).
 All ER 681 where the same provisions of the 1952 Act were considered.

         "...in our opinion the words "who appears" must mean ’’appears on a summons
         lawfully issued**"

  We therefore maintain that the enclosed copy Summons was not validly issued and ask you
   quash, it. without the need-for-an.attendance^.----- .........                      7-^ ~

 If you do not agree that the Summons should be withdrawn and nullified without an
 attendance then we would ask please that a date be fixed before or after 17th July (in which .
 case the hearing would have to be adjourned) so that our submissions on the invalidity of the
 Summons may be heard.

 . In the event foa* you are not prepared forthwith to quash the Summons and you require us
   to submit arguments on the validity of the Summons then we would ask that Mr Duckenfield
   will not be required to attend. It would seem quite improper that he should have to attend
   court to answer a summons which he contends and is advised was not validly issued.

 . May we ask- you please to let us have your response without delay because we will have no
   alternative but to apply to the Divisional Court if you do not confirm that the Summons is
   invalid and may be regarded as a nullity or you require submissions on the validity of the
   Summons to be made in court. Pending consideration of such an application to the Divisional
   Court, in the unlikely event that this course of action is necessary, would also result in an
   application to your Court for the first bearing to be adjourned.

  Yours faithfully .

 Dear Mr. Kelly,



 Hillsborough. Inquiry - Technical Working Party to examine the Green Guide



 The inaugural meeting of Professor Maunder's Technical Working Party to examine
 the Green Guide took place in London on Wednesday 18th October.

 As you will appreciate this meeting mainly comprised discussion to establish
 requirements and procedures and work on the Guide will not take place for a week
 or so.

 However, even at this stage it appears that significant changes in the Guide are
 intended, with particular reference to structures, spectator flow and capacities,

 I will forward a copy of the minutes of this meeting when issued and keep you
 informed as the meetings progress.


                                                                                                                                                                                %

Dear Bill,

         Hillsborough Inquiry - Technical Working Party
                   to Examine the"Green Guide

     Thank you for your letter of the 20th October, 1989, it is
interesting to note that, even at this early stage, signs are
that the Green Guide may be subject to significant change.

     It is to be hoped that the work Clubs are being obliged to
undertake at the present time to comply with the Interim Report
of Lord Justice Taylor is not affected by later discussions.

     Please do not hesitate to get in touch if you require
anything from us.

                         Yours sincerely,




                            J.D. Dent,
                            Secretary.

To:-

         The Right Honourable the Secretary of State for the
         H om e Departm ent and the Chairm an and M em bers of
         the South Yorkshire Police Authority.



Sir
M r Chairm an, Ladies and Gentlem en

I have the honour to submit my Report for 1989, together with my com m ents on events
during the year.
                                Chief Constable’s Foreword
Hillsborough

Throughout the greater part of 1989 all m em bers of the South Yorkshire Police, but
particularly those officers who w ere directly involved, have been preoccupied with the
disaster that occurred at Hillsborough Stadium on 15 April when 95 football supporters
tragically lost their lives and many others w ere injured. The then Hom e Secretary, The Rt
Hon Douglas Hurd, instituted a Public Inquiry and appointed The Rt Hon Lord Justice
Taylor to carry out the Inquiry. Lord Justice Taylor com m enced his investigation into the
disaster at Sheffield on 15 M ay and concluded the public hearings on 29 June. He
published his Interim Report on 4 August and his conclusion was that although there w ere
other causes, the m ajor reason for the disaster was the failure of police control at the
ground.

In consequence of the strong criticism he directed at m em bers of the Force I thought it
appropriate to submit my offer of resignation to the Police Authority. At a meeting held on
14 August the Police Authority declined to accept it and I continued in office. My
im m ediate objectives in the aftermath of the Interim Report w ere to implem ent those
recom m endations of Lord Justice Taylor that lay within the control of the police and to take
such further action as I considered appropriate in the light of the Interim Report. O ne such
action was the institution of an enquiry to establish if any criminal liability arose as a result
of the deaths, and this will continue into 1990.

The on-going effects of that tragic event will continue for som e considerable time to com e.
At the conclusion of their enquiries the W est Midlands Police will submit their report to the
Director of Public Prosecutions for a decision on the question of criminal liability in respect
of any individual. The Inquest to be held by Her M ajesty’s Coroner cannot proceed to a
conclusion until the question of criminal action has been resolved and even on the most
optimistic forecast the Inquest is unlikely to be concluded before the end of 1990. Coupled
with the attendant civil proceedings, the legal aftermath of Hillsborough is likely to continue
well into the 1990s.

The traum atic and lasting effect this tragedy has had on the families of those who died, on
those injured and their families, and on many others involved, together with the safety of all
those likely to attend m ajor sporting events in the future, dem anded that the highest level
of scrutiny be devoted to all the various aspects of investigation and legal review. The loss
and hurt so clearly suffered by so many requires this lengthy and detailed consideration
and, regardless of where blam e lies, it is essential that the causes should be properly and
fully determ ined and every m easure necessary taken to prevent a recurrence.

The fact that South Yorkshire Police officers stand adjudged to have been contributors to
this terrible tragedy is obviously a source of sorrow and regret within the Force. W e have
responded by opening negotiations with those bereaved and injured with the aim of
resolving all bona fide claim s and preventing further grief to them. I have previously
publicly expressed to the bereaved and injured my regret and deepest sympathy and now
do so again.

Cuts in Resources

The shadow of this event has in a public sense all but obscured the normal work of the
Force. Furthermore, the financial cost of Hillsborough has had a m arked effect on
resources and consequently upon our effectiveness during the year. B ecause the financial
y ear continues until 1 April 1990 the effect on the policing of South Yorkshire will also
continue until and beyond that date.



                                                3
Chief Constable’s Foreword
At the beginning of the financial year 1989/90 the Force was faced with a budget cut of 2%
which m eant an effective reduction in our budget of £1.868 million. Because of this
reduction, cuts had to be m ade in the areas of the vehicle fleet, overtime, training and
building m aintenance. Later in the year, because of the comm itm ent of £1 million from the
operational contingency fund to pay for the costs of the Hillsborough Inquiry, a stop was
put on police and civilian recruitment and a further £300,000 was cut from the vehicle
replacem ent program m e. It is against this background that the results of 1989 need to be
reviewed.

Morale

The Hillsborough tragedy itself and the criticisms expressed against the officers involved
by Lord Justice Taylor was a m ajor blow to the Force and clearly affected m orale. This
had to be overcom e and I believe that it has been. Although the effects of Hillsborough will
rem ain with individual officers for many years to com e, the level of perform ance achieved
by the Force despite all its difficulties says much for the quality of its officers.

Objectives

The Force O bjectives for 1989 rem ained unchanged from those with which we
co m m en ced the year. It has always been my aim to ensure that the policing of South
Yorkshire is carried out professionally, fully conscious of the needs of each of the many
com m unities within the county, and in consultation with the people in those communities.

The Force Objectives for 1989 reflected this aim, targetting issues of public concern yet
striving to give a better quality of service by addressing our own organisational
effectiveness.

The O bjectives were:-

      1.    To identify those locations which the general public regard with
            apprehension due to the prevalence of public disorder and/or
            alcohol-related offences, and concentrate police activity in those
            areas with a view to eliminating or reducing public concern.

      2.    To minimise the incidence of burglary dwelling offences.

      3.    To minimise the incidence of thefts of and from motor vehicles.

      4.    To exam ine all administrative procedures and operational practices
            with a view to improving efficiency and cost effectiveness, thereby
            optimising the availability of operational officers to the public.

Our experience indicated that there is merit in retaining som e objectives for m ore than one
year and the first three objectives for 1989 were, in essence, a continuation of those
im plem ented in 1988. Our aim in 1989 was to continue, consolidate and expand the useful
work and initiatives which had already been undertaken.

Public Disorder and Alcohol-related Offences

The co-ordinated and pro-active approach taken with regard to the first objective not only
resulted in an increased police presence in troublesome areas and greater attention to
specific licensed prem ises, but also to less overt initiatives.


                                              4
                              Chief Constable’s Foreword
In Sheffield, for exam ple, a senior officer from the Community Liaison Departm ent acts as
an observer on the Sheffield Alcohol Advisory Service and Sheffield Alcohol Forum.
Through these organisations education on safe drinking limits is being attempted and links
between alcohol and disorder are being examined. Again in Sheffield, a co-ordinating
com m ittee is being established involving representatives from breweries, night clubs and
other bodies, to disseminate information and encourage best practice.

The close co-operation which local police com m anders have with the licensing trade is
reflected in the growth of “Pub W atch” schem es with the result that information is now
received through such schem es about all categories of crim e, not just disorder. The
Sheffield Pub W atch schem e has been hailed nationally as an exam ple of excellent co­
operation between the police and licensees and has been used as a model for many
similar schem es in other areas.

As a result of the continuing positive approach towards offences of drunkenness and
public disorder, the number of persons dealt with for those offences showed an increase
for the second successive year.

Burglary Dwelling

The second objective, to reduce the incidence of burglary dwelling offences, was retained
for the third consecutive year. Although considerable success was achieved in both 1987
and 1988, it was felt that the level of offences still remained high and that there was scope
for further reduction in this category of offence. The Force has actively responded to any
public request for the creation of Neighbourhood Watch schem es. There are now 1,164
such schem es within the Force area, an increase of 222 since the beginning of the year
and now covering a total of 63,590 homes.

Much has been said and written about the effectiveness of such schem es. I hold to the
sim ple view that if the residents of a particular location wish to form a W atch schem e and
feel safer and m ore secure by being part of one then they should be given active support
by the officers who work that area. The schem es allow for a greater ease of police contact
with the people of that district and present a better opportunity for us to highlight crim e
prevention initiatives and other actions to protect their property and also assist in bringing
offenders and prospective offenders to notice.

The statistics speak for themselves. The number of burglary offences reported reduced
from 10,202 to 10,121 - a reduction of 1.77% when com pared with 1988 which also
showed a d e cre a se of 1,498 offences or 12.80% on the figures for 1987. In fact, only two
sub-divisions of the 14 in the Force have shown rises in this category of offence during the
period 1987/89.

Vehicular Associated Theft

The third objective, to reduce the incidence of thefts of and from motor vehicles, remains
an area in which much m ore work needs to be done. Thefts of motor vehicles are higher
than the s am e period in 1988 and thefts from motor vehicles have continued to rise
similarly.

Initiatives to com bat these crim es have been many. In addition to vigorous crim e
prevention m easures the S cenes of Crime Departm ent expanded its work in connection
with stolen vehicles and those from which property had been stolen. The aim of the
Departm ent was to increase by a process of selectivity the num ber of motor vehicles


                                               5
Chief Constable’s Foreword
subject of crim e which could effectively be exam ined for fingerprints with a view to
increasing the detection rate for this category of offence.

The total num ber of examinations increased by a dram atic 117% although the num ber of
identifications m ade increased by only 18% . Seeking the right balance between effort,
resources and results is not easy and the figures illustrate the difficulties involved in
selecting and directing where additional resources should be applied.

General Crime

On recorded crim e generally, a com parison with the previous year showed an increase in
crim e of 6.06% and a reduction in the detection rate from 46.46% to 4 3.4 4% .

Offences of violence rose by 8 .86% , sexual offences by 8.16% and robbery by 15.49% .
B ecause these categories attract m edia interest these rises must increase public unease.
Our success in dealing with this type of crim e is indicated by the detection rate which
stands at 86.20% for violence, 87.40% for sexual offences and, given the nature of the
offence, a creditable 46.34% for robbery.

Domestic Violence

The overall classification of violence contains the category known as dom estic violence
which, of course, raises for the family involved a number of difficult and sensitive issues. I
am conscious of the need for police support and counselling in such cases. 1989 saw a
slight increase in the num ber of offences reported to the police. Those which am ounted to
a criminal offence w ere referred to the Crown Prosecution Service, which resulted in 50%
being prosecuted.

The majority of offences of domestic violence amount to com m on assault in which the
victims are given advice and whenever possible the appropriate support. W hatever the
nature of the assault the situation is traumatic for the victim and every effort is m ade to
ensure that all c ases are investigated in a sympathetic and helpful m anner. The Sexual
Offences/Child Abuse Investigation Unit is now being involved in m ore of these cases
w here the officers’ expertise is being utilised to good effect.

Dom estic violence is not something that should be tolerated, and with this in mind I have
taken steps to ensure that my officers do all they can to ensure the safety of victims and
bring offenders to justice.

Offenders

Our efforts against offenders generally can be judged by the fact that the num ber of
persons arrested rose to 39,934 against a figure of 37,731 for 1988, whilst the num ber of
charges preferred rose to 32,886 against a total of 28,726 in 1988. Equally, the num ber of
sum m onses rose from 51,979 to 52,308.

Many offenders, particularly those who com m it minor traffic offences, do not ap p ear before
the Courts because of our continuing use of various diversion schem es. For instance, the
issue of fixed penalty notices has increased by 12.88% to 82,026 and the num ber of
vehicle defect rectification notices issued has also increased by 10.84% to 5,348.




                                                6
                               Chief Constable’s Foreword
In 1988 I had to report that the number of offenders cautioned for crim e offences had
decreased. It is pleasing to note that in 1989 that trend did not continue and the total
num ber of offenders cautioned rose by 22.31% to 6,189.

Improving Administrative Procedures

During the consultation process concerning the choice of Force Objectives for 1989 it
b e ca m e apparent that there would be merit in moving away from crim e/incident based
objectives to an objective which concentrated on internal organisational procedures. If the
Force is to give an increased quality of service, it is felt that internal administration must
be capable of operating m ore efficiently. As a consequence the fourth and final objective
was aim ed to stream line administration and bureaucracy within the Force with a view to
reducing the amount of time spent by officers on administrative tasks, thus increasing their
operational availability.

The Force R esearch & Developm ent Departm ent undertook a close examination of
various administrative/operational support units in other forces. As a result an
experim ental operational support unit was introduced within the Barnsley Division in
O ctober 1989 to undertake the preparation of all process files within that division. The unit
incorporates the divisional Prosecutions Departm ent and CID Administration and, following
close monitoring, the remit of the unit has been extended to undertake other administrative
tasks previously carried out by operational police officers. If the unit proves to be a
success the concept will be extended Force-wide.

O ther areas under review include the m eans of liaison and communication between the
Force and the Crown Prosecution Service coupled with a review of the handling,
administration and storage of court files; the m anner in which we adm inister property
coming into the possession of the police; and an examination of road traffic accident
administration.

In keeping with this em phasis on internal organisational scrutiny I rem ain conscious of the
need to continually monitor the suitability of posts for civilianisation. A recent review was
undertaken and a number of additional posts am enable to civilianisation have been
identified and will be filled subject to Police Authority approval and funding.

Outside the scope of the objectives the Force has progressed in many areas,
technologically, administratively and operationally. I look with pride on the considerable
achievem ents m ade by the Force in 1989, but with som e sadness on the fact that those
achievem ents, however considerable, are inevitably clouded by the events of 15 April.

Conclusion

In all my previous reports I have concluded by thanking the Chairm an and M em bers of the
Police Authority for their support during the year under review. That support could not have
been m ore difficult or publicly apparent than during this tragically eventful year. For this
support I, both personally and on behalf of all m em bers of the Force, extend my
appreciation.

Criminal Justice Act

The purpose of this project was to examine the
implications of various parts of the Act to the
South Yorkshire Police and in particular to the
Force Commercial Branch. An examination was
conducted of:-

    i.    extra work perceived to be necessary due
          to the requirements of the new legislation
          to trace and seize assets of convicted
          persons; and

    ii.   the effects of various changes regarding
          evidential requirements in cases of fraud.

 A report produced in January recommended the
appointment of two civilian accountants to
undertake asset tracing work for the Force and to
assist police officers in the Commercial Branch
with routine clerical tasks. Both positions were
approved by the Police Authority, but due to
Force budget cuts in October 1989, neither
position was filled. It is hoped that the financial

Between 1 January and 31 December 1989, 119
of the completed cases had been referred to the
Police Complaints Authority, of which 15 were
supervised investigations. Eighty completed
investigations were forwarded to the Police
Complaints Authority for independent
consideration of disciplinary proceedings. In
addition, a waiver from the requirement to further
investigate cases was sought from, and granted
by the Authority, on 38 occasions when
complainants did not co-operate with the
investigation officer. Their conduct rendered the

During the year the Assistant Chief Constable
(Staff Services) visited the Authority in London
and met the new Chairman, both Deputy
Chairmen and liaised with two of the members
responsible for this Force, Captain E N Taylor of
the Investigation Division and Mr G Gillman of the
Discipline Division.

Discipline

There were 31 internal enquiries undertaken
following alleged breaches of discipline reported
during the year. Formal disciplinary proceedings
were instituted against 12 members of the Force
involving 19 charges, all of which were found to
be proved. The Chief Constable heard 15
charges, the Deputy Chief Constable the other
four.

Scientific Support

1989 was a year of rationalisation in respect of
scientific support provided within South Yorkshire.
The core elements of scenes of crime,
fingerprints and photography were moulded
together to form a Scientific Support Unit in
keeping with the recommendations of the
 “ Touche Ross Review of Scientific Support to the
Police” and the reports produced by the Police
Research Services Unit scientific support team.

Regional Crime Squad

The Sheffield branch of the No. 3 Regional Crime
Squad is staffed by 27 experienced detective
officers of the South Yorkshire Police. During the
year the Sheffield branch has been responsible
for a total of 103 arrests for a variety of criminal
offences. Stolen property valued at £750,000 was
recovered during the year. Even more significant
is the fact that Class B controlled drugs, with a
potential street value of over £1 million were
recovered by squad officers.

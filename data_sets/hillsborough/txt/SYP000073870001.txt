           I am a police dog handler/in the West Yo r k s hire P o l i c e , presently

           stationed at Halifax.

           On Saturday 15 April         1989 I went to Sheffield as part of a conti ngent

           of other dog handlers on mutual aid to South Yorkshire Police.   After
                                                                         '-j'C
           briefing at Niagara sports ground I was paired with PC 2878 Fish/ a

           South Y o rksh i re d og handIer            Our brief was to patrol the A61 Hal ifa:<

           Road from Rosehill Road up to the Ml.                    We were to assist with the

           escorting of coaches along this route to the Claywheels Lane Coach

           Park.     By mid to late morning the traffic was building up and was

           progressing slowly stopping and starting.

           Whilst travelling tow ard s/S he ffi e1d in the line of traffic I saw ahead

           of me a minibus,         the type which seats approximately twelve people.                     It

           was     parked in a layby/on the nearside                in the Highgreen area and stood
on the pavement side of the minibus were a group of youths and men.

As we got closer one youth was urinating and it was quite obvious that

the others had been doing the            .   PC Fish and myself went and spoke

to the group and warned them a / to their conduct.          It was only 11.15

am yet all of them were drunK and they insisted on shaking hands with

us and were being over friendly in the way that some drunks are/.                 I

could see a large number of empty beer cans lying about          in the layby.

By 2pm we were parked on the forecourt of the Crown public house which

was at this time    closed.     The traffic was extremely light and I only

saw the odd coach drive along the A61 in the direction of Sheffield.

We had been instructed to take a meal at Niagara Social Club at 3pm or

as soon as was practi c a b l e .   As we arrived at the Club I could hear

that there were problems with the crowd at the Leppings Lane end of

the ground.     I heard a message     passed for someone to get a gate open

'otherwise people could be killed out here.*           I assumed that that

meant the outside of the ground.         There was a tremendous amount of

radio traffic and as I started niy meal        I heard a request for some bolt

croppers.

At 3.20pm I heard a radio message that a temporary mortuary would have

to be set up.     Up until    this point I d i d n ’t realise nor did any of my

colleagues a round me realise the seriousness of the situation and at

this point we all     left our meals and went back out.

PC Fish and myself     parked near to the Leppings Lane      roundabout.     We

had only been there a few minutes when Inspector Pheonix told us to go

on standby near the Gate public house as there was nothing we could

do.   Whilst at the Gate      I saw the same group of drunken youths that 1

had spoken to at the layby at Highgreen,          they were some of the first

group of fans away from the ground, and as they passed they shouted at

us ’Murderers' and a flow of o bs c en it ie s.    The vast majority of the

fans filed away in silence with just a few yelling obscenities at us.
                                                                                 PAGE    3
                                                                                 S1813

        Quite a few fans came over to talk to us and in no way blamed the

        police for the incident.       They did condem what they called   'the

        mindless drunken y o b s .*   When all the fans had set off home we then

        returned to Niagara for debriefing and I was then stood down to return

        to West Yorkshire.

                                                                             SIGNED

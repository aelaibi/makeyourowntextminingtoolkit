           (1050)   I left the ground to visit Sector D, arriving                                                                       in H alifax RD at

At 11.50 am (1150)            I made my way up Leppings LN to supervise officers

on Mi ddlewood RD.            There was quite a large number of supporters              in

Leppings LN at this time and they appeared well                  behaved.       On ar r i val

in Middl/<wQod RD I noticed a group of a b o u t S sup^/rters noticeable

unde r t h e, inf h ^ n c e   of alcohol a sking pass i ng p*f$po rte rs for spare

1 1 ck e          Further along the road at the junction with Dudle^/$D 1

not iced a tryfnjnt van with about            10 suppoi^ers sat around drin^yfig

cans of l/fq&r.          It was very busy in Mi ddl ewood RD at this time with

large numbers of supporters arriving and a constant flow of vehicles.
                    ^  ®^/*VX.OH©U
At approximately 1 .30 pmy/l330) I saw a group of about 30-40

supporters sat on the wall             of the coach park,     Mi ddle^ood RD training

ground.          I noticed that they had c a r r ier bags c o n t a ^ f n g    cans of lager

and         r.     I remained in this area assisting with the parking of

vehicles until approximate ly 2.45 pm <1445) when the volume of traffic

at this point had reduced and there was just                 intermittent vehicles

arriving.          Along with other Special Constables from that area we

walked back along Mi ddlewood RD towards the ground with the main

body of supporters who were at this time well                  behaved.

On arriving         in Leppinys LN I was aware of a very large volume of

supporters.          I also noticed a group of about 8                  worse for drink

on the Bridge         in Leppings LN asking for tickets.            I was then

instructed by an Inspector             to the gym.     Due to the heavy congestion in

Leppings LN I took my officers down Vere RD entering the ground in

Peni stone RD.          Immediately on enter i ng the g round at 3.05 pm (1505)                 I

was directed immediately onto the pitch with the Serial                       of Specials.

I was not aware at this time what had happened.                   Immediately on

arriving onto the pitch officers were split under the direction of a

Chief      Inspector     (not known).      I was directed to the Spion K ojb behind

                                                              xj_
the goal monitoring the Nottingham Forest supporters to prevent

pitch invasion.           Once the supporters were aware of the situation and
                                                                                    PAGE     3

          had settled down I intermittently helped dazed and distressed

           supporters to avail abl e first aid, also making      checks on Special

          Constables.        I took SC              out of the ground for approximately

           10 mi nu te s, she was    in a very distressed condition,   having   regained

          her composure we returned into the ground.          I then continued to assist

          distressed supporters.

          At 5.30 pm (1730)       I then began to co-ordinate the re-grouping of

          Special Constables behind the North Stand as they began to return to

          the ground,    some in a very distressed condition.       I then took all

          Special Constables        into the North Stand for de-briefing at 6.30 pm

           (1830), all Specials       being accounted for. After de-briefing     I then

          attended with Divisional Commandant MARTIN at the Royal Hallamshirg.

          Hospital arriving at 7.00 pm (1900)         to check on one of my injured

          Special Constables,                         who sustained rib injuries.



                             I left the hospital,   going off duty at 8.00 pm (2000).

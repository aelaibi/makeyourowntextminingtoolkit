Since Professor Maunder and I met you for lunch some months ago, the FSADC has been
hard at work preparing a variety of documents.

The first of these is now ready and deals with the subject of "Seating" and I have pleasure
in enclosing a copy for your information. I very much hope that you will find this both of
interest and in support of the recommendations in your Hillsborough Report.

Other publications are expected to be issued at regular intervals over the next few months.

One of the early documents will be a Bibliography of recent publications relating to Football
Stadia, and I wonder whether you would be kind enough to consider writing a Foreword to
that book?

If you are agreeable in principle I will write to you separately with more information so that
you can see what the booklet will contain. Also, unlike the Introductions to the Seating
booklet, it would be our intention for your Foreword to be bound into the Bibliography
booklet.

With kind regards,




Gwilym Roberts

                     Gwilym Roberts, Chairman of the FSADC
                  WELCOME BY GWILYM ROBERTS CBE, CHAIRMAN OF
                  THE FOOTBALL STADIA ADVISORY DESIGN COUNCIL.

                   On behalf of the FSADC, the editor and our three contributing
                    experts, I have much pleasure in presenting the first of what
                     we intend to be a comprehensive series of advisory booklets
                   , on detailed aspects of stadium design. I hope that all who
                      read the material will deem it to be interesting, relevant and,
                      above all, useful.

        All over the world the game of football has inspired architects and engineers
to design and construct a rich variety of stadia. Britain, where the modern game
first took root, was for many years a leader in this field. Indeed we still possess
football grounds in this country which, with their wealth of tradition and marvellous
atmosphere, are respected and envied throughout the world game.

The task of the FSADC is to make sure that Britain maintains and enhances that
position, not only by helping football clubs to meet the recommendations of Lord
Justice Taylor’s Report but also by encouraging the very highest standards of
design.

The disasters at Bradford and Hillsborough have created a powerful desire to see
a new generation of football stadia evolve, providing our national game with a
unique, once-in-a-lifetime opportunity to develop safe, modern and comfortable
facilities for supporters. To miss this opportunity would be an unforgiveable ‘own
goal’.

Success will require the close collaboration of the football authorities, local and
national government, financiers, planners, architects, engineers, technicians,
manufacturers and those involved in research. But the potential benefits are
enormous, not least the continuing rise in gates and revenues, and perhaps the
staging of the 1996 European Championships or even the game’s greatest event,
the World Cup in 1998.

The FSADC’s role in this immense challenge is clear. Our planned series of
advisory publications will be the first published in this country to provide specific,
straightforward guidance on the myriad of complex issues which stadium design
entails. The Council will also be holding seminars, marshalling research, and
through the compilation of a comprehensive register, serving those who need to
find experts in specialised fields.

We have the expertise in this country. We have many talented individuals and
companies able to provide a service. And now, with the help and backing of the
FSADC, we hope that these skills can be put to the best possible use.
ROBERT ATKINS MP, MINISTER FOR SPORT

I am very pleased to have the opportunity to welcome this, the first of a series
of guidelines to be produced by the Football Stadia Advisory Design Council.
The FSADC was established in the aftermath of the tragic events at
Hillsborough in April 1 9 8 9 , amid a growing recognition amongst all those
involved in football that the standards of safety and comfort at our football
grounds were in urgent need of improvement.

These new guidelines on seating, and those to follow which will cover all
aspects of stadia design will, I am sure, provide a valuable source of
expert advice and a common reference point to all those charged with the
responsibility of bringing our stadia up to the standards of safety and comfort
that football spectators are entitled to expect.




SIR BERT MILLICHIP, CHAIRMAN OF THE FA

When Lord Justice Taylor recommended the setting up of an Advisory Design
Council, the Football Association, in conjunction with the Football League,
recognised that football did indeed lack expertise in this direction. Gwilym
Roberts and the other members of the FSADC have undertaken to fill this
vacuum and identified several key areas which needed their immediate
attention.

One of these was the production of advisory booklets on the individual
problems which football clubs need to tackle. I am certain that they, along
with everyone interested in the development of stadia in this country,
welcome this publication arid those which are to follow it.


                                                             tvc'




WILLIAM FOX, PRESIDENT OF THE FOOTBALL LEAGUE
On behalf of the Football League, I am particularly pleased to welcome this
first publication by the Football Stadia Advisory Design Council. Football
League clubs will, I am sure, find the information contained in this and future
publications most useful as they continue to upgrade their stadia in line with
the recommendations made in Lord Justice Taylor’s Final Report.

Gwilym Roberts and the members of his Council, along with the authors and
editor of this first publication, are to be congratulated for producing such a
valuable document. I look forward with enthusiasm to the publication of
future issues in the FSADC series

Dear Sir,

I have pleasure in enclosing a copy of the FSADC's first publication "Seating" which
deals with sightlines, seat types and conversion of terracing to seating.
Further publications dealing with other key issues will become available over the next
few months - see page 24.

In addition, we will be compiling a register of specialist consultants and suppliers,
which clubs proposing to embark on improvements to existing stadia or the
construction of new ones will be able to access.

We are also planning to hold a series of meetings seminars at which information about
the Council's work and recommendations will be discussed by representatives of clubs,
professional advisors, suppliers and other interested parties. It is hoped that the first
will take place in the early autumn. Details will be circulated to you in due course.
I hope you will find "Seating" of interest and the work of the Council of value and I
would welcome your observations so as to ensure that our future activities and
priorities respond to your needs.


Yours truly

In the UK, the most commonly used material for stadium seating is Polypropylene with UV (ultra-violet stabilizers) and absorbers (see first column).
A number of other materials available on the market are compared in the table below, compiled by BASES. Wood and metal are still used, but have
been excluded as they are both uneconomic when compared to plastics. It should be noted that the figures given for the 'raw material cost factor'
are for information only, and do not necessarily reflect unit costs to the buyer.

                     Report of the Technical Working Party for Lord Justice Taylor's Final Report


     Serving the needs of football
     In August 1 9 9 0 the Football Association and the Football League combined to implement
     Lord Justice Taylor's recommendation that an Advisory Design Council be set up. The
     Council's aim is to encourage higher standards of stadium design, promote wider
     knowledge and foster research
       The Council's Chairman is Gwilym Roberts CBE, F.Eng., Chairman of Acer Group Ltd
     and a past President of the Institution of Civil Engineers.
       The five members are: Prof. Leonard Maunder OBE, F.Eng. (Dept, of Mechanical
     Engineering, University of Newcastle), Dr. Chris Nicholson PhD, C.Eng, MIM (Deputy
     Director at the Research & Laboratory Services Division, Health and Safety Executive),
     Geraint John (Chief Architect & Head of Technical Unit for Sport at the Sports Council),
     Alan Butterfield FRICS, FIHT, ACI Arb (Senior Partner at George Corderoy & Co) and
     Simon Inglis Qournalist, author and member of the Football Licensing Authority).
        The Council's Executive Officer is Christine Gausden, MCIOB, to whom all enquiries
     should be made at the address below.
        The Council is privileged to draw upon the expertise of experienced individuals who
     form both its Architects Working Party and Engineers Working Party. Both groups will play
     a leading role in the drawing up of future publications, as will numerous other experts
     and organisations whose support for the FSADC's aims is greatly appreciated.

     Publications
     If you would like to receive notice of all FSADC publications, or would like to order
     further copies of this booklet, please apply in writing to the Executive Officer. Cheques
     for £ 1 2 .5 0 (inc. p&p) should be made payable to the FSADC.
        Forthcoming titles for 1 9 9 1 include the following topics:

       •   Feasibility Studies • Communication Systems • Toilets    • Roofing • Steelwork
           • Turf Systems • Police Facilities    • Appointment of Professional Advisors
             • Stadia Costs • Planning Regulations and Applications     • Legal Issues

     The FSADC is also drawing up a selective Bibliography, comprising references to major
     publications, journals, papers, standards and regulations relating to football stadia and
     their design. Publication is planned for Autumn 1 99 1.

     Register
     The FSADC is in the process of compiling a register of consultants, manufacturers and
     suppliers with experience of, or interest in, all stages of stadium design, listed under
     their areas of specialisation. Extracts from this register will be freely available, on
     request, to all members of the Football League and Football Association. Outside bodies
     will be asked to pay a search fee.
        If you wish your company to be included on the FSADC register and have not yet
     received registration forms, please contact the Executive Officer at the address below.

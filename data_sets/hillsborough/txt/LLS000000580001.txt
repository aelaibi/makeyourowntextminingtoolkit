I,   '                                                   (born                              of

                  ■                      , Nottinghamshire (telephone

will state


I am employed by                                    and I am          years old.


On   Saturday         8th    April    1989    I    went to Sheffield         as a Liverpool supporter

to see the game in the F.A.                  Cup semi final between Liverpool and Nottingham

Forest.


I did not have a ticket                 for        the game but I knew from previous              experience

that there would probably be                       someone in the area of the ground who              would

be prepared to sell me a ticket although I might have to pay over the odds.


I    arrived
     r
                 in    Sheffield       with some friends at about 11.45 a.m.                      I believe

the ground opened at about                   11.00 a.m.            I managed to buy a ticket from a

man about        10 minutes from the ground.                       The man had with him his son and

he had a £6 standing ticket                       at the Liverpool end of the ground.                I paid

£10 for it.            I could       see that there were other peoplealso selling tickets

but I did not see any                fogeries.


I entered the ground at                  about 2.20 p.m.              The turnstyles were already busy

but I was surprised                  how few police there were about.                 I had no difficulty

 getting    in    to        the ground       and    unlike       my   previous   experience      at the semi

 finals there was no 'screening*                     as we approached the ground to ensure that

 we had tickets.


 Having    entered          the ground* I          was    able    to go to the front of the terrace

 directly      against        the wall       and     the    anti      hooligan   fencing.     The wall was

 between    knee        and    waist    high       and    the    fencing was fixed on to the top of

 the wall.            Gradually the crowd began to grow and I did at one point think

 of going into the wings of the terrace because they were empty but to do

 that I would have had to go                       over the top of the fencing of the pen             or out

 of the central terrace and round to the side.
I was on the front row of the central terrace about 10 or 15 feet of the

right hand goal post facing down the pitch.


When I first went on to the terrace some of the players were out on the
                                                                                                                   /


pitch having a kick about but they soon went in.


As        3    o'clock          drew near       the names         of   the     teams were announced and there

was general cheering.                        I cannot remember the actual kick off and so I believe

that the incident of the pressure on me took place at about 3.00 p.m.


 At       first       I    simply       felt    a    big surge         of the crowd coming          from the back.

 I    expected             it    to    recede       because      sometimes when the players           come out   the

 crowd          moves       forward      but        almost    inevitably       start   to move back easing the

 pressure             on    those       at    the    front    once      they    have   seen   the   players warming


 up before the match starts.


 On this occasion however the pressure did not ease and I became increasingly

 aware' of pressure                     from    the back         pushing me forward.           I became pinned    to

  the         fence        straight      ahead       of    me.      I was not pushed          to the side at all.

     At       first       the pressure was on my back, then it got worse and worse until

     after a few minutes I was numb in my left a m .                                    I had put my left arm on

     to       the   fence to try to stop myself being pressed against it and I could

     not manage to pull it back.                          I was not able to move my body at all.


     The       match was still going on                      and I could hear people screaming around me.

     The       crowd were             calling to the police to open the gates in the fencing to

      allow us on to the pitch but nothing seemed to be happening.                                       Some of the

      crowd were worried about children who were with them and were calling to

      the police and people on the side of the pitch for assistance.


      At       first the           police       did not seem            to realise that a serious problem was

      developing.                I did not see             the    policeman run onto the pitch and stop the

      game which I have later been                         told happened.


      I        only        became      aware    of the       fact      that    the natch had stopped when        people

                          ,Hn,hW        over the          fence..      I could still hear people screaming to
the policemen and other people                to       open    up    the    gates.     I    did   hear    a   St.

John Ambulance         man tell us that the gates in the fencing had been opened

and so we could take it easy since we would be allowed out but no-one was
                                                                        /
stopping to allow anybody else through.                          I believe in fact that the number

of people was so great and the pressure so heavy                                that the only chance of

getting out through the gate was to be directly in front of it.


I could not move my head or arm since it was heavily pressed against the

fence.      On       my right was a lady who had put her arm across the fence to

ease    pressure on herself and my head and throat were pressed against her

arm which caused me difficulties in breathing.


On my left was a man who looked to be about 19 years old.                                   He was screaming

all' the time until suddenly he threw up and was sick all over me.                                       I could

then     feel    him urinating over me on my back and legs and then he went blue

and he      fell     into    the space where I had                  been standing.         I did not see him

taken away or lifted out but I firmly believe that he died at my side when

 he fell.


 I do not know how long I was pinned to the wall and fence before I managed

 to get out but I would place it at about 20 or 30 minutes.                                       Before I got

 out    I was        conscious      of the police             trying   to    pull the barriers           down but

 I was     standing         right    next    to       a post which was holding              a barrier up       and

 I knew that if             they got the fence down they would not be able to                            pull the

 post    down.         Additionally         I kept        thinking that       if the       barrier   came down

 I would not           be able to. get over the wall since I was                           pinned right to it

 by my legs and I was afraid that people would'be trampling over me.


 I kept      hearing wires           ’popping*         and knew that I had to get out                    if I was

 to .survive. ' I managed in the end to pull myself up the fence with my right

 hand     and    I     could     feel   somebody above me trying to lift me out.                           I have

 since     seen on the television news a policeman pulling me over the fence.

  At    first    I could not get over the fence because my left arm was p mnea.

                                                  -   1   -
 Then my jeans            caught        on    the    spikes       in the waistband      and   I had    to lower

myself down to release the spike then be pulled further only to find that

my jeans had caught in the spike.                                My jeans and shirt were badly torn but

I was eventually pulled over the fence and went on to the pitch.                                           <■


The people on the fence who were lifting fans over were too busy lifting

fans     to deal with                those who had been able to get over.                  At first I stayed

on the floor for a few moments but I wanted to get out of the way of the

first       aid     and        police    who    were       dealing with      fans   more   seriously    injured

than me or those who had died.                             My legs had been pressed against the wall

and     were       cut    and bruised.              I had no feeling in my left arm but I could

walk     slowly          and    so     I went       down    the    pitch   towards the centre circle and

walked       towards       the Forest side.                 There was nobody        telling us what to do,

nobody       seemed       to     know    what to do even though I kept looking for someone

to give directions which would give guidance as to where the fans who had

been     involved         should        move    or sit or rest.             I therefore climbed into the

seating section over the billboards.                              I was looking to see if I recognised

anybody who may be able to assist.                          I had gone to the match with my fiancee's

sister and her boyfriend and her friend and husband and as I walked down

the    side        of the pitch I looked for someone I had seen with them earlier

in    the    Nottingham              Public    House, Sheffield           which   was   a public house near

the Hopsital near the ground.                         A man I had seen there recognised me although

I do not know his name and wiped the sick from me.


I    also    saw     a friend who had travelled up with me in my car (she was my

fiancee’s          sister's          girlfriend).          She    asked    if I   was   alright but I could

not remember my reply.


I had       climbed back by this time over the billboards and was walking along

the touchline down                   towards the Forest kop end.                  There was a good deal of

abuse       from    people        as    I walked       down       since they did not seem to know the

extent      of the tragedy.                  Someone shouted to me "we'll never get into Europe

now" and "its always you scousers".

                                                      - 4 -
I climbed back over the seats and went to the toilets in the stand.                                      There

was still no feeling in my left arm.                              I filled a sink with water and ducked

my head into it.                      I knew that people were staring at me because my jeans

and shirt were torn and I washed off the dirt as far as I could.


I    went          back   into    the ground and climbed over the billboards                       and I could

hear       Forest         fans    shouting       about    Liverpool      in   a way which indicated       they

did       not know what was happening.                      Liverpool fans were still being blamed

and       taunted         in    the    chants.      I    also heard a roar from the Liverpool end

and       I    could      see    bodies    being        brought    out   on     billboards   and   fencing and

laid          on    the   pitch.        I saw people being given the kiss of life all over

the pitch.


Eventually the atmosphere changed as the Forest fans realised that something
      t

very          serious      had    happened.         At first       it seemed to be only those in the

seats down the side of the pitch who realised what had happened but then

those standing at the end knew there had been a great tragedy.


I had been wandering about until about 3.45 or 4.00 p.m.                                     in a very dazed

condition            still       suffering       from the physical damage to my legs                from being

pressed against the wall and the numbness in my left arm and shoulder.


I climbed back over the billboards, went up the passage through the seats,

past the back of the stands and left the ground.                                    I walked to the car and

could          see    ambulance men,         ambulances         and police everywhere controlling the

traffic flow.


I went             to phone my mother from a shop to tell her that I was alright but

she had not heard about the incidents at the ground.                                     I got back     to the

car       between         4.15    and    4.30     p.m.    and     my   friend    who had travelled up with

me came back at about 5.00 p.m.


We        listend to radio Hallam and                    at first I only heard of a few casualties

but gradually the figure kept going up.

                                           - 5 -
X could not drive home because I was physically unable and so my fiancee's

sister's boyfriend drove the car.                          He said he would not have let me drive

anyway as I was in no condition to do that.


We listened to the radio and I could hear them appealing for off duty police

and medical staff to report in as soon as possible.                          I did not go for medical

treatment           in Sheffield because I thought there were people more seriously

injured         than me but when we reached Nottingham we went to my friend's home

(i.e. the driver of the car) and I had a bath.                            I threw my jeans away having

thrown         my shirt        away      earlier because it was a          Liverpool   shirt and people

were taunting it.


I       had    been      supposed        to go    to    a wedding   reception on Saturday night and

was       going       to stay       so    I had    brought some clothes to change into for the

reception,            so I     changed into them after I hadhad a bath and went                  to the

Queens         Medical*        Centre      in Nottingham       at about   7.30 p.m.In the Accident

 and Emergency Department,                   my head was x-rayed because of the swelling and

 pressure marks               from the railings           but. no fractures were found.      My arm was

 examined           because      of   the    lack of      feeling down the inside from the top to

 the thumb, including the thumb.                        They tested it.with pins to test the numbing

 sensation.              I was      checked thoroughly        for cuts and bruises to both my head

 and      legs.          I was    advised that the feeling would probably come back to my

 arm.


    I was asked if I wanted to go home but                          advised to have counselling.       My

    parents         and sister had arrived while I was being examined and I went home

    at about 10.00 p.m.


    I returned           to the hospital on Friday the 21st                 April as the feeling in my

    arm       had   still     not     come   back.        I was examined and told that there could

    be permanent damage.

                                                                     of                , Eastwood,   Notts

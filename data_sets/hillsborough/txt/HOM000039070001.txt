               Dear £hris

               Further to our recent discussions please find enclosed my analysis of the major variances
               between the findings of Lord Justice Taylor and the summing up of Dr Popper. Please note
               that whilst the analysis is comprehensive it is not fully exhaustive. Had time permitted I would
               have liked to compile a section on the barriers in Pens 3 and 4.

               I am also enclosing copy extract from the Inquest (21s1February 1991) which in my view
               confirms that Dr Popper was indeed aware of the existence and role of Roger Houldsworth.

               Sorry for the late delivery but it has been a long hard slog.

               Best wishes for Christmas and New Year.

               Yours sincerely

for late or congested arrivals, or any provision
for the avoidance of overcrowding on the
terraces, there was a number of other
omissions. For example, there was no
specific deployment of officers to man the
perimeter gates. The Order did not detail
the duties of the mounted officers deployed

included Liverpool officers to assist in
marshalling their own fans .... By an
oversight, the provision requiring mobile

services was omitted from the text.”.

dangerous congestion at the turnstiles.       similarly for the ones who came in later.”

police should have realised, the turnstile
area could not easily cope with the large    “If you want to add the under 80
numbers demanded of it unless they arrived   milligrams into the people who had over 80

                                             too many, but we had quite a few
                                             Licensees in the beginning and the upshot I
                                             think of all their evidence was this, barring
                                             one and we subsequently had somebody

                                             Licensees was that consumption was in the
                                             range of 3-4 pints, on average; ....one
                                             Licensee who was in a small pub who said:
                                             “I was not displeased to see them go”.....
                                             but the vast majority of the publicans had

recognise that. On the other hand their
pubs were full” Day 76 P49G-50E

“We also heard from a whole load of
people who live in the neighbourhood or
who were in the streets      like Mrs
Guilland-Cumming, she found the
atmosphere threatening. Make of that
what you will. I don’t think that it is
terribly significant. It may be that she just
is not used to large crowds.
We also asked quite a lot of people as to
whether they saw people carrying or
drinking out of cans and we got a
distribution from those who said: I did not
see a single one” which one you may treat
with a certain degree of caution, I think.....
to those who said they saw at least 50%
and we got a nice spread of opinion.” Day

“... there are several I could mention.
There was one young m an,        who when
he entered by Gate C (a) had to hold on to
his friend and (b) was terribly concerned
about his footing. Now he attributed that
to the fact he was carried along by the
crowd. That may be so.... but it might well
go along with the possibility that eight
pints or thereabouts has something to do
with your ability to stay steady.” Day 76

“....but... the real problem is trying to
decide whether or not that percentage, and
let’s take it as say 20%      and let’s take it
that they were the “3 pint people”. What
effect if any did that have on their
behaviour and in particular on their
response or otherwise to direction and on
their mood in the sense of increasing their
frustration; decreasing their frustration;
increasing their aggressiveness; decreasing
their aggressiveness, or what effect did it
have?” Day 76 p53B-E

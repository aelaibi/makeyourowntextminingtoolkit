                           Dear Stefan


                           In response to your letter of 14/10/91 I am sure that any spare
                           copies of documents re latin g to the Hillsborough Disaster Inquest
                           left over once the records are handed over to Chris Dorries's
                           satisfaction, (or to the City Archives), will be of little value or
                           interest except to you and it would be quite in order for you to keep
                           them for your personal career records.



                           I agree that time spent compiling an inventory of documents you take
                           for these purposes would be pointless.


                          Yours sincerely




                          D W Purchon

        Dear David,

        You will recollect thfet when we had lunch around about the 8th of October,                       *
        mentioned to you that I would like to take home with me whe n I leave, some of
        the transcripts relating to Hillsborough, and possibly some of t
        transcripts arising out of the Public Inquiry when we have copies surpl
             we need for the records. Obviously I did not want to make any p a y m e n t s
        for these copies.

        You indicated that you did not think that there was any objection to this
         and we could deal with this by way of exchange of letters.


         there^may'he^ome othe^document^or^papers^other^tha^transcripts^which3!


         any objection if I retained some of these as well.

         I have not yet defined the detail of this and I could in du e cour se let you
              a full inventory, but it would be extra work and I do not think it woui
         be particularly useful, and I woul d e*pecr that in the end it wou ld not be
         completed Unless you therefore feel that you definitely want to have a
         complete list of papers etc., I do not propose to prepare this.

         I look forward to hearing from you with your confirmation (so that the
         record is straight)               in due course.

         Youf if sincerely,




                         r.

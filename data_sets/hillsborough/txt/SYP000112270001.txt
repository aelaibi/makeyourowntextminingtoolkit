I am a Police Inspector in the South Yorkshire Police stationed at

Doncaster.

On the 9th April 1988 I was on the semi final day duties between

Liverpool and Nottingham Forest football clubs* I was in charge of

serials of officers on Leppings Lane and the main purpose of this

duty was to prevent football fans from walking and travelling along the

side street which travel off fron this road. Officers were detailed at

road junctions along this stretch of Leppings Lane and had barriers

erected to prevent access onto these side roads. My particular area

of responsibility extended from the first houses along this road from

the Leppings Lane roundabout for about two hundred yards.

I can say that at no time during this duty did I see or order any of the

barriers to be taken from off the side roads and used on Leppings Lane.

I can further say that no such barriers were used on Leppings Lane

in the area where I held responsibility to filter any of the football

fans.

I can also say that having performed duty on both 1988 and 1989 F.A.

Cup Semi final duties that the police arrangements and details appeared

to be very similar throughout. As a supervisory officer I was fully

aware of exactly what was required of me on each of these dates. I

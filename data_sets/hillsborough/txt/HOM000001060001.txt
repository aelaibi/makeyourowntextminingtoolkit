 The gate           in the   perimeter        fe ncing    leading     into    number     2 pen was

 opened for me to enter*                     I was a ware of other officers                 following me

 in there           but am unable       to     say who    they were.         The   crushing           in number

After     pulling    out   several        people-by this method I began to select

people who       I could see were           clearly    in distress.        I could see       people

were     clearly having dif fi c u l t y breathing from their ♦aces-                       Some were

only being       held up by the           pressure    exerted on them by the          crowd,

litera lly out on their feet*                   I shouted to l“$s di stressed men             into

the    crowd to      pass me those         people.     The    lesser    distressed nren behaved

i m p e c c a b l y , without   panic end       ignoring     their own oovious       fears for

osrsonal       safety    and    passed rr>e the      o e o - 1e I scouted for.       It was

nec es sa ry    to shout and screa-V:             a be heard but       I pulled several more

people over' the fence and                I v.as aware      tnat    other supporters behind me

were tending         for those ft-ost distressed.

After      pulling    in the      »eglcn of twenty people over             the    railings,    I got

my first       view of a pile of           people    under the       perimeter    fence,     They

were     laid in a heap          reaching ten to twelve feet             back from the fence,

six or seven deep and along                 the    length of the fence,           My immediate

thought was that the              people had just fell             and because some of the

crowdi ng      had been relieved,           they were all          going to get up.        I then

saw a w om a n ' s    face.      She was       en tangled    in the    pile towards the top,

with her head hanging              backwards*        Her face was       purple*     I realised I

had to get to that woman.                  I shoute d to someone         to my right to cup

his hands       to acc om mo da te my foot,          as sisting me to scale the            railings*

I cannot       be sure whethe r         this    person was a police officer or a

supporter*         I got over       the fence an d started to try an d free people

from the       e nt ang le d    pile.     It became    immediately obvious that many of _

the     peopleWere       a l r ea dy dead*                                                             7

his m ou t h a n d throat with my fingers and tried to get more air                               into

not    respond*        I left     the two       supporters        with him trying to revive

him.     He was    obv iously dead.

There was a pile of bodies                   under      it.   People from the        crowd were

still    pushing        f orw ard against myself and other helpers*                       The only

forward,       scrambl ing       over     the   bodies,       and climbing up it.          I saw

Police C o n s t a b l e      1775- Hu mphries       on the fence        pulling a supporter

over.      I sh out ed to Police Cons ta bl e Hu mphries to get the gate                           open

and to     get    some     polic eme n       into the     pen to form a line to           carry    people

out.      I then saw Chief S u pe ri nt en de nt Nesbit at the fence.                         I shouted

to him a nd made           the same       request*        The supporters        in the     pen were

acting     in panic and          it' was      impossible       to organise      them.

 I had found a y o u th          in the       pile still       breathing a nd      I was    carrying

barrier and thew                it over   the per jroatar' fence at 'the '^olice.                I was

the gate       into a line anc$ I saw the barrier                     land near to him and those

officers,           As    I neared the gate          it was    opened and a panicking youth

who had        seen someone           in Ine    pile of people he knew,               jumped onto the

pile    in     front      of me and in front          of the gate.           The youth laid on top

of the        pile       crying and totally emotiona lly distraught.                        I had tomove

hint to       get    to the gate,           Hr Nesbit saw this           and ca;tie    into the pen      to

assist.        The y o u t h was       pushed through the            gate.       I was then able to

pass    the y o u t h      I was     carrying,      ass isted sy Hr Nesbit, 'through the gate

to officers          outside       the fence.        With Mr Nesbit and other officers                   I

began to move             bodies     from the area cf the gate.

Once    this was achieved,                other officers were able               to enter the        pen and

assist       to get       the    injured and dead out.              There was        no way to select

the living from the dead                   in the    pile.     Every      person was        pulled out

and passed t h r ou g h the gate.                 Others were still             climbing the fence

whi ls t      this was          going on.

In the        struggle          I twisted my      right knee and I felt a              very sharp

pain.        I shouted          ’My knees g o n e . ’     I was     unable      to stand.      Hr Nesbit

saw this and             in structed me to leave the              pen.     He    remained in there

w i t h other       officers.         I recall Police Co nstable Humphries                   helping me

th r o u g h the gate and I wal ke d onto the                  pitch.        I was     physically

exhausted.           Af te r sitting        on the      pitch for a couple of minutes,                 the

pain    in my knee          eased.        I got up,      took off my Police anorak and tunic

and    rejoined the             line of Pol ic e taking a position directly at the

alive.        Due   to the          line    being held up,           ■ carried this        person from the

gate    onto     the     pitch with anoth er               officer.        As we put him down I felt

for a pulse         in his          neck*      I could not         feel    one*     I was then.aware        of

Police Se rg ea nt McCall                  to my    right      bending over the youth.           The youth

had s t o p p e d   breathing and Sergeanl i^cCali started mo ut h to mouth

st arting       this,        two doctor?:         came to V-.e yo ut h and           continued to tend

him.     I left         to    re-join the          line.       I went back, inside the          pen after a

while.        The    pile of         people       seamed ^citcfileis.             .They had been piled

several       people deep            in the well         at the front of the terracing.                It

was my only thought                  to get       all   tne    people     in the     pile out onto the

pitch.        The   p h y s i c a l ■effort        involved was         tremendous.        At one stage

whilst     in the        pen     I saw Sergeant            McCall      again giving heart massage to

an    injured supporter.                   A n oth er   officer was giving mouth to mouth.

Somebody        shouted,         ' W e ’ve got      this      one g o i n g . ’   He was   lying on the

steps    of the terrace.                   Most    of the other         people had al rea dy been

tak en out       of the        gate.        Ag ai n my thought was to get the supporter                     out

onto    the     pitch as q ui ck ly as              possible.          I shouted,      ’Come on lets have

him o u t . ’       I went to pick the yo ut h up,                     he vomited and       I got my

fingers       into his m o u t h to make sure his ai rw a y was                        clear.   The youth

was    coughing and sp lut te ri ng                 but 1 could see he then continued to

breath.         A g a i n Chief S u p e r in t e n d e n t Nesbit           came to help us and we

carried the          su pporter to the gate and                     passed him through to other

officers.

We w o r k ed    until        all    the     people were         carried out.

I then saw that a crush barrier had co mpletely collapsed.                                       There were

a press           photographer.                    Two   or three men oroke                   througn the   cordon of

Police a n d          ran at                                                            m     a n aggressive manner,

 shouting         obscenities.                     I restrained one of them and saw Police

Ser gea nt        mcCall            restraining another-                       They were taken back behind the

 cordon' to the top of the terracing.                                                                             left

 the    pen-        I shouted to the                     remaining           crowd      in the     pen to try and

 remain       calm.          I exp lained that the man wit h the                                camera had been a

 phot ogr aph s           had to be taken for the Coroner.                                    The ma jority seemed to

acce pt       this,        other         replied with abuse.

.The    pr ope r ty str ewn around was                            collected           and piled on the      track

 the    pen.

There were            both police and suppo rt er s                            on     the pitch.     Some   injured

were      still       being attended,                    both Po l ic e a nd supporters involved in

 carrying          people           on adverti si ng              boards       used as stretchers.           An

a l t h o u g h some    individuals          were      shouting    obscenities at the Police and

thr owing missiles.               At this 'time I could only walk around totally

s ho c k e d an d     physically exhausted..                I tried to consols seme

supporters*            One fan came to me and                identified me as having pulled

him from the           crowd-         I did not know whether            1 had    or not; whether      it

was me      or one of the hundreds                  of othsr      policmen tnere*      In any event,

he th an ke d me for saving his                  life and walk ed away-            The whole scene

cheeks *       Sorrse stood       in silent         groups whilst       others    tried to help

d is tr e s s e d    fans-

I rem ained on the            pitch and        tnere was          an announcement    that the game

wo uld be abandon ed.                 The   crowd at the L-eosines Lane            end applauded

whi lst     there was        jeering        from the Sp io n Kop.         The    crowd then started

to disperse,           I remained on the               pitch until     the maj ori ty of it had left

I found my helmet and tunic                      but    could not find my anorak.         I returned

to the Po li c e        room area behind the N o r t h Stand-                   It was there    I heard

over     the    radio that my serial                was    on Halif ax Road with the buses the

L iv erp ool        support er s were        to take       back to the    railway station-

I made my way there and                     re-joined my serial*          I remained with them

until we were           stood down from the ground at about 7-OQpm                      (1900)    that

date*

I then returned to Police H e a d q u a r t e r s and went off duty at 9* OOpm

(2100)      that"date-

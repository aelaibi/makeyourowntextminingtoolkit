Thank you for your letter of 12 December which I have only just seen. Please
accept my apologies for my non-attendance at the Special Meeting on 19
December last.

I support the campaign and I will do what I can to help.

In the meantime I enclose Hansard for the debate we had on the subject in the
House of Commons last week.

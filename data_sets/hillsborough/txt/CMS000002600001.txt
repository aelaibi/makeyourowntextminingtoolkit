        Dear Mr Goulbourn

        You wrote to Mr Moynihan                           on   6   February
        about The Taylor Report,

        However,   as   the    matter     seems   to   be
        primarily   for    the   Home    Office,    I  am
        passing   your   letter   to that      Department
        asking   them   to    reply   to    you   direct.

        Yours sincerely




        ALASTAIR MCINTYRE
        Private Secretary

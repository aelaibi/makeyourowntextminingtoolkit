SECRETARY OF STATE




 Thank you for your letter of 16 October about appeal rights against
 terms and conditions in safety certificates where these arise from
 a requirement of the Football Licensing Authority (FLA).

 We both recognise the need for the Football Spectators Bill (the
 Bill) to be clarified. Given your strongly held views on this
 issue we are prepared to accept that the Bill should be amended in
 the way you propose.  Instructions are being sent by our lawyers to
 Parliamentary Counsel to this effect so that the necessary
 amendments can be tabled.




                                 PETER LLOYD




 Hon. Colin Moynihan MP

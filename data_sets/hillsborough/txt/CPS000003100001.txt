17 January 1997




Dear Mr and Mrs Clark

The Attorney General has asked me to thank you for your letter of 9 January
and to reply. He has the deepest sympathy for yourself and all the families
involved in the tragic events which took place at Hillsborough and fully
understands the concerns raised by the recent programme. Your letter
suggested re-examination of the circumstances although you did not indicate
whether you had in mind a further public inquiry or the seeking of an order for
a fresh inquest.

In considering the question insofar as the inquest is concerned the Attorney
General has in mind the points made in the House of Commons in a debate on
this topic on 17 December and what the Home Secretary said in response. He
made the point that any decisions which have to be taken m ust be on the
basis of consideration of all the relevant facts and underlying evidence rather
than simply on the basis of the television programme itself. He said that in
particular the Home Office would consider whether there is any new evidence,
and if so, whether that evidence is of such significance that had it been put
before Lord Taylor or before the Coroner, either the outcome of the Taylor
Enquiry or the verdict of the jury would have been different.
The main role of the Attorney General in the events which have followed the
Hillsborough disaster has arisen from his responsibilities under Section 13 of
the Coroners Act 1988. He has previously considered several applications for
consent to the making of an application to the High Court for an order
directing the holding of a fresh inquest. In each case he concluded that the
matters put forward did not establish that there was a realistic prospect of the
High Court granting such an order. Indeed, very similar issues have been
canvassed in unsuccessful judicial review applications.
There does not appear to be anything in the programme which materially
affects the applications which the Attorney General has already considered.
Officials here are however in touch with the Home Office to ensure that the
Attorney General is informed of any new evidence which may emerge and is
relevant to his responsibilities under Section 13 of the Coroners Act 1988.

At present, and while the Attorney awaits the views of the Home Secretary,
there is nothing that can be added to what has already been said by him in the
House. The Attorney will have close regard to any points the Home Office may
put to him as to the desirability of any further inquest. In addition, any
application based upon further evidence would be considered carefully in the
usual way but as I have indicated, the programme is not of itself evidence.

Yours sincerely

                   Dear Dam* Barbara,

                  football jioaotcr at Hillsborough, Sheffield on the 15th April
                  1989. I write to you both a* a bereaved father and in my capacity
                  as Chairman oC the BFSG.
                  Following my fc«1 ep.hone conversation with Jane Gill on the
                  Lalejjhuuo yesterday we are arranging tor a full bundle of
                  documents and supporting video tape* to be hand delivered to you
                  today by Phil Hammond (Vice-Chairman.) and Ann Adlington
                  (solicitor). Further copies will be passed to the police Policy
                  Directorate (acting on behalf o£ the Home Secretary) on Thursday
                  of this week.
                  We felt that you would appreciate an opportunity to examine this
                  material properly and privately. Me have therefore attempted to
                  avoid media attention at Lhia time - hence the "private and
                  aenfidential" nature of our submission.
                  The bundle is large and the background same-wli*.L complex,
                  therefore I felt it useful to summarise th* k*y issues for youi-

                        Pre-production research, and the screening of the J im m y
                        Kcfinv«rn/f!r(ina<ia TV programme brought to light fresh
                        evidence and/or new witness's, some of this has reached the
                        public domain and io probably alroady known to you.

                        Follow up of these matters has led to the discovery of even
                        aoro evidence which not only corroborates the fresh
                        evidence, it proves that suppression of «vidence, perjury
                        and uouM^lreuy to pex'vwrt the course ol justice all
                        featured in the legal process that followed the dioaotcr.

     We have instructed Alun Jones QC and he has setn/ reviewed our
     material and his Opinion appears to support our view.

      Naturally these are matters for your office and we would formally
      request you to examine the evidence and to initiate a full and
      urgent criminal investigation into these matters.

     We will gladly make ourselves available should you/your staff
     require a meeting to discuss the evidence/ issues or we will
     provide any further detail/material you request.

     This clearly is a matter of public interest and not just victims
     families seeking retribution and/or vengeance. All we have ever
     sought is a proper and even handed investigation into the events
     that cost the lives of our loved ones.

     Justice can only be done when those charged with investigating
     the circumstances and presenting the results to an inquiry or a
     jury do so in an honest and even handed way. Clearly that cannot
     be the case in the light of the evidence we no w place before you.

     Yours sincerely




     Trevor Hicks
     Chairman.

        Video Evidence - HillflJborouqA Disaster

        I Trevor Hicks of \
                                                               would make the
        following statement la connection with video material I have
        viewed in recent week*.


        Earlier in a y career 1 was Divisional Director of Chubb Alarms
        L t d , a company which Mold, installed and serviced security
        systems and hence have a reasonable working knowledge of
        closed-circuit television systsas (CCTV)




        a)     zt is m y firm belief that the material I viewed is
               genuine footage recorded b y the South Yorkshire Police
               video system and that the time and date codes on that
               footage are correct.


       b)      I am content that the video material proves three ke y
              points;-
               1}      The crucial camera (scoreboard/Camera 5) was working
                       from llOOhrs through till 1700hrs at least.
              2)       It could p a n , tilt, and zoom and produced pictures
                       of sufficient quality and detail to "identify facial
                       features"
               3)      The footage contain excellent views of people
                       standing at the front of Pens 3/4 of the Leppings
                       Lane terraces and can be seen to zoom during such
                       sequenc es.


        c)    All of the above corroborate Roger Houldsworth'a
               statement and in m y opinion shows that Police Officers
               Ryan and Bichard gave false witness.

        d)    Because of the large number of "sequences" contained
              within tbe videos it ia incomprehensible that the person
              or persons who edited the "Compilation Video* did not
              know o f the existence of the extensive footage from the
              scoreboard camera.


        e)    it was not produced despite several requests from the
              inquest jury end this indicates suppression of critical
              e v i dence .


        f)    It is m y belief that had this footage been produced and
              shown to the jury it would have totally changed their
              view of "what the police could see".



       Background
       Following discussions with Katie Jones of Oranada Television,
       I contacted M r Chris Bryer, Head of Factual Programmes at
       Yorkshire Television in an attempt to establish what material
       was still in their archives following their production "First
       T u e sday ".


       After our telephone discussion he agreed to see what was
       available and contact me further.                The following d a y he
       returned m y call and advised that he and Roger Fizmlgan
       (Senior Producer and co-producer of the First Tuesday
       programme) had discussed m y telephone call /various aspects of
       H oulds worth 's evidence. Hm mad* the following c omment*:-


       1.     They had conducted an Interview with Roger Houldsworth a
              few weeks after the Disaster and were looking to see if
              any video footage of that remained.


       2.     They have a written transcript of the aforesaid Roger
              Houldsworth*s interview.


       3.     T h e y h a d found some footage of p o l ic e video tapes which
              bad b e e n su p pl i ed to them b y South Yorkshire p o l i c e when
              t h m y we r e researching/making the First T u e s d a y progromxam.

                 4.      The circumstances of fch* supply of video Capa* were as
                         follows:-
                                   An approach was made to SoutJi Yorkshire police.
                                   The request required ratification b y Peter Wright,
                                   the then Chief Constable.
                                   At a subsequent meeting with Peter Wright, a b o x of
                                   VHS video tapes were handed to Messrs Brier and
                                   Finnigan.
                                   Working copies (broadcast video tape format)o£ the
                                   VHS video tapea were made by Yorkshire Television
                         (Note; these were the tapes viewed by me. )


                 Mr B r ier confirmed that both he and Roger Finnigan remembered
                 carrying out the interview with Houldsworth and that it was
                 interrupted b y a police officer.                  He later confirmed that this
                 was Superindent Burton (?) who at the time was in charge of PR
                 at West Midlands p o l i c e .


                 It was agreed that we should meet so that I could examine
                 whatever video footage they had and that meeting took place on
                 Friday 24 January 1997.


                 Meeting At Yorkshire T - Friday 24th January 1997
                 Following a preliminary discussion mainly surrounding
                 Houldsworth's evidence and the relevance thereof, we crossed
                 to another building and entered an editing suite.


                 We viewed at length several video tapes including references
                 Pi-Part 1,2 & 3 and P4-Part 1 & 2, which clearly showed that
                 the score board camera (camera 5 on map attached as appendix
                 A) was working.


                 The pictures from this camera were clear enough to enable
                 identification of individuals and in only one case was there
                 any evidence of the flaring (whitening of screen) appmaring.

             The clarity of the images was more than satisfactory snd
             therefor* raised a serious doubt la a y mind regarding the
             truthfulness of evidence by the police officers responsible
             for operating the CCTV.


            Tapes Pl-Part 1,2 & 3 shows several different sequences taken
            from the scoreboard camera ( camera S) from the earliest time
            of 1200hrs through to 1423 and than 1S02 through to 1523hrs.


            Although there is no footage recorded from this camera between
            1423 and 1502 it is more than probable that the camera was
            working p e rfec tly well throughout this peri o d . The screen in
            the police control box would of course show the output from
            this camera even when it was not recording.


            Tape P4- Part 1 6               2 include similar footage timed at 1S57     and
            through until 1722 when the                 tape rune out.


            These sequences Include some very clear shots of the front of
            of the West Stand and Pen 3/4 on the terraces.                 Camera 5 can be
            seen to pan,           tilt     and xoom, especially when looking at agroup
            of four people at               the front of the terrace.


            Both sequence* of video tape show the arrival of a Limousine
            Registration NTV2 and comparing the video time bases we were
            able to establish that the footage had comm from two video
            machines -which fits the configuration of the Sheffield
            system.


            J contacted Roger Houldsworth by telephone and he confirmed
             that the two video machines in the police control box operated
             in parallel.            This would appear sensible as It would enable
             recording via either VCR of any of the two "sequencing*
             devices output enabling the police to either view or record a
             specific incident while the other machine was still on *uto-
             aequencm.

        It ia my opinion that chi a footage haa never been aaan before
        by myaelf and I believe h&e not b«en included in any police
        compilationm and/or other tapes that I have a ten.


        From m y knowledge of cloae circuit telcvlmlon and o£ this
        particular CCTV ayttt-.sm, thin evidence in uncontroversial proof
        that camera 5 - the black and white scoreboard camttza waa
        working between the hour* ot aay 1100am and 1700pm.                    In mil
        aaaaa bar one, thm images are clear and cannot be deacribed aa
        inferior.


       la addition to thm proof of quality, tha s e q u e n c e s c o n t a in
       pan, tilt and zoom actions which not only prova that thee*
       faclliilea warm functioning, they prove that tha operators
        (i.e. tha policeman) ver « using the camera and da facto must
       have known it to be working and been able to earn the terraces.


       Meaaro Dryer and Finnigan operate in the television world and
       hava produced many documentaries (including Firat Tuesday)
       which have relied upon video evidence.                They gave me the
       Impression that in their opinion this footage was more than
       adeepimte.


       Subject to rttr.httr.king renearch and/or other footage, Messrs
       Bryer and Finnigan appear t o a g r e e with mynelf that thin
       supports Houldsvorth'p evidence th*t the CCTV equipment
       viewing Fen* 3 and 4 waa functioning satisfactorily, both
       prior and subsequent to tha opening of Gate C.


       Furthermore, they advised that the transcript of t h e i r
       interview with Uouldaworth tends to support Houldcworth'a
       s ta te m e n t and in effect c o r r o b o r a t e * hie position H as n o t
       changed between the disaster and now regarding the performance
       of tJie equipment.


       It ia m y belief that the foota&e I viewed totally auppvria
       Uouldaworth'a position.

                                            The Hillsborough lim ite r /Inril 1989.


                                                           Opinion



            Introduction

             1      I am asked to give on opinion to the Hillsborough Family Support Group on the
                    appropriate legal course to follow in the light of three areas o f fresh evidence that
                    have come to light recently. Ninety-five people, mainly supporters of Liverpool
                     Football Club, died in tho Hillsborough Stadium in Sheffield as a semi-final of the FA
                    cup was beginning in April 1989. After a Ions inquest, hold in April and May 1990,
                    and later between November 1990 and 28* March 1991, verdicts of accidental death
                    were recorded on the victinu .

            2       A full application for Judicial Review was made in November 1993 by six o f the
                    bereaved families, seeking to quash the verdicts and obtain a fresh inquest. The main
                    complaints of these and the other families were set out in the skeleton argument
                    presented in (he Divisional Court hearings on their behalf, attached as Annex A. fn
                    summary form, those main complaints were,

                    2.1       The Coroner imposed an arbitrary cut-off point in time of 3.1S, which had the
                              effect of exeluding relevant evidence as to tho failure to implement the “Mqjor
                              Disaster Plan” promptly (paragraphs 6 and 7); and failures to summon the
                              emergency services promptly.

                    2.2       The Coroner failed to enquire into the individual circumstances o f the deaths
                              of the 95: he failed therefore to disclose and call evidence indicating that many
                              of the victims were alive after 3.15, and might have been saved by prompt
                              medical attention (paragraphs S.5 to 5.12. and 7)

                    2.3       The Coroner devoted an excessive time, reflected In seventeen pages of his
                              summing-up on the subjcct, to the unsubstantiated allegation that many of the
                              Liverpool supporters were under the influence of drink. The report by Lord
                              Taylor, which was severely critical of the police, had ruled out the
                              consumption of alcohol as a cause of the disaster (paragraph 10.10)

                    2.4       The CoroneT exhibited bias towards the South Yorkshire authorities in his
                              sclcction of evidence and treatment of witnesses (paragraphs 10 and 11).

                    2.5       The Coroner failed to leave the jury with any substantia! task to perform, in
                              directing them that there was no verdict intermediate between accidental death
                              und unlawful killing.

           3        The inquest verdicts were not quashed. The judgment of the Court is at Anns* n
                    The Court was strongly influenced by the feet that the lawyers originally instructed
                    for the families had Acquiesced in many of the Coroner’s decisions (eg page 7). that
                    the evidence presented then, in 1993, would not really have made a difference, or had
                    been properly excluded (pages 14- 36); that the directions of the Coroner to the jury
                    wore orthodox; and that a new inquest would serve no useful purpose (page 9 and
                    40).

           4      Since 1993, as I am keenly aware, various bereaved relatives, and the Hillsborough
                   Family Support Group as a whole, have continued to believe with deep conviction
                   that the legal .'system failed them badly, and that they have been deceived as to the
                   circumstances of death. After the 1993 judicial review it seemed to me that the
                   disaster would probably rccede, from the legal point of view, quietly into history. It
                   has not. In the past six months, there have been three developments which, in my
                   professional opinion, provide strong evidence of perjury by individuals police officers
                   at the inquest, and suppression of evidence, organised successfully to pervert the
                   course of justice at the inque.it. None of the following matters were made known at
                   the inquest.

           5      The evidence of Roger Houldsworth. Attached is an affidavit of Roger Houldsworth,
                   dated 25'h November 1996, attaching a statement of May 1989 and supporting
                   documents, and commenting on cvidcncc given at the inquest (Annex C l Contrary to
                   ih<# evidence presumed, no cameras were faulty; the cameras gave clear pictures of the
                   T-eppings Lane Terraces where the deaths occurred. If this evidence is correct, video
                  tapes and Mr Moulds worth's evidence were deliberately suppressed, and a number of
                  officers committed perjury. This evidence was made known to the world at largo in
                   December 1996 when Granada Television televised a drama-documentary on the
                  disaster. (The evidence of the witnesses referred to by Houldsworth is at Annex D)

           6      The n e w v id eotape evidence. Very recently, a. member of the Family Support group
                   has acquired from Yorkshire Television tapes which appear to be those, or copies of
                  those, taken away or stolen immediately after the disaster. Copies arc enclosed. I am
                  told that tapes, or copy tapes, were made available to Yorkshire Television by the
                  South Yorkshire Police shortly after the disaster, but at a significant time before the
                   inquest. I have been shown a videotape by Mr Trevor Hicks of the Family Support
                   Gmup in iho presence of Mr liouldsworth, Mr Philip Hammond of the Family
                  Support Group, and Ann Adlington of my instructing solicitors. The tape indicates
                   that policc o fficers were lying, and that the pictures of all relevant areas of the ground
                  were clear, detailed and uninterrupted, contrary to the police evidence referred to by
                  Mr Houldsworth in his evidence of November 1996. Hvcnts in the relevant area may
                  not, for various reasons, have been recorded on tape between 2.30 pm and 3 pm, but
                  they w ere dearly visible on the monitors to those on duty at the time.

          7       1 have ul.so been shown a copy of what was, I am told, presented to the jury. It is a
                  very badly duplicated and blurred picture o f individuals escaping from the stricken
                  pens shortly after 3 pm, in which it is indeed not possible to identify individuals. The

                  tope has bad interference in the picture. It appears that this tape is a copy at several
                  generations removed from either the copy'now made available to Mr Hicks, or from
                  the videotape of which the new evidence L<i a much better copy, but it presents only
                  events a Her 3 pm.

         8       The importance of the new evidence. The question whether the polite could and did
                 notice (he pressure on the pens before 3 pm was central at the inquest. On Day 77,
                 pugc 125, the Coroner directed the jury fAnnex Kk

                 “The assessment of the terraces” is a “very important factor” and “maybe the single
                 most important factor in the whole inquest'1. “The total sum of cvidcncc from the
                 Control Room, that is Mr Duckenfeld, Mr Murray, Mr Goddard and Mr Bichard was
                 that none of them noticed any problems with the pens until 3 o-cloclc”.

         9       None of this evidence was available in 1993, and yet it touched the core issue in the
                 caw in the pre-3.15pm period, regarded as by the Coroner aa the critical time. I
                 belie vo (lmt the existence of this evidence would have been of crucial significance to
                 the High Court in 1993, let alone the jury in 1991.

         10      The e v id e n c e of Dr Ed Walker In February 1997 the evidence of Dr Walker came lo
                 light; see Annex F. . The evidence at the inquest to which it must he contrasted
                 appear* at Annex G. The new evidence discloses that Philip Hammond junior had
                 “sinus rhythm and cardiac output” after arrival at the Northern General Hospital,
                 ShclTit'ht The statement Dr Walker made very shortly after, in 1989, shows serious
                 criticisms of the reaction to the disaster, and that other victims were alive. Dr Walker
                 points out in his letter of Th February 1997 that his evidence conflicts with that of Dr
                 Slater. Dr Walker was congratulated on 3* May 1989 by Dr Wardrope, who was
                 closely involved in the inquest, and who requested Dr Walker on 15lhJune 1989 to
                 .stand by to make a statement to the West Midlands Police. Dr Walker was not callcd
                 at the inquest.

         11      It is difficult to exaggerate the significance of the concealment of Dr Walker's
                  evidence. At page 10 uf the Divisional Court's judgment of November 1993 the
                  Court pointed to the Coroner's reason* for the 3.15 cut-off. In all cases, it was said,
                  the evidence disclosed the same pattern, o f rapid unconsciousncss leading to rapid
                  death. Dr Walker expressly disagrees, especially with Dr Slater. Perhaps the most
                  revealing remark comes from Dr Wardrope in his letter of 3rt May 1989 “Almost
                  immediately the department was flooded with large numbers of acutely ill patients
                  requiring urgent resuscitation". The whole inquest, spanning over ninety days, was
                  structured by the Coroner on an utterly different factual assumption.

         12      The previous inveaiijtation. One of the most striking aspects of this history is the way
                 in which the evidence presented to the inquest was evidence which tended to
                 exculpate the South Yorkshire authorities and the police from blame. Very serious
                 questions arise as to the process by which evidence was selected by the West
                 Midlands Polico who assisted the Coroner.

         12     Conclusion. In my view these new pieces of evidence call for a full police enquiry or
                public inquiry. Exhibits such as the tapes must be secured and subjected to forensic
                analysis by some independent body with powers to investigate and compel the
                product ion of evidence. Witnesses must be identified. I therefore recommend that
                this opinion, together with the documents referred to in it be sent to the Director of
                Public Prosecutions for her consideration, with a full copy to the Home Secretary,
                who has expressed interest in this matter in the last few months.

         13     i hope that the Director might feel able to allow a senior lawyer in her office lo meet
                 two or three of the Family Support Group, Ann Adlingtan and me to expand upon this
                 advicc.

           Dear Dame Barbara,
                             The Hillsborough Disaster 15th April 1989.

           Pursuant to Counsels Opinion obtained by the Hillsborough Family
           Support Group from Alun Jones Q.C, I enclose a copy of that
           Opinion together with Annexures referred to therein.
           Please also find enclosed copies of the video tapes referred to
           in paragraph 6 of the Opinion together with the draft statement
           of Chairman, Trevor Hicks, which describes how he obtained
           possession of the video tapes and his comments in relation to the
           same.
           I further enclose copy of the video tape referred to in paragraph
           7. This video tape was recently supplied by South Yorkshire
           Police to one of the bereaved families in response to a request
           for a copy of the actual footage presented to the jury.
           I hope that you feel able to convene a meeting as suggested in
           the final paragraph of Counsels Opinion and look forward to
           hearing from you.

                         The tape/s have never been seen before, by the
                         families, our lawyers, or by the Inquest jury. Only
                         one small section { 'a couple of minutes from 3.02pm"
                         says Coroner)

                         it proves the scoraboard aamera/CCTV system was
                         working and police control could see the terraces in
                         detail.

                         it contradicts police evidence                                   ■; ce.L' '
                         and fully supports Houldsworth's statement.

                         It shows many sequences from camera 5 - so many that
                         it is impossible for them to be aiisaed when the
                         aoaqpilation tape was produced by West Midlands police.

                         If this tape footage              is   not    "now*     then     it      was
                         suppressed as evidence.


         Para 3 -        tape (from camera 5) has never been mieeiug. ....

                         As above. - why was it not shown to the jury deapite
                         three requests for more footage etc.

                         coroner himself (p318B) says to Bichard "If I tell you
                         we cannot find it would that make any difference to
                         your answer."   - d C facto the tape was missing or the
                         Coroner misled the jury!Il

                         If not lost why did the West Midlands Polioe (acting
                         as Coroners Officers and Investigating Officers for
                         Taylor and DPP I) not reveal that other footage wae
                         available-   Th«y  or- South  Yorkshire   must  have
                         suppressed it! 11

                         Transcripts show both Taylor Inquiry and the Inquest
                         were misled regarding capability of system and quality
                         and quantity of pictures- (Biah»*d, Ryan, Goddard)

                         Coroner himself refers to missing tape.

                      As above.

                      “there is no evidence that the risk, the obvious risk,
                      was apparent to anybody in that oontrol room. I rely
                      upon the evidence of Murray/Goddard/Bichard etc. etc.
                      f I4T

                      Why did the Coroner say it was missing

                      why wee ic omitted from the compilation tape prepared
                      fior Taylor etc. - Missing or suppreaaed


         Pare 4 -     The camera that took              the    pictures      was    indeed     in
                      v©.ricing order.....

                      Prior to this statement the South Yorkshire Police
                      position has always been that the scoreboard camera
                      w as faulty, (transcripts confirm this.)

                      South Yorks Police tried to discredit Houldsworth (who
                      stated that he had repaired the camera) as recent as
                      December 1996.


         Pare 5 -        live transmission of the pictures into tfce police
                     control point at thm time was of poor quality....
         Pair* 5 -   It has always bean assumed that thm interferenam on
                     their screen was caused by television eguipaent being
                     used to transmit live coverage of the FA Cup seal -
                     final, which was not a faccor when the eguipmeuC was
                     tested warlimr in the day.


                     c c t v sysceas are hard wired with screened co-axial
                     oable and pictures £rom the camera are fed to the box
                     down these cabled and not "transmitted"

                     Thousands of TV outside broadcasts take place every
                     w e a k at aoceer s ta d iu m
                                            (and other locations) whze CCTV
                           use. Interference has not bean aaan to m q u c and
                     it would render crowd control at all these events
                     unsafe henoe it would have surfaced before now.

                     In a r e c a n t c o n v e r s a t io n w i t h t h e BBC i n Lieeds t h e y
                     confirmed no knowledge of this "problem". H o u ld s w o r t h
                     and Hicks have no knowledge of such problems.

                     Tha T r m n o c r ip t e shew that police e v id e n c e w as t h a t
                     other cameras were satisfactory. They use the some
                     cables and terminate in the police box - why did the
                     previously unknown Interference not affect them.

                      Tapes   came  from tha polio*     control box video
                      recorders. They show what was on the screens/ Police
                      could see, if interference was present it would appear
                      on the tepee.

                      Also in addition to the permanent TV screen/monitor on
                      each camera a second TV monitor shows what ia being
                      fed to each of the two v c r machines. Both screens
                      would have to be faulty for vision impairment.

                      The monitor* are the camera operators "eyes'1 when he
                      operates the cameras remotely (pan, tilt, zoom etc.)
                      and they must have been working for Bichard to perform
                      these tasks. Tapes shov such operations were carried
                      out many times - including with the scoreboard camera.

                      uouldawofth and PC Quest ( n o w deceased) both eaw
                      pictures from tha police CCTV system (via video link
                      to the club eontrol room) and they make no reference
                      to interference / claim good pictures.
         .Para 6 -    . . . . confusion o   w   'aiasin^1 tepee   seem s t o a r i s e   fr o m
                     thm fact that tvo othor tapes recorded at eh# ground
                     on the day of the disaster vers stolen overnight from
                     Sheffield Wednesday Football Clubg recording suite in
                     a locked room ia tic stadium.....

                     Kay issue is that tapes were "stolen" from a locked
                     cupboard, in a locked and alarmed room which was a
                     critical area in the middle of a major fatal injury
                     inquiry area UNDER POLICE CONTROL.

                     Only the police could benefit from the tapes loss and
                     the suppression of the new tapes and the loss of club
                     tapes are a vary suspicious coincidence indeed.

                     Houldsworth states that his numbering of tha VCRs Jn
                     the control room was unusual and the "thief" may have
                     intended to take tapes from different cameras to those
                     ■cstually taken.

         Dear Mr Pearson,

         Further to our telephone conversation earlier today please find enclosed a copy of the
         news release issued by South Yorkshire Police. Families are anxious that I respond to the
         same.

         I would draw your attention to the following matters:

         1) The Mbsin^Ta^g
         South Yorkshire Police state that “The tape in question. . . has never been missing and it
         was m ade available in full to both Lord Justice Taylor”s inquiry and to the Coroners
         inquest."

         It is the families case that footage from camera 5 did indeed go missing and iheiefore
         could not be shown to the inquest jury PC Bichard in hie evidence confirms that shots
         from cam era 5 w ould have been recorded prior to 15.02. He could not explain w hy the
         relevant footage could not be found (P 318 Annex D2).

         Families are concerned at this stage to hear that South Yorkshire Police themselves w ere
         in a position to "select" evidence for admission to either the Taylor Inquiry or the
         inquest. It has always been their understanding that the responsibility for gathering
         evidence lay w ith the W est M idlands Police w ho of course were also charged with the
         task of preparing a report for submission to the DPP in relation to the conduct of South
         Yorkshire Police on the day of the disaster.

         2) Camera 5
         It is now stated that "The camera which took the pictures was indeed in working order".

      3) Quality of Transmission

      For the first time South Yorkshire Police appear to be alleging that there was no fault
      with the camera but rather the quality of the transmission via the m onitors in the police
      control room. They now presum e that this interference w as due to the television
      equipm ent being used at the location.
      This has been discussed with the video technician, Roger H ouldsw orth, who has assured
      families that this claim is totally unfounded. One of the monitors in the Sheffield
      W ednesday control room was liriked to the Police CCTV system(P73 Annex C). There
      could not be interference on one system and not on the other. The monitor in the club
      control room showed clear and uninterrupted pictures w ithout interference.

      Further, in his statem ent Chief Inspector McRobbie describes how PC Bichard o p e r a t e d
      the zoom facility which he thought was "a super facility for spotting troublem akers in
      the ground". He also states that he was watching the screens and was aw are that the
      area in Leppings Lane behind the goal was filling up (P446 Annex D2). He etates that he
      looked on the left m onitor and was aware of a build up of supporters. At no time does
      McRobbie mention interference on the monitors. However, unfortunately Chief
      Inspector McRobbie was not called at the inquest.

      4) The Tapes Stolen From The Club Control Room
      Whilst it is Accepted that the tapes stolen from the club control room showed nothing of
      a probative value, the fact remains that they were stolen from a locked cupboard in a
      locked room which was alarmed. There was a massive police presence at the ground
      that night as effectively a m urder investigation was m ounted. It is inconceivable that
      such security could have been breached by a stranger. It is simply not satisfactory for
      South Yorkshire Police to dismiss this matter so tightly. Clearly the thief thought h e /sh e
      was stealing something of value.

      I trust you will take the above comments into account before making your decision.
      Finally, 1 should be grateful if you would telephone me on          pefore making
      any announcement to the media.

      I am anxious to ensure that families are warned in advance of any public announcement.
      W ith the 8th anniversary just a few days away this is a particularly stressful tim e for
      families.

                                     Response to Daily Mirror report on Hillsboroug i

               Responding to a report in|today’s Daily Mirror, about the Hillsboroug i tragedy, Assistant
            •’.Chief Constable Ian Dairies said:

             ‘ Reports about this part cular video tape continue to add confu sion to an already
             complex set of circumstances. The Chief Constable has always said that, any new
             evidence surrounding the disaster will be examined in detail. There is no new evidence
             in thfe article published,in ;he Daily Mirroi today.
.




            • '.'The tape in question - from a closed circuit television camera s [Owing the disaster
              unfold on the Leppings |_ane terraces - Has never been ‘missinc and it was made
              ayeiliable in full to both Ijord Justice Taylor’s inquiry and to the c< roner's inquest. Its
             existence has never been} in doubt.

             “The camera which took the pictures was indeed in working order, ot lcrwise there would
             have been no tape to submit as evidence.

             "What officers have previously explained is that the live transmissior of the pictures into
             the police control point at this tirtie was of poor quality This meant nat they had to rely
             on the view from the. polic e oontrol room window and on informarion mm officers on the
             ground.■, It has always been assumed that the interference on their screen was caused
             by tfHeVisioh equipment oeing used to transmit live coverage of th< FA cup semi-final,
             .whitlvwas not.aifactor wl-^eri the equipment was tested earlier in the lay.

             “As Jlvas. been explained before, the confusion over ‘missing’ tapes ieems to arise from
             the .fact that .two other tapes recorded at the ground on the day c the disaster were
             stolen overnight from Sheffield Wednesday Football Club’s recordii g suite in a locked
             foonv in lh e stodiurn: Orje would have shown a disused area of tl e complex and the
             other would have .shown turnstiles. Neither tape would have bi en relevant to the
             tragedy and th© motive ..foj’ the theft has never been established.

             "We understand that enquiries are being conducted by the Crown ^osecution Service
             but have not yet been concluded."

         Dear Mr Pearson,

         Further to our telephone conversation earlier today please find enclosed a copy of the
         news release issued by South Yorkshire Police. Families are anxious that I respond to the
         same.

         I would draw your attention to the following matters:

         l^TheJM issingTapg
         South Yorkshire Police state that "The tape in qu estio n . . . has never been missing and it
         was m ade available in full to both Lord Justice Taylor's Inquiry and to the Coroners
         inquest,"

         It is the families case that footage from camera 5 did indeed go missing and theiefore
         could not be show n to the inquest jury. PC Bichard in his evidence confirms that shots
         from cam era 5 w ould have been recorded prior to 15.02. He could not explain w hy the
         relevant footage could not be found (P 318 Annex D2).

         Families are concerned at this stage to hear that South Yorkshire Police themselves were
         in a position to "select" evidence for admission to either the Taylor Inquiry or the
         inquest. It has always been their understanding that the responsibility for gathering
         evidence lay w ith the W est Midlands Police who of course were also charged with the
         task of preparing a report for submission to the DPP in relation to the conduct of South
         Yorkshire Police on the day of the disaster.

         2) Camera 5
         It is now stated that "The camera which took the pictures was indeed in working order".
         This is contrary to evidence given by Officers Bichard, Ryan and G oddard who all
         disparaged the capability of camera 5 (see in particular pages 316 and 318 Annex D2).
         Video evidence recently submitted to you shows clarity of image and dem onstrates that
         the camera could pan, tilt and zoom ajnd produce pictures of sufficient quality and detail
         to identify facial features (Trevor Hicks statem ent refers).

      3) Quality of Transmission

      For the first tim e South Yorkshire Police appear to be alleging that there was no fault
      with the cam era hut rather the quality of the transmission via the m onitors in the police
      rontrol room. They now presume that this interference w as due to the television
      equipm ent being used at the location.
      This has been discussed with the video technician, Roger Houldsworth, who has assured
      families that this claim is totally unfounded. One of the monitors in the Sheffield
      W ednesday control room was linked to the Police CCTV system(P73 Annex C). There
      could not be interference on one system and not on the other. The monitor in. the club
      control room showed clear and uninterrupted pictures without interference.

      Further, in his statem ent Chief Inspector McRobbie describes how PC Bichard operated
      the zoom facility which he thought was "a super facility for spotting troublemakers in
      the ground". He also states that he was watching the screens and was aware that the

      looked on the left m onitor and was aware of a build up of supporters. At no time does
      McRobbie mention interference on the monitors. However, unfortunately Chief
      Inspector McRobbie was not called at the inquest

      4) The Tapes Stolen From The Club Control Room
      Whilst it is accepted that the tapes stolen from the club control mom showed nothing of
      a probative value, the fact remains that they were stolen from a locked cupboard in a
      locked room which w a s alarmed. There was a massive police presence at the ground
      that night as effectively a m urder investigation was m ounted. It is inconceivable that
      such security could have been breached by a stranger. It is simply not satisfactory for
      .South Yorkshire Police to dismiss this m atter so lightly. Clearly the thief thought h e/sh e
      was stealing something of value.

      I trust you will take the above comments into account before making your decision.
      Finally, I should be grateful if you would telephone me on 0151 225 2975 before making

         Dear M r Pearson,

         fu rth er to our telephone conversation earlier today please find enclosed a copy of the
         news release issued by South Yorkshire Police. Families are anxious that I respond to the
         same.

         I -would draw your attention to the following matters:

         1) The Missing Tape
         South Yorkshire Police state that "The tape in question. . . has never been missing and it
         was m ade available in full to both Lord Justice Taylor's inquiry and to the Coroners
         in q u e s t."


         It is the families case that footage from camera 5 did indeed go missing and Iheiefore
         could not be show n to the inquest jury. PC Bichard in his evidence confirms that shots
         from cam era 5 w ould have been recorded prior to 15.02. He could not explain w hy the
         relevant footage could not be found (P 318 Annex D2).

         Families are concerned at this stage to hear that South Yorkshire Police themselves w e r e
         in a position to "select" evidence for admission to either the Taylor Inquiry o r the
         inquest. It has alw ays been their understanding that the responsibility for gathering
         evidence lay w ith the W est Midlands Police who of course w ere also charged w ith the
         task of preparing a report for submission to the DPP in relation to the conduct of South
         Yorkshire Police on the day of the disaster.

         2) Cam era 5
         It is now stated that "The camera which took the pictures was indeed in w orking order".
         This is contrary to evidence given by Officers Bichard, Ryan and G oddard w ho all
         disparaged the capability of camera 5 (see in particular pages 316 and 318 Annex D2).
         Video e v i d e n c e recently subm itted to you shows clarity of image and dem onstrates that
         the c a m e r a could p a n , tilt a n d zoom and produce pictures of sufficient quality and detail
         to id e n t ify facial features (Trevor Hicks s t a t e m e n t refers).

       T. Hick*                                      P. Uunmonl                             M «, 1. Ttaynor

                                                                                             PAGE     02



        Quality of Transm ission

      For the first time South Yorkshire Police appear to be alleging that there was no fault
      w ith the camera but rather the quality of the transmission via the m onitors in the police
      control room. They now presum e that this interference w as due to the television
      equipm ent being used at the location.
      This has been discussed with the video technician, Roger H ouldsw orth, w ho has assured
      families that this claim is totally unfounded. One of the m onitors in the Sheffield
      W ednesday control room was linked to the Police CCTV system(P73 Annex C). There
      could not be interference on one system and not on the other. The m onitor in the club
      control room showed clear and uninterrupted pictures without interference.

      Further, in his statem ent Chief Inspector McRobbie describes how PC Bichard operated
      the zoom facility which he thought was "a super facility for spotting troublemalccrs in
      the ground". He also states that he was watching the screens and was aw are that the
      area in Leppings Lane behind the goal was filling up (P446 Annex D2). He states that he
      looked on the left m onitor and was aware of a build up of supporters. A t no tim e does
      McRobbie m ention interference on the monitors. However, unfortunately Chief
      Inspector McRobbie was not called at the inquest.

     4) The Tapes Stolen From The Club Control Room
     Whilst it is accepted that the tapes stolen from the club control, room show ed nothing of
     a probative value, the fact remains that they were stolen from a locked cupboard in a
     locked room which w as alarmed. There was a massive police presence at the ground
     that night as effectively a m urder investigation was m ounted. It is inconceivable that
     such security could have been breached by a stranger. It is simply not satisfactory for
     South Yorkshire Police to dismiss this matter so lightly. Clearly the thief thought h e /s h e
     was stealing som ething of value.

     I trust you will take the above comments into account before m aking your decision.
     Finally, I should be grateful if you would telephone me on 0151 225 2975 before m aking
     any announcement to the media.

     I am anxious to ensure that families are warned in advance of any public announcement.
     With the 8th anniversary just a few days away this is a particularly stressful time for
     families.

     In anticipation of y o u r co-operation.
     Yours sincerely,



     Ann Marie Adlingfcon (Solicitor)

      Dear Ms Adlington


      Thank you for your letter of the 9th April 1997.

      The page numbers you require are pages 253 to 255 of your Annex D -l, that is, day 71 of
      the Hillsborough Inquest Hearing.

      On page 255 Mr. Killoch refers to C 539 having the original reference of TB/1. C539 is
      footage from camera 5 covering the Leppings Lane Terraces between 15.02.54 and 15.16.02.
      It was taken from the video reference TB/2 which is footage from a number of cameras
      starting at 12.00.22. The last part of TB/2 is the footage from camera 5 between 15.02.54
      and 15.25.42.

      I have enclosed a number of schedules which may assist you to understand what has
      happened

               1   List of Coroner’s Exhibits showing C 539 as a video film with reference
                   number TB1.

               2   New Schedule showing timings of footage from camera 5 on video tape
                   reference TB1.

               3   New Schedule showing timings of footage from camera 5 on video tape
                   reference TB2.

    You will note that the final timings on the third schedule cover the period of the Exhibit
    C539. Therefore I can only presume that Mr. Killoch’s response as to the police reference
    number for the video being TB1 was a slip of the tongue when in fact he meant TB2.

    Please let me know if I can be of any further assistance.



    Yours sincerely,




    GEORGE R. CROSTON

           Dear Mr Croston,
           1 th a n k you f o r y o u r
                                l a t t e r of 10th April.
           I an astonished that you seem to be dismissing the matter of the
           new video evidence as a "s lip of the tongue".  This aspect of the
           families case cannot be dismissed in such a fashion,   it simply
           does not do justice to the rost of tho case.
           Families know that vital footage before 15.02 went missing and
           was therefore not put before the jury.

           Thera would be outrage amongst members of the Hillsborough F a m i l y
           Support Group if such important matters were to be brushed off by
           a re-writing of the Inquest transcripts.  In the circumstances I
           am instructed to ask you for a meeting as a matter of urgency.

           I look forward to hearing from you.


          Your Sincerely

        Dear Mr Croeton,
                       Further to recent correspondence I would like to
        draw your attention t.e> the Inquest transcript, of 13th March P.S'JD
        ( copy enclosed ) where the coroner state* that the jury had on 2
        occasions asked about the video evidence of the terraces.
        You will note the coroner renarks that there was * actually next
        to nothing on the videos because, of course, not everything was
        recorded
        He goes on to state that the footage from 15.03. would be shown
        hut it was of very poor quality- In hie opinion it would not help
        the jury very much. As you are aware, f&otege from 15,02 was
        shown to the jury on 15th M arch ( pBO E ) this being the date
        when the coroner stated that the footage prior to this tine had
        gone missing.
        Further to your suggestion thet I obtain copies of tapes * TB1 "
        and " TB2 " from South Yorkshire Police, families have asked ma
        tu make a formal request for the sane through your office.
        Finally, I should be grateful if you would forward copies of the
        H a t of exhibits from the Taylor Inquiry and tne< Inquest as
        previously discussed.


        yours‘Sincerely

                   They did not know, and could not know, the state of the
                   Leppings Lane terraces?    They were on the wrong side of
                   it. - A. Mr. King I have nothing to add.

            B            MR. KING:          Thank you.
                         THE CORONER:          Mr. Catchpole?
                         MR. CATCHPOLE:          Ihave no questions.
                        THE CORONER:   Mrs. McBrien, you will be a little
                   bit longer than that, I take it?
                         MRS. MCBRIEN:          Yes.
                         THE CORONER:         Miss Addleman?
                         MISS ADDLEMAN:          No questions, sir.

                         THE CORONER:         Mr. Russell?

                         MR. RUSSELL:         I have no questions.
                       THE CORONER:   I do not think it is worth starting
                  before lunch but there is just one thing which the jury
                  have mentioned to me.   In fact they have mentioned it
                  twice, and that is what about the video evidence of the
                  terraces.   I have had the videos looked at and there is
                  actually next to nothing on the videos because, of
                  course, not everything was recorded.   That does not mean
                  to say they weren't possibly scenes, but there is, I
                  understand, a little tiny bit which is actually on the
                  compilation which you have seen.   There is another
                  little bit which starts at 15.03 and goes on for a few
                  minutes.
                       Uhat we have done is that ve have clipped it, if
                  that is the right word, and we will show it to you, but
                  it is very poor quality and I do not think it is going to
                  help us very much.   As far as I can tell there isn't
                  much recorded.   Does that help?

                       Right, two o'clock. Mr. Duckenfield you will
                  remember you are still on oath.

    Dear Ms Adlington

 Thank you for your letter of the 7th May 1997.

    From the small amount of copy correspondence in my possession I have ascertained the
    following information:-

          1      All material was held at Nechells Green Police Station.

          2      The Hillsborough Disaster Sefton Helpline (Sefton Social Services) who were
                 working with the bereaved families and survivors of the tragedy had access
                 to all the video and photographic material on the 28th July 1989.

          3      Representatives of the Hillsborough Steering Committee also had access to the
                 material on the 28th July 1989.

          4      The Hillsborough Steering Committee were in contact with 8 families who had
                 expressed a particular wish to see videos at the Leppings Lane End and
                 arrangements were put in place for appointments to be made with the police.

          5      Solicitors acting for Sheffield Wednesday Football Club viewed video footage
                 (including TB2/A/Part 4) on the 25th May 1989.

          6      Mr. Trevor Hicks viewed video material at Nechells Green Police Station on
                 the 7th July 1989 between 1700 and 2130.


 MMS/283.97
         7     Mr. and Mrs. Hicks visited the police station on the 3rd August 1989 when
               they viewed further material and recorded times shown on video prints/photos.

If I can be of any further assistance, please do not hesitate to contact me.

Yours sincerely,

                              1 acknowledge receipt of your letter of 9th May
              which, quite frankly, is not particularly helpful insofar as it
              fails to address the specific query raised in my letter of 7th

              Further, given that my requests for a meeting have been ignored,
              families are becoming quite impatient. I am therefore instructed
             to ask you to provide me with an indication as to when the
             Director of Public Prosecutions is likely to announce her
             decision in this matter.
              I thank you for your assistance.

Dear Mr Croston
I am in receipt of copies of your letters of the 9th and 16th
May 1997 addressed to the HFSG's solicitor, Ann Adlington.
1 am quite appalled and somewhat annoyed that you should infer
that visits by myself and my ex wife, Jenni Hicks (items 6 and
7), should in any way represent access to the video material
we recently discovered at Yorkshire Television.
For the record I would advise
(a)        My visit to Nechells Police Station was in response to a
           request by West Midlands Police that I be the "guinea
           pig" in attempts to locate and track loved ones'
           movements.
(b)        This was partly because at that time, I was Managing
           Director of a Company in Dudley, West Midlands, and also
           in my capacity as Chairman of the Hillsborough Family
           Support Group.
(c)    There was also a suggestion that some of the material
       that I would be shown would be distressing. I was to
       give an opinion regarding Jenni' $ likely reaction to this
       material.
(d)        The later visit (your item 7) by Jenni and myself was to
           follow-up the material I had seen on the 7 July 1989.
                  ENGLAND WORTHSIDE            372 P02   20.05.97   15:09




For the avoidance of doubt I will state categorically that I
did not have free access to the video and photographic
evidence at Nechells Green Police Station. Jenni and I were
shown a selection of photographs and small clips of video,
mainly BBC outside broadcast footage, and all of this exercise
was specifically directed towards the location of Sarah and
Victoria. None of the material was selected by me, it was
placed before me by Inspector Layton and other officers
working on the Inquiry.
I was advised by the officers at Nechells Green that there was
more than eighty hours of video footage and literally
thousands of photographs. You will appreciate that even in
five or six hours total visit time it would only have been
possible to view a small selection of the material.
If the police are now claiming I was shown the Camera 5
footage (which I disputel), then surely this is a further
indication of the collusion that must have taken place to
mislead the inquest jury regarding the non-availability of
footage relating to the condition of the terraces prior to the
opening of Gate 'C'.
Please do not attempt to use me as an excuse for not taking
these matters further - it really is shallow and does no
credit to the CPS.
Yours sincerely




Trevor Hicks

Dear Mr Hicks

Thank you for your letter of 19 May 1997 which clarifies the detail of the video viewings
that were arranged for you in 1989.

My letter of 9th May was meant to inform Ms Adlington of the seven relevant facts which
I had ascertained from the information before me.

I intended no inferences to be drawn and gave no opinion as to how those seven pieces of
information should be interpreted. Nothing was intended to be read into items 6 and 7
concerning yourself other than that you visited the police station and viewed video material
as was stated.

I am sorry that I have not been able to satisfy Ms Adlington’s requests for information to her
or your satisfaction, but I can only provide information based on material in my possession
and obtained from the police archives.

I have made no claims either for myself or the police as to the extent of the material that you
viewed in 1989. Nor have I attempted to use you as an excuse for any of my actions past
or present.

If you feel that I have misled you in any way in my previous correspondence to
Ms Adlington then I must apologise, that was certainly not my intention.

I hope to be able to write to you very soon with the outcome of our consideration of the
issues you have raised. I appreciate that this matter has taken some time, but I am sure you
will understand that it is necessary to give this the most careful attention and thorough
review. I am grateful to you for drawing your concerns about my previous letter to my
attention.

Yours sincerely

             Dear Sir,


                     I thank you for your letter of 14th May. The iett«r and
             accompanying documentation were delivered to me upon my return to
             the office on 28th May.

             Unfortunately the quality of tapes TBi and TB2 is quite poor at
             certain times.  I should be grateful if you would let me know
             what generation the copies are and if there are any better copies
             available.

             Finally you state that you hove enclosed a copy of tho exhibits
             list from the Taylor Inquiry. However. George Croston from CPS
             Central Casework has already provided me with a copy of the same
             which differs in style and content from the schedule which you
             have forwarded. Can you please explain exactly what it la that
             you have now supplied. For your information the document is
             headed " All records in the exhibits database “.
             I thank you tor your assistance
             Yours Faithfully

HILLSBOROUGH INQUIRY


Thank you for your note of 19 April.

2. I fully accept the need for caution in all this but, as I see
it, the present position is this.

     (a)    We do not yet have any estimate of the likely cost of
            this inquiry although past experience suggests it will
            fall somewhere in the £300,000 to £500,000 bracket.

     (b)    We have not yet heard from Mr Moriarty's budget support
            group whether they can or cannot undertake to absorb
            part or the whole of the estimated cost. But I spoke
            to Mr Clayton yesterday and asked him to address
            precisely that question.

     (c)    As yet we have no idea of how easy or difficult it will
            be to raise our existing commitment to the £2 million
            payment for BVPs.  If, when we have all the FIS
            profiles in, it looks easier than we thought (which I
            accept is unlikely) the case for a Supplementary might
            be weakened.

     (d)    We have until 2 May (I think) to ask Treasury for
            either a revise or a supplementary.

I see no point in deciding right now whether to go for a revise
or a supplementary.  Indeed, I do not think we have the
information yet on which to decide this.

3. I shall (fortunately) be on leave next week but Mr Watts will
pursue the matter once we have the raw materials for decisions.
Your note and this should join the file which you are already
making up with previous papers. That file can then go to
Mr Watts.

4. I have now had it confirmed that the £500,000 donation to the
appeal fund is being paid by the Department of the Environment.
So we have no problem with that.

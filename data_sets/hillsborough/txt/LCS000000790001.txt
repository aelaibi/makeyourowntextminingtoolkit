MINUTES OF THE HILLSBOROUGH CONFERENCE PLANNING GROUP
MEETING 17TH MARCH. 1992-


PRESENT:              Sarah Darcy,             Gerry Flanagan and

A P O L O G IE S :


Sarah has now written to Merseyside, Nottingham and Sheffield directors and will
write to the Liverpool director to inform him of progress and time committed to this by
workers, for approval. She has contacted                      re: chairing the conference
in his capacity as representative for M.I.N.D. His fee however is £250 per day and we
will need to ascertain from Rowntrees what amount is specifically available to plan for
facilitators fees and/or expenses, also for costs of recording.

There is an apparent need at this stage for art admin worker’s representative to be
invited to join this planning group and several people will be approached. Names
were further suggested with a view to facilitation of workshops on particular themes,
and will be pursued by the planning group.

Additional themes to be incorporated into the broad menu of workshops are;

        1.     Admin systems and support.

       2.      Carrying on teams and applying lessons learned in the
                evolutionary process.

It was agreed that each workshop be led by two people and recorded by two “scribes”,
for the later purpose of presentation as a package of learning.

Next Meeting April 6th 3.00pm at Liverpool Hillsborough Centre.

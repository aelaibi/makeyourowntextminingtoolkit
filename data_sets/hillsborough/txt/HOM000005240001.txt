  HOME AFFAIRS COMMITTEE: INQUIRY INTO POLICING FOOTBALL
                          HOOLIGANISM

  A d m i n i s t e r s will know, the Home Affairs Committee (HAC) will
  be conducting a short inquiry in the period before Christmas
  into policing football hooliganism.

  2.       The Committee has already obtained written evidence from
  a large number of interested parties, including a memorandum
  from the Home Office. This evidence is to be published at
  1 0 , 0 0 am on Thursday, 8 November.

  3.   The Committee has decided that oral evidence will be
  taken as follows:

  Monday 12 November              Representatives of the Football
                                  Association, Football League and
                                  Football Supporters1 Association

  Wednesday 14 November           Police representatives, led by
                                  Mr James Anderton, Chief Constable
                                  of Greater Manchester

  Wednesday 28 November           Home Office witnesses and
                                  witnesses from the Football
                                  Licensing Authority

  All oral evidence sessions will take place in Committee Room
  15 in the House of Commons at 4.15 pm.

  4.   We now understand from the Clerk of the Committee that
  the HAC would wish a Home Office Minister to give evidence on
  28 November alongside Home Office officials and witnesses from
  the Football Licensing Authority. As the invitation was not
  directed at a particular Minister, I would suggest that there
E.R.




  is no need for us to nominate the Home Secretary unless he
  particularly wishes to attend.  Miss Snow has confirmed that
  Lord Ferrers would be able to attend the oral evidence session
  on 28 November and, subject to any views which Ministers may
  have, I propose to advise the Clerk that Lord Ferrers (as
  Minister with specific responsibility for police issues) will
  attend on that date accompanied by officials.

  5.   Are Ministers content for me to proceed as proposed?

                             1 5 APRIL 1989

                    SOMARY OF WEST MIDLANDS POLICE

                            (XMPUATIGN TAPE

              VIEWED BY DETBCTCVE SERGEANT

The tape is divided into a number of sections and compared with other
summaries the following include extra observations regarding Police
presence.

SECTION 1

This section is not timed and shews views of theLeppingsLane
turnstiles frcm a position on Leppings lane itself. There are no
supporters and the film was probably taken well after the event.

It shows a view of all the turnstiles and the outer perimeter gates.
The camera views take us through Gate C and shows views of the West
Stand Enclosure to the centre tunnel leading to the terraces.
Further views are shown of Gate C and the A - G Turnstiles frcm within
the West Stand Enclosure and also the gap in the dividing wall within
this Enclosure. Frcm the West Stand Enclosure behind the A - G
Turnstiles a view and verbal explanation is given how fans can gain
access to Pens 6 and 7 (through the gap in the dividing wall) and Pens 1
and 2 (via the co m e r of the West and South stands).
The Camera takes us through the centre tunnel and describes a slight
gradient up before going down to the pens.
Views are taken of Pens 3 and 4.

SECTION 2

This section is timed by use of the 24 hour clock and shows black and
white viewsof the Leppings Lane turnstiles area taken by a fixed camera
mounted on the stadiums structure. The views ccnmence at 1402.37.

1402         Very few fans in the turnsile areas but fans are
              approaching the area along Leppings Lane frcm the
              direction of Penistone Road. They fill the pavements
              and although are spilling on to the roadway, they are not
              blocking the road and vehicles are being driven along it.
              Although the black and white pictures are not clear it
              shows Police Officers within the enclosure watching fans
              as they cate through the A - G Turnstiles.
              It is not clearly defined but it appears groups of Police
              Officers are on Leppings Lane at the turnstile area and
              at least one mounted officer is present but at this stage
              there is no cause for concern as fans are still sparse.
1402.57       Ttiis section concludes.

SECTION 3

This section is not timed but the ccnmemtator states the views start at
1424 and show Liverpool supporters in Halifax Road (at its junction with
Leppings Lane).    Two Police Officers can be seen watching the fans
pass. The section cmly plays for approximately one minute.
                                 - 2 -


SECTION 4

Views then return to the black and white film taken by the fixed camera
an the stadium's structure, which is timed. The views conmenced at
1429.50.

In contrast to the previous views by the camera its shows a marked
increase in the number of supporters in the concourse areas of A - G
Turnstiles and 1 - 1 6 Turnstiles.

Police Officers are still in the enclosure observing fans caning through
the A - G Turnstiles. Three sets of turnstiles can be seen with two
Police Officers on two of the sets and one Police Officer on the other
set of turnstiles.

Fans are going through the outer perimeter gates towards the 1 - 1 6
turnstiles, but there appears to be same Police control at the outer
perimeter gates leading to the A - G Turnstiles. Mounted Officers are
in attendance. Fans are approaching the turnstile area fron both
directions along Leppings Lane.

The river side of the concourse area of the A - G Turnstiles shews
plenty of space but in contrast the fans in the enclosure by the large
dividing fence, appear tight. Fans are building up outside the
perimeter gates. Inside the West Stand Enclosure the small view that is
given shows plenty of space with some fans remaining in the area.

1430.31      The tape then jumps to -

1432.52      and shows mounted officers at the open perimeter gates
              trying to control the crowd but fans stream through past
              the horses by the open perimeter gate nearest the large
              dividing fence causing the horses to "back away."

1433.00       It can be seen there is a concerted push by fans a little
              way back frcm the perimeter gates to cause those in front
              of them to force their way past the horses and into the
              concourse area. The mounted officers regain partial
              control at these gates but fans are still getting past
              them when the opportunity arises. This area in front of
              the A - G Turnstiles is obviously packed and is swaying
              with fans.

1433.10      Fans can be seen going through an open perimeter gate at
              the river side into the A - G concourse area. A mounted
              officer is present but fans still pour through. Another
              mounted officer is by the crowd near to Gate C and
              approximately four mounted officers are by the open
              perimeter gate near to the large dividing fence.

1433.38      Vehicles can be seen travelling along Leppings Lane.

1433.49      Shows clearer views of fans going through the qpen
             perimeter gates towards the 1 - 1 6 turnstiles. There is
             no apparent Police control at these particular open
             perimeter gates.
             Although the pictures are not clear and the crowd is
             dense, no foot officers are seen until -
                                    - 3 -


1434.23      Which shows two foot officers on the outside of the
             perimeter gates, within the crowd. A number of Police
             Officers are on Leppings Lane on the outside of the crow3.
             (Four can be clearly seen)

1434.36      Shows views of the concourse area of the A - G turnstiles
             and it can be seen there is space by the river side, and
             same fans are leaving the area by the river side perimeter
             gate. However at -

1434.54      There clearly is a surge within this concourse area
             emanating fran the crowd by the large dividing fence
             causing the fans to spill into the space by the riverside.
             The Police horse by the open perimeter gate near the river
             side is forced back away fran the open gate. An officer
             of Inspector rank or above is at this open perimeter gate.

1435          Shews views around Gate C. A Mounted Sergeant is at this
              position. There are no fans around this gate, two foot
              officers are present. The mounted officer by the qpen
              perimeter gate is unable to control the influx of fans and
              they rush through as the officer speaks with one fan in
              the crowd.

1435.20       This section concludes.

SECTION 5

This section is timed but not by means of time of day by the 24 hour
clock. The timing commences at -

0558          and shows colour views of the fans at Leppings Lane
              (extracted fran the BBC tapes) and commentary says it is
              fran 1437.

              Attention is focused on the Leppings Lane end on the
              outside of the ground. The view shews a large anoint of
              people in front of the Turnstiles A - G and Gate B, two
              mounted officers are at or near to Gate B. Inspector
              Purdy and two foot officers are near Gate G, there is
              is still roan on the river side of this conccxirse area and
              people are walking about freely between the anall metal
              barrier and the river.

0610          The tape jumps to -

0632          A mounted officer is near Gate B.

0633          Sees a young boy aged approximately 12 years climbing the
              wall at the side of Gate B, the outer corner of the wall.
              Fans are also seen to be on the dividing fencing which
              s e p a r a t e s the concourse areas of 1 - 16 and A - G. The
              boy gets to the top of the wall, looks over and then
              climbs back down again.

0730   Fans are coming through the outer perimeter gates, going
       into the concourse area of the A - G turnstiles. Gates B
       and C clearly can be seen to be closed.

0741   Chief Inspector Creaser is in the area, fans are still
       caning through the outer perimeter gates. Fans are on
       the fencing separating      concourse areas 1 - 1 6 andA - G.

       fans are congregating, although they are not compact on
       the roadway. Fans are caning along Leppings Lane fran
       the Penistone    Road area. Few Police Officers arein this
       crowd or near to it.

0838   Concourse area in front of Turnstiles 1 - 1 6 and A - G,
       there is heavy ccmpaction in that area and fans are
       approaching fran Leppings Lane. All perimeter gates are
       open and fans are going through. There are six mounted
       officers at the perimeter gates to the A - G turnstiles
       but fans are still going through, there are two mounted
       officers at or near Gate B. There is at least one foot
       officer by the outer perimeter gate at the river side and
       an officer of Inspector rank or above is nearby (probably
       Inspector Sykes) There appears to be little control in
       stopping the fans entering the concourse area. There
       appears to be little movement of fans going through the
       turnstiles.

0853   Fans on Leppings Lane still approaching the turnstile

        1440          There is surging in Pen 4 which originates fran the back
                      of the crowd. A fan in a red shirt appears to be stood on
                      the safety barrier in Pen 3. Another fan in a blue shirt
                      is above the crowd but he may be on the shoulders of
                      others. There is plenty of space in the West Stand
                      seating area and in the North Stand seating area. Fans
                      can be seen to be playing with a beach ball in the pens

                      to be closed, fans are continuing to climb the wall by
                      the turnstiles.

        1053          Outer perimeter gates leading to Turnstiles A - G appear
                      to be closed with one exception by the large dividing
                      fence. There is a heavy compaction of fans inside the
                      concourse area of A - G and a heavy canpaction of fans
                      outside the perimeter gates. At least two foot officers

  1445          There is a heavy concentration of fans in pens 3 and 4
                although at the front of the pens it is quite      loose.
                There is   a surging and swaying of fans in Pen    3 and one   is
                above the crowd in Pen“T"but ltTis unknown what he is
                stood on.    Another fan in a white top appears    to be
                stood onthe safety barrier in Pen 3 and another fan in a
                blue shirt is above the crowd.

  1446          Close up shots of the fan in the white top believed to be
                the one in Pen 3 standing cm the safety barrier. On the
                North side of the terracing camera shots show very few
                supporters there with a lot of space available.

                  is stood on the safety barrier within Pen 3 with a white
                  top 1bouncing up and down.1

    1448          There is still plenty of space available in the West Stand
                  seating area, surging in Pen 3.

    SECTION 10

    Returns to the Leppings Lane area and shows views taken by the camera in
    Section 2 ccrrmencing at 1439.59.

    1439.59       There has been a dramatic increase in the number of fans
                  vdio are now up and against the Police barriers. Mounted
                  officers are in the crowd.

    1440          The service road is new full of fans which have over­
                  spilled into it. Gates A and B appear under pressure.
                  Gate C has fans nearby. Police Officers are in the
                  enclosure by A - G turnstiles.

    1442          Turnstiles A - G can be seen in use and although pictures
                  are not clear it appears Police Officers are in the
                  enclosure by sane turnstiles.

    1443          Fans are sat on the roof of Gate B. At least twD Police
                  Officers are in the enclosure by Gate B.

    1444          Enclosure shows fans with plenty of room.   Some staying in
                  vicinity.

    1445          Two buses pass along Leppings Lane. Police Officers are
                  still in enclosure by A - G turnstiles and by Gate B.

®   1447          Police Officers outside ground near Gate C sane are in the
                  crowd by this gate. Foot Officers are by the perimeter
                  gate (at least two and an officer of Inspector rank or
                   above.)

    1448          Gate C opens for about 15 seconds, fans pass through but
                  only a snail number (100 - 200) compared with the masses
                  outside. Gate A is under pressure. After Gate C is
                  closed there is an over spill into the service road.
                  West Midlands commentary indicates that Gate C was opened
                  frcm the inside to enable Police to eject a youth.

                  The over spill into the service road is forced back by
                  mounted and the area regained by Police.

    1450          These views conclude.

    SECTION 11

    turnstiles.

    It appears a steward is by Gate C.

    At an early part of the     tape it shows fans     in the      enclosure obviouslyin
    no hurry to take positions on the terracing or     in    the stands. A Police
    Officer can clearly be seen to enter a turnstile, take out a youth and
    eject him through Gate C. As time progresses fans are flowing through
    the turnstiles, Police are in the enclosure and fans are still remaining
    in the enclosure. Police Officers are outside Gate C. Fans begin to
    climb cn to the roof above turnstiles A - G and jump down into the
    enclosure. The views show a youth jump fran the roof of turnstiles A -
    G into the enclosure where he walks away. This youth is 'caught' by a
    Police Officer and taken to Gate C. The picture is not clear but it is
    assumed he is ejected, but on this occasion as the gate opens fans
    stream through from outside and into the enclsoure, about 2 - 300 in
    total. It is assumed this is the first opening of Gate C at 1448 hours.
    A mounted officer controls the situation outside and the gate is secured
    after being open for 15- 20 seconds.

    A number of fans remain     in the vicinity of     the   enclosure.   Police
    Officers are still evident in the enclosure.

    These views conclude shortly after the closing of Gate C.

    SECTION 12

    The views continue with camera shots of inside the ground caitnencing at

    1449.53       In what seems to be Pen 3 a gap forms in the crowd near
                  to the safety barrier that collapsed. A few fans rise
                   from the floor area.

    1450          Pen 3 is quite full now but the area around the front of
                  the terracing is still quite oonfortable. The mouth of
                  the tunnel where it meets the terracing is packed with
                   fans. At 1450 running into 1451 announcements over the
                  Ground Tannoy System causes cheers fran the crowd.

    1451          Fans are still caning down the centre tunnel and filing
                   into Pens 3 and 4. At 1451 Pens 3 and 4 are tightly
                  packed. There is still plenty of space in the West Stand
                  seating area.

               of the crowd outside these gates and Gate A and the area
               in front of Turnstiles 1 - 1 6 can be seen to be u n d e r
               pressure.

     1453      The perimeter gates at the river side are then breached
               and fans run towards the Gate C and through it.

     1454      There is surging in front of Gate A. A number of Police

              On Satur         15th                      50489) together with

                                  and                         went to Hillsborough Football Ground

              )Sheffield to watch the Semi Final between Liverpool and Nottingham

              Forest.

              We arrived at the ground about 2,15 pm (1415) and after getting in the

              crowd crush we eventually got into the ground around 2.50 pm (1450).

              We went    through      the   tunnel    into    the     Pen/4   terraces and   because   it

              was absolutely crushed we made our way to the front and got into P

              and then Pen/6 where we found a spot to watch the match because it was

              not so crowded there.

              The match was just about to start when I looked over to my left

              towards the North Stand.               The match may have started because

              and                       were looking towards the pitch.

      I am not certain of the exact tp tfis .

      I saw some youths in P ^ 7 ^ t ^ a g a i n s t      the fencing separating Pen 7

      from the North Stand and it looked as though they intended to climb

      the fence a-rfcl get into the North Stand I then saw a yo^fi about 20

      years a y age wearing jeans and a sweater climb toyChe top of the

      f e n c ^ / He was trying to turn round on the top Vo that he could drop

      backwards into the stand,

      I then saw a Policeman approaching him from in the North Stand and get

      up to the fencing by the youth.             The youth seemed to hesitate which

      way to get down for a few seconds with one of his legs dangling on the



      I saw the Policeman who*4 I remember had a beard reach up,

      the youths ankle an/ yank him down

      and I thought he must have been knocked out.

      Other Policemen then ran up towards the youth and I saw them bending

      over him.

      The crowd in Pen 7 were getting very upset and were shouting at what

      the Policeman had done.

      Just afterwards I saw the P o 1i ceman with a beard just walk away and I

      do not know what happened to the youth because my attention was drawn

      to the match and other things that where happening at that time in

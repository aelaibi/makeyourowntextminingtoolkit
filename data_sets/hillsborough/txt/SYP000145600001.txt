Q36„    HAVE YOU ANY COMMENT TO MAKE ON THE DISTRIBUTION OF FANS IN Ti-

        STANDING AREA TO THE FRONT OF THE WEST STAND?



            YES -- THE TUNNEL IN MY VIEW IS INAPPROPRIATE       TACTICALLY

PRESSURE ON THE MOST POPULAR STANDING AREA -- IE DIRECTLY BEHIND THE

GOAL.

REQUIRED.

        - CREATED BY COACH PARKING ETC - EXTERIOR GATE          HAD TO BE OPENED TO

        LET FANS IN.   AT ONE STAGE CROWD OVERSPILLED ONTO PITCH I HAD TO MAKE

        THE DECISION TO OPEN THE GATE.     THERE IS NO WAY IN 1984/5 I COULD HAVE

        BELIEVED THAT BY OPENING THE GATE WITH A VIEW TO STOPPING & EASING THE

        PRESSURE ON THE FANS WOULD HAVE THEN CREATED A HILLSBOROUGH CRUSH.

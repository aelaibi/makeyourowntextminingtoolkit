              set of traffic             lights    near to the    pre m e n t i o n e d   junction.

              P ri or    to a r ri ving at the ground or on route                  I did not see any other

              s u pp or te rs     consuming alcohol        neither      did    I see any     pubs opien.

              I a r r i ve d at S h e f f i e l d at about      1.30pm    (1330)      parking      the   car    in the

              B i c k e r t o n R oa d area.

              A ft er    parking     the    car and having a general             walk about        then making        our

              wa y to the ground there were                plenty of      police a r o u n d but we         received

              no d ir ec t io ns     or escorts       to the ground,          a l t h o u g h we did not ask.

              E n -r o ut e   to the ground         I saw no disorder,          d runkeness     of supporters            and

              we a r r i ve d at the gr ou nd at about 2.30pm.

              just a s olid mass            of    pieople bo^i o utside and         inside the gates             to the

              elsewhere.           Due    to the massive       volume    of    people     it was    nearly

              i m po ss ib le     to get    to the turnstiles        in a comfortable way or wit h ease,

              but on the          outer    right    t urnstiles   to the terraces           is a blue

              h or iz o nt a l    bar about       4 feet above    ground       level a police        officer       then

              said to s up po rt ers         by this     bar   to get    under     it and make       our way to a

              gate at the          side of the       terrace    t urnstiles       because    it was       going    to be

              o pened.

great        deal      due to the          crowd      crush.

The     crowd        crush was         imminent        on entering                 pen 3 and was             still    serious

 AFTER       THE       MATCH       WAS    STOPPED?

 G52

 DID YOU WITNESS ANYTHING THAT YOU CONSIDER TO BE A CRIMINAL OFFENCE?

 NO.

 G53

 t v o u HAVE ANY VIEUS 0R OBSERVATIONS ON THE WAV THE

 INCIDENT WAS HANDLED, AFTER THE MATCH WAS STOPPED?

 FROM 3.06PM <1506) UNTIL 4.20PM (1620) THE ONLY MESSAGE WE GOT WAS FROM THE

 TANNOY SYSTEM WAS FROM KENNY DALGLEISH.     THERE   APPEARED TO BE A LACK OF

 COMMUNICATION TO THE FANS.    IT APPEARS THAT THE   POLICE WERE MORE PREPARED FOR    A

 PUBLIC ORDER SITUATION THAN THE EVENT THAT OCCURRED.            /

 THE POLICE NEVER TOOK HOLD OF THE SITUATION. LACK OF COMMUNICATION.

 LACK OF ACTION.

 054

£      THERE ANYTHING THAT YOU WISH TO ADD WHICH YOU FEEL IS

 VITAL TO THIS JUDICIAL INQUIRY?

 THERE APPEARED TO BE 2 FACTORS THAT CAUSED THE      DISASTER?

 •1) TOO MANY PEOPLE PUT INTO TOO SMALL AN AREA,     A LACK OF PROFESSIONALISM, AND

 2) LETTING IN SO MANY LATE ARRIVALS AT THE SAME TIME. SPECTATORS ARE TREATED

 LIKE ANIMALS. THE TIME MUST COME WHEN CONSIDERATION MUST BE GIVEN TO THEM.

 BETTER CROWD CONTROL IS THE ONLY THING I ADVOCATE IN THE FUTURE.

 COMMUNICATION WITH THE POLICE AND A LONG TIME UNTIL PEOPLE REALISED WHAT M S

 GOING ON. IT SEEMED THAT A LOT OF OFFICERS WERE STANDING AROUND NOT KNOWING

 WHAT TO DO.    PERSONALLY I THINK THAT THEY DIDN’T REALISE WHAT WAS HAPPENING.

 LACK OF MEDICAL FACILITIES.    IF AN AUDIBLE ANNOUNCEMENT WAS MADE FOR MEDICAL

 ASSISTANCE, PEOPLE WITHIN THE CROWD WHO HAD MEDICAL TRAINING COULD HAVE BEEN

 USED,   INSTEAD ALL I HEARD WAS THE ANNOUNCEMENT TO CLEAR THE PITCH.

AFTER THE MATCH WAS S T O P P E D T N v

 THE POLICE WERE SLOW TO REACT AN d N q ^REALISE WHAT WAS HAPPENING IN THE CENTRE

 PENS.         IF THE P.A. SYSTEM HAD BEEN USeNctf INFORM THE SUPPORTERS THAT A

SERIOUS INCIDENT HAD OCCURRED,            IT WOULD HAVE PREVENTED ANY OTHER INCIDENTS

AND ALLOWED POLICE OFFICERS TO CONCENTRATE MORE ON THE RESCUE ATTEMPT.

 THERE WAS NO ORGANISATION ON THE PITCH AND PEOPLE WERE JUST WANDERING ABOUT

EVERYWHERE AND THIS IMPEDED THE EMERGENCY SERVICES.

 1) LACK OF LIFE SAVING EQUIPMENT & STRETCHERS.

 ON.

 THE NOTTS FOREST END IN ORDER TO TELL THEM WHAT WAS GOING ON,        BUT THEY   WERE

 Q54

 IS THERE ANYTHING THAT YOU WISH TO     ADD WHICH YOUFEEL    IS

 VITAL TO THIS JUDICIAL INQUIRY?

 I THINK IT WAS COMPLETELY WRONG TO     PLACE A POLICE OFFICER WITHOUT CROWD

 CONTROL EXPERIENCE IN CHARGE OF SUCH A MATCH.

 ALSO THERE SHOULD HAVE BEEN A SYSTEM OF QUEUING IN LEPPINGS LANE WHICH WOULD

 THE LAYOUT OF THE PENS WITH THE DIVIDING FENCES ALSO THE PERIMETER FENCES

SURROUNDING THE PITCH CONTRI BUTE'S TO THE INJURIES AND DEATHS.        THE POLICE WERE

 VERY SLOW TO RE-ACT TO THE SITUATION? BY ASSISTING AND GIVING 1ST AID TO THE

 INJURED PEOPLE, ACTUALLY ON THE TERRACES.



 WHAT TIME DID YOU LEAVE THE FOOTBALL GROUND?

 ABOUT 3.55 PM <1555).

 G51

 DID YOU LEAVE ON THE DIRECTION OF EITHER A POLICE OFFICER,     ASTEWARD,

 A LOUDSPEAKER ANNOUNCEMENT OR    OF YOUR OWN ACCORD?

 OWN ACCORD.

 G52

 D ® YOU WITNESS ANYTHING THAT YOU CONSIDER TO BE A CRIMINAL OFFENCE?

 NO.

 053

 DO YOU HAVE ANY VIEWS OR OBSERVATIONS ON THE WAY THE INCIDENT WAS HANDLED,

 AFTER THE MATCH WAS STOPPED?

 THE POLICE CAME TO THE PERIMETER FENCING AS THEY WOULD TO QUELL A RIOTING

 CROWD.   THEY WERE YELLING AT US TO GET BACK, BUT THERE WAS NOWHERE TO GO

 BECAUSE WE WERE HEMMED IN.     THEY APPEARED MORE PREPARED FOR A RIOTING

 SITUATION ON THE TERRACES & IT TOOK A LONG TIME FOR THEM TO REALISE THE

 SEVERITY OF THE DISASTER THAT HAD OCCURRED AND IN TURN REACT TO IT.

Q54

IS THER£ ANYTHING THAT YOU WISH TO ADD WHICH YOU FEEL IS VITA L TO TH IS

J U D IC IA L INQUIRY?

I FEEL THAT THE WHOLE TRADGEDY WAS AN AVOIDABLE ACCIDENT DUE TOj

1)     WRONGLY ALLOCATING LIVERPOOL THE SMALLER SECTION OF THE STADIUM & THE

ALLOCATION OF THE TICKETS.

2)     THE TERRACE DESIGN -   FENCES PREVENTING FANS TO SPREAD ACROSS THE

TERRACING.

3)     NO ORGANISED AND AUDIBLE COMMUNICATION WITH THE CROWDS OUTSIDE THE GROUND

INFORMING THEM WHY/WHAT WAS HAPPENING AND RE THE DELAY IN GAINING ENTRY TO

T ® GROUND.

4)     THERE APPEARED L IT T L E COMMUNICATION AMONGST THE POLICE THEMSELVES,   IE THE

TRAFFIC POLICE ON THE MOTORWAYS INFORMING POLICE AT THE GROUND RE THE TRAFFIC

DELAYS AND THAT A LARGE NUMBER OF FANS WOULD BE ARRIVING LATE.

5)     THE GAME SHOULD HAVE BEEN DELAYED.

6)     LACK OF INFORMATION LETTING THE CROWDS KNOW WHAT WAS HAPPENING ACTUALLY

IN S ID E THE STADIUM.

7)     COMMUNICATION AMONGST THE POLICE INFORMING POLICE OUTSIDE THE GROUND WHAT

THE POSITION OF THE CROWDS WERE L IK E IN THE GROUND.

       THERE WAS A SUDDEN SWING OF ATTITUDE AMONGST THE POLICE FROM HOLDING &

RESTRAINING THE CROWD, TO OPENING THE GATE AND ALLOWING ALL & SUNDRY ACCESS

INTO THE GROUND.

9)     THE POLICE COULD POSSIBLY HAVE REACTED SOONER TO THE CROWD CRUSHING ON THE

TERRACES & BLOCKED THE TUNNEL TO STOP ACCESS OF MORE FAGNS ONTO THE TERRACES

THRU THE TUNNEL.

1 0)   LACK OF INFORMATION TO THE CROWD, LETTING THEM KNOW WHAT WAS HAPPENING.

<THE FOREST FANS WERE JEERING IN IT IA L L Y POSSIBLY THINKING I T WAS A PITCH

IN V A S IO N .)

•11)    WE WERE APPROACHED BY TWO LADS FOR TICKETS OUTSIDE THE GROUND, BUT ON THE

WHOLE, VERY FEW PEOPLE APPEARED TO BE WITHOUT TICKETS FOR THE MATCH.

 •12)    A NORMAL PA SYSTEM IS COMPLETELY USELESS IN A SITUATION SIMILAR TO THE

 HILLSBOROUGH MATCH, BECAUSE WITH THE NOISE FROM      THE CROWDS,   ANY BROADCAST

 IS COMPLETELY DROWN BY THE VOLUME OF NOISE FROM      THE CROWD,

 AN INTERNATIONALLY RECOGNISED SIREN COULD BE ADOPTED FOR SPORTS STADIUMS WHEN

 A LIFE THREATENING SITUATION IS OCCURING,

 1) THE APPARENT MISSUSE OF THE SUBSTANTIAL RESOURCES OF POLICE OFFICER THAT

WERE AVAILABLE (LACK OF ASSISTANCE THAT APPEARED TO BE GIVEN INITIALLY TO

 THOSE WHO HAD BEEN INJURED OR WERE DYING).

THERE ONLY APPEARED TO BE ONE AMBULANCE)

DID YOU WITNESS ANYTHING THAT YOU CONSIDER TO BE A CRIMINAL OFFENCE?

NO

<253

DO YOU HAVE ANY VIEWS OR OBSERVATIONS ON THE WAY THT INCIDENT WAS HANDLED,

AFTER THE MATCH WAS STOPPED?

THERE WAS NO ORGANISATION, EVERYBODY JUST SEEMED TO MUCK IN.

 I AGREE WITH THE LINE OF POLICE   ACROSS THE CENTRE OF THE PITCH BUT NOT THE

LINE OF POLICE IN FRONT OF THE NORTH STAND.     AS LIVERPOOL FANS WERE CARRYING

 INJURED PEOPLE FOR THE LENGTH OF THE PITCH THE LINE OF POLICE JUST STOOD AND

WATCHED THEM SHOULD HAVE BEEN USED TO HELP THE INJURED



 IS THERE ANYTHING THAT YOU WISH TO ADD WHICH YOU FEEL IS VITAL TO THIS

JUDICIAL INQUIRY?

LAST YEAR WHEN I ATTENDED FIRSTLY THERE WERE NO TRAFFIC PROBLEMS AND WE

ARRIVED EARLIER.    LAST YEAR THERE WERE MORE POLICE ABOUT AND WE COULD NOT GET

THE CAR NEAR THE GROUND.    WE WERE TOLD WHERE TO PARK BUT THIS YEAR WE DROVE

RIGHT UP TO THE GROUND.    LAST YEAR THE ORGANISATION OUTSIDE THE TURNSTILE WAS

BETTER AND PROPER QUEUES WERE FORMED.    THERE WAS A TOTAL LACK OF ORGANISATION

THIS YEAR.

 IF I COULD SEE FROM THE MIDDLE OF THE NORTH STAND THAT THERE WAS A PROBLEM IN

L f H l N G S LANE WHY COULDN’T THE POLICE IN THE CONTROL BOX AND ON THE GROUND.

THEY TOOK A LONG TIME TO REACT.    WHEN PEOPLE FIRST TRIED TO CLIMB OUT

POLICEMEN WERE PUSHING THEM BACK INTO THE CROWD.

A BETTER USE OF THE TANNOY SYSTEM TO INFORM THE FOREST SUPPORTERS WOULD HAVE

HELPED BECAUSE THE LINE OF POLICE ACROSS THE CENTRE OF THE PITCH WOULD NOT

HAVE BEEN NEEDED IF THE FOREST SUPPORTERS HAD BEEN TOLD OF THE SITUATION.

THESE POLICE COULD THEN HAVE BEEN USED IN THE RESCUE OPERATION.

TRADITIONALLY LIVERPOOL SUPPORTERS ARRIVE LATE AT GROUNDS, THIS SHOULD HAVE

BEEN TAKEN INTO ACCOUNT.

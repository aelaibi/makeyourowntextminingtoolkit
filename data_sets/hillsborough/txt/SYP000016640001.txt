 Arriving       at the ground I found the situation *t th= turnstiles in

forwards, ^acfcwards and sideways, I left the queue because, if for
n°. ? Sr ^eason’         1 felt    1 was     making no progress in terms of
gaming      entrance to the ground. Also, the pressure at the front of
 -he   queue on the turnstiles was obviously intense and dangerous to
the people being squashed against them. For this reason I moved to
the area      I have marked "A" on the enclosed diagram and spoke to a
senior    peace     officer   suggesting he needed to take some action to
prevent     serioub   injuries occurring. My thoughts at this time were
     ~ a . 9ate needed      to be opened, a decision that certeir.lv seems
wrong .inhindsight      but     has to      be put in     the context'of the
     uation    hat ..ad been allowed       to develop outside the gates.
Without     information   coming   frora inside the ground, in my opinion,
there was only one decision that could be taken. One step that was
   fen at this time was the closure of the wrought iron perimeter
gates,    enforced    by the police horses, to prevent further people
entering     the turnstile area.       Unfortunately there were already so
many fans        crammed into this space that this alone could           not
3 ieVi?             situation.   people were still being pushed, squashed
and    thrown   around   while progress      into the ground was pitifully
slow.                                ,                                      7



 At  this time the decision was taken, by someone, to open one of the
 concertina gates (see diagram). Becatfse of the. position I had taken
 up while speaking      to the police officer I was one of the first
 people to pass through       this gate. There was no police control or
 ticket   check of any sort. In fact the Liverpool fans were trying to
 police   themselves with shouts of "Slow down" and "Walk" as people,
 even then,      became aware   of the   dangers of    any rush onto the
 terracing.   Due to the position      of  the gate that was opened the
        thing ^you see as you pass through it is the tunnel into the
 centre of    the terracing, I noticed no signs to other entrance ways
 and neither police nor stewards were attempting to guide the fans
 in other directions.      I walked towards the tunnel      although my
 intention _at ^this time was to enter the adjacent toilets which I
 subsequently did.    I emerged a couple of minutes later to find that
 the concertina gate was still open and fans where still enteri

 *       erracing on     e le-rt hand side as viewed from the pitch. This
        section was crowded but by no means unusually so based on previous
        experience of watching Liverpool F.C. at Hillsborough.




SeneraI_Cgffiments


       Every    time     I have had occasion to stand at the Lepping Lane End i*
       S S L * T h * H*reme} * crowded. A t • "        ticket league game between
       Sheffield Wednesday         and Liverpool three years ago I.was only able
       to g a m      access to the terra«_« proper at half time. I spent the
       ■whole of      the first     half stood in one of the entrance ways to the
       terracing.      In my opinion      the rating of that terrace area at ten
       thousand people is too high.            I do not believe it is capable of
       operating at        that limit without problems. At last seasons F.A. Olid
       semi-final      the conditions in that end were some of the worst I have
       experienced_ i n      some .sixteen years of watching football, sadly as
       no one was injured, no one was interested.                            5


       I also believe that the Leppings Lane End does not have sufficient
       turnstiles,,; saitably  located,  to provide safe access when large
       numbers of    fans are attempting to enter that end. There is a wider
       issufc? here,  with every ground in the country (including the likes
       of Old Trafford, probably the best club stadium in England) having
       cut down the     “.-way fans"  end to the minimum,     reflecting the
       requirements of    an average league game, so making them unsuitable
       for use when a game       (such as a semi-final) has large number of
       supporters in attendance from TWO clubs.


       Finally,   there is absolutely no doubt in my mind that, whatever
       happened   subsequently,   the initial problem was the lack of control
       outside the ground       by the police.    I also find the    argument
       regarding the late arrival of the fans somewhat misleading. While I
       would   not dispute    that a large number of fans did arrive between
       1430    and 1500 I would suggest that       the problem was    already
       underway.   Proper control (consisting, for example, of ticket checks
       away from the ground and use of barriers to form proper queues)
       needed to be in place from the beginning. To suggest that the late
       arrival   of fans caused the problem       is pure fiction. The police
       failed to set up controls such that a capacity crowd could gain
       entrance to the stadium in an orderly manner. The late arrival of
       fans merely exacerbated a problem that had begun much earlier.

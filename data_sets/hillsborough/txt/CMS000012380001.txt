HILLSBOROUGH DISASTER - HOME OFFICE GUIDANCE TO LOCAL AUTHORITIES


The Minister may like to see this copy of the advice which Home
Office officials have given the Home       Secretary   about the
possibility of issuing interim guidance to local authorities
under the Safety at Sports Grounds Act, while the Taylor Inquiry
is sitting.
The official advice is doubtful about issuing anything now,
because of the risk of pre-empting Lord Justice Taylor's report.
They suggest that, if the Home Secretary considers it essential
to do something, a short circular should be issued drawing local
authorities'  attention to certain aspects of the existing
guidance. They recommend more firmly against an immediate request
to local authorities to impose tighter restrictions on terrace
capacity, both to avoid pre-empting Taylor and because of the
risk that changing the existing limits might be open to legal
challenge (by the clubs) as "unreasonable".

I understand that the Home Secretary has     not responded to   this
submission yet.

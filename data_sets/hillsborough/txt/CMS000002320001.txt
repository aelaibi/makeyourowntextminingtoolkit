HILLSBOROUGH LEGAL BILL


I am replying to your note of 29 July. In your second paragraph, I was comforted to note
that you accept that it could not be reasonably foreseen in January 1990 that the need for
final payment of this bill would not arise until the financial year 1991/92. However, the rest
of your second paragraph is of no help. The point about 1990/91 is that there was massive
underspend on the part of the Football Licensing Authority, and we could have met this bill
from that.

2.      That is in the past, and the current position is how to pay this bill. I take issue with
the last sentence of your second paragraph. You are misinformed. We are not projecting
a large overspend on running costs on the central Fire Department budget. If you are
referring to the totality of the Fire Department, including the Fire Service College, that is
another issue which is being resolved with the Treasury, with the assistance of Finance
Division 1, and is almost entirely bound up with the move to agency status being planned for
the Fire Service College. In summary then I thank you for the guidance that we can pay this
bill from running costs, and choose to ignore your unwarranted remarks about Fire
Department’s ability to budget.

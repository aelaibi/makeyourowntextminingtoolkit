I     am     a        Police      Sergeant            in     the        South       Yorkshire            Police        at

On S a t u r d a y ,         15 A p r i l    1989,         I w a s d e s i g n a t e d to p e r f o r m d u t y

I took my refreshments                         at a p p r o x i m a t e l y 1 . 3 0 p m a n d a f t e r w a r d s

T o g e t h e r with the PC's                  I advised Liverpool                        s u p p o r t e r s to w a l k

t h e n w a l k to the N o r t h S t a n d and W e s t S t a n d e n t r a n c e s .


I had        earlier            been     instructed               by     Inspector           Scarfe,        to     meet
the    Force            coach     on     Leppings           Lane        and        supervise         the     serials
boarding              the      coach.            I     made        my        way    along         Vere      Road       at
approximately                   2.45pm         the         same        date        and       after       receiving

several        Liverpool           supporters                      from      gardens        and y a r d s         on    Vere

supporters            complained                 that         t h e r e w e r e t o o m a n y p e o p l e at t h e

was    engaged            with     this           I heard,               on m y P o l i c e       radio,        a Senior
Officer         asking       for        the           gates        on L e p p i n g s       Lane      to be o p e n e d .
I didn't            hear    who        the            officer         was      but     h-o sotmd-e-d-m*y.

A few        minutes        later,               at     approximately                 3 . 00pm,         I walked        from
V e r e R o a d to t h e L e p p i n g s L a n e t u r n s t y l e s .                          On a r r i v i n g t h e r e
I s a w a l o t of p e o p l e q u e u i n g                        at t h e t u r n s t y l e s .            I also saw
several            Police         Officers                    at     that           location            and     a      Chief
Inspector            talking           to        the        crowd        through       a megaphone.                  I then
heard        a n o t h e r m e s s a g e on t h e P o l i c e r a d i o                     to t h e e f f e c t        that
the      crowd        had        started               to      invade         the      pitch        and       that      some
people         were       being         crushed               in     the      West        Stand.           I heard        the
Chief        I n s p e c t o r with the m e g a p h o n e t e l l i n g the s u p p o r t e r s not
to    try      to     enter       the        ground.                 The      supporters            were       taking         no
notice.               I     then            walked              into         the      enclosure               where       the
turnstyles            are        and        enlisted               the     help      of     several           PC's     and     a
Sergeant.              I instructed                     the        officers          to m o v e      the      supporters
out     of     the enclosure                     and        to c l o s e      the     gates.            I did this            in
an    effort         to p r e v e n t            even         more        supporters            from entering             the
ground.


A     few      minutes           later,               at      about        3.10pm,          I     saw      some        people
emerging            f r o m the exit                  g a t e of the W e s t              Stand.        Some men were
helping            people        out        of    the         gate,        these      people         appeared          to be
in    pain         and were        holding                  their        chests       and       stomachs.              I went
                                                                                                                          3   *




to    these        people          and a d m i n i s t e r e d         what        first     aid       I could.                    I
then     saw a man come r u n n i n g out c a r r y i n g a y o ung boy,                                           the boy
was      extremely                 pale.         By         this       time        there         were      a lot                  of
supporters                   outside         the       exit gates,                 most      of          these were
shouting           and        swearing           at      Police            Officers         and        saying                that
t h e r e w e r e q u i t e a f e w p e o p l e b e i n g c r u s h e d to d e a t h .                              I then
went     with several                 other        officers             into       the     enclosure                    at t h e
rear     of        the         West        Stand.                I     there        saw      several               hundred
s u p p o r t e r s mill i n g around the area,                             I also saw several                      people
lying        on              the     ground           being attended                 to      byf r i e n d s             or
relatives.                    Again        I rendered what                   first        aid      I     could until
Ambulance                    and     Fire        Service personnel                       arrived.                   I        then
organised               Police         Officers             in        trying        to      get         able            bodied
s u p p o r t e r s o u t o f t h e e n c l o s u r e to m a k e w a y f o r t h e e m e r g e n c y
services.                I then         assisted            the       Ambulance            Officers            to        place
people        on        to    stretchers              and     place         them      into        the     ambulances
w h i c h had just s t a r t e d to arrive.                                It w a s o b v i o u s f r o m w h a t                      I
saw      that           several            people,           including              some         children,                   were
already           dead.            Supporters            were         still        carrying        people               out        of
the      West Stand                 through        the       tunnel,            these       people            were                now
being      t r e a t e d by A m b u l a n c e            and Fire O f f i c e r s .                I went               o u t on
to     the         access           road,        which               eventually            leads         again                into
 Penistone              Road,        and        organised              Police        Officers            to         provide
 access        ways           for      the       fleet           of     ambulances              which          had            just
 started           to        arrive        in    force.                I    was      approached               by         a        man
 carrying          a stethoscope                   who      told       me     he    was     a doctor                and           who
 asked       if     he        could        help.            I took          him     to     the     exit        gate               and
 h a n d e d h i m o v e r to I n s p e c t o r S y k e s .                    At t h i s t i m e m o s t of the
 casualties                  behind        the        West            Stand        had      been         removed                   by

 a m b u 1ance .
                                                                                                                                   Ml
                                                                                                                4   .


I saw quite              a lot of c a s u a l t i e s                 a r o u n d the F irst Aid Room,                         I
then     assisted               ambulance            personnel               with        the       loading          on        to
stretchers             and a m b u l a n c e s         of        several          injured            persons.             The
ambulances             were       parked       behind             the      ground        gymnasium            and        were
l o a d e d up a n d d e s p a t c h e d f r o m t h a t p o i n t .                     W h e n t h e r e w e r e no
more    casualties                 I went      to P e n i s t o n e R o a d              near        to g a t e         0 and
directed        emergency                vehicles              into        and out       of        the     stadium            as

required.


Shortly       afterwards,                  I presume                 it    will       have      been       just         after
5.00pm,        I       w a s in     the      area         of         the     Police           room       when       I      saw
several        Police               Officers              behind           o n e of      the         prison         buses.
These     officers                were     openly           crying          and were           very       distressed.
I managed              to         obtain keys                for a         personnel          carrier,              I took
these      officers               to t h e    van,          placed          t h e m in       it a n d d r o v e          them
to     C 1aywhee1s                   Lane      where              I left       them           to      obtain             some
refreshments.                        I     returned               to       the ground              where        I       again
assisted           Inspector              Scarfe        in t h e t r a f f i c d i r e c t i o n             needed           in

t h e g r o u n d a n d in P e n i s t o n e R o a d .

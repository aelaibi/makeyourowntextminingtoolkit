           The       Nottingham           Forest       f a ns        were       already       arriving          in the       vicinity           of

           the       ground       between          12 a n d      1 2 . 3 0 w h e n we         arrived        for      the    pre    match

           luncheon?             it a p p e a r s    that        the       Liverpool          supporters             were    seriously
                                                                                N u q R o
           delayed          on    the     M62s      this        from Rogan             Taylor       of    the     Football         Supporters

           Association,

           My attention                was    drawn        to    fans       scaling          the    perimeter             fence    before        the

           n e ar     miss       when ,      apparently,              Beardsley             hit    the    cross       bar at       the     other

           end         I did        not      see    this        because          I wa s      looking       at     the      crowd,

           A    po 1 i ce    of f i cer a 1 1 e m p t e d            to    speak       to    the    L 1n e s m a n    on    the    near- s i cie ,

           but       the    Linesman          carried, on w i t h                play?       another       policeman          then       came

           into       the    pitch        from      behind           the    goal       and    the     referee         suspended          p l a y at

           six       minutes        past      t h re e .

           After       about        15 m i n u t e s       I went          to    the     Police       Control         Box    which

           ironically,              affords         what        one       would     have      thought        was      a    perfect       vision

           of    the       terraces          in q u e s t i o n        looking         directly          along       the    goal    line        from

           the       corner       of    the    stadium.               Close        circut         television          cameras       scan        the

           terraces          and       the    environs           of       the    ground.

           They       t o l d me       that    a    gate        or    gates        had      been    forced        and      showed     me    a

           picture          which       purported           to       represent           this.        Their       indication          was       t h at

                                                                                                                                          D1S19

the      match       would          have      to    be a b a n d o n d e d         because         there          had        been

fatalities.                Th e      Police         Commander             was      present,            together              with    the

Assistant            Chief          Constable            Mr    Jackson.

Some      25 mi nu tes              after       the      suspension              I convened             a meeting              of    the       three

Clubs      concerned,                t he     Referee          and       the P o l i c e        Commander              in th e       main

B o a r d Room.            The        likelihood              was    s t il l      that     the        match          would        have       to    be

abanded,            but    the       Police         seemed          to    h a ve     moved       slightly              away        from       the

prospect            of a b a n d o n m e n t        and       were       not     ruling         out     the         possibility               that

the      match       would          go    on.       I think          this       was      probably            because           they       were

fearful         as     to w h a t         would       happen         if the          full       extent           of    the     situation

became         k n o w n at         t h at    time .          There       followed          a    l on g      period           of

uncertainty               with       people         of all          three       Clubs       and        the m e d i a          milling

around         not     knowing            what      to    do    or w h a t         to    s a y as       it       became        apparent

t ha t    the       fatalities               were     increasing.

I asked         the P o l i c e           Commander            to    stay       in      close      contact             with        the    Referee

who      was    in the          changing            room       area        for     obvious         reasons,              but I t h i n k

t ha t    there        was      a    last       direct         contact             they    had         for    the       best       part       of an

hour „

in the         intervening                t i me    the       two    team m a n a g e r s          were          taken        to    do    a

tannoyed            announcement,                  but    1    did       not       hear     thi s.           No r      did    1 see       fo r the

most      part       what       was       happening            on    the        pitchbecause                 I was       behind          the

scenes         trying        to m a k e         sure      that       nothing            unauthorised                  wa s   done        or    said.

  1 understand               that         there       was      no    urgency            shown      in a n y           respect        out       on

the      field       nor     that         any      material          information                w as    given          out     over       the

tannoy.

The      Manager          of N o t t i n g h a m F o r e s t             sent      out    word         that       he w a s         taking          his

players         home       at       one      stage       and    I went           into     th e     dressing              room       to    say       to

him and         to     the      players            that,       although            there        was     a     less       than       50/50

chance         of    the m a t c h           being       resumed,           there        must      be       no    indication              from

anybody         t ha t     the       game       had      been abanded                until       the         police          gave    the       say
                                                                                                                                        F AG£
                                                                                                                                        D1219

so.        Eventually,              at    about          4.25pm      I understand                that       a    tannoyed

announcement               was      made       to    the       effect      t ha t     the       match       had       been abanded,

t ha t     there      had       been a         serious          incident         and       people          were       requested            to

k e e p their          p laces.

At    t h at    point,          in the         understanding               t ha t     there       had       been about               50

fatalities,               I f e lt       able       to    speak      to    the       media       who       had       been     clamoring

around         for    so me      time         and    I did       interviews               with    B BC      Television               a n d B BC

Radio       and      gave       a short         press          conference            to    the    waiting             reporters            at

about       4 . 4 0 pm.

1 understand               t ha t    all       through          this      time       the       backroom          sta f f,        many      of

them       young      boys       and      girls          at    Sheffield         W e d n e s d a y , were             involved            in

supplying            hot w a t e r        and       stretcher            facilities             and    it w o u l d a p p e a r            that

they       g av e    a superhuman               performance.                   For    the       first       time        we    ha d

arranged            that    the      h o st     Club          Doctor      be    situated          in the             tunnel        area,         so

what       action         the    Doctor         was       involved         in.        I have          to    say       th at      the      only

person         throughout            the       episode          t h at    I sa w a c t i n g          with any             degree         of

urgency        was        the    Sheffield               Wednesday         physio,             Alan    Smith,           who      wa s

running         up a n d        down      the       pitch       in the         middle          tending          to    the     injured

presumably.

After       the      two    Clubs         had       left       the   Chairman             of    Sheffield             Wednesday            was

persuaded            to    leave         the    ground          by hi s        relatives.

In th e        middle       of      the       evening          I was      called          to a m e e t i n g          of     the

Secretary,            Graham         Mackrell.                 I felt      that,          in v i e w       of    the       continuing

media       presence,            their         and       our    interests            would       be    best          served        by t h e m

leaving         the       ground         so    that       one    could         not    be       picked       off       as     against           the

counterfoils                not     having         been       torn       off.           It wa s        rumoured           throughout              the

to a s c e r t a i n        whether          this       was       so.      In the            event,       purely          by     chance,          1

saw      him arrive            in      the       opposite          corner          of    the       ground         with      the      Police           at

about        10.43pm.              I me t        him    on    the       terraces             and    we    inspected              the

relevant         are as .

The      story was            that       there         had    been a very                real       possiblity              of    an

accident         outside            the      turnstiles             because             of    the     volume         of L i v e r p o o l

supporters             coming          at    the       last m i n u t e s          and a        decision            had     been       made       to

open     a     concertina              type       doorand          allow       them          through.               They       w o u l d then

terrace.             There         was      an    exit        g at e    in e a c h       of      the     two      sections           of the

breached         in a n u m b e r            of    p la c e s ,     but       it m a y        be    that       this       had     been

deliberately                cut     by m e m b e r s         of    the     Fire         Service          who      attended.

Colin M oy ni h a n were                    entirely                appropriate                 in    speaking             of    thos e      who    ha d

been      bereaved             and        had    relatives                  of    friends            injured and                not    entering

w as     as    s h a k e n as         anybody             by       the      enormity            of    what       had       happened,

possibly            because           he    was       one          of    the      few who            spoke       to    relatives             of    the

                      F.A.SEMI-FINAL
   LIVERPOOL V NOTTINGHAM FOREST AT SHEFFIELD WEDNESDAY
                 SATURDAY 15TH APRIL 1969




      The Nottingham Forest fans were already arriving in
the vicinity of the ground between 12 and 12.30 when we
arrived for the pre match luncheon; it appears that the
Liverpool supporters were seriously delayed on the M62:
this from Rogan Taylor of the Football Supporters
Association.

      My attention was drawn to fans scaling the perimeter
fence before the near miss when, apparently, Beardsley hit
the cross bar at the   other end - I did not see this because
I was looking at the crowd.

      A police officer attempted to speak to the Linesman
on the near side, but the Linesman carried on with play;
another policeman then came into the pitch from behind the
goal and the referee suspended play at six minutes past
three.

      After about 15    minutes I went to the Police Control
Box which ironically, affords what    one would have thought
was a perfect vision of the terraces in question looking
directly along the goal line from the corner of the
stadium. Close circuit television cameras scan the terraces
and the environs of the ground.

      They told me that a gate or gates had been forced and
showed me a picture which purported to represent this.
Their indication was that the match would have to be
abandoned because there had been fatalities.  The Police
Commander was present, together with the Assistant Chief
Constable Mr Jackson.

      Some 25 minutes after the suspension I convened a
meeting of the three Clubs concerned, the Referee and the
Police Commander in the main Board Room.  The likelihood
was still that the match would have to be abandoned, but
the Police seemed to have moved slightly away from the
prospect of abandonment and were not ruling out the
possibility that the match would go on.  I think this was
probably because they were fearful as to what would happen
if the full extent of the situation became known at that
time.  There then followed a long period of uncertainty
with people of all three Clubs and the media milling around
not knowing what to do or what to say as it became apparent
that the fatalities were increasing.

      I asked the Police Commander to stay in close contact
with the Referee who was in the changing room area for
obvious reasons, but I think that there was a last direct
contact they had for the best part of an hour.
                           - 2 -


      In the intervening time the two team managers were
taken to do a tannoyed announcement, but I did not hear
this.  Nor did I see for the most part what was happening
on the pitch because I was behind the scenes trying to make
sure that nothing unauthorised was done or said.  I
understand that there was no urgency shown in any respect
out on the field nor that any material information was
given out over the tannoy.

      The Manager of Nottingham Forest sent out word that
he was taking his players home at one stage and I went into
the dressing room to say to him and to the players that,
although there was a less than 50/50 chance of the match
being resumed, there must be no indication from anybody
that the game had been abandoned until the police gave the
say so.  Eventually, at about 4.25 p.m. I understand that a
tannoyed announcement was made to the effect that the match
had been abandoned, that there had been a serious incident
and people were requested to keep their places.

      At that point, in the understanding that there had
been about 50 fatalities, I felt able to speak to the media
who had been clamoring around for some time and I did
interviews with B.B.C. Television and B.B.C. Radio and gave
a short press conference to the waiting reporters at about
4.40 p.m.

      I understand that all through this time the backroom
staff, many of them young boys and girls at Sheffield
Wednesday, were involved in supplying hot water and
stretcher facilities and it w ould appear that they gave a
superhuman performance.  For the first time we had arranged
that the host Club Doctor be situated in the tunnel area,
so as to provide quick and easy access to the pitch in view
of what had happened to Paul Lake of Manchester City
recently, but I was not aware what action the Doctor was
involved in.  I have to say that the only person throughout
the episode that I saw acting with any degree of urgency
was the Sheffield Wednesday physio, Alan Smith, who was
running up and down the pitch in the middle tending to the
injured presumably.

      After the two Clubs had left the Chairman of
Sheffield Wednesday was persuaded to leave the ground by
his relatives.

      In the middle of the evening I was called to a
meeting of the remaining Directors of Sheffield Wednesday
together with the Club Secretary, Graham Mackrell.   I felt
that, in view of the continuing media presence, their and
our interests would be best served by them leaving the
ground so that one could not be picked off as against the
other in making conflicting statements and in view of the
fact that the Secretary would have to remain there anyway.
We had promised to make ourselves available to E.B.C.
Television for the mid-evening News and for Match of the
Day later, both of which we did.  On the interviews we gave
our impressions of what had happened, we said there were
two versions as to what had happened, one that the gates
had been forced, the other that the gates had been opened
by the police and the people were let in without having
their tickets closely checked or the counterfoils torn off.
There is much evidence of counterfoils not having been torn
off.  It was rumoured throughout the evening that Colin
Moynihan would be on his way to Sheffield but despite
numerous telephone calls to Government contacts we were
unable to ascertain whether this was so.  In the event,
purely by chance, I saw him arrive in the opposite corner
of the ground with the Police at about 10.45 p.m.  I met
him on the terraces and we inspected the relevant areas.

       The story was that there had been a very real
possibility of an accident outside the turnstiles because
of the volume of Liverpool supporters coming at the last
minute and a decision had been made to open a concertina
type door and allow them through.   They would then have
gone through into a holding area and through a 15 yard
approximately long tunnel onto the terraces filtering
either to their left or right at their whim into one of the
two middle sections of the terrace.   There was an exit gate
in each of the two sections of the perimeter fencing.    The
perimeter fencing appeared to have been breached in a
number of places, but it may be that this had been
deliberately cut by members of the Fire Service who
attended.

      The scenes of distress will remain with me forever,
of anger, bitterness, frustration, bewilderment.   The
nearest room to people coming away from the terraces and
the playing area down through the players tunnel, was the
Referees' changing room and although this is only small,
the Referee and Linesmen made it available to act as a
haven for a sit down for those people who came through and
wished to do so.  The conduct of the Referee and his
Linesmen was impeccable, given the difficulties he had in
maintaining a flow of information from the Police and
passing this on to the two teams and given the fact that he
had nearly a dozen F.A. Personnel looking over his shoulder
as it were.  I don't know what he could have been expected
to do under the circumstances but he was anxious to
officially postpone the game at the earliest opportunity in
view of the fact that the players had by then been off the
field for an hour and I believe by the end of the day he
was considerably shaken.  I thought the comments of Colin
Moynihan were entirely appropriate in speaking of those who
had been bereaved and had relatives of friends injured and
not entering into any debate about the various side issues;
in fact, I thought he was as shaken as anybody by the
enormity of what had happened, possibly because he was one
of the few who spoke to relatives of the bereaved.
      I promised T.V.  A.M. that I would be available at
home at the end of the telephone to respond to questions on
Sunday morning, but in the event I decided to go to the
Studio and pick up any points at the end of an hour and a
half programme which I felt handled the disaster with
considerable care and sensitivity.

      I then went to the Office to consult those Members of
the Management Team who had come in.

      We decided to call in additional Members of Staff in
order to handle the Media and to determine a plan of action
over the course of the next three or four days.

      I then spoke to the office of the President of The
Football Association, The Duke of Kent, who was due back in
London from the West Indies in the middle of Sunday
morning; I advised that a visit to Sheffield by either The
Duke or Duchess of Kent would be most welcome to The
Football Association.  I reported to the Chairman the full
circumstances in the middle of the evening and we agreed
that The Football Association would, without prejudice,
make an immediate donation of £250.000 to the Lord Major of
Sheffield Appeal Fund.

      On Sunday morning I spoke to the Chairman, I said
that I would be stressing the need for more seats at the
ground, I wanted to re-examine the ticket allocation for
the F.A.Cup Final which we felt in the Office would serve
as a suitable memorial for the fans who lost their lives
the previous day.  I divided the Management Team into three
specific tasks:

1.   Maintaining contact with Sheffield Wednesday to
     ascertain precise figures from computer printouts
     through the various sections of the ground.

2.   Looking at arrangements and details of a possible
     replay between Liverpool and Nottingham Forest.

3.   The possibility of turning the Cup Final into a
     memorial for the dead supporters.


      The previous evening along with the number one
Football Writers of the National Daily papers I agreed to
hold a Press Conference at 3.00 p.m. at Lancaster Gate on
Sunday, 16th April.  On Sunday I went, to I.T.N. for a live
interview and then the B.B.C. Radio Four The World this
Weekend for alive interview.  I joined in a conference
about the reduction of betting tax in order to improve
facilities at our leading Stadia with Tom Pendry MP

      I stuck to what I had said the previous day about not
making any decision about the Liverpool v. Nottingham
Forest match but tended to pour cold water on the idea that
the F.A. Cup Competition would be abandoned this Season.
                            - 5 -


      Brian Wolfson of Wembley Stadium came to see me on
Sunday. He said that Wembley would do whatever was
appropriate with regard to charitable donations.   He also
said that Wembley would be prepared to stage all seater
semi-finals next season if we so wished.

      On Monday 17th April I went to Channel Four News for
a live interview at 7 a.m. responding to comments
previously made by David Evans.  On LBC News Radio at 7.20
a.m. I responded to criticisms by David Evans saying that
the authorities had abdicated responsibility.

      I went to Breakfast Time BBC Television at 8.10 a.m..
I responded to questions about whether the competition
should carry on.

      I went on Kilroy and faced some anguished people from
Liverpool live at 9.20 a.m. until 10.am. on Monday.  One
lady struck me at the end.

       I decided to instruct all clubs to immediately
consult their local authority and review the perimeter
fencing arrangements.   I consulted all the Staff and they
were overwhelmingly in favour of the competition going
ahead.   The P.F.A. were in favour of the competition going
ahead.   It was reported that the Liverpool players would do
what the fans wanted.   The fans were equally spread. I
consulted some referees present at Lancaster Gate for
promotion interviews.   They felt the game should go ahead.
We discussed detailed arrangements with The Football League •
office.   I discussed with Steve Clark the precise details
of Liverpool's representation to us - He said the protest
was not in any respect about safety, merely about numbers
of tickets.

      Glen Kirton informed me that he offered Graham
Mackrell, the Secretary of Sheffield Wednesday a
postponement at 2.40 p.m. because there were so many empty
spaces in the ground.

      David Evans had earlier said that the Government
should take control of the game, it was terrible for the
game to waste money on transfer fees and The Football
Association! had put the fans on the wrong end.

      I gave Peter Went at the Press Association a holding
interview when I arrived at the office at 11 a.m. so that
he could advise the various provincial papers as to where
we were at.

      I gave immediate instructions for the insurance cover
of The F.A. for such instances to be reviewed.

      I have been in constant touch with our legal advisers
and,  because in such instances leading Counsel get retained
at the earliest opportunity I agreed to put two Counsel on
retainer.
      We agreed with The Duke of Kent's Office that he
should go up there at the earliest opportunity and it
transpired that he was flying up there on Tuesday.  He
offered me a seat on the plane.

      We need to decide   how we allocate the proceeds of
any matches.

      The Chairman and Vice-Chairman and I went to the
House of Commons, via the offices of Denis Howell and Roy
Hattersley, to hear the statement by Douglas Hurd.  He
followed my comments about all seater. Despite the protest
on both sides of the House he indicated that he was
carrying on with the Football Spectators Bill.

      We responded very strongly to disgraceful statements
by the President of UEFA attributing the trouble to
violence and violence by Liverpool fans in particular. We
put in train the arrangements for a one  match only no
replay live television match between Forest and Liverpool
at Old Trafford on Sunday May 7th.

      A decision was finally made by the Chairman and
Vice-Chairman at 6.45 p.m. on Monday that The Football
Association must make an immediate announcement in view of
the need to act firmly and positively and to give a lead.
If we did not do so we would be left with egg on our faces
if Liverpool F.C. were able to put us in a position the
following day.   There would be no point in saying "well we
were prepared to give all the tickets for the Cup Finals to
the fans" if there is no Cup Final. We must make that
decision on Monday.

      Therefore, it was decided to call a Press Conference
for 7.45 p.m.  The issues that needed to be covered were:-

1.   The future of the Competition

2.   The action we were taking in respect of clubs

3.   Our reaction to the statement in the House of Commons
     by the Home Secretary.


      The Chairman , Vice-Chairman and I, along with Jack
Dunnett attended at the House between 3.30 and 5.00 p.m. to
hear the Home Secretary's statement and the various
questions.

                      F . A .SEMI-FINAL
   LIVERPOOL V NOTTINGHAM FOREST AT SHEFFIELD WEDNESDAY
                 SATURDAY 15TH APRIL 1989




      The Nottingham Forest fans were already arriving in
the vicinity of the ground between 12 and 12.30 when we
arrived for the pre match luncheon; it appears that the
Liverpool supporters were seriously delayed on the M62:
this from Rogan Taylor of the Football Supporters
Association.

      My attention was drawn to fans scaling the perimeter
fence before the near miss when, apparently, Beardsley hit
the cross bar at the other end - I did not see this because
I was looking at the crowd.

      A police officer attempted to speak to the Linesman
on the near side, but the Linesman carried on with play;
another policeman then came into the pitch from behind the
goal and the referee suspended play at six minutes past
three.

      After about 15 minutes I went to the Police Control
Box which ironically, affords what one would have thought
was a perfect vision of the terraces in question looking
directly along the goal line from the corner of the
stadium. Close circuit television cameras scan the terraces
and the environs of the ground.

      They told me that a gate or gates had been forced and
showed me a picture which purported to represent this.
Their indication was that the match would have to be
abandoned because there had been fatalities.  The Police
Commander was present, together with the Assistant Chief
Constable Mr Jackson.

      Some 25 minutes after the suspension I convened a
meeting of the three Clubs concerned, the Referee and the
Police Commander in the main Board Room.  The likelihood
was still that the match would have to be abandoned, but
the Police seemed to have moved slightly away from the
prospect of abandonment and were not ruling out the
possibility that the match would go on.  I think this was
probably because they were fearful as to what would happen
if the full extent of the situation became known at that
time.  There then followed a long period of uncertainty
with people of all three Clubs and the media milling around
not knowing what to do or what to say as it became apparent
that the fatalities were increasing.

      I asked the Police Commander to stay in close contact
with the Referee who was in the changing room area for
obvious reasons, but I think that there was a last direct
contact they had for the best part of an hour.

    taken to do a tannoyed announcement, but I did not hear
    this.  Nor did I see for the most part what was happening
    on the pitch because I was behind the scenes trying to make

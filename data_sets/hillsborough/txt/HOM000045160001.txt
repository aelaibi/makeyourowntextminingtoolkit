‘THE COOK REPORT’                         YORKSHIRE TV - SHOWN 2
JUNE 1994
The programme concentrates largely on the death of Kevin Williams.

Key points made in the programme

(Programme lasts around 25 minutes. Timings are shown below).

00.50            Roger Cook - ‘evidence previously disregarded or altered under
                 duress and witnesses previously ignored demonstrate that Kevin
                 and others could be alive today’.

01.50 -          WPC Debra Martin ‘I picked him up ... cradled him ... he opened his
                 eyes ... (they) fluttered .... he went ‘Mum” (and then died).

02.50 -          Cook - the police refused to believe her story - but the first statement
                 was 100% the truth - she did what she had never done before and told a
                 lie (Debra Martin nods agreement).

03.30            Cook - Kevin was pulled out of the stand at 3.28. Two men who
                 carried him across the pitch say he was still alive - so does an off-duty
                 police officer who gave him the kiss of life 20 minutes after he was
                 supposed to be dead. So does Debra Martin, later still.

04.00 -          Sir Malcolm Thornton MP (as was) ‘the truth seems to have been
                 suppressed - policemen and women on the spot were ‘leaned on’ by
                 their colleagues to change their evidence’.

05.00 -          The ambulance service refused to allow their staff to be
                 interviewed by West Midlands police. Instead, ambulance staff were
                 interviewed by the service’s own solicitors, and sealed copies were
                 kept.

08.00 -                             who was trapped against the fence for a quarter of
                 an hour, has sensible things to say about the disaster - police lost
                 control.

09.00 -          Roger Cook tries to talk to Mr Duckenfield, who walks away.

10.30 -          Sheila Coleman (‘official Liverpool researcher’) - ‘the 3.15 cut-off
                 time meant that there was no inquiry into the period post 3.15 when we
                 know the chaos was at its worst’.

11.30 -          Mrs Williams ‘Kevin was still alive at five to four’.

 12.00   -        Dr Iain West, pathologist, says Kevin could have been saved by
                  creating an airway below his voicebox - can be done with a pair of
                  scissors.

 13.00 -          Cook - as it was, nobody took control. The fans used advertising
                  billboards as makeshift stretchers to carry the dead and injured away
                  from the crush. This went on for almost half an hour, the period
                  which has never been properly investigated.

                 Sheila Coleman - police let off the hook by the 3.15 cut-off time. It
                 meant that there was no proper investigation into their behaviour. ‘We
                 also have the investigating force creating a picture of events. Kevin
                 Williams didn’t fit into that picture. When he didn’t fit pressure was
                 brought to bear so that witnesses altered statements ...’.

                 Cook - if evidence that (Kevin) was alive at five to four had been
                 allowed to stand, events after 3.15 would have had to be investigated.

15.00 -          Debra Martin describes being browbeaten by West Midlands police.

16.00 -          Fans who carried Kevin across the pitch say he was still alive.

17.00 -          Mrs Williams says that PC Bruder has told her he never changed his
                 statement, although West Midlands police tried to get him to.

                 Cook - Bruder had claimed that an ambulance passed him as he was
                 helping Kevin at 3.37. But videos which the police chose to
                 show the Coroner did not show the ambulance. But it is shown on
                 another video - Cook programme has traced the driver.

18.00 -          Tony Edwards (ambulance driver) describes driving over pitch.

18.30 -          Mrs Williams - PC Bruder wondered why he was never called to the
                 Inquest.

19.00 -          Dr Popper (Coroner) - a number of anomalies in Bruder’s evidence
                 including the ambulance - Cook tells Popper he has film of the
                 ambulance - Popper ‘fair enough, but at the time ...’ - other problems
                 with Bruder’s evidence too. Popper does not believe Kevin could have
                 sat up in Debra Martin’s arms and said ‘Mum’.

20.30 -          But James Burns, pathologist, thinks he could have done.

21.50 -          Cook - ‘Kevin was alive, he was recoverable, and he was not alone’.

23.00 -          Sandra Stringer - Coroner said her son (Paul Carlile) was dead by 3.15
                 - but he was still fighting for life then.

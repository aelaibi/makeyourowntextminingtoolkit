                   Dear Mr Wells

                   Re                Mr and Mrs                            S Roberts

                   Your letter of the 17th January addressed to our cleints Mr and
                   Mrs Roberts has been handed to us by them for our attention.
                   We confirm that we are acting on behalf in respect of their loss
                   following the death of their son at the Hillsborough Disaster.
                   Throughout their principle concern has been to establish
                   precisely the circumstances which arose irnmediately prior to
                   "the death of their son. In particular they are anxious to have
                   a copy of the full Statement of the two police officers who
                   were directly involved as far as their son is concerned. They
                   have seen extracts of those Statements but not the full
                   transcript, we should therefore be grateful if you could release
                   those Statements to us as soon as possible.

                    Yours sincerely

 the kick        off      as  the cr owd outside the turnstiles did not                           seem
 to reduce at all over a p e r i o d of about five minutes.

 R o u n d the      c o r n e r from the turnstiles there was a          large blue      exit
 gate which was opened briefly to allow somebody out.                             I could
 see         some supp ort ers       t ryi ng to obtain      entrance but the gate was
g u a r ded by p o li ce            and was closed again.        At about 2.50 p.m.           I
         a s t°n ish ed to see the gate open and the police u she rin g supporters
    rough it.              This a ppe are d to be the safest way of en tering 'the
g ro und in the c i r c u m sta nce s and I told the boys to fo llow me t h r o ugh
it.            we all      had our tickets         ready but   nobody looked at       them.
  nee through the gate there was a kind of court yard.                            This is
where pr o g r a m m e s         are nor mal ly sold and I immediately looked for

the          gate through         which   we had    come,   was a tunnel entrace        wit h

 It is .very important to note that                      there was no indication that ,
 there were other points of access                       to the terraces, nei the r was u
 th ere anyone to direct us to them.                                                    '
                                                                                        •

 To  the    left of the tunnel        ent r a n c e   was     a gents      toilet whi ch
 Craig    and Ke ster d e c i ded to    use.        W h i l e A n d r e w and I w a i t e d
 for th e m I saw several h u n dre d sp ectators pass through the open
 side gate.      They were w a l k i n g in an o r d e rly fashion and there
 was   no   evidence of rowdy behaviour.               I thought that it          wo u l d
 be impossible for there to be a s udden surge of supporters into
 the g r oun d in any case, as ther e was a blue railing to the side
 of  the    turnstiles w hic h   all    those q u e u e i n g outside wo u l d have
 had to go round.

 When        Kester          and Craig came out            of the gents I led all three
 boys        into the tunnel.                  All     those     supporters who came through
 the open gate headed s tra igh t for the tunnel as it was so i m med iat ely
 odvious .             Orice in the tunnel there was no way of turni ng ba c k
 because           of the large n umbers fol l o w i n g             behind.        I was convi nce d
 that we would be able to turn e i t h e r to tlje right or left along
 j|^gangway at the back of the terraces; in order to find a safe
            . to    '" s t a n d .     As it t u r n e d  out, at         the end of the tunnel
 we spil led                on to the terraces wh i c h w er e already very congested.
 C r a i g has later told me that at this point he stumbled and w o u l d
 have       probably               fallen   over   and p o s s i b l y    have been trampled on
 if K e s t e r had not p u l l e d hi m up again.                           I yelled to the boys
 to go right w hic h is the side of the goal to which we no rmally
 stand.            I was c o n cer ned that we were directly                       behind the goal
w h i c h is always the mos t c o n g e s t e d area.                         It was difficult to
 c o n t rol       our move men ts by n o w b e c a u s e          of the steadily increasing
 num ber s        in the area.                I was h o r r i f i e d to see that there was
 a vertical               blue fence b l o c k i n g us in co mpl ete ly to the right.
The       c r o w d surged around              and we we r e         c a r rie d to our left and
downwards.                    I was still       close to K e s ter but could not see the
o t h e r two by now.                     We we r e po we r l e s s to control our move men ts
and e n d e d up no more than a couple of feet from the front fencing.
At this point the mo vem ent s t o p p e d and the pressure from b e h i n d
became          such that we we r e stationary.                         I was facing *_£he w r o n g
w a y an d         a suppor ter b e h i n d me t o l d me to turn                  around and even
«pe        me      some help in doing so.                       I was      very concerned at the
snuation.                     I cou ld see that the play ers were on the pitch and
that the game                    was about to k i c k off.          K est er was about a yard
to my left but I c o u l d not see Cr a i g or A n d r e w anywhere.                              My
left       a r m was free and I r e a c h e d               out and p r e s s e d it against the
fence at the front to try and r e m o v e some of the p res sur e on
me.

I can         remember     a n umber of things over the next few minutes,
but they did not n e c e s s a r i l y oc cur in the order I relate them.
The game start ed and L i v e r p o o l attacked.            I was aware that they
h a d a s coring chance but was not sure w hat h ad happened.                  Play
then       ca m e  towards     our  end.     The  pre ss u r e from be hind became
almost        intolerable      and  I was    having    di fficulty   in  breathing.
1    t r i e d to r a i s e ; myself on tip toe to enable me to e x pan d my
lungs.           I lo oked at K e s t e r to my left and felt that he w o u l d

 be OK as he seemed to be t all er than m a n y of those around him.
 He did look a little pale but I t h o u ght that I was in more trouble
  than him.         This was the last time that I saw him alive.                      I co uld
  see that there was a n a r r o w gate on to the pitch several yards
 to my right.            People were s c r e a m i n g at a polic ema n w a l k ing pas t
  in front of us to open it but he was o b liv iou s to the request.
  I thought that even if it was o p e n e d we were too far away to
 get out through it for qui te                   a while.             I saw a p hot og r a p h e r
 t ak ing pictures of us.          P e o p l e were        g r o a n i n g and screaming but
 mo s t were just         silent. I was c o n v i n c e d that some of the p eop le ,
 in      front of me were dying.               I was b i t t e n just below my left
 shoulder by somebody in agony.               At one p o i n t I became semi conscious
 but m a n a g e d to force myself bac k T o consc'iousHelss':':..“T r e a l i s e d

 I thought that           at least he was safe.              As I had convinced my self
 that Kester would be OK I was mo s t c o n c e r n e d about Craig.                             I
 kn e w there was a good chance that I w o u l d die and thought h ow

       somebody coming over the top of me.                His leg knocked my spe ct­

 off my arm.         I passed out.

 I was         unable    to move at all.           Wi t h   He rbie's encouragement I
 ev e n t u a l l y ra ised myself on to one elbow.             A bit later I c rawled
 a few yards to the wall b e s i d e the gat e and propped myself up
 a gainst it.           I could see m a n y othe r p e o p l e lying aroujid by the

     We   dec ide d that the only thing to do was to               go back to the sta diu m
     to   see    if the police            had    traced Kester.       We m a n a g e d to jump
     on to a bus           wh ich took us there. We w er e            told by a p o li cem an
     at   the    s t a di um that we should go            to the   H ammerton Ro a d Police
     Station     wh ere        all    a vailable     in formation   was     being     collated.
     We were       given        directions      but   no transport was        available.      In
     the event we m a n a g e d to hitch a lift from a pri vat e drive r who
     was    stun ned       by     what   had ha ppe ned and obviou sly r e a l i s e d     that
     we   had been involved.              He told us that a        large number had been
     killed and I think it was 74 at this stage.                           He was e xt rem ely
     co nsi der ate     and      took    us    all  the    way to    the     Police    Station.
     I was int erv iew ed by an officer and gave a description of Kester.
     We were       then told to go to the Boys Cl u b down the roa d where
     we woul d be          given tea and sandwiches. As                soon as we entered
     the    Boys Club          so mebody    asked if we needed to use a tele pho ne
     and I said yes.               A g e n tle man ___________________     told me he woul d
     take me       to one and I told the boys to wait for                     me.     I thought
     I would       be g oi ng into another room but, in fact, was taken to
     (                           home on the         edge of the city about 5 minutes
     drive away.           I te lep hon ed home to tell my              wife that three of
     us were      safe but Kester was               still missing.         She said that the
     fathers      of A n d r e w   and Craig         were setting        off   immed iate ly for
     Sheffield and I told them to come to the Police Station.

      Back at the Boys Club we w a i t e d for some time before ________________
      suggested that we should go to the hospital as there were casualty
      lists there.      He drove us there in his car and we went into
      a   large  canteen   where       a large   number     of people were waiting
      for news.      Every so often an official from the hospital jumped
      on t.o a tab] e to give a description of some of the dead or to
      read out a list of casualties from one of the other hospitals.
      We were shown some of the lists but Kester's name was not on
      any of    them.    I m a n a g e d to. phone m y ^ w i f e again and she told
r^. me that my friend                 was on his way.'                      said that
r* vi*.he had to go back to the Police Station but we decided to stay
C*'*4 at the hospital as there seemed to be more information available
      there.     Eventually however         it was  announced that -we would be
      taken by bus back       to the Police St a t i o n          H e went,  in fact,
      back to the Boys Club where we met                                     wife  who
      is a q u alified Social Worker.          She stayeo wren as tor        the  rest
      of the evening,     sometimes       with her daug               The fathers of
      Andrew and Craig arrived and later my friend

     Eventually   I was     asked   if   I would 9 0 b a ck to the s tadium as
     pictures had been taken of the dead,                 came with me, together
     with                     and her daughter      who   drove the car.     Back
     at the   stadium     there was considerable      confusion - some people
     were sitting      o n a double decker      bus   for   no apparent   reason.
                       took us       direct to the entrance    of the gymnasium
     where  a policeman       explained that    the pictures were pi n n e d    to
     a board and he wanted me to go and look at them.                I explained
     that I had lost my spectacles and would have to be very close
     to them.     When I went in,         I was fairly sure that the picture
     at the bo t t o m of the se c o nd or third row was K e s t e r .     It was
     Number  74.         asked          if he thought it was Kester and he
     said he thought it might be.            We went all along the pictures
     and I was convinced that none of the others could be him.                The
-7-


po l ice man asked me to look back along the rows- of pi ctures and
whe n I came back          to Number 74 I r e c o g n i s e d Kester by his     dark
eyebrows -     The     policeman    said    th e y w o u l d    fetch the body    for
a formal     identification-        We w a i t e d a few moments and then I
was invited to go through a door into the m ai n gymnasium-
asked if I w a n t e d him to go w i t h me and I said no, I w o u l d go
on m y own-     As soon as I saw K e s t e r I k n e w it was him.             Th e r e
were no marks on his face.            I r e c o g n i s e d his clothes.   His shirt
and T shirt w er e         pushed up tow ard s his neck.             I fell on    him
in grief and r e a l i s e d he was cold.

I was    asked by      a policeman       'Is this your son Kester?'                   and I
said   'yes'.     I was led away to a table-                       Somebody said 'Take
your   time,   walk as slowly as y o u want'.                     We sat at a table,
myself,                                   and       her   daughter,          together   w it h
three policemen-       One of them asked me to r e c o unt what had h a p p e n e d
th roughout the day and I did this.                  They did not make any notes
but the off ice r opposite me l o ok ed me in the eye most of the
time.    When I finished he asked if we c o u l d go through it again
 nd   he   wrote   a    transcript,      prompting       itie by         asking   questions
 r om time to time.        Oc cas ionally I m ad e a r e ma rk about the police,
such as 'the p r o b l e m s caused by the horses out sid e the turnstiles'
but   when   I ev e n t u a l l y read t h r o u g h m y ^ s t a t e m e n t  any cri tic al
st atements   about    the police had b e e n ^ K i m o v c d :              I was   not in
any mo o d to argue at the time but 1^ did make him change two
parts which were factually wrong-              At one p o i n t we were i nte rru pte d
by   another o f f ice r who wanted         to      give me Kester's belongings.
I had to sign a receipt.             This was very distressing, and I asked
      to look after the items.

We wen t back to the Boys Club w h e r e it was easier to t e le pho ne
home.     I was   anv i    to do this as q u i c kly as possible and,
therefore,   asked        if he w o u l d break the news to the boys
and their    fathers.   I was taken to a r oo m and left alone to
teleph one the news to my wife.

After    a little whi le we all    left,     ev e n t u a l l y r eGQ^eeed m y car
and drove home in two cars,     d r i v e n by the boys' farthers.              We
 r ri ved back in St. Albans at about 2.45 a.m.                    When I saw my
 ife I broke down for the first time.

 Dear Sirs,

 RE; Sheffield Wednesday Football Club - Hillsborough Disaster
 Mr. Roger BallT                     “                        ■

Your letter of the 19th September addressed                                                        to

we are acting ior                                       in connection                          with his claim arising out of
the Hillsborough incident.

The answers to your specific queries are as follows;

1.       Our client came out of the tunnel at the LeppingsLane end and found
         yQur cllenj.-CQljagsed on the, ground and apparentl2T~dSa^''~”‘T ^ ~ m a n

         He was           outside        the     tunnel        at           the           Leppings      Lane    end   lying on        the
         ground.

3.       Because there did not appear to be any sign of life from your client
         our client says that he slapped hisface a few times  and this seemed
         to revive him.      He eventually managed to get your client to sit
         up on a rail by the gate.

       roughly, to get to a s u i t a b l e p a r kin g place.               Ther« was-
       just a solid line of t r a f f i c from the exit of the

      in tne road, supporters m i l l i n g a r S u n d in the r?ad          and
     tCr ^ s t i l e s J U th a Rm ® lee         P e o p l e cr ush i n g towards the
     Inlr^rl           \           t u r n s t iles.       We had tickets for that
                             re were some Police standing around and
     gates Were SOn,e P° llce h o r s e s i nside the blue perimeter
                                                             R. c. BAi.r.

       The horses were on the inside or on the outside, do vou
       remember? - A. They were on the inside, the ones I saS
       Tnere were about three horses, I would say, mounted
       Police, and tney were in the m i ddl e of this crowd of
       people trying to gain access to the turnstiles.     Tne-e
       were no queues, no o rga ni s a t i o n at all.
 0.    Did you see what the hor semen were attempting to do            or
      (perhaps they were not at t e m p t i n g to do anything? - a
      |They were snouting at the crowd.             They seemed quite *
      |angry and there was a fair bit of anger around
      factually, o n _both s i d e s , b e c aus e it was such a
      jridiculous situation.        The people at the front were
       more or less pressed up aga ins t the turnstiles and the
       walls m between, and were kind of slipping into the
       gateways as and when they could, and the whole-kind of
       crowd I would say was about 25 yards long at that
       point.

 Q.- You say the Officers were sho uti ng and no doubt the
     crowd were shouting as well, I think, from what you
     said.  Tnat is right, is it? - A. There was a fair bit
     or argument on both sides.  The supporters were
     complaining at the lack of organisation.

            were the Officers saying to the supporters? - A.
      jTney were just saying, "Get back, get back.  Stop
      jpusning .                                       ^

Q. Did anybody appear to take any n oti ce of t h a t 7 -        A
   Some people were reluctant to j oin the queue for             the
   turnstiles and were standing around.    As I said,            there
   were quite a few m the road, there were quite a               few
   near tne fencing and on the bridge.

Q.| Did you notice whether there were others who were
   ; pushing or ^ot? - A. It seemed to me there was an
  j anxiety to get into the ground. The re was nobody
  i actually pushing, it was just the turnstiles seemed a
  ; long, l o n g w a y away from the back of that crowd, and we
  I          joined it for a few min ute s but I was anxious
    about the safety of the boys.       I saw a supporter nearly
     knocKed over by a horse and if you had gone down then
    you wou-ld have been injured, or perhaps worse.

Q. By the horse or by the crowd, or by both, if he had
   gone down. - A. If he had gone down, by both.

Q.il am a little bit puzzled by you saying there was no
  Ipushing, it was a deep crowd, there was some aggr.o, the
   Officers were shouting, "Push back", which is what you
  , told me.    wnat on earth were they saying that for if
   n°      W fS        anything? - a . Sorry, nobody was doing
  .anything?                                       J         °
                                                                               101
    A
                                                                    R.   C.   B AL L


         0. You were saying, you just told me, that there was not
            any pushing.      I asked you that spe cifically and you
            said no, there vas_not any pushing.       You also told me
            tnat the m o u n ted Officers, in wha tever tone of voice
    _       were saying,      Don t push".   Why were they saying that
    O       if nobody was doing it? - A. Sorry, there was no
            p ushing from the back.      It wasn't like people joining
            at the back and pushing, it was the sheer numbers
            trying to gain entrance to the ground.

         Q.j.So what you are saying is that you did not see anybody
            j d e l i b e r a t e l y push into the crowd but the sneer volume
            {of people was creating a pressure effect? - A. That is
              correct.            As we joined it people came up behind us and
           11^ou felt as if you were being pushed from the back,
           ijTnere was nobody actually in the middle of the-crowd
           j pushing, that is what I was meaning.

                 y o ^ s e l f , with the boys, got anxious, they didn't
             liKe it in this situation, and you stepped to one side?
               A. I told the boys to come out of it and we went and
             stood by the fence beside the river.
D        0 . Were  you a l r ea dy within the p erimeter gates at that
             point or w e r e . y o u still outside - pres uma bly you must
             have been w i t h i n the perimeter gates? - A. Yes.      The
             crowd at that stage had not reached the peri met er
             gates.

        Q. So were you still outside the perime ter gates whe n you
           stood to one siae. - A. No, we were inside.

        0. You were inside, and       you were able    to step to one side,
           m  other words. - A.       Well, you had    to kind of elbow
           your way out.

        0. But you coul,d do it? - A. Oh, yes.

        Q.   In that area things were better, would that be r i ^ ’     nt,
             or not. - A. As soon as we got out and stood wh ere we
             were, Dy the river, I could see that there was a blue
             barrier w h i c h has already been re ferred to, w h i c h was
             kind of c o n t a i n i n g the crowd in that area in front of
             tne turnstiles.

        Q. Are you talking about the bar, we call          that   the funnel
           bar? - A. Yes, that is the one.

        Q. Of course, y ou were on this side of it, wer en' t you, on
           the river side? - A. Yes, more or less op pos ite Gate C
           but a little bit towards the p er i m e t e r gates.

        Q. Tne horses w h i c h you have des c r i b e d were higher up,
           they were n e are r the outer peri met er gates, is that

                                                               S-   C.   B AL L


       right? - A. They were towards the back of           tne crowd
       nearer to tne perimeter gates.                                    ’

 0.    So you nad stepped outside of this crowd and you were
       now s t a n o m g oy tne concertina gate.     I don't supcose
       tor a minute you expected it to open or die you? - a.
           I was a s t o n i s n e d when it opened.

 0.    oerore we aeal with that, you could now look at *he
       crowc w i t m n t m s runnel bar. Did the peoole a-joear to
       you to _ce aistressed? - A. One or two I think wer» in
       discomrort, a minority I would sav.

 0.    what about tne ones against the turnstiles?        Could you
       see tnem?        You nave already passed them in a way, so
       you may not have been able to see them. - A. r could
       still see the turnstiles, I think, at that point,
       oecause^I was not exactly opposite Gate C.        Gate C was
             - o n l. ot me but to my rignt.  I could see ths
       turnstile area but then I was diverted by what haooened
       wi.n tne peri met er gates, which were closed at about
                .
       z o - 1o - j

 Q*     hhy Q i° tnat divert you?          In what sense did that divert
        you. - A. well, I decided, I was c o nv inc ed at that time
        tnat we wouid not get in before tne k i c k - o ^ r so ~
        could not see much point in rejoining the-mass of"
        people trying to get through tne turnstiles.            Anyway,
        cne numbers ^ cia not s e e m t o reduce.      The flow through
        une c u ^ n s t n e s was in cre dib ly slow because, I think   o^
      ) t ne proDleras up at the front.          People just could not
     | get into tne gateways.            Then I noticed to my left the
     | large Diue p e r ime ter gates had been closed by some
     1 Policemen, and very q u i c kly another crowd b uilt-UD
     j b e n m e tnose gates, and some people at the front were
     | Gis tressea.
     i                 V


0.    Against   the peri met er gates? - A.   Yes.

Q . j So younow, in fact, had two crowds, so to speak, one
  I witnin the p er ime ter gate and the turnstile area and
    one outside the perim ete r gate and you could not see
  , tne bacjc of it, I presume? - A. That is ri=>ht.       Ther°
 I seemed to be - ‘b ecause the flow of fans to~the first
 I        h fc b e e n , been Stemmed it was bu ilding up further
 | back outside tne peri met er gates.

Qj    You were not in that crowd, of course, but you felt
  :   tnat tne people against that perimeter gate were
  ;   distressed? - A. That is right.       There were a few at
  I   the front.      I remember there was a young girl  who I was
 ;    quite c o nc ern ed about.
                                                                   103

                                                        R.   C.   BALL


   Did you see any further action or event with regard to
   those perimeter gates? - A. Yes.    They were being neld
   shut, I think by some Police Officers, and they could
   not stem it.   They were forced slightly open, some
   people got through or more or less fell through.     They
   w.
    e ^e snut again but eve ntually they were reopened.   I
   think they were closed for no more than about five
   minutes, as far as I can recall.
                                                                    IV j
   Did you see by any chance around that time a cordon
   formed by Police horses?  If you did not please sav,            "I &/••*** t
   never saw it". - A. No, I didn't.                                      %

Q. Did you hear any tannoy messages addressed      to the
   crowd? - A. Not that I. recall.

Q. Did you see a Land Rover?    - A. No,   I did not.

Q.. And I take it you never heard any messages from anv
    loudspeakers, as opposed to a tannoy? - A. I don't^
    recall any.

Q. You mentioned that the m ounted Officers in the crowd
   were communicating.  Did you see any other Officers,
   particularly when you were near this funnel bar,    *
   attempting to communicate with the crowd? - A. Not that
   I recall, because first of all I was looking at the
   perimeter gates.  I was talking to the boys as well,
   talking about the situation, and then Gate C was opened
   very briefly.

Q* Tell me, you actually saw it open for a very short
   time, that is right, isn't it, in the first instance? -
   A. I do recall seeing it open, just wide enoug'h^to let
   somebody out, and I r emember some fans, just a handful
   of fans went and asked, I presumed they were asking if
   they could go in through there because they were
   pointing at the situation by the turnstiles, but I did
   not see anybody actually go in at that point.

0. You d i d n ' t . _ Did you see it open again? - A. Yes, a
   couple of minutes later.         I estimated about 10-to-3.
We know now that it was 8 -m inutes-to-3 but in my original
statement 'I said 10-to-3.

Q. Of course, at that time we did not have the benefit of
   the videos.  Did it open w idely this time? - A. It was
   opened wider than the first time, but as I recall it
   was not fully opened and the first few people who went
   through, there was some attempt to make sure they went
   through in an orderly fashion, which they did.

Q. Can you recollect whether you saw it shut again on this
   second occasion? - A. No, because we went through it.
                                                                     104

                                                          R.   C.   BALL


Q.   I see, so you don't know what happened behind you? - A.
     No.  I felt that in the c i r c u mst anc es that was the
     safest means of gaining entry to the ground.         I had
     never been to Hillsborough before.         I had been to most
     large grounds in this c o u n try but never Hillsborough,
     and I did not know what the situation was inside, so I
     thought it was better to get inside and then find out
     what was going on.

0.   In view of the situation?    - A. That   is right.

Q.   In fact, you managed to get in quite safely? - A. We
     walked through.  As soon as I saw it open I said to the
     boys, "Okay, let's go in".

Q. By the way, I did not ask you this but did you have
   tickets for the match? - A. We did.    We all had tickets
   although two of us only ob tai ned tickets on the day.

Q. On the way up, I think at      the services?    - A. At the
   service station, yes.

Q. Once you got inside there was a relatively large
   concourse area, is that right? - A. Yes, that is
   correct.

Q.   I take it the crowd in there was more dispersed, would
     that be right? - A. It seemed almost empty.     It was
     most unusual at that time b e fo re a big game.

Q. What time would you say that was again?               In your
   statement I think you said 10-to, but you now think it
   might be about 8 - m i n u t e s - t o - 3 . You think you went
   through on the second openi ng is what you are spying,
   isn't it? - A. I believe we were among the first to go
   through the second time the gate was opened.               Nobody
   checked ouf tickets.




                    /0. Can I just
                                                           105

                                                   R. C. BALL


Q. Can I just go back to the first opening that you
   described? Are you confident that nobody went
   through that first time? - A. Somebody came out, that
   is what I saw.  I didn't actually see anybody go in
   but I wasn't looking at it all the time it was open.

Q. Because there were more openings, in fact, than the
   three we concentrate on and that is why I ask you.
   Whatever it was you were one of the first to go
   through the opening where people did go in? - A. We
   were actually ushered in. We were ushered in by the
   Police on the gate.

Q. Having got in you say that it was fairly empty and I
   think the boys went to the toilet, is that right? -
   A. Two of the boys went to the toilet which is just
   to the left of the tunnel entrance.

Q. You stayed outside I suppose? - A. I waited outside
   with the other boy.

Q. How long were they in there, would you say? - A. It
   seemed a long time, possibly two or three minutes.  I
   was getting anxious to get in and on to the terraces.

Q. Can you remember whether the gate stayed open all
   that time or not? Again if you did not see it, do
   not guess? - A. Yes, the gate was open because there
   was a steady stream of supporters from the gate
   walking orderly, in an orderly fashion, towards the
   tunnel all the time that I was waiting outside the
   toilet.

Q.   Did you see anybody fall over? - A. No.

Q.   Did you see "anybody knocked over? - A. No.

Q. You did not see anybody lose their shoes either, or
   did you? - A. No.

Q. In this area I am talking about? - A. No, my
   recollection is of an orderly procession.

Q. Was it a procession from which somebody could have
   stepped to one side? Was there enough room on the
   concourse area to allow people, if they did not want
   to go, to just get out of the way and go and buy a
   programme or go to the loo or wait for a friend or do
   whatever they wished? - A. There was a lot of room.
   You couldn't buy a programme.  I didn't see a
   programme seller.

Q. You did not see one? - A. I looked for one
   specifically because we always get a programme but
                                                               106

                                                     R. C. BALL


     there were some people standing around.  I think they
     had been separated from friends and were waiting for
     them to come through or whatever.

Q.    What Iam trying to find out is that the group of
     people going towards the tunnel were in such a mass,
     if I can use that word, that once you were in   it you     |
     had to go with them or whether you had voluntary           J
     movement in that group? - A. No, they weren't   in a       J
     mass at that time. As I say, it was an orderly group
     of people walking in a line, you know, two, three,
     four abreast, towards the tunnel.                          I

Q. Did you see a wall anywhere which divided the .
   concourse area near where you were standing by the
   toilets either behind you or facing you? - A. Facing
   back wards Gate C was a wall on the right.

Q. Sergeant Griffiths, can you just point to that
   dividing wall on the model? Do you remember seeing
   that wall at all? - A. That is the wall I am
   referring to.

Q.    Were you facing that wall or were you with your back
     to it? - A. No, the toilets are to the left of the
     tunnel.   I was standing just outside the entrance to
     the toilet facing back towards Gate C, with that wall
     on my right.

Q. Do you remember seeing that little opening in the
   wall by any chance? - A. No, I wasn't aware that
   there was any other access to the terrace.

Q. No, that was not the question.   I am just asking you
   whether you, happen to remember seeing that opening
   there before? - A. I don't remember seeing that
   opening.

Q. You did not see any programme seller around that
   area? - A. I did not, no.

Q. The boys came out of the loo, yes? - A. Yes.

Q. You had been there for twoor three minutes and you
   had now decided to go down the tunnel with them? - A.
   Yes.

Q. The four of you, in fact, were going down? - A. .That
   is correct.

Q. What was it like going down the tunnel? - A. It         j
   wasn't crowded.  There was still a steady stream of
   people walking in an orderly fashion but it did s e e m ;
                                                               107

                                                      R. C. BALL


      to quicken up towards the end of the tunnel.   People
      gained speed towards the end of the tunnel.

Q.     Did you by chance look down the tunnel before you set
      off on to the pitch? - A. I think I did, yes.   I was
      aware halfway down the tunnel of where we were.   I
      could see the goal.

Q.     Could see the players, that is what I am after? - A.
      I am fairly sure there were players on the pitch.

Q. I assume from that reply that you do not know what
   they were doing, whether they were playing the match,
   warming up or what? - A. They were kicking into the
   goal. They were not playing the match.

Q.. They were not playing the match? - A. No.

Q. Did you assume that they had come out in readiness
   for the game? - A. That is right.

Q. When you came to the end of the tunnel, did you turn
   right or left? - A. In most grounds where there is
   that kind of situation where you go straight on to
   the terraces behind a goal there is a gangway at the
   back that you can walk along, either to the right or
   to the left, and it was my intention to walk along
   that gangway to the right, towards the corner flag,
   because we don't normally stand right behind the
   goal. We stand a little bit to the right.   So as we
   came out of the tunnel, I looked around.  I yelled to
   the boys, because there was a lot of noise, "Go
   right". At that point, in fact, one of them did
   stumble and Kester grabbed his collar and probably    j
   saved his life.

Q.    Did they follow your instructions and move to the        f
     ■right? - A. As far as we could but the flow of people    j
      from behind us coming out of the tunnel pushed us
      down more towards the right.  It was impossible to       j
      make a sharp right turn.                                 I

Q. In fact, what you are saying is that even though you
   had not been at the ground you assumed that there
   would be a passageway at the back? - A. That is the
   normal layout in a ground like that.

Q.   You were right, in fact, but what you are saying is
     that you could not make it? - A. I never saw it on
     the day.

Q.   When you first exited, when you first got on to that
     terrace, I realise you were trying to get to the
     corner, what was your impression.of the terracing at
                                                                108

                                                     H-   C.   BAT.T.



    that stage? - A. It was very full.   I didn't want to
    be in there with those boys especially.    It was, I
    would say, at or above capacity from my experience.
    ^      not know at that time that it was an enclosed
    pen.   I thought there would be free movement to the
    right and the left because where there are pens you
    fire normally directed into them in sequence.

 Q. If it is completely empty why do you need a
    passageway at the back?  If it is completely
    undivided, why did you anticipate there would be a
    passageway at the back? - A. What I mean is that
    instead of terracing going right up to the back wall
    there is like a path along the back, a flat area.

 Q. What you are saying is that if there are no dividing
    fences, of course, you do not need that, do you,
    because you can move along at any point? - A. In some
    grounds the terracing does go right up to the wall at
    the back.  It was not until we got swept to the right
    and I saw the radial fence that I realised we were in
    a pen.

Q. At what point did you feel that the match had kicked
   off? - A. It hadn't kicked off at that time.

Q. When did it kick off? Where were you when it kicked
    off? - A. We then got swept down to the left again
    and further down towards the front.   I mean, there
   was nothing you could do about it.   You are trying to
   keep your feet and Craig was in front. Kester was
   next, I was next and then the other friend, Andrew,
   was behind me. Eventually Kester and I ended up          )
   about two or three feet from the fence at the front
   and at that, point I didn't know where the other two
   boys were.   I was facing the wrong way.    I was facing »
   back and somebody told me to turn round and, in fact,
   helped me to turn round and almost immediately the
   pressure became intense so that you were stationary.
   That really worried me because, all right, in.that
   kind of situation if a crowd is moving around it
   should'sort itself out but we just could not move.
   It was about that time I think that the qame kicked
   off.                                      y

Q. When, in fact, it solidified basically? - A. Yes.      I
   had a lot of things on my mind at that time, as I
   recall.

Q. Obviously you were worried about Kester which is
   quite understandable and, in fact, you looked across
   to him at that point, did you not? - A. Yes, for a
   period of about three or four minutes, I mean, we
   were fighting for our lives. At one point I did -look
 across to him. He was about a yard to my left at the
 same level. He seemed to be a little bit taller than
 the people around him and he looked a bit pale but I
 thought he was going to be okay and that I was going
 to die.                                            ^

. I think it was shortly after t h i s t h at you lost
  consciousness, did you not, yourself? - A. I 'nearly
 T os TT consciousness once and I might have lost it for
  a couple of seconds.    Then I forced myself back into
  consciousness.    There were quite a few things
  happened in those two or three minutes where I just
  couldn't breathe.    I wanted to say to Kester, "Stand
  on tiptoe", which is what I was trying to do, but I
  couldn't.    I couldn't breathe let alone talk.     I had
  my left hand actually touching the perimeter fence
  trying to give myself some breathing room but it was
* useless.

 That is because there were people between you and the
 perimeter fence, is that right? - A. Yes, that is
 correct.

 When you were there in that position you have told us
 obviously that you could not even speak, did you hear
 any cries and shouts around you? - A. Yes, it was
 most eerie because I knew the match had started
 because of the noise of the crowd.  You could tell
 from the roars of the crowd but in our area, our
 immediate area, it was silent except for people
 9roaning and people shouting for help and for
 somebody to do something.

Were you anywhere near the gate? Could you see it? -
A. I could fee the gate.     This is one of the things
that went through my mind.     It must have been no more
than about ten feet to my right and it was closed the
first time I saw it and I thought, "Even if they open
        i-s going to take half an hour to get everybody
out through it" and so I discounted it, although I
didjsee^ it open later o n . There were photographers
taking pirc1nM^-s-n^tl^--frDirTKe other side of the’
netting.

At this particular point in time? — A. That is
correct.

Axe you saying the photographers were taking pictures
when the gate was still shut or are you unable to
say?  I know from your statement that you had
difficulty i-n sorting some of the events out in time
sequence and I quite understand that? - A. I believe
from what I have seen of some of the evidence so far
that I must have eventually lost consciousness at
                                                                110

                                                         R. C. BALT,

      about .f ive-past...three because I don 't remember the
      game being stopped . I knew Liverpool""had nearly*''''*
      scored.

 Q. You knew that at the time? - A. I knew that Liverpool
    had nearly scored before I passed^out.

 Q. Did you see people climbing over the fence? Can vou
    recollect that? - A. Yes, I did.  Somebody climbed
    over me. They were crawling across you on top of
    your head and I lost my spectacles. My wrist"watch
    was ripped off and somebody bit a chunk out of my
    shoulder because they must have been in agony or
    something.

 Q. Did you see any Police Officers? - A. I do recall
    seeing a Police Officer walking from my left to my
    right towards the South Stand in a very slow manner,
    almost caricature of a Policeman is how I remember it
    with his arms behind his back. People were shouting
    at him to open to gate or to do something and he was
    just ignoring those cries.

Q. He did not appear to react so far as you could see? -
   A. He did not appear to hear.

Q. Did you see any Officer using a radio? - A. No, I
   didn't.  One thing I did see before I passed out, I
   saw Andrew on the other side of the fence and so I
   knew he must have got out through the gate.  I
   thought Kester was going to be okay but I did not
   know where Craig was and I was most concerned about
   Craig.

Q. He was okayt Craig, was he not? - A. He got out, yes,
   because what happened, I mean, listening to the
   ©vidence today I do not know if people understand but
   in that kind of situation there will be periods of
   pressure on particular parts of the crowd which will
   then ease off and even gaps might appear. A gap
   appeared and Craig was to the left of both me and
   Kester.-■ A gap appeared and he was able to duck under
   a barrier and went back out through the tunnel.

Q. He went out through the tunnel? — A. This was very
   shortly after the match had kicked off.

Q*      fact, you came to when you were already out on the
     pitch. Somebod y was resuscitating you I think and
     slapping-your face'"a S T waler n g y 6 r -ff|,— jiqfit,

               Cross-Examined by MRS. McBRIEN:

Q. Mr. Ball, did you see the Police Officer at the rear
   of the terrace indicating there was an access point
   there when you went down the tunnel on to the
   terrace? Did you see a Police Officer at all? - A. I
   never saw any Police Officers on the terracing..

      THE CORONER:    Mr. Ball, thank you very much indeed.

        Dear Sirs

        RE: KESTER BALL -       DECEASED

        I am in receipt of your comments regarding the summary of evidence in
        relation to the above-named person which were forwarded to us by Mr Fraser
        from the Hillsborough Steering Committee.

        Your comments are noted regarding the question in relation to whether or
        not the wearing of a scalf contributed to Kester Ball's death. This matter
        has been forwarded to H.M. Coroner for his information in order that he may
        address the comments you have raised.

        In relation to paragraph 4 of the summary of evidence, it is accepted that
        there appears to be a conflict of evidence between Police Constable
        Lawrence and the witness, Terence Pitt. Mr Pitt identifies Kester Ball
        from facial photographs taken of the deceased in the temporary mortuary at
        the gymnasium of Hillsborough football stadium. Police Constable Lawrence
        and Mr Pitt do not corroborate each others evidence. Your comments have
        been passed to H.M. Coroner for his information.

        In relation to paragraph 12, photograph reference PO/4, is the photograph
        that was published on the front page of the Times newspaper dated 17 April
        1989.

        Yours faithfully




       K v lope

                     Lister.No fans visible at this time.
            11.05 Arrive at top of Halifax Road and saw that a mini bus            parked at the
                     top of the road and it was our intention to park all Live rpool coaches
                     and mini busses behind this vehicle backing up towards tl.<.e ground,
                     Obviously those arriving first would be furthest from tl e ground but had
                     more time to walk the mile or so to the ground.
            11.40
                     Private vehicles arrived and parked in the side streets 1hey appeared to be
            11.50 mainly families and respectable looking people in good c! ass cars who
                     were asking directions to the ground and how long it woild take to walk
                     ^he odd one or two asked where local public houses were lut not many.
                     Most people had flasks etc and were advised about cans ar d banners not
                     feeing allowed in the ground.
                     There was a steady arrival of fans in private vehicles,mdstly Liverpool
                     supporters until about 1 .15pm when the odd Liverpool coach arrived.
                     PC Baker and PC Marsh (C.1. Police woman) were deputed tc take all the
                      registered numbers of arriving coaches.     ,

                     and the occupants appeared friendly and in good spirits.Ve were asked
                    again on several occassions if public houses were open,tcId them most were
                     and gave directions.
                    Advice also given was about entry being refused to the ground without
                     tickets.
            14.30   Coaches were arriving now one after the other almost but were still being
                    directed and briefed by police before being allowed to «mpty.It was
                    apparent that the mood of the bus occupants was more exc ited but this was
                    probably due to the kick off being only 30 minutes away.£ everal occupants o:
                    these busses were drink beer/lager from cans as they waJked down the stree'

                 and chanting.Some were carrying cans of beer/lager. I saw that there were

                 his personal radio and we thought there was fighting in the ground.
    14.55        Ordered to line up ready for quickly getting to the grounji
                 All these serials went round onto Leppings Lane and lined up awaiting
                 instructions.At this time we could see Police Officers and horses section
                 up near the entrance to the ground.I could not see any su pporters in the
                 area of the entrance to Leppings Lane stand at this time.
                 On route to the match I was at the siie of PC Williamson CCl warrants
                 officer) who had his own radio tuned onto the police chan iel.I heard
                 someone reguest the start to be delayed otherwise there wbuld be a
                 catastrophe.I did not hear any reply and then an instruct Lon to open the
                 gates.Ihis conversation was heard en route to Leppings lane some 5 mins
                 before we were lined up on Leppings Lane outside the shop
   15.10         Ordered into Leppings Lane end.
                 As we went into the ground I saw about 30 or 40 uniformed officers stood
                 around near to the large blue door which were open.We ran through them and
                 went towards the tunnel that led into the Leppings Lane id.As I approached
                  I could see a large amount of people spewing out of the sntrance.They were
                 shouting abuse and the tunnel was full of people most of rfhome appeafed to
                 coming out of the ground.                     ’
                 Most of the officers I saw at this time I recognised as C division
                 personell.
                 It became apparent that there wasn't any fighting and tfcere was a crowd
                 problem at the front of the standing area near to the co:dcret wall and
                 fence.I could see a number of officers climbing the fence and shouting at
                 the crowd to back off buf the crowd were just stood chant ing and swearing
                 and were unwilling to move voluntarily.! I phsically remc ved several men fix
                 from the standing area and pushed them towards the tunnel 1 with instruction
                 to get out.Other officers were doing the same but few pe cjple were leaving
                 of their own volision.
         15.20   I couls see that people were climbing over the fence in crder to escape
                 the crushing caused by people at the back.Supporters in the cantlever stand
                   were spitting on us and shouting abuse. 'Murdering bastsjrds' etc.Tension
                 was at a peak and the hostility towards police officers was something I
                 had not experienced on this scale or intensity before.
         15.25   The crowd had thinned out enough for us to get through tc the front and
                 I saw a pile of people.I grabbed on man and with the assi stance of smother
                 officer who I do not remember I pulled him from the heaj and towards the
                 tunnel exit.It appeared that all the people in the pile (approx 40 or 50
                 were very seriously injured and at the very best unconcic us.Many were
                 purple in the face as was this man.He was limp and not me ving.% were
                 assisted in the tunnel by another officer who I can't ren ember and we carrie
                 him through the crowd most of whom were leaving the leppin,gs lane end.

            As we carried the man a number of ferns shouted abuse at as and when we
            reached the end of the tunnel I could see that all the f ans that had left
            the terracing were still in the ground milling around.AlDt were
            hysterical running about.We placed this man who I now knpw to be
            Martin Kenneth Wild approx 30 years of
                       on the floor.He was purple around the mouth anil his face was
            ashen.I gave him mouth to mouth resusitation and smother officer gave
            him heart massage.I could not see any visible injuries and could not
            feel a pulse in his wrist or neck.I honestly felt that tiis man had been
            dead for some time but we kept trying for at least two minutes.We were
            hampered at times by fans screaming abuse at us but nevertheless we
           kept trying.I could see other people being carried out and it was
           apparent that further assistance was needed in the grounl.I covered WILD
            with my anorak and returned to the terraces.I cannot recillect who t he
           other officer was who assisted me.
           The tunnel was still very busy alot of people were just stood against the
           walls of the tunnel and they were told to get out and mace room for people
           being carried out.I went back into the terracing which was still very full
           and I could see that there were a large number of polic t officers now in
           the front of the terracing near to the fence but they w;re still having
           great diffuiculty in keeping fans back from the body's s :ill on the floor
           at the front.1 pushed through until I got the the people on the floor and
           sgain I grabbed a man and pulled him from the pile assisted by smother
           officer.At no time had I seen any civilian giving assistince to the
           injured.We struggled with this man smd I now know him to be KESTER
           ROGER MARCUS BALL 2.7.72 J
           I cannot remember the officers but two more came to our assistance and we
           carried him through-the fans who were still in the tunnei.1 and placed him
           at the side of Wild.As I approached I could see people s ;ood around Wild
           smd one lifting up my anorak that was covering his face.! asked him if he
           knew him but he didn't.I asked them all to move mback to give us room to
           work smd I knelt over Ball.He was purple siround the fact,his face was
           ashen smd there was blood siround his mouth.I wiped it cL;an smd began
           mouth to mouth.Another officer began hesirt massage,I don
           was,I think most C1 officers had gone onto the pitch stria.I did see
           SC 282 Davis smd remember seeing him csirrying someone dth smother
           officer.I cannot rememvber seeing any serious obvious injury to Ball.
           I thought Ball was dead but we kept trying for two of three minutes.
           I hadn't seen smy senior officers until this time when I
           CH/lnsp who I didn't know I told him there were kO o r %) people piled
           up that looked like they were dead.He didn't reply smd wiilked off towards
           the lsirge blue doors on the ground perimeter.Several people came up
           looking at BelII and Wild but I left my coat covering WiJ.ds face
           I stayed with both men smd a woman who said she was a nurse came up smd
           asked if she could do anything.I told her I thought they were both dead
           smd she felt both men for a pulse and said they both       eared dead,
           An officer came up smd I saw EDC 2o2 Davis and I was       itructea

               to remove the body's to am area outside the main part of the ground
               at the side of the river area that runs at the oack of tie Leppings Lane
               stand.The area was still full of supporters shouting anc swearing and
               obviously very upset and hysterical.lt was difficult to tell if they we re
               under the influence of intoxicants or just hysterical wi th the events
               that they had witnessed prior ta m     our arrival at the ground,
               I requested other officers to assist in removing both miei and they were
               both carried in turn the 40 or 50 yards to am area outsjiide the main gates
               that had been opened.I took my anorak with Wild and plac ed it again over
               his upper body.Both men were placed to gether and as othe r body's arrived
               at this location constables were deputed to form a line between the
               body's and supporters leaving the ground.It was at this time that I saw
                a press man with a green 'PRESS' jacket attempt to take pictures of the
               body's and us and he was punched and kicked by Liverpool supporters,he
               ran off towards Leppings Lane.
  16.10        Someone came with blankets they appeared the type used by ambilances
               smd I covered up BALL and Wild.I think it was about this time that DI
               Webster appeared on the scene with other officers I cam remember seeing
               DC Braden PC Chang \ ^ D I         Webster took control and was in
               possession of plastic uags,exni6it labels string etc

  ifi 16.25    Removed sill articles from both deseased labellled them and placed them
               in plastic bags, here was nothing that would enable idenftification of
               either mam .All possessions placed in plastic bags amd selaled.
               I cannot remember if it was before or after EK that DC Braden was
               deputed to deal with BALL but a Dr arrived at the scene DR M0NHAGHAN
               this was at 1 6 .3 0 hours.He was equipped and , started to examine the bodY's
               which I think numbered 11 at this time.
  16.35        DEATH CERTIFIED ON WILD AND BALL Dr was from the Hallanfehire amd what
               details that could be placed on Gen 18 were, tattoos, full! descriptions
               and clothing.
  F16.45      Ambulances had now been arriving in convoys amd a Dr fro a Liverpool who I
              have since seen on numerous occassions on T.V. was on the scene.I left
              both body's and briefly assisted with casualty's.DC Davi|s did a good job.-
              The Dr was good too examining people amd placing them 11 priority for
              ambulamces,in fairness his comments regarding officers arganising the
              casualty's was pairtly justified. Certainly no senior of! icers were in
              attendence at this time{Told of 74 body's in gym)
  17.05       All the injured had now been transported to hospital and we began
              removing the body's by ambulance from the Leppings Lane t nd .1 went with
              two other uniformed officers who I didn't know and their respective
              body's.I left DC Braden at the scene.I remember being si u ck in traffic
              for some considerable time outside the entrance to the pc lice room
              and gymnasium.Eventually we were let in and ambulance st< f f carried the
              body's into the gymnasium. 17.10 approx...
              The sight in the gym was horrific dozens of body's laid c ut.I was given
              a card to place around the bpdy's ankle.Name collar No ,c1 vision etc.
              And given a number 77...This was thecfirst opportunity I had dad to
              count the cash from the man fend I did so in the presence of a police

At about 1100 hours on Saturday, 15 April
1989, Mr Roger Charles BALL travelled by
private car from St Albans with his son,
Kester Roger Marcus BALL, deceased, and two
other youths with the intention of attending
the F.A. Cup Semi Final football match at
Hillsborough Stadium, Sheffield. Mr BALL had
a West Stand terrace ticket, and his son
purchased a ticket for the same enclosure,
from other supporters during a break in their
journey.

 After parking the car, and walking directly
 to the stadium, they arrived at the Leppings
 Lane entrance at about 1430 hours and joined
 the huge crowd attempting to gain entry. At
 about 1450 hours they entered the stadium via
 Gate C . They entered the tunnel beneath the
 West Stand and were carried by the incoming
  crowd into Pen 3, to a final position two to
  three feet from the perimeter fence,
  immediately behind the goal. Mr BALL saw his
  son was about three feet to the left of him
. at match kick off time. In the severe
\
  crushing that followed Mr BALL lost
; consciousness and did not see his son alive
 Following the severe crushing in the West
 Stand terracing Police Constable 1961 John
 Robert LAWRENCE was in Pen 3 assisting to
 remove casualties.   At about 1525 hours he
 removed a youth he now knows to be Kester
 Roger Marcus BALL from Pen 3 near the
 perimeter fence. With the assistance of
 other officers, who have not been identified,
 he carried Kester BALL through the tunnel to
 the concourse area at the rear of the West
 Stand.

 Police Constable LAWRENCE attempted to
 resuscitate Mr BALL assisted by another
 police officer, who has not been identified,
 but without success. Mr Terrance Steven
 PITT, a spectator, attempted to resuscitate
 MR BALL, again without success. A nurse, who
 has not been identified, examined Mr BALL and
 stated that he was dead. Police Constable
 LAWRENCE moved Mr BALL to a position outside
 Gate C adjacent to the river wall and
 remained with him.

I At about 1635 hours Dr David MONAGHAN
                     minim al


j attended that location, examined Kester BALL
i and certified life extinct. At about the
  same time, Police Constable 2263 Rupert CHANG
  took charge of the deceased, Kester BALL,
  from Police Constable LAWRENCE and escorted
  the body to the temporary mortuary in the

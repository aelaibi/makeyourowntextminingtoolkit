Re:- Sheffield Wednesday P»C.Ltd», Phase II Contract
Due to the period of maintenance, of the above contract, coming to an
end, Messrs. Eastwood; and Partners have made their customary final in-
  ection of all the wc>rk carried out. >
   y have passed   the majorityjpf work, including all our       work, our
remedial work on the Sprion Kop Staircase handrails and South Stand,
and the majority of work carried out by yourselves.
However there are still a ff w; liinor outstanding items which, they stress,
be rectified as soon as
Firstly the Spion KopiGates) le&ctiag onto the pitch, and surrounding
frames are in a poor state |>f (jiecoration. There are several areas where
rust is evident and where ;the |paint has flaked off. Eastwoods suggest
that this has been caused through lack!of priming to the steelwork before
erection and full paint specification..; To rectify this Eastwoods suggest
that these areas   are to be scraped down .to"bright' metal, and given the
full paint treatment as their specification.
Also, the barriers on the West[Stand, are showing similar sighs as
previously described, i.e^ thjeite are several areas where rust is evident.
These areas are to be giyenlth# s&me remedial1treatment as the Spion Kop
Gates and. frames. ;. J r 1
   twood and Partners jstr^sp t&£rt) this jwork must be carried out immediately
  d completed, wijthin the [next geyen days. If this is not done, then we,

Dear Sirs,
          Sheffield Wednesday Football Club Ltd
          Phase II Contract
     Yesterday we made an inspection of the work at
Hillsborough.    Listed below are the items of remedial
work requiring immediate attention.
     a)   West Stand - South Exit
                The rendering applied to the wall which
          was cut to form the exit is cracked and
          spalling.    This render is to be hacked off
          and redone using Reebafill or Nitomortar.
     b)   Spion Kop gates
                Rust is showing through on the new gates
          leading on to the track.    The welds which were
          recently redone have not been painted.
     c)   Painting
                It is evident that much of the steelwork
          was not thoroughly prepared before priming,
          surfaces are pitting, with scale and rust
          showing through.    All such surfaces shall be
          thoroughly scraped and wire brushed down to
          bright metal and given the full paint treatment
          specified.
                                     Yours faithfully,

Dear Sirs,
               Sheffield Wednesday Football Club
                        Phase II Contract
      We have recently inspected the various section? of your work
and given below are the items requiring your prompt attention.

West Stand - North Exit
(a)   Two welds between the door post and straps are incomplete
      and require sealing to prevent corrosion.


(b)   Spion Kop Terracing
             Two gates leading onto the track are difficult to close.
      The first gate from the north binds against the frame, the
      second springs against its frame.     These have been the subject
      of complaint by the Police and the gates should be made to
      close properly with the bolts sliding freely.    All remedial
      work must be complete before the next home game on 13 September



                             Yours faithfully,

          D. I. Vaughan                    (South Yorkshire           County Council - Administration Dept.)

          1.        Purpose of Meeting

          In view of the F.A . Cup Semi-Final at Hillsborough on 12th April and following recent
          visits by the disciplines represented on the Working Party, the Chief Executive of the
          South Yorkshire County Council had raised with the Club by letter dated 31st March various
          m atters which apparently were still outstanding.

          A letter of reply dated 3rd April had been received from the Club, as well as letters dated
          4th and 8th April from the Club's Consultants, M essrs. Eastwood and P a rtn ers, giving
          details of the present position.

          2.______Inspection of Ground

          The Working Party inspected the ground in company with the Club's representatives.

          (i)       Training of Safety Stewards

                    The Club had felt there was little point in pursuing the training of the Safety
                    Stewards until the fire warning system had been completely installed, but with
                    agreement the County Fire Service had instructed some stewards yesterday.
                    A schedule specifying the duties and responsibilities was handed to the Club's
                    representatives.

          (ii)      Exit Signs

                    The Club's representatives felt that the exit signs generally had been sited where
                    required and were of adequate size and/or illuminated.

r                   It was agreed that there were a number which could be more advantageously sited
                    and/or illuminated, and some which might be more effective withlarger lettering

                                                                 1.
          and/or direction arrow s. The County Fire Service undertook to liaise with
          M essrs. Eastwood and P artners.

(iiij     Emergency Lighting in the South Stand

          As was evident, complete re-w iring of the South Stand with separate circuits had
          already commenced, and the County Fire Service undertook to let M essrs. Eastwood
          and P artners know their detailed requirem ents.

(iv)      Fire Warning System                 *

          The Fire Warning System had been installed, except for the trickle charger and
          battery equipment. These items had been subject to delivery problem s, but the
          system should be complete by the end of the month.

          It was agreed that as regards the F.A . Cup Semi-Final, the Police Communications
          base which would be at the ground would also be used for Fire Service purposes if
          necessary.                                                                              %
(v)       Sealing of Fire Resisting Fram es

          The sealing of the fire resisting door fram es against the supporting walls had generally
          been carried out, but there were a small number which were now showing signs of
          sm all gaps.

(vi)      Fire Retardent Paint

          The Club pointed out that "Nullifire" fire retardent paint had been specified on the
          partitions within the South Stand but, as the Contractors were on holiday until
          14th April, it was not possible to say with certainty at this time whether it had actually
          been used.

(vii)     Wired Glass

          The Club pointed out that to the best of their knowledge wired glass had been used      W
          wherever required by the County Fire Service.

          The County Fire Service and the Police were generally satisfied that the small panes
          of glass in the upper half of the wooden partitions within the South Stand would not in
          normal circumstances be regarded as a fire and/or safety hazard. The Club agreed in
          the longer term to consider the fitting of wired glass and, in the short term , to
          consider fitting wooden battons as an interim m easure.

 (viii)   Sharp Edges to Steelwork on South-West Stand

          Whilst there were a number of sharp corners on the supports, these were at a height
          of at least seven feet. However, the Club undertook to round them off*

 (ix)     Perim eter Fencing on the Spion Kop

           The Club pointed out that this had been tested where feasible and the results forwarded
           to the Chief Executive in January. A copy had been passed to the Building Authority on
           30th January.
                                                  2.
(x)    Possible Step Obstruction on Upper Exit Area on Spion Kop

       Whilst it was agreed that the erection of the b a rrie rs at the Upper Exit Area had l e f t
       a sm all adjacent area of approximately one foot wide by four foot long at a lower l e v e l
       than the rem ainder of the exit, it was felt that its position coupled with the crowd
       flow at that point meant that it did not unduly create an hazard. However, the Club
       undertook to give attention to it in the longer term .

(xi)   Mesh Fencing under North Stand

       In view of the normal crowd f l o w rates on t h e public side of the mesh fencing and the
       fact that there was no public access to its re a r , it was felt that the timber f r a m e d
       mesh fencing under the North Stand providing security to storage areas was acceptable.

Dear Eric,
                 Certificate of Safety 1980
     The crush barriers which recently failed the test were
retested yesterday and I am now in a position to sign a
certificate concerning all 39 of this year's batch.   I spoke
to David Vaughan yesterday and he requested that before I issue
my certificate there should be a joint inspection with Mr.
of the Town Hall.   As Mr.         is on holiday this week it appears
that we cannot complete the formalities for another week or so.

The Secretary,                                            July 1980
Sheffield Wednesday Football Club Ltd.,

Dear Eric,
        Renewal of Certificate of Ground Safety - July 1980
   Last week we tested a block of 39 crush barriers in the lower
part of Spion Kop representing approximately one fifth of those
in the ground as required by the South Yorkshire County Council.
During the course of the testing three or four of the barriers
suffered fractures of one of the posts and about six others
displayed some distress.     It was interesting that in just about
every case the insipient failure only became apparent during the
second five minute period of applying the load.      You will recall
that the 'green' book Code of Practice requires the load to be
applied twice for five minutes and in any case where the recovery
of deflection is less than the specified value, the load has to be
applied a third time.      Thus, including testing which took place
last year all the barriers have had the load applied for four
5 minute periods and some for five or six such periods.      It seems
that there is a fatigue effect which, when superimposed on the
loss of strength which is bound to occur due to rusting, is going
to produce a crop of failures each year.
   Bearing in mind that you will want to have the ground ship shape
as soon as possible in the season I spoke to Mr.          and
obtained his approval to spend up to £1000 on remedial works to
the nine barriers which failed to pass the test.      John Strange is
                                                               )
trying to obtain a fixed price tender for the work so that it
will not be an open ended commitment and assuming he has a
contractor selected we shall be starting work before the end
of this week.
   I also sent to you at the beginning of last week a copy of
a letter from South Yorkshire County Council saying that
they would require an Institution of Electrical Engineers
certificate regarding the whole of the electrical installation
in the ground.    We have carried out full checks on the North
stand and West stand installation which is still in a satisfactory
condition.    The emergency lighting system andthe South stand
wiring have just been renewed, but one or two extraneous
items such as the wiring to title turnstile area at Leppings
Lane are very old and have failed the test.      I therefore
asked Mr.             s approval to spend up to £1000 on putting
the remaining matters right so that a certificate cam be issued
for the whole ground without difficulty.      As he pointed out,
if the work needs doing in the near future, it is better to
do it now so that you will probably receive a grant towards
the cost.
   This extra electrical work should be completed within-the
next few days.
   I am sending a copy of this note to Mr. Sheppa.rd and the
Chairman.


                                     Jfours sincerely,

    Dear Sirs,

    Safety of Sports Grounds Act, 1975 -
    Sheffield Wednesday Football Club Limited

    I thank you for your letter dated 15th July.

    After consultations with the Building Authority and in view of the fact
    that all of the barriers were tested prior to certification, the County
    Council is able to agree this year with the course of action which you
    propose.  However, I would stress that this agreement is conditional
    upon it being recognised and accepted that it is without prejudice as
    to what may be required in future years under the provisions of paragraph
    25(2) of the Safety Certificate.

    May I also mention the Certificates by:-

    (a)     a suitably qualified Chartered Engineer (as required by
             paragraph 24 of the Safety Certificate) as to all structural
             parts of the Stadium, excluding crush barriers and handrails;

    (b)     an independent Electrical Engineer (as required by paragraph
             26 of the Safety Certificate) as to the electrical installation
             within the Stadium; and

    (e)     an independent Electrical Engineer (as required by paragraph
             12(2) of the Safety Certificate) as to the condition of the
             Emergency Power Supply.

    I take it that if the Club has not already done so, they will shortly be
    requesting you to supply these.

                                                           Yours faithfully,

For the attention of Mr.D. Vaughan


Dear Mr. Vaughan,
            Sheffield Wednesday Football Club Ltd.
      I       believe that the County Council wish to have one fifth
of the crush barriers tested each year so that they will all be
tested during each five year cycle.    The first batch were
to be tested approximately seven months from the date of issue
of the certificate of ground safety.
      The Club has therefore asked us to carry out this years
quota of tests and it is our intention to carry out the work
commencing on Monday, 21 July.    There are approximately 185
barriers in total and it would be possible to either test barriers
1, 6, 11 etc. or Nos. 1 - 37.approximately.    It would be very
much easier and quicker to test one block of 37 barriers rather
than testing every fifth barrier throughout the ground because
the testing equipment is very heavy and requires a considerable
amount of man handling.   There should be a considerable saving in
cost if all the barriers tested are in one block.
     We have discussed the matter with Mr.                of the
Sheffield Building Surveyors department and he sees no objection
to us taking the easier and therefore cheaper course.       Unless we
hear from you to the contrary this is what we will do.
       Two copies of our report will be sent to you shortly
after the testing is complete so that you can then forward
one to the Building Surveyors department.


                               . Yours sincerely,




c.c.   Mr. E. England

      Today we inspected the various sect Iona of work which
had been previously noted as requiring your atteat ion,
      It appears that very little effort has been applied
to VMtlfjr the faults and the Mjoritjr of the work remains
undone.
      The site welding generally is   very poor and requires
your lamedlate attention. Reaedial    work is to start no
later tiua Wednesday IS July and Is   to he conploted, to oar
satisfaction within 10 days of this   date.

Dear Sirs,

    Las t Friday we inspected the various sections of work -m iz.k
which had been previously noted in our letters dated 28 January

see that not all the items listed had been completed.
      Enclosed is a revised list of items requiring remedial
work. Would you please return to site immediately to complete
the outstanding work.
      A copy of the list has been forwarded to Peter Ward

               West Terracing
               a) One small section of Reebafill has come away from the
  terrace adjacent to barrier 127.
               This repair is to be redone.

               b) The render on the threshold of the first gate from the
  south stand has lifted and is spalling.                                                  The area is to be
  broken out and repaired with Reebafill or Nitomortar.


               West Stand - North Exit
               a) Shrinkage cracks are still visible at the north end
  of this exit.                      They are most noticeable on the corner of the
  upstand against the original wall and slab.
               An appropriate epoxy rein grout and/or mortar would
  probably be considered suitable.

               b) The straps fixing the door post to the concrete wall
  have not been painted.

               c) There are incomplete welds and welds missing on the
  underside of the handrails.


               West Stand - South Exit
               a) The rendering applied to the parapet wall has cracked.
  This is to be hacked off and redone using Reebafill or Nitamortar.

               b) The rendering on the underside of the cantilever slab,
   at the north end has cracked.                                              This is to be replaced with new.

                c) The RHS section above the gate has not been properly                -p
          sealed.

                d) Some of the welds, especially on the underside of
          handrails and handrail brackets are poor,     They are cold lapped
          incomplete, bulbous and/or have not been cleaned off.     These                   p.w
          welds are unacceptable and are to be removed completely and redone
          to our satisfaction.


                Spion Kop Terracing
                a) Several sections of new terracing remain unacceptable.
          The section behind the goal and the first section to the right
          (looking from the pitch) are acceptable.     The remainder has
          nosings out of line, risers that are not vertical and uneven
          treads.    Same of the steps have been grout washed and this is
          spalling off in places.
                All such sections are to be removed and recast.

                b) The rendering on the upstands and walls round the tunnel
          at the north side has cracked and is spalling away.     This is to
          be hacked off and redone.

                c) The first gate from the north end is binding on the frame
          and is difficult to close.    The top of the perimeter wall has not
          been made good.

                d) The second gate from the north end is springing against
          the frame and is also difficult to close.     The render applied
          to the top of the wall is poor and is to be made good.

                e) Same of the repairs done on the steps in the gangways
          have cracked and in one case come away from the parent concrete.

                a)          The welding on the handrails is appalling.     It is
          difficult to find a weld that is not either undercut, porous,
          uneven profiled, bulbous, cold lapped, incomplete, not cleaned
                                                                                            ?.w   ,

  be removed and redone to our satisfaction.

        b)          The painting is -extremely poor.   We suspect that the metal
 was not properly cleaned before priming and cleaning was omitted
  before applying subsequent coats. The whole of the steelwork is to
  be thoroughly cleaned down to bright metal and repainted in accord­
  ance with the Specification.

  are undercut, porous, uneven profiled, bulbous, cold lapped anqlj
  incomplete.    Many of the plates are scarred with spatter from
  th§ welding.     Where remedial work has been attempted the result
  is often worse than that existing originally.        All defective     | ?

        Painting
        When all remedial work has been completed, checked and
  accepted the damaged paintwork is to be made good.        The steelwork
  is to be thoroughly prepared and cleaned down to bright fnetal and
  primed before the final coats are applied.
        The full paint specification must be applied and every
  care taken to cover all misses and blemishes.        The complete piece
  is to be given the the final gloss to prevent any resulting colour
  flash over the surface.
        Every precaution is to be taken so that the recently
  decorated walls are not marked or spoiled.

Dear Eric,
     On each of the last two Fridays we have held meetings
with Hallamshire Builders Limited to discuss their final account.
Although presented rather late in the proceedings they did
furnish sufficient evidence to warrant reconsideration of several
items which they had not made clear in previous submissions.       The
figure in dispute, before discussions with them bagan, was in the
region of £4,000.     We settled for a sum of just over £700, which
we believe to be fair.
     As part of the negotiations we discussed the cost of
the work done by Peter Ward Engineering.     This was agreed by
Hallamshire Builders Ltd, on their behalf as a duty of the Main
Contractor.   Theee was some difficulty here because we have never
received formal or proper documentation from               to substantiate
his claims.   We therefore had to make the fairest assessment of the
value and rates for his additional work.     It may be that he will
object strongly to our valuation of his work in which case we might
have to reconsider.     However, in this case the amount in dispute
would be no more than a couple of hundred pounds and his case for
pressing further payment is very weak.
     He has had our letter informing him of the settlement for
several days now and we have not heard from him.
     The situation with Hallamshire Builders Ltd., including
Peter Ward's work, is that we have agreed on a final account
figure of £51,017.33.     A certificate for the payment of an
additional £714.68 has been forwarded to them.     The original
is enclosed.
    We have requested that they submit a statement of their
total final account to you when presenting the copy certificate.
     You will recall that on 30 January we forecast the probable
total cost to be £126,084 and in my meeting with board members
on 28 Febnuary I was able to say that we expected the sum of
the final accounts would probably be between £2,000 and £3,000
below that figure.      Attached is a revised summary of the cost
of the works which indicates the likely total to be £12 3,579
so we are on target.      There is one outstanding account to be
received and settled, the one from Messrs. Bradwell Electrical
for the work in connection with the fire alarm and public address
systems.    The figure included in the summary is an estimate
of Bradwell's final account for this work which we think will be
accurate.

                                        Yours sincerely,

Dear Sirs,

              Sheffield Wednesday Football Club Ltd
                New Crush Barriers and Handrails

    Yesterday we made an inspection of your work, prior to
issuing the Final certificate.    We were suprised to see that
a considerable amount of the work listed in our letter dated
20 August 1979 has not been done.
    It appears that very few of bases on Spion Kop and west
terracing have been attended to, item (b), and not all the
grout and concrete splashes have been cleaned off the posts
the posts and angles.
    In places, the haunch around the base of the posts has
cracked and is spalling away.    We suspect that these haunches
were not formed monolithically with the base, hence the
cracking.
    Items (d) SI and 3 still need to be done and the base plate
on barrier 135 requires painting.    The paint on several raking
angles in the north-west corner requires touching up.
    Would you please attend to the above work and write to us
when it is finished.    The Final Certificate will not be issued
until the work is completed to our satisfaction.

                                                Yours faithfully.

      As I expected Hallamshire Builders are dia-aatisfied with
our assessment of their final account and have asked for a
meeting. This has been arranged for Friday 27 June. Should they
be able to produce evidence that we have     been unfair wemay have
to issue a further certificate.

Dear Eric,

      The attached letter regarding Hallamshire Builders account
was written for me$by John Strange.     As you may quess we have
been rather cross with them, not^for delays in carrying out
work on defects, but also for failure to submit a properly
drawn up final account.
      We have invoked     the clause in the contract which permits
us to decide what their account should be.     We have been a
little tough so that the figure on the certificate is almost
      less than I had in mind when we had the meeting at the
end of February.   This may well produce a reaction, and as in
the end they have to be dealt with reasonably fairly we may
have to give a little more.
      Sandall Woffindin*s account should be settled in the next
two or three days and I will then let you have a grand summary.
However, you will recall that the estimate I had given on
30 January of £           for all the work authorised up to that
time, was reduced by the time we met on 28 February to about
S        ind that figure I expect will be very slightly underspent



                                         Yours sincerely,

Dear Eric,
                  Final Contract Figures
     Despite letters and telephone demands we have not received a
final account from Hallamshire Builders Ltd.     Under the terms of
the Contract they are required to submit their statement within
three months of the date of the Certificate of Substantial Completion,
11 February 1980.     We have therefore exercised our right as the
Engineer and made our own calculation of the final account figure.
This is fi|
     A certificate for the payment of £           has been forwarded
to Hallamshire Builders Ltd.     The original is enclosed.   A copy of
the certificate together with their statement will again be presented
to you by Messrs. Hallamshire Builders.
     A final account has been received from Sandall Woffindin Limited
for the sum of £              This has been assessed and our comments
given to them.     John Strange is meeting them later this week to agree
a final figure.     We expect settlement to be made at approximately
£|        Sandall Woffindin's account includes most of the additional
work, relevant to their Contract, requested by the S.Y.C.C. working
party during the inspection on 10 April but we do expect to receive
a further invoice for the larger "Exit" signs.
     There remains outstanding a few other minor items requested by
S.Y.C.C. at that same inspection which are more appropriate to the
Contract with Hallamshire Builders e.g. the step obstruction at the
top of the ramp from Spion Kop, a small repair to a beam in the
south stand, etc.
     You may feel that this work could be done by your ground staff
but as Hallamshire Builders have to return to the stadium to tidy
up a few things it may be wiser to let them do all the work in Hite
final operation.
     I will ring you later this week to obtain your reaction to
this suggestion but in the meantime we will pressure Hallamshire
Builders and Peter Ward to complete their maintenance work.



                                    Yours sincerely,

For the attention of Mr.


Dear Ur.

                       Sheffield Wednesday Football Club Ltd.

      Please accept our apologies for not commenting sooner on
your final account but we have been under such pressure recently
that, after receiving the account and then reporting to the Employer,
it had to be put on one side.
      However, we have now considered the contents and write
to make the following comments.     We will continue with your numbering
system for easy reference.

7)    We were rather suprised to see the addition of        when we    oK
had been lead to believe,    in your letter dated 6 September 1979,
that the cost of items 4-7 inclusive would be between
Can you justify this increase?    Our records do not contain any
instructions given by us for additional work.

9d)   We disagree with the addition of £55.58 for the furniture on
these two doors.   It is acknowledged that the furniture was omitted
from the schedule but there was an item billed on page 45 for the
doors and furniture.    Compare the rates given againit say, item 43/9,

     91)   We find it difficult to accept that the additional cost
     of the variations to the ironmongery amounts to £97.75.     Have
     you taken into account the omission of the panic latches, the
     reduction in cost of the pressed steel hinges and re-use of the
     existing furniture?

     9k)   We consider the cost of forming the boxings for the ventilators
     unreasonable.   This work would have been much simpler If the initial
     joinery had been done when instructed, before fixing the plasterboard.
     We would expect the cost to be in the region of £

     9n)   We do not understand this addition.    The quantity was doubled
     in your tender documents.     See our letter dated 16 August 1979, item 9.

     9p)   Can the addition of £         be justified for the brickwork
     and sealing the reveals alone?    This cost appears rather excessive
     for the amount of work done.

           An early reply or meeting would be welcomed.     Immediately
     after agreement we will issue a penultimate certificate.     The Final
     Certificate due towards the end of November 1980 will release the
     retention money.

For the attention of Mr.


Dear Mr.

             Sheffield Wednesday Football Club Ltd.

     We have noticed that the 'Exit' signs fixed in the
North and South Stands have 4” high letters and not 5”
as specified.    These will require replacing.

     However we have recently received comments from the
South Yorkshire County Fire Service about the signs in
general and we have agreed to Mike the alterations shown
on our A4 size drawings 1610/61 and 62.   Two copies of
these drawings are enclosed together with a copy of our
drawings 1610/8E, 23C and 41D showing the location of
the signs.


                               Yours sincerely,

For the attention of Mr.


Dear Mr.             ,

                Sheffield Wednesday Football Club Ltd.

      Some doubt has been cast that "Nullifire" intumescent
paint was used on the partitions II to 15 in the South Stand.
      Apparently one of the local building inspectors, visiting
the ground, repotted that he saw one of your workmen applying paint
onto these partitions from a "Dulux" tin.   Would you be kind enough

Dear Eric,
                    Final Contract Figures
     We still have some details to clear up with Hallamshire
Builders and Sandall & Woffindin.    I have been chasing them
this week for further information to substantiate some
aspects of their accounts before finally agreeing their account.
     However, we have had confirmation from Tarmac of their
account - copy enclosed.    You will recall that in my letter
of 30 January I predicted a settlement at about
The actual figure is £             The difference is part of
the saving on my January estimate, which I indicated when I
met members of the Board.
     I hope to write to you again on the other accounts shortly.


                                    Yours sincerely,

Sheffield. SI 4GS


Dear Sirs,
             Sheffield Wednesday Football Club Ltd.,
             Phase II Contract
     Please find enclosed a copy of the items of remedial work for
the South Stand.
     After the meeting on site last week we write to express our
doubts that the treatment given to the precast step units
in the North Stand will be successful.   We will inspect these units
again later in the maintenance period and if they show signs of
deterioration then we shall insist that they be roplaced with new.
     Grinding the terracing on Spion Kop may improve the finish but
will not overcome the defects resulting from the snutterers moving
or being out-of-line with the existing steps.   We can see no
alternative but to break out these defective areas and recast them.
     The remedial welding on the Spion Kop staircase is not accepted.
It also appears that the handrail was not properly prepared or primed
before being painted.   This is to be rectified by thoroughly
wirebrushing the handrail down to bright metal followed by priming
and the application of the full paint specification.
     Certain lengths of the Reebafill repairs on the West Terrace are
still not acceptable.   These are to receive further attention.
                                   Yours faithfully,
EASTWOOD & PARTNERS                                                                                       BOWMAKER HOUSE

                   Gangway N o . 1
                   The columns supporting the brickwork are not properly
     bedded on mortar.                              Two nuts in the centre connection have not
     been tightened.


                   Gangway No . 2
                   There is a gap between column type 2, above the exit

EASTWOOD & PARTNERS




         Gangway N o . 5
         The handrail connections at the top of column type 2 have
   not been given the full application of paint.


         Gangway N o . 9
         The handrail/column connection has not been given the
   full application of paint.     The welds on the lower handrail
   bracket have uneven contours, are bulbous or have not been
   cleaned.


         Gangway N o . 10
         There is a gap between column type 2 and the brick wall.
   The nuts in the centre connection have not been tightened.


         Gangway No. 11
         The column supporting the brickwork has not been properly
   bedded on mortar.


         Gangway No. 12
         Several nuts on the supporting columns have not been
   tightened.


         Exit No. 1 (West end)
         a) The Nitomortar? round the posts on the bottom flight
   requires making good to give a neat edge to the step.

         b) The column, located in the turnstile cubicle, has not
   been properly fastened down.

         c) Several of the welds between the handrails and posts
   have uneven contours and are incomplete.


         Exit No. 2 (East end)
         a) Several nuts on the supporting columns have not been
   tightened.

         b) The holding down bolts in the column in the "gymnasium"
   do not project through the nut.
                                                                     SHEET   3


EASTWOOD & PARTNERS




            c)          The welds between the handrail and posts, and the
   column and the handrail mounting plate, have uneven contours,
   are incomplete, and have not been cleaned.


            Exit adjacent to Gangway No. 6
            The first post on the first half landing, walking up, has
   a sloping top.        The handrail at this point is horizantal.    Please
   rectify to give a neat appearance.


            Seated Area
            a) Two of the new barriers at the foot on the gangway have
   not been installed onto the timber barrier rail.

            b) One of the new barriers has been fitted with an odd
   screw.        Please remove this screw and replace with one to match
   the remainder.

            c) The preparation and painting is generally poor.       The
   barriers are to be rubbed down to a smooth finish and repainted.


            General Painting
            When all remedial work has been completed, checked and
   accepted the damaged paintwork is to be made good.        The steelwork
   is to be thoroughly prepared and primed before the final coats
   are applied.
            The full paint specification must be applied and every care
   taken to cover all misses and blemishes.        The complete piece is
   to be given the final gloss to prevent any resulting colour flash
   over the surface.
            The above remarks on painting apply to all the steelwork
   and handrailing in the Contract.

          The dates you suggested for a meeting

          in the evening are not convenient.

          Mr. England suggested Thursday, 28

          February.    I explained that you had

             Dear

             CERTIFICATE OF GROUND SAFETY
             FINANCIAL STATEMENT

             Your letter as detailed above and dated the 30th January
             1980 was before the Board at our last meeting.

             It was discussed at some considerable length, particularly
             in view of the overspend of some j       against the
             original budget figure of

             This differential from budget to actual is explained
             clearly in your letter, however, a number of my
             colleagues expressed surprise at the considerable
             increase in your company*s fees from the original
             figures that had been talked about in our earlier
             discussions.

             My Directors are of the opinion that during the
             numerous negotiations that you have undertaken on our
             behalf and extra work by your staff, some mention of
             this additional cost should have been brought to the
             notice of the Club.

           Two of my Directaors, Mr. S.L. Speight and Mr. C.
           Woodward would like the opportunity of discussing
           this matter with you, and I shall be pleased if you
           could inform me of a suitable date.

           Yours sincerely,



           Chairman.
                    Contact Eric at Hillsborough so that he can make the arrangements.

I.     Purpose of Meeting

The original Intention of the visit had been to check that the outstanding m atters
referred to In the Note of the meeting held on 12th November had been completed
o r were In the course of completion p rio r to the anticipated Issue of the Certificate
by the County Council this week.

2.     Minor M atters

An Inspection of the ground showed that a number of minor m atters still required
attention, but the Club undertook to ensure that these were attended to in the ne xt
few days.

 3.    Major Matters

A.     Emergency Lighting - South Stand

 The meetings which had taken place between the County Fire Service and M essrs.
 Eastwood and P artners since 12th November on the South Stand Emergency Lighting
 had produced agreement on an Interim arrange me it which would be regarded as
                                                  /
                                                                                               4




acceptable for the duration of the existing battery life. Further modifications at
that ttme would remedy the shortcomings of the existing installation. Details were
contained In the letter dated 12th December which M essrs. Eastwood and P artners
had addressed to the F ire Service.

B.     South Stand Construction

The Building Authority expressed concern as to what they saw as a lack of structural
Integrity In the South Stand. In their opinion, corrosion was contributing to the
progressive deterioration of the Stand which, It was felt, could only be properly
determined by a M l structural survey. The report forwarded by M essrs. Eastwood
and P artn ers In the la st week was not considered to be sufficiently comprehensive
to provide the required Information, and the basis of calculation used could not be
agreed as appropriate. Whilst It was agreed that there had not been a specific
written request for such a full structural survey of the South Stand, the Building
Authority felt that It had been Inherent In the detailed discussions which had taken
place that such a report would be forthcoming. The Building Authority were                 \
concerned at the possibility that the requirem ents of the Building Regulations and
the Code of Practice Safety Factors could not be met; In p articular the Structural
stability of the South Stand In conditions of gale force winds and heavy snowfall
 was mentioned.

 For the Club, D r. Eastwood agreed that the Stand would obviously not be built to the
 same specification o r the same construction standards nowadays, but pointed out
 that, for Ins tan ce, none of the buildings In Sheffield built before 1970 could meet
 the latest wind pressu re requirem ents. Even the Building Besearch Station was \ »*«,
 evidently thinking In term s that these requirem ents were unreallstlcally high. In ^
 his professional opinion, the Stand was structurally safe and able In practice to meet
 the loadings demanded. In any case, the conditions which had been described as
 being possibly dangerous would mean In practice that a match could not be played
 and consequently no spectators would be present.

 Experience of the corrosion of Indoors steel In the Sheffield area showed this to be
 minimal, and the Stand was regularly test loaded by spectators. Structures such
 as this would show obvious external signs, such as cracks, well before there was
 any possibility of collapse, and would be readily apparent on even a superficial
 visual Inspection. Even though he did not consider It essential, plating of the
 front steel columns had been carried out as a compromise to try and m eet the
 Building Authority's concern. He agreed there might well be a continuing
 maintenance problem with the stand, but this was a different m atter to saying there
 was a structural problem . Beference was made to the Guide's advice that when
 assessing whether existing situations provided adequately for the safety of spectators,
 the criterion to be used Is that of a reasonable degree of safety. In Dr. Eastwood's
 view, It would be unreasonable and unnecessary to Insist ton a full structural survey
 of the South Stand o r to delay the Issue of the Certificate. It was his professional
 opinion (which he was m ost jealous of and would not put In jeopardy) that the South
 Stand was structurally safe and that the basis of the calculations provided was
 appropriate. He was prepared to advise the Club to use the appeal procedure open
 to them should this be necessary.


                                       2.
                                                                                     i
IT WAS AGREED that:       <

(a)   as there was no obvious deterioration in the South Stand structure of such
      a nature as to be of immediate concern, no objection would be raised to the
      continuance of the derby game with Sheffield United on Boxing Day morning
      provided that no extreme weather conditions occurred In the intervening
      period, and

(b)     a fui'flier meeting should be held as a m atter of urgency between the Building
        Authority and Dr. W. Eastwood to discuss the structural Integrity of the
       South Stand and the appropriateness of the calculations used (Mr. D. Vaughan
       to be present a t Dr. Eastwood's request).

NOTE As the discussions on the South Stand Construction hinged on structural
     theories and practices, the F ire Service and Police representatives felt
     there was little they could contribute and left the meeting p rio r to its
     term ination.

1.    Scope and Objectives of Discussions

M r. H. E. McGee welcomed the representatives, and stressed that the Club were
ambitious and wanted to make the Stadium the best in Europe, Crowds had been
averaging 11,000 this season and, viewed purely as a football operation, the Club
had been losing money since 1967. Com m ercial ventures had made the Club
viable, and it was hoped to expand this side of the Club's activities. The Club's
eventual ambitions obviously had to be tem pered by practical considerations.

IT WAS AGREED -

1.    That, whilst Designating O rders did not specify time lim its for the issue of
General Safety C ertificates, it was essential to aim for the Certificate to be issued
by the sta rt of the 1979/80 Season.
                                  2.    That, a s the Club wanted to a ttra c t representative gam es, the aim should
                                  be for the Stadium to be certificated for maximum crowds.

                                  3.    That as much work a s possible should be carried out In the close season,
                                  bearing In mind that because of the recent continuous spell of bad weather, this
                                  will be m ore re stric te d than usual. The Annual Jehovah’s Witness Bally had
                                  also to be borne In mind.

                                  2.    Discussion on Standing A reas

                                  A.    Salon Kop

                                  IT WAS AGBEED -

o*-                                     That the siting and angle of the new b a rrie rs to be installed be the subject
                            •     of detailed discussions between D r. Eastwood and the Building Surveyor.

 Dear Mr. England,
                                      Certificate of Ground Safety, 1979
                          Test on Crush Barriers,                             Balustrades and Fences
                We have pleasure in presenting a formal report drawing
 together the results of all the load tests on crush barriers,
 fences etc. which were carried out between June and December
 1979.


 Crush Barriers
                The first series of tests were made on all the barriers
 existing at the time of the application for a safety certificate.
These are shown on the attached prints of drawings Nos. 1610/61 and
 62.            The barrier numbers used in the following descriptions of
 the tests are as shown on these two drawings.


 (a)            A total of 19 barriers failed to carry the specified test
                load of 6 kN/m length when first tested.                                            Seven of these
                failures (Nos. 40, 41, 42, 57, 58, 62 and 68) were caused
                by defective retaining clips on the horizontal rails.
                Seven failed because the horizontal rail suffered permanent
                deformation (Nos. 34, 87, 91, 92, 93, 97 and 98) and five
                failed because of bending of vertical posts (Nos. 4, 18,


                                                       Registered in England - No. 1134531
                                                                 SHEET   2 .

        19, 37 and 38).
             During the course of the testing careful inspection
        was made of each barrier and it was found that, although
        they passed the test, a number of barriers had minor
        defects mainly due to corrosion.     A total of 32 new clips,
        eight new rails and five new posts were fitted in addition
        to strengthening of those barriers which failed the test.
        All protruding or sharp edges were removed.
             One further barrier was modified because it was initially
        significantly lower than the minimum height recommended in the
        green Code of Practice.
             Following construction of the new additional barriers on
        Spion Kop and the completion of repairs to the old barriers
        a second series of tests was made.    All the new barriers
        and all the repaired barriers now passed the test.


  (k)   Leppings Lane
             In the first series of tests six barriers (Nos. 104,
        105, 106, 107, 110 and 123) had failures of the tube
        retaining clips.    Five barriers (Nos. 107, 114, 115, 121 and 130)
        suffered permanent deformation of the horizontal rail.
             All these barriers were repaired.    In addition 13 new
        clips and five rails which were badly corroded were replaced,
        and any protruding or sharp edges removed.
             After construction of the new barriers, they and all
        the repaired barriers were tested and all withstood the
        test load satisfactorily.


        North West Corner
             The initial testing of the first few barriers in this
        corner showed that all of them were only capable of taking
        about half the test load.    The rails deflected excessively
        and the holding down bolts were also inadequate.
                                                                   SHEET



EASTWOOD & PARTNERS




              Major strengthening in the form of extra posts to
       shorten the span of the rails and to share the load with
       the existing posts were installed.      A new type of holding
       down arrangement was devised.
              When re-tested all existing barriers plus all the
       new barriers successfully withstood the specified load.

 The Safety Cage
       When the first series of tests were made on the crush
 barriers it was found that the safety cage along both ends of
 the ground had defective supports.      It was found that certain
 holding down bolts had not been fixed when the fence was
 installed.    There was also a need for support from the
 concrete perimeter wall in some places.      After appropriate
 remedial work the fence was successfully test loaded in 4m sections
 along both ends of the ground using the normal crush barrier
 loading of 6 kN/m length.


 Boundary Fences
       Concern had been felt for the boundary fence along the
 edge of the ramp from Spion Kop.      Any failure of this fence
 as the crowd leaves the ground could result in people being
 spilled down a steep bank.     The whole length of this fence
 from the score board down to the bottom was therefore tested
using the lateral force specified in the green Code of 2.74 kN/m.
 The whole length carried the load satisfactorily.
       The continuation of this fence round to the north-east
 corner of the pitch, plus the two lines of fence which protect
 the island of spectators to the west of the tunnel were also
 appropriately tested (the lengths marked in red on the attached
 print of drawing 1610/11).    All the sections successfully
 carried the test load without signs of distress.
       It was also found to be possible to test load five sections
 of the boundary fence round the top of Spion Kop as shown by the
 short red lines.     The load applied was again that appropriate to
EASTWOOD 8- PARTNERS




  the lateral force on exit routes.      Again the load was
  satisfactorily resisted.


  South Stand   Balustrade
        The final testing was on the south stand     balustrade.
 At the foot of every gangway a length of 2m was subjected
  to the same test load as crush barriers i.e. 6 kN/m length.
  In every case this load was resisted without distress.
        In between the gangways, the     balustrade was subjected
  to a test load of 3 kN/m length applied to the whole span
 between successive pairs of supports.       Again the load was
  everywhere satisfactorily resisted.


 Future Numbering of Crush Barriers
        Many of the barriers have been lengthened and also
 additional barriers have been installed.       It is obviously
  inappropriate to continue with the old numbering system.
 We therefore include prints of two new drawings 1610/6 3 and 64 which
  show a new numbering system for Spion Kop and the whole of the
 west end of the ground.     It is proposed that these numbers
 will be used in all future reports.


                                      Yours sincerely,

                                                28 January 1980



                 Sheffield Wednesday Football Club Ltd

                        Phase II Contract


a)   North Stand
           Refering to our letter dated 14 August it is evident
     that the rubbing down, rendering and grinding carried out
     to the precast units has been unsuccessful.
           33 of the new precast step units are damaged.     We
     suspect that the reason for this is the absence of the
     10 mm radius arrlse specified on the drawings.      3 units
     require repointing.
           All 33 damaged units are to be removed and replaced
     with new.     Attached is a schedule showing the location of
     the damaged units.


b)   West Terracing
     1)   The areas repaired with Reebafill are still below the
          standard specified and expected.    The finished lines
          and levels are to match those of the adjacent terrace
          steps.   The unacceptable areas have been marked with
          yellow crayon.   These sections are to be broken out
          and treated again.
     2)   The new steps cast at the North end of the terrace,
          under the stand, have a very poor surface finish.   It
          appears that th<* flight of steps has been grout washed
          and this is beginning to spall off.    Would you please
          forward, for our consideration, your proposals for
          improving the finish.
     3)   Che of the   concrete landings cast in front of the
          new exist       through the perimeterfence is qradtel . All t t e e landirg3 have
          not been fully compacted.           These are to be broken out
          eRd recast in accordance with the Specification.
     4)   The rendering applied to the perimeter wall adjacent to
          the above mentioned exits exhibitsshrinkage cracking.
          All such rendering is to be removed and done again
          using "Reebafill" or "Nitomortar".


C)    West Stand - North Exit
      1) The thin skin of concrete grout in front of the barrier
          posts and beneath the post base plates is to be very
          neatly trimmed off.          A true vertical line is to be left
          where the concrete meets the posts and plates.

          All exposed steelwork is then to be thoroughly cleaned,
          primed and painted in accordance with the Specification.
      2) Shrinkage cracks are visible at the North end of this
          exit.    Would you please forward your proposals for
          sealing these cracks.          An appropriate epoxy resin grout
          would probably be considered suitable.
      3) The root of the new cantilever slab exhibits grout loss.
          This is to be hacked back and made good with a sand/cement
          mortar and a suitable bonding agent.               The resulting finish
          must be servicable and match the Adjacent concrete.
      4) The rendering done after our letter dated 14 August is
          not satisfactory.         Shrinkage cracking is evident together
          with some spalling.          All suspect rendering is to be hacked
          off and replaced.
      5) The paint on the handrail at the North end of this exit is
          flaking.       All loose paint is to be removed by thoroughly wire
          brushing,     followed by priming and painting in accordance with
        the Specification.     The whole length of handrfil is to
        be given a final gloss to give a uniform finish.
   6)   The B.H.S. gate post has not been fixed to the existing
        parapet wall.    A detail similar to that indicated on
        detail 2, drawing 1610/36B should be adopted.
   7)   The rail over the first gbst from the North end has only
        been tack welded.     A full sealing weld is to be applied.
   8)   The top of the concrete upstand, referred to in item 10)
        of our letter dated 14 August, has been rendered.     This
        rendering is badly cracked and spalling.     It is apparent
        that the measures taken to bring the upstand to the proper
        level have not been successful.     The upstand is therefore
        to be demolished and recast to its correct level.     The top
        surface is to be left with a smooth, even steel trowelled
        finish.


d) West Stand - South Exit
   1)   The same comments as the previous items 1, 4 and 8 also
        apply to this exit.
   2)   The concrete at ground level around the JEirst support
        stanchion has lost cement grout.     Please break out this
        concrete to a depth of at least 100 ram and re-cast to
        match the surrounding concrete.
   3)   Water is still ponding on the Durbar     plate landing.   Would
        you please drill more holes in the plate to release this
        water or alternatively straighten the plate to prevent
        ponding.
  4)    The cabin hook and eye fastening back the gate is to be
        wire brushed, primed and painted.
   5)   The E.H.S. section above the jfat© has not been sealed, this
        must be done to prevent corrosion.     The cap is to be primed
        and painted in accordance with the Specification.


e) Spion Kop Terracing
   1)   The new terracing, referred to in section c) of our letter
       dated 14 August 1979, is not acceptable.    The rgosings are
       out of line by more than the specified 3 mm and arenot truly
       vertical.    The steps have been grout washed and this is
       now spalling off in several places.    The treads are un#v,en.
       It is apparent that the measures taken to effect a repair
       have not been successful and we wish you to remove the
       defective sections and recast them.
 2)    The first step through the tunnel at the North end has a
       large crack through it where it has been recast.    The loose
       section is to be broken away reconcreted.


f)Spion Kop Staircase
  1) The welding on the handrails and posts is generally poor
       quality.    All welds underut, porous, uneven profiled,
       incomplete or welds that have not had the slag removed are
       to be ground down and rewelded.

       All new welds, damaged paint and lengths not painted are
       to be thoroughly cleaned, primed and painted in accordance
       with the Specification.
 2)    The concrete upstands show extensive grout loss and honey
       combing and general lack of compaction.     All such lengths
       of upstand are to be demolished and recast.
 3)    As a matter of urgency the steep embankment adjacent to
       the second flight is to be reduced in height and graded as
       requested.
  4)   The face of some of the steps and the inside faces of the
       upstand have been patched or bagged down, others still show
       signs that the concrete was not sufficiently vibrated.      All
       sections of insufficiently dense concrete are to be cut out
       and recast.


g)Gate 0 (Penistone Road)
  The gate track damaged by your skip early in the contract is
  to be repaired.

1_.____Purpose of Meeting

The original Intention of the visit had been to check that the outstanding matters
referred to In the Note of the meeting held on 12th November had been completed
or were In the course of completion prior to the anticipated issue of the Certificate
by the County Council this week.

 2.     Minor Matters

 An Inspection of the ground showed that a number of minor matters still required
 attention, but the Club undertook to ensure that these were attended to in the ib xt
 few days.

 3.     Major Matters

 A.     Emergency Lighting - South Stand

 The meetings which had taken place between the County Fire Service and Messrs.
 Eastwood and Partners since 12th November on the South Stand Emergency Lighting
 had produced agreement on an Interim arrangement which would be regarded as
acceptable for the duration of the existing battery life. Further modifications at
that time would remedy the shortcomings of the existing Installation. Details were
contained In the letter dated 12th December which Messrs. Eastwood and Partners
had addressed to the Fire Service.

B.     South Stand Construction

The Building Authority expressed concern as to what they saw as a lack of structural
Integrity In the South Stand. In their opinion, corrosion was contributing to the
progressive deterioration of the Stand which, It was felt, could only be properly
determined by a M l structural survey. The report forwarded by Messrs. Eastwood
and Partners In the last week was not considered to be sufficiently comprehensive
to provide the required Information, and the basis of calculation used could not be
agreed as appropriate. Whilst It was agreed that there had not been a specific
written request for such a full structural survey of the South Stand, the Building
Authority felt that It had been Inherent In the detailed discussions which had taken
place that such a report would be forthcoming. The Building Authority were
 concerned at the possibility that the requirements of the Building Regulations and
 the Code of Practice Safety Factors could not be met; In particular the Structural
 stability of the South Stand In conditions of gale force winds and heavy snowfall
 was mentioned.

For the Club, Dr. Eastwood agreed that the Stand would obviously not be built to the
same specification or the same construction standards nowadays, but pointed out
that, for Instai ce, none of the buildings In Sheffield built before 1970 could meet
the latest wind pressure requirements. Even the Building Research Station was n
evidently thinking In terms that these requirements were unreallstlcally high. In
his professional Opinion, the Stand was structurally safe and able In practice to meet
the loadings demanded. In any case, the conditions which had been described as
being possibly dangerous would mean In prabtlce that a match could not be played
and consequently no spectators would be present.

 Experience of the corrosion of Indoors steel In the Sheffield area showed this to be
 minimal, and the Stand was regularly test loaded by spectators. Structures such
 as this would show obvious external signs, such as cracks, well before there was
 any possibility of collapse, and would be readily apparent on even a superficial
 visual Inspection. Even though he did not consider It essential, plating of the
 front steel columns had been carried out as a compromise to try and meet the
 Building Authority's concern. He agreed there might well be a continuing
 maintenance problem with the stand, but this was a different matter to saying there
 was a structural problem. Reference was made to the Guide’s advice that when
 assessing whether existing situations provided adequately for the safety of spectators,
 the criterion to be used Is that of a reasonable degree of safety. In Dr. Eastwood's
 view, It would be unreasonable and unnecessary to Insist On a full structural survey
 of the South Stand or to delay the Issue of the Certificate. It was his professional
 opinion (which he was most jealous of and would not put In jeopardy) that the South
  Stand was structurally safe and that the basis of the calculations provided was
 appropriate. He was prepared to advise the Club to use the appeal procedure open
 to them should this be necessary.
IT WAS AGREED that:

(a)   as there was no obvious deterioration in the South Stand structure of such
      a nature as to be of immediate concern, no objection would be raised to the
      continuance of the derby game with Sheffield United on Boxing Day morning
      provided that no extreme weather conditions occurred in the intervening
      period, and

(b)    a further meeting should be held as a matter of urgency between the Building
       Authority and Dr. W. Eastwood to discuss tbs structural Integrity of the
      South Stand and the appropriateness of the calculations used (Mr. D. Vaughan
      to be present at Dr. Eastwood's request).

NOTE As the discussions on the South Stand Construction hinged on structural
     theories and practices, the Fire Service and Police representatives felt
     there was little they could contribute and left the meeting prior to its
     termination.

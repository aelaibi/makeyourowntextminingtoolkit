\ * . u ,
Thank you for your letter of 6 May about additional financial
support for direct service provision and for the Regional Unit you
propose to establish to provide and co-ordinate continuing care in
the aftermath of the Hillsborough tragedy. You also wrote to
John Moore, Secretary of State for Social Security and to
Nicholas Ridley Secretary of State for the Environment. Please
accept this as a reply to all three letters.

The Department's Social Services Inspectorate have kept me informed
of the action taken by the local social services departments
together in the wake of the tragedy and I know that the Chief
Inspector has written personally to all the Social Services
Directors in appreciation of the remarkable efforts made by them and
their staff.

The precise response to a tra^e^y of this sort needs to be decided
on the spot, on the basi s of a careful examination of needs. My
Department has no power to make additional resources available to
local authorities for th is purpose. However, I understand from
Nicholas Ridley, Secreta ry of State for Environment, that under a
model scheme designed to deal with extra-ordinary costs arising from
emergencies (the Bellwin Scheme), the Government has provided
special financial assist ance to local authorities in certain
circumstances.

The Bellwin Scheme was drawn up after discussions with the Local
Authority Associations and provide for assistance towards the
immediate and additional costs of dealing with an emergency once
expenditure exceeds a threshold beyond which local authorities would
normally be expected to budget for. In the case of the last use of
the Scheme, following the Great Storm of 1987, that threshold was
(for Counties and Metropolitan Districts) set at the exclusive
product of a l.Op rate.
E.B.

 If you consider that you have a case for assistance of this kind,
 Nicholas Ridley is prepared to consider a detailed and fully costed
 application (though at first sight it looks as if the level of
 expenditure needed would be substantially below the likely threshold
 for the authorities involved).  I know that he will keep me informed
 of events if you do decide to pursue this possibility.

 The Government has, of course, as you mention, already made a
 contribution of £500,000 to the Disaster Fund to help those most
 closely affected by the Disaster

 Copies of this letter go to John Moore and Nicholas Ridley.

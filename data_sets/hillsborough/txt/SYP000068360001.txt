                 My   name   :i.s Neil       F ITZMAUR I C E , I live at

                 I am     19 yrs     old-        I am u ne mp lo ye d at              the moment.            I have     been a

                 s u pporter       of L i verpool y *C for m any years                           at Anfield.

                 My first      trip awa y from A nf i e l d S t a d i u m was                      on S a t u r d a y the     15th Apri

                 1989     (150489)        to H i l l s b o r o u g h ,   to w a t c h L i v e r p o o l      play N o t t i n g h a m

                 Forest      in the semi           final      of the F . A          cup     competition.

                 I went wit h some             friends        to the match,               and a r r i v e d at S h e f f i e l d at

                 a bout    12.00 noon          (1200 hrs).               I went       to the       pub for a drink a n d hjrcl

                 about 2 — 3 pints           of /ager.           I went        to the gr o u n d w ith a g roup of

                 f riends    of mine and a l t h o u g h we seen man y                           police    officers       w hen we wsr

                 walking     towards         the stadium,            when we a c t u a l l y a r r i v e d         by the      gates

                 there was         only     I think       three      officers          on duty at the             time.       When      I go

                 near     the entrances            to the      stadium,          it was          obvious    there was a severe;
                                                                                                                   page:
                                                                                                                   SI 262

crushing        problem,         there was           people     literaly        passing      out    outside            the

g r o u n d and at that            stage       it was rny opin i o n that                the gates      to the

ground had to be op e n e d or the                         crowd    pushed back.            There was         m Y help

from     the    police       officers          in pushing          the    crowd back,        so t he/police

officer at          the    gate        had    really no a l t e r n a t i v e      but     to op^rt the gates a

people were           obv i o u s l y    being       crushed.        Whe n    the gates^Xl/ere opened many

peo p .1e f ell       to the       g round       i n the      rush to get         in .

We got       in the a rea          behind        the goal,         it was     really tight.             I had never

e x p e r i e n c ed a n y t h i n g    like     it,    it got      p r o g r e s s i v e l y worse,    actually

inside      the area behind                  the goal       it was       ridiculous.         I deci d e d      to get

out and        1 went      to move away              but only my neck moved.                  I then       r e a lised

I literaly          couldn't move at all.                      I quite       h o n estly    panicked,         the       next

thing my w a t c h glass                burst and          ripped off. I wasn't             actually           carried

by the      crowd but was               very        crushed s t a nding        in the      same spot.          I

thought my arms              were       breaking.           I was    that     crushed,       I was      tota l l y       in

I was      losing      air     then.          I stopped       b r ea th / ng but         I managed      to be able

to move my neck a couple                       of    inches    so his        elbow would       be awa y from my

windpipe.           I m oved      it,        I think       to the    right,       I then     remembered            being

able    to breath a ga in               very        slowly.     However        I then      lost my balance and

me.     He just        col l a p s e d and went             down on the        floor.        I d i d n ’t see           him

          was      stopped     by two or three            police males            who w o u l d n ’t let me at            it.

          was      s c reaming at them to get                the    fence    down and at that moment                     the

the time,        I just w a n t e d        to get s o mewhere         to w a t c h the m a t c h          from.         At

the     start    of the tunnel             it was easy       to walk along it w a s n ’t too

congested.         About      t hree       quarters      of the w a y along the tunnel                      it became

crowded a nd there was a                   strong push from behind.                    This was        caused          by

some     s u pporters      running         along    the tunnel,        I think.              When    I eventually

got     to the end of the             tunnel,       I went    to the        left hand side

an d    into a pen,       w h i ch    I now know to be           pen number             four.       The     game was
                                                                            t
in progress at that              point and there was a lot of noise                             from the

crowd,     singing and          cheering        etc.     Once    inside          pen four,          I took    up a

po s i t i o n just     forw a r d    of the tunnel,          about      four or five feet                  into       the

pen,    s l i g ht ly to the         left as you        look at       the       rear of the goal.                 I have

m a r k e d this   initial       p o s i t i o n on the s e p arate             grid    plan using          the

figure     one.       Things     were       very tight       in pen four,              but    I w o u l d n ’t say          it

was a crush.            As we    s tood       in p o s ition one,        things         became       tighter and

tighter.         As things       got w orse         in the    pen,     I deci d e d to try a n d move,

but     realised that         I c o u l d n ’t move at all.              I c o u l d n ’t see         the    pitch at

all,    but the game was              o b vi ou sl y still      being       played due to the

reactions        of the     crowd.          After a short        time,          I felt mys e l f       being

carried by a gradual                 swa y of the       crowd.        You       c o u l d n ’t stop    it,    yo u had

to m ove wit h the          crowd.          I was    carried by the              crowd towards my             left

hand side,         towards       what     I now know to be             pen number five.             By this

time,     it was a crush            inside       pen four.           At some stage,            a man on my

left wearing a black                leather jacket,             put his       hands     on the s h o u l d e r s           of

the    person      in front       of him,        trying     to get a bove         the    crowd.        As    he did

so,    his      right elbow went against my w i n d p i p e and                    I felt as th o u g h               I

c o u l d n ’t breath at all.              I thought        I had s t o p p e d b r eathing and              if       I

was    in this      position        for much        longer,      that    I w ould die.            I somehow

m a n a g e d to move my         neck to my         right and get awa y from the mans                        elbow.

This    caused the m a n to              lose his       balance,       but    not a c t u a l l y fall.           I was

now able         to breath a bit           better.         The man w ith the            black     leather

jacket       then grabbed my             left    shoulder       to ste a d y himself          again.         This

r e s ulte d     in him pushing me to my                 right and s l i g h t l y f o r wards          into the

left    shoulder      of a m a n who was s t a nding                  just    in front        of me.        As    I

pushed       into the man he also                fell    forwards       to his     right.         It was         just

like domino         effect.        As     I e ve nt u a l l y   r e g a i n e d my balance and stood up

again,       I looked a r o u n d but           I c o u l d n ’t see    the man that           I was    pushed

into.        He may well         have     fallen to the ground.                 The man        I pushed          into

was a white male,            aged        between forty and forty f i v e .                    I think       he had

light     brown h a i r .        He was w ea r i n g        sky blue         coloured short         sleeved T

shirt,       1 d o n ’t know      if     it was     round neck or a collar.                    I never       saw the

front     of the man.            This     is all     tht    I remember         of that man.            I would

es t imate as       best    I can that           the game may just             have     been s t o p p e d at

that    point,      as there was           not the normal             react i o n from the         crowd at

that    time.       I was    still        being     ca r r i e d over    towards        the    d i v iding       fence,

Whilst       still about         ten feet awa y from the                dividing        fence there          seemed

to be a slight            ease    in the        pressure.        A    lot of    people were         getting               out

onto    the     p itch,    by now,       and there         se e m e d to be a slight            b a ckwards

give    them      room.     Ha v i n g    felt this        sudden easing          of the       pressure,          I was

                    looking          towards     the    pitch,    whe n    I saw a man who          suddenly       popped      up

                    a bove      the    rest     of the    crowd.      The man was a bout            fifteen feet         in front

                    of me,       further        down the    pen towards           the    pitch,    about    ten feet         behind

                    the    fence at the front              of the     pen.        I could see       the mans       head and

              s h oulde rs above the rest of the crowd. The ma n was not a c t u a l l y

                    head was          flop p e d to the     side and        his eyes were          closed.        I could see

              J     that       his    lips were        blue and his face was a pale grey                    colour.

                    up by other          supporters,        hence w h y he s u d d e n l y a p p e a r e d a bove        the

                    crowd.           Having     seen that man,        I turned a r o u n d and s c r eamed to a lad

                    behind me to           push back.        The    crowd seemed to              push back and whe n           I

                    faced fron t w a r d s again,           there was more              space    in front    of me,      and       I

                    could see          the ground again.            I saw the man,              I have just mentioned,

                    this       time he was        lying on his       back     on the       ground,    just    in front         of a

                    crush barrier.               There was a man squatting                 down over       him,    apparently

                    t rying      to    revive     him.     I looked at them for a little                    bit    longer and

s t retcher          bearing.           I was     left on my own.                  S h o r t l y after,       w hile    I was

still      in the goal area,                   som e w h e r e betw e e n the six and e i g h t e e n yard

lines,         I saw Five          s up p o r t e r s    carrying       s o m e b o d y on the mak e s h i f t

s tretchers,              the a dv e r t i s i n g      hoardings.           One    of the middle             s e c tions     of

the    hoarding w a s n ’t s u p p o r t e d and was sagging.                                 I went    over       to the

lads and            took hold of the              back     end of the h o a rding and we                      ran to the

far    corner         of the       pitch,       betw e e n the Hop and                  the N o r t h Stand.           I left

the    other         lads and the hoarding at that                           end of the ground and then                       ran

back     to the L e p pings Ln end.                       I only had one                look at the          person     on

that     hoarding.              It was a m ale            person,       who    had a brown             leather       jacket

covering            his    face.        The    jacket was a r o u n d his                head not just             covering

the    face.          I do not          remember a n y t h i n g        else a bout            that    person.

When     I got        back      to the L e p p i n g s Ln             end    I saw some             other    lads    putting

a no t h e r    person onto a m a k e sh if t                  stretcher.

These      lads were            on the        left      side    of the       pitch as you             look    from the

West Stand,               roughly on a line with the e i g h t e e n yard                             line

towards         the N orth Stand.                 I took        the    back    end of the hoarding a n d we

ran back            to the far          corner       of the      ground.           We    left the       lad at that

end.      The        lad that        I assisted           carrying          on the       second hoardin g was

injured,            not dead.           He was a w hite           lad, an d he was .referred to as

board,         to the other end.                  We went        to the other                side    of the       pitch this

time,     the S o u th S ta n d side                 of the      pitch.        We       saw a man being             revived

by a single               person.        T here were           people       s t a nding around,             but   only one

trying         to    revive      the man.            The man was            lying       on the       pitch    in front        of

the S ou th Stand,               about        nine yards         from the goal                line and outs i d e        the

                        two to three minutes                and    then got up and said                     to the effect,

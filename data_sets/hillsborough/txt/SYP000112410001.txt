Ground <$t approximately 9.40am,                                      ’,

At 10am ;this -date I attended the main bfiefing                 in, t h e .North Stand

with my serial where we were briefed by Chief Superintendent

Duckenfield and Inspector                                             Jtpr_ White F

division who was       in command-. of ..se'r



After a refreshments break          1 reported to Leppings Lane end with my

se ria l at    riant where we were briefed again by Inspector White who

also   covered the emergency procedure.              In the event of an emergency

PC   975.   Washington was to be,deployed          in the central t u n n e l s

Our terms'of      reference was the searching of. fans coming through

turtvsti les A-G at the rear of the West              -Stand,''Leppings Lane end

inside the ground for alcohol,            weapons,    etc.

We were      in position at i "I. 15am.

Several      fans had started drifting          into the ground by this time and I

noticed that there was about six', fans             in the centre north pen.

From then until approximately Spiri there was a gradual                    increase of

fans   coming    into the ground.      The majority were good .humoured and

friendly.       There was no problems at this stage but I did-rnoti.ee a

number of supporters outside the turnstiles attempting to enter the

ground without.a- ticket,         I saw money offered to several             turnstile

operators when I was present.             When that happened the fans did an

about turn and mingled with the other supporters who were queueing                        i

an orderly manner outside.-         A few supporters without „ ti ckets jumped

t>he:’turn'sti les and were ejected.

Approximately at 2pm I deployed PC 3232 Burton to supervise the

programme sellers behind ,us because- ofthe hassel                   from the supporter

PC 1002 Wiid was deployed at the snack                bar at the     rear of the West

Stanalso        to supervise a number of -fans.              1

       Angf" parti cular :attention to the turnsti les when it became apparent

    that a number of operators were taking payment.                 I therefore flitted

    between A-G' turnstiles,       with a view to catching them out.              There was

    no real   problems at this time.

    About 2.30gjiu^the re was a >a,rge number o#-^ans ,comi ng'' through the

    Several   cans of beer and lager had been /binned*              in the litter basket

    on entry.      The mood of the majority of fans had changed and they were

    becoming more aggressive.          The smell of drink was becomirigxroo re

    apparent.

    I personally thought we were very light on manpower at this end

    compared with previous         years.

    I have    worked this end of the ground either outside the                turnstiles.,

    inside    searching or in the West Stand            for several years at Cup ties,

    FA Cup    Semi-Finals and league matches with a lot more manpower.                   In

    fact I have seen more manpower at this'end during                 league matches.-

    Normally we have had a serial at the centre tCinnel to direct fans to

    the North or South pens when the Centre             pens had been filled.           This

    was not the case at this match and several of my serial                   remarked on

     It was noticeable at this time that the situation had quietened down

     Control      into the South Stand and over the wall.                           I instructed them to

     stay together as a serial                       because of the number of Police -officers '

     It was apparent that the situation was serious at this stage and

     speed was essential.              1      was u n a b l e    to get through the gate because 'of

     the bodies,         therefore,        I climbed onto the security fencing and pulled

     several      fans from the mass and over the fencing together with my

     serial.       The majority of these appeared in shock but. were                              conscious.

     I then went to the gate w i th C h i ef Superintendent M e stoil,. wi~ierie with

     difficulty managed to pull a number of bodies away from the gate

     until     it could be opened-fully.

         understandable under the circumstances.                   1 did see a n u i f t b ¥ ^ f coins

         being thrown onto the field.

         A l o t .of Police officers,          St..Johns Ambulance,       were engaged in

         resuscitation.              Many were shouting for oxygen which was not

         forthcoming.

         Initially my feelings were of frustration because                    I was unable to get

         to the people because of the security fencing.                    Perhaps       if I could

         have, we may have been able to save a lot more lives.                         The actual

         gates were wholly inadequate simply because there was not enough and

         the ones which are there are too small.

         When the ground was eventually-emptied I escorted the Liverpool                          fans

         with my. serial            out the Leppings Lane end to the main roundabout on

         Penistone Road before             returning to the gymnasium,        where three

         officers on my serial were                involved in the sudden death reports.

         At 7.20pm I returned to Claywheels Lane where some of the serial                           had

         a meal as we awaited transportation to Barnsley.                     PC 2887 Grant was

         the only officer still engaged at that time with his                     *b o d y * .

         At    8   pm I retired from duty.

         Understandably a number of my, serial were upset by the .situation but

         all       credit to them they did not show their emotion during the-

         incident and all            performed with c re da bi 1 ity.        .

I                          e officers     in pairs,         P C ’s 2398 Moss and 236? Sykes

were deployed at the bottom of the stairs leading JtQ the seated area

'serial were on general            public order        patrol       in the bar concourse in

the West Stand and, also the area behind the Leppings Lane end inside

the ground.

The     1 >ral behaviour and 'attitude of the fans on this *                                was very

1500.        I do recall     some of     the fans had            been drinking and were in a

good humour.          This was riot a problem,

The only problem we did encounter was the number of Liverpool fans

with tickets for the terracing who at tempi eel to get into the

area of the West Stand fay using tickets passed down to them by the

fans in the stand.            Me had anticipated this and the four officers

•assisting the stewards at .both entrances tore the corner of the

tickets on entrance to the West Stand so that they would know if the?

tickets had been passed on to the Leppings Lane terraces.                                  This did

not cause any problem and the -fans accepted their plan had been

*rumble d*.

At 1450 hours we had an instruction ;                       .»      >          »        no more

fans were to be allowed in the                                   ns, t h e r e f o r e » the wooden

gate at the rear of the tunnel was closed denying a c c e s s .                            This was

done by PC       1278 Lang,

The game took place without               incident and there were no arrests by my

se r ia l.

                On conclusion of the game my serial supervised the fans leaving the

                ground and eventually we were deployed to remain at the Junction with

                Catchbar Lani.    The fans had been orderly and good humoured

                throughout the afternoon not one member of my serial had cause to

                intervene,   either before,   during or after the match.

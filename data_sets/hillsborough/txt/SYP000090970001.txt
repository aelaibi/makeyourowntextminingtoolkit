                                                                                                                                S3523

to    go    there      via    the      perimeter          tr a c k .        We    entered        the     track        at    the

opposite         end    to L e p p i n g s       L a n e , the      end      nearest        the     Police           Room.




As    1 stepped         out       onto    the     track       there         was    a tremendous               roar     from       the

c r o w d as     the    game       got    tinder way.




As    I approached            the      area      behind       the      goal       mouth     I c o ul d        see     t ha t     the

centre       section         of    the    terrace         was    v/ry        c r o w d e d w ith        p e op l e    pushing

from       the   back    and       that     peo pi e a y t h e           f r o n t we re be i ng           pressed          agai nst

the    perimeter         fence.                     t /




The area         to    the    right       of     this     section appeared                  to     be    less        populated.




I joined         other       officers           already       behind         the    goal     as     the       emergency           g a te s

were       opened and         I sa w      people         climbing           over    the     to p    of     the       compacted

crowd       towards      the       fr o n t .     I also        sa w     people      climbing            over        the

perimeter         fence.




I assisted            officers         whom      I d id jffot k n o w            t o pull    people           from     one       of    the

g a t e s to     t ry a n d       relieve        tp«     situation           and after           a short         time       officers

began       doing      this       in a s o r t      of    relay        to    ease    the w o r k l o a d         on    each       o t h er




I assisted            many    people        from       the    ground and            helped         them       clear        of    the

a r ea ,    whilst      work       continued           by Police/ a n d            persons a l r e a d y             removed          from

the    crowd.          I saw       people        held     in %j/e c r o w d         near     the        fence        who    appeared

to me       to   be    dead       or   dying      as     thar c r u s h w o r s e n e d .          Dead       persons           were

pulled       from      the    crowd a n d         l a i y on     grass           and were        taken a w a y         on

makeshift         stretchers.




On    several         occasions          I w as     obliged         to      restrain        fans        who    were        running

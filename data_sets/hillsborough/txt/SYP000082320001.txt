               1.



               I reported       for duty at R a w m a r s h Police S t a t i o n at 8.0 0 a.m.                   on

              S a t u r d a y , 15 April   1989,       at this       time,     I was     in full Police

               uniform.      I was     conveyed        d i r e c t l y to H i l l s b o r o u g h Football      Ground       by

              Force     coach,    to be brie f e d        for    the day's        duties.




                                                                                                         75*F1

              Following      the briefingr in the N orth S t a n d at                    the Football          Ground,       I

was    deployed         w ith the       rest      of my serial        in R a w s o n Spryng R o a d ,          an

industrial estate                near      to the bottom           of Harries Roa^i/, At           11 . 15 a .m ,

that    date,       I took       up my      position to direct              the N o t t i n g h a m Forest

contingent,           to suitable           parking       places a l l oc a t e d wi t h i n the           industrial

e s tate.The        football       fans      I saw were          conducting        t h emselves         in a good

natursd and           l i g h t h e a r t e d manner,      wit h the m a j o r i t y of fans             parking       up

early and ente r e d the                ground at the same               time.        On the a p p r o a c h    of 3.

00    p.m.    the     roads a r o u n d Periistone Road,                 Herries R oad and Ra w s o n

S pring Road,          were almost           deserted.           There was       the odd         late a r r i v e r    to

the    ground,       but the       numbers were            not    so great as to             cause any       problems

The    next     stage      of our duty was             to a t t e n d C l a y w h e e l s    Lane Traffic

O ffice      for meal       and    following         this,       we were      to be on s t a n d b y duties

o utside      the ground          on the P e n i s t o n e R oad end.

At about 3.05            pm that        date      I was    stood wit h the            rest of my serial               at

the    corner       of P e n i s t o n e    Road and Herries R o a d outs i d e                 the Char l i e

Br o w n s Shop.         We were a p p r o a c h e d       by a S u p e r i n t e n d e n t ,   who     had just

emerged       from the football                ground,      he    im m e d i a t e l y ordered us          into the

ground.

Wit h PS Taylor           and     Inspector N E W E Y who were                both     in p ossession of

Police       radios.        As    I a p p r o a c h e d the      playing area          from the         en trance

between       the North S t a n d and S p i o n Kop,                 I saw the         player       leaving     the

pitch and a large                crowd of s pectators              on the       pitch       round the L e p p i n g s

Lane    end of the ground.                   My    immediate       thought were             that    there    had been

a pitch       invasion by the L i v erpool                  fans.        I then       ran ac r o s s     th e pi t c h

to offer my a s s i s tance,                there were a few Po l i c e O f f i c e r s               present       but

not a great          number.As          I moved      closer       to the goalmouth,                1 was    still

under     the      impre s s i o n that        the Liv e r p o o l     fans     had    invaded the          pitch.

It was       then that        I heard a shout              fron a fan that             people were          dying      in

there,       and    it was at        this      point      I realised the           full      horror      of what was

happening.           From only a couple                of feet a w a y        from the          perimeter      fence.

                                                                                                                S 26SS

I could see         people were a l r e a d y dead,               others wersj/turni ng blue and

some were having            d i f f i c u l t y breathing

I then with a group of other                       officers,         s t a r r e d to shout         to the

supporters        to move      back        but there was          ncy'movernent.             Everything         was     in

chaos , there was           no guida n c e         in what      t>o do .        Spectators          in trying          to

escape     the    crush,     were         stepping      on bodies         to    lever       thems e l v e s    over     the

perimeter        fence.      Police O f f icers were                 s t a rting      to    pull    spec t a t o r s

over    the     fence,     many      of w h i c h were        inldred       or dead,         as    these      persons

were    pulled over         I star t e d to d r a y ^ t he bodies                from the          pitch s u r r o u n d

onto    the     playing     serv I H h e r e/other              officers         and medical           staff were

trying     to    resuscitate          the    injured.          This     task was made all                 the more

di f ficult      by the Liv e r p o o l        fans who        u n d e r s t a n a b l y wan t e d their        own

relatives and friends a t t e n d i n g                 to,    and tried         to pull          us awa y     from

where we we r e deali n g .

I stayed        near to the          perimeter fence and              co n t i n u e d     to     carry    bodies       to

the    playing     surface,          where     by this        time    both Police O f f i c e r s             and

s p e c t a t o r s alike were        carrying        bodies      on s t r e t c h e r s made        from

advertising        hoardings.             After what          seemed an age,               I. swapped      places

w ith another        officer         as    I felt     physi c a l l y     e x h a u s t e d and     I felt      I could

do    no more.

I then under         the    i n s t r u c t i o n of a high          ranking       officer         helped      in

trying     to move       spectators          from the         playing      surface          to the     s a n c t u a r y of

the N o r t h Stand,        this      proved futile as s p e c t a t o r s                 refused to go.              When

the terrace was            clear, A         tried u n s u c c e s s f u l l y    to      re-join my serial,                 I

then a t t a c h e d myself / o           other C2 officers               to await          further

instructions,          it w a y at this           point       that we were          told to form a cordon

at the     halfway       l i n d and        not    to let a n y b o d y t h r o u g h      to     the S p i o n Kop

end.

At a p p r o x i m a t e l y 4 .30    p.m.     I returned to R a w s o n Spring R oad                      to assist

in the     removal       of the N o t t i n g h a m Forest            fans.        F r o m there       I returned

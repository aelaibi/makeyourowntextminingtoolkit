    We    parked          the       car     on      a    piece        of    land         behind          the       Notts          Forest          end        of

    the    football             ground           this         was     close         to    the       ground             but    I d o n ’t          know           the

    road       the       land       was     in      or    by.       We     then      got       a    taxi          to    “T h e     Rutland              Hotel.'

    which       was       about        a mile            away       from       the       ground.             When       we    got       to       t he

    Rutland          I asksd           the       receptionist                  if    a    lad       by       the       name       of

    had    checked             in - a s          he      was       a mate       that          w e ’d a r r a n g e d          to       meet       up     there

    but    the       receptionist                   said        there       was      no       one    of       that       name          in    the        hotel.

    Because                         w a s n ’t at         the       hotel       the       four       of       us       got    a    taxi          back        to

    where       w e ’d        left     the       car.         We    then       got       in    the       c ar      and       drove          around           to

    the    Liverpool                end     of      the       ground        and      parked          up       in a        road         opposite              the

    Park       Pub       - which          was       situated             off    Leppings             Ln.          I should             think       the           time

    would       be       about       half        past         12 a t       this      stage          <1230          hrs).




    We    then       got       out     of      the       c ar      and     walked         around             the       outside          of       the     ground

    by    the       Leppings           Ln      entrance.              We    had      a    couple             of    barm       cakes          from        a       shop

    in L e p p i n g s         Ln    and       at       the     same       time      had       a    wander             up a n d        down       the        road

    to    see       if    there^JSas             anyone            selling          any       tickets             as    none a f            us

    had    got       a    t ^ k e t . We            h a d n ’t g o t        tickets            ourselves                f/om       Anfield              because

    we    k n e w / w e * d be        able          to    get       some       from       by       the       ground          and       t h a t *s w h a t          we

    do    at    basically              every            ticket        match         we    try       and       get       them       from          someone

    s e l I i ng     them.




    There       was       a    tout       selling             tickets          b y >£ne         ph one box             opposite             the    main

    gate       at    Leppings             Ln     and      I approayned                   him       but       he    was       selling             them        for

'   £40    for       a    £6    ticket           and      that        w/s      too       much.




    Then       we    decided           to      walk       a     bit      away       from       the       ground          as       we    fancied              a

    drink       &    I asked           a Policeman                  where       there          was       a    pub       that       was       open        as       all

    the    ones          around        the       ground            were     shut.             The    Policeman                directed              us       to

we'd         been       in       before.               It          was       too    packed                &    hot         to        drink          in    the    pub       so

that         they       would          be        in    the          standing                area          &    mine          was          for       the       seated

area.             Due    to       this           I swapped                   mine       with          another                fan,          who       was       outside

the        pub,     so       the       four           of       us       all    then             had       ground             tickets.

all    the       matches             that       I go          to.




Due    to       the       great       mass          of    people        we    obviously             c o u l d n ’t q u e u e          &       we    just

joined          the       mass       who       eventually             moved           slowly       forward           towards          t he

turnstiles.                    When       we'd       actually           gone          through       the        main       entrance             gate       &


heading          for       the       turnstiles.                    I saw^effie P o l i c e m a n              on    horseback                who       had

his    truncheon                out.          He     wasnH/ffitting                   anyone        he        was    just       trying             to

tell       everyone             to    push          hat€k.          Then     I saw       him       get        on    his       Police          radio,

but    I c o u l d n ’t he-^r w h a t                     he    said.         By       this       time        now    we       were    getting

close       to       the       turnstiles.                    There     seemed          to    be    a     few P o l i c e m e n           about          now

by    the       turnstiles                &    I saw          one    Policeman           climb          up     onto       a    wall       &    pu ll

out    a    small          child          -   who        was    queuing           close       to    the        turnstiles.                    I think

he    passed          the       child         - who           looked       frightened              because           the       lad    was

getting          'pushed'             &       I saw       the       Policeman           pass       the        child       to    some          other

Police.




I then          went       through             the       3rd    turnstile              from       the     right       and       the       steward

separated             my       ticket.              I followed                          as    I    pushed           him       through          first,

but    I d o n ’t          know       which          one                                     went       in.         The       four    of       us       then

met    up       once       through             the       turnstiles,              &   went        through           the       only    entrance

that       we    knew          of    whicM          was       the    tunnel.            There       were           loads       of    people

walking          through             J/ns      tunnel          with     us    but       we    weren't              being       pushed          &    there

was    no       surge       pf       fans.           I don't           know       how    many       were           coming       through

be hi n d       us    a*€ I n e v e r t u r n e d               around,




Once       through             the    tunnel             we    walked        ov/r       to    the       pen        situated          on       the       left

(which          I can          identify             as    being       R^n     4),        The       pen        itself          was    packed             when

we    got       in -       I        1 ike      to    stand/nearer                 the    back       normally              &    not    behind             the

goal       but       on    this       occasion/                we    had     no       choice       b ut       to    stand       where          we       were
                                                                                                                                                 PAGE
                                                                                                                                                 S I 22 5

stood       - which           was         about          12       rows       from        the        front.       I can        only          g u es s at

this       as    there        was         no    such          thing          as    rows         -    it     was a      ' m a s s ’.




I wasn't             aware       of       the    match             starting             but         I realised            the      teams       h a d come

out    due       to     everyone               cheering.                 At       first         the       f o u r of    us    were         being

pushed          from       all       angles          -    causing             us       to     sway        but    then        the     pushing

seemed          to    stop       &    we    were          just          stuck          in     one     position           - &       standing          one       -

&    you    c o u l d n ’t e v e n             lift       your          arms       up.




During          all     this         the       four       of       us    got       separated               -    I had                    with       me

but    I    lost        sight         of                      &                                  had       been        standing          the     closest

to    the       fence        separating                  pens          4 & 5,          so     I could           only     presume           h e ’d    been

pushed          over       towards             that.




After       this        there         seemed             to       be    'surge'             a f X.jptS ' s u r g e *     from        the    back         oi

the    Pen       4.        All       around          I could             see       people           climbing            over       the     fence

s e p a r a t x ng      4 & 5.




I honestly              c a n ’t      remember                0/fiat h a p p e n e d            then       except        that        I ended         up       by

the    fence          which          separates                4 &       5.                    was     with       me     & at       one     stage          I ’d

held       out       rny h a n d      to       him       to       stop       him       being        pushed           further         away.




Before          I seemed             to    'black             o u t ’ I can             remember                         shouting           to      me

words       to       the     effect            that       we       were       standing              on     someone.             It    was

impossible              to    get         down       &    help          the       people         who       had       obviously           fallen          to

the    ground           as    you         were       supported                by       everyone            around        —    in a       standing

position.

                Everyone                   was       screaming                around           me          there       were          people          crying          -    grown

                                                                                                                                                         S 1225

      gymnasium                was    over       the       far       end          of    the          pitch       -    the    opposite           end      to       the

      incident             &    through          a    gate.              In       the       gymnasium                I saw       people       lying          on    the

      floor       -    some          with       coats          over       their             heads.           They          were    obviously             dead

      but    I just             thought          the       others             would             be    probably             unconscious             -    but       they

      were    dead             too    though.




      During          all       this       the       Police          formed             a       line       across          the    pitch       -• o t h e r s

      were    giving             mouth          to    mouth          &    others             were          stood       around          talking          in

      groups          which          we    had       to    push          past          to       get    the       stretchers             through.




      The    ' P r e s s ’ were             taking             photographs                      everywhere.                 I can       remember             one

      incident             in    particular                when          I saw          a    Policeman                giving       mouth       to       mouth          to

      a   child        &       the    press          were       taking             photographs                   of    hi m.       Next       to       the

      Policeman                was    another             woman          lying          on       the       ground          going       blue    -       there       was

      only    one          Policeman             &    I saw          the       press             start       to       take       photos       of       the    woman

      who    was       obviously                dying.           I       lost          my       rag    &    jumped          in    the    circle          of

      press       that          had       congregated                &    I threw                them       to       one    side.        I d i d n ’t

      injure          anyone          of    them          or    damage             their             property          -    it w a s     just          that       they

      had    no       respect             for    the       dying woman.




      The    crowd             eventually             d r i f t e d off            &    we           left        the g r o u n d ata b o u t             10       to    3

      <1650       hrs).              We    left       of       our       own       accord,             returned             to    the    car       &    returned

      home.           During          the       whole          afternoon                I can          remember             one    announcement                   over

      the    air       -- w h e n         Dalglish             spoke          &    basicallytold                       e v e r y o n e to r e m a i n

      calm    &       to       assist       the       Police.

                  I did        not       witness          anything           on    the       day    that       I    considered             to    be    a

                  criminal              offence.           1 did        not       witness          anyone          ' l o o t i n g 9 the        bodies          or

                  any        fights          between       gangs        &    I had       a    good       view       of    everywhere             with       being

                  up     &    down       the       pitch       with     the       hoardings.




                  After        the       match       was       stopped        I thought             the    authorities                ie       the    Police          &

                  the        Stewards          either          d i d n ’t    realise          what       had       happened         or     d i d n ’t w a n t         to

                  realise           what       had       happened.            I c a n ’t       condem          the       Police,         but     there          again

                  I    c a n ’t     praise          them.         I ’ve      seen    Policemen             do       courageous             things          at

                  Hillsborough                 &    try    &    help        the    dying       &    injured,             but    I also          saw

                  Policemen              who       were    totally           inadequate             to    the       duty       they      should        have

                  done.




                  In m y       opinion             the    Policing           outj^tfe         the    ground          especially                was

                  I      wish           to   add     certain           points       which          I feel       vital          to   this        Judicial

                  inquiry           &    they       are    s-

                  2)         Liverpool             football        Club       wanted         more        tickets          because          t h e y ’ve      got       a

                  3)         I think          that       you    should        have       Police          who       are    used      to     &    specifically

                  trained           in       the    organisation              of    football             grounds.




                  4)         Also       I think          that     we    s h o u l d n ’t      be    treated           like      animals          because             who

                  else        would          pay    £12    to     go    & watch          sport       &    be       shoved       in a       ca g e .

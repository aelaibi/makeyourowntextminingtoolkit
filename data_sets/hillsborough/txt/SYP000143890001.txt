(329«    HAVE YOU ANY COMMENT TO MAKE ABOUT THE ACTIONS OF THE POLICE

         OFFICERS AT THE TIME OF THE DISASTER?



 The Police appeared slow to realise what was happening and seemed

only concerned with getting fans who were trying to climb the fence

from the terrace back onto the terrace.       After that it seemed that it

was the supporters who took the initiative in the rescue operation.

There seemed to be lack of liaison between Police officers.          I saw

Police pushing back supporters who were l^r^ing to get over the fence.

Police    reinforcements arrived and tpmY:. a position across the pitch.

Police response overall was slys un-coordinated and ill prepared.

In fairness I saw about a d*fzen giving the kiss of life and

ressucitation to fans ayr the pitch.



CRITICAL OF POLICE OVERALL

 Doing there best,    but at, first same mind as Police,   but once they

realised what was happening - okay - 1 did see one steward attack a

west stand

 No,    except pens 3 and 4 West Stand. Looked full,                                 but the stands at

either side were not full, why were supporters not distributed to

either side

                       SIR TOHN WHEELER MP's FOOTBALL (OFFENCES) BELL



                 Following the Home Affairs C om m ittee 's re p o rt "Policing Football
        Hooliganism", which was published on Tuesday, 5 February, Sir John Wheeler has tabled
        a Football (Offences) Bill. The purpose of this l e t t e r is to suggest the way forward on
        handling this.

        Wheeler Bill

                 The Bill tabled by Sir John Wheeler seeks to make illegal a t a football m a tc h
        throwing a missile, chanting obscene or racialist abuse, or going on to the playing area
        without reasonable excuse.

                  The creation of these th re e offences was recommended by Lord Justice Taylor
        in his report following th e Hillsborough Stadium disaster and are ones which, as you wjll
        recall, we had agreed to c re a te w'hen P arliam entary time allowed. The problem with
        their formulation in the Wheeler Bill is th a t they are presented in a simplistic way-and
        w'ould need considerably tigh ter definition to be acceptable. Sir John does not include
        the fourth Taylor-recommended o ffence of tic k e t touting at a football match which we
        intend to incorporate in the G overnm ent Bill.

                  Sir John's Bill also has t w o 'f u r th e r provisions which are unacceptable: to
        extend the offences to Scotland, which w-e understand the Scottish Office does not w-ish
        to do; and to include a tte n d an c e c e n tre orders amongst the penalties for the proposed
        new offences. This would be inconsistent with existing policy on attendance centres,
        which are reserved for younger offenders and re stric te d to punishment of offences
        w'hich also carry a penalty of imprisonment.

        Handling


                 Given the significant difficulties with th e Bill as currently drafted, we could
        simply block it a t Second Reading. This, though, would be embarrassing: we have
        already indicated our intention to legislate along th e lines proposed by Taylor and it The



        The R t Hon Lord Waddington, QC.
        Lord Privy Seal
        Cabinet Office
        WHITEHALL, S.W.l.                                                                          /cont.

would look odd if we were now to block a Bill which has all-party support and which, to
those not familiar with the detail, would appear to be helpful to the Government’s
position. Moreover, given th a t in his oral evidence to the Select Com m ittee Robin
Ferrers indicated t h a t a Priv ate Member's Bill could be a useful vehicle to bring these
new offences forward, we would be seen as a t b est inconsistent and a t worst as having
acted in bad faith if we were simply to reject the Bill now.

          Another option would be to allow Sir John Wheeler's Bill to pass its Second
Reading and take its chance along with all the other Private Members' Bills.
Realistically, given the pressure on Standing C o m m itte e C and the paucity of tim e a t
R eport and Third Reading stages, the Bill would have very little chance of passing into
law. If it did manage to enter C om m ittee, we could table the necessary' amendments
then. But there would still be a good chance th a t the Bill would founder later.

         Politically, this would be a difficult road to travel as we should come under
intense pressure to provide Government time for the Bill. Whilst we could refuse to do
this on the proper grounds th a t Parliam entary tim e is short, we would be subject to
criticism from all sides. I th e re fo re think we need to look seriously a t the p o s s i b il i t y
of providing time.

            What I should much pre fe r, though, would be to bring forward our own Bill as
soon as possible. I app reciate t h a t Parliamentary’ tim e is short but there is, I believe,
a strong case for acting positively a t a time when the House would probably be very
supportive. My officials have been working on the promised Bill to introduce the four
Taylor offences, and we ex pect to be in a position to bring it forward for Second
Reading not long a f t e r Easter. The tim etable for gettin g it through would be tight, but
th e re is more chance, I think, of taking through a properly drafted Government Bill than
trying to aid a badly drafted P riv a te Member's Bill which would require substantial
amendment a t C o m m itte e Stage.
     *»
         I know th e demands on Parliam ent time, but I am sure th a t there would be
considerable criticism from all sides of the House and from the football authorities if
we were seen to be failing to press ahead with a Government Bill, given the clear
prospect of all-party support. If you and colleagues agree, I will approach John
Wheeler, asking him to withdraw his Bill in return for speedy action and consultation on
the Government Bill.

        I am copying this l e t t e r to all members of HS and LG C om m ittees and to Sir
Robin Butler.

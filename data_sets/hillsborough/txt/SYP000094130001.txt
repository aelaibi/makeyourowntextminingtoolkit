                 At 8.00 am <0800)    on Saturday 15 April         1989 <150489)   I commenced duty

of the Nottingham Constabulary a nd although I was designated for city

centre supervisory     (Dog Section),    my main area of duty was at the

Midland Station along with other Dog Handlers and uniformed officers
'
from various Divisions within the force.

My duties at the Midland Station consisted              the supervision of

supporters who were arriving on speciaj/ymd service trains and being

loaded onto buses and conveyed to H ^ j f e b o y u g h Football G r o u n d .

These suppor ters we re in g o o d \hi*(fiou r and v4ijdk'tmT present any major

problems at this time.       It was noticeable however tha*fr supporters who

were arriving on the later trains had been consuming alcohol of a

larger degree than the earlier arrivals.            In connection with my duties

in the city centre I attended the following incidents occurring                  in

that area.

12.45pm (1245)     Supporters fighting in S n ig Hill - Youths dispersed.

1.20pm (1320)      Fighting Surrey Public House, Norfolk Street - Youths

                   escorted from premises.                        ol&SJL -

1.25pm (1325)      Fighting in Castlegate - Arrests made - Youths

                   dispersed.

1.45pm (1345)      Disturbance Hen Chickens - Persons escorted from

                   premises.

1.50pm (1350)      Disturbance Roebuck Public House, Charles Street

                   Persons escorted from the premises,

Bearing   in mind the problems we have had in the past re supporters                  in

licensed premises,     it was again noticeable that these         persons were

allowed entry into same      by the Landlords.

At approximately 3.05pm      (1505) Qjyerations Room      asked forany Dog

Handler to attend Gate      "O' at/thy^gi^yund where it was said that

problems were arising.       I atterypj^yft the ground from Rutland Road at

the same time requesting West Bar to notify Handlers             taking meal at

that location to attend      also.
                                                                                         PAGE
                                                                                         S3839

    3 . 1 0 pm (1510)       Arrived at the ground where I saw a number of Dog

                            Handlers on the ramp (between the North stand and the

                            Spion Hop) with their respective dogs.  I spoke to
                             N lit3/p
                            Sgt. DENT who informed me he was awaiting instructions

                            from ground control.          I saw that there were a large

                            amount of supporters on the playing area a large

                            number of which were showing hostilities towards

                            Nottingham Forest supporters on the Spion Kop.               Also

                            on the playing area ,s*ire a large number of Police

                            officers.              made    contact with Chief      Inspector

                            BEAL who             1?d the dogs to be placed out of

                            sight        informed Sgt. DENT of this         instruction and !

                            re qu/sted the Handlers to return to and stay with

                            their vehicles       in Penistone Road.     I then returned to

                            the playing area and assisted other officers and

                            supporters    in carrying ir/urej/persons to an area

                            directly outside the q^njjygTs jurn        the rear of the

                            North stand.

    3.40pm (1540)           I then returned to my vehicle in Penistone Road and

              At 0900 hours               on Saturday,        IS April      1989,        I a tt en d ed for duty at

              E c c l e sf i el d Police Station,              Sheffield.         At      1000 hours        the same date            I

               paraded at the N or th Stand at H i ll s b o r o u g h football                         ground for the

               briefing          for the      football m atch between Notts Forest                         FC and

              Liverpool           FC,      I was briefed to patrol              in civilian           clothes       on an

               unmarked Police m o to rc yc le                on the northern side of the grounds,                       in

               relation to thefts               from motor          vehicles    in the area.               I was    not on

              ground        control        radio netweork           but on a C1D net.               From    1200 horus

               onward       I noticed that            public houses some distance                    from the ground had

               large       numbers        of football        fans    congregating          outside     drinking,,       they

              were wearing              red and white         football      regalia and         I took them to be

              L iverpool          fans,     being on the N or th e rn side of the                    city?    at this        time

               1 saw no sign of any trouble                     though the drinkers were                    boisterous.

               There were          also a      large',-number of people walking                     the streets       carrying

               cans and bottles               of drinks.        As the kick off time a p pr o ac h ed at about

               1420 hours           1 noticed that           large groups       of fans were making                 their way

               to the ground singing and                     chanting      though nothing            out    of the

               ordinary.           Some     time     later    I do not know the time I received a call

               over       the    radio     for all CID officers             to return to the ground

                                                                                                                   '•o a d

          entrance.          I i mmediately saw that          something      very serious was wrong

          with Police O ff icers and fans                bringing      in casualties    to the area of the

          police        room and Gym.         I went   out onto     the    pitch towards    the Leppi ngs

          Lane    end of the ground            I saw a large number of casualties                on the

          ground        I gave    first aid to a number,          and     put them in the     recovery

          position,        a number      I tried to help were o bviously dead though                 I

          cannot        recall    any de sc ri pt io n s.     I then gave      fans a ss is t an c e to

          carry     casualties        to the area of the gym.             A number of     casualties were

          lying on the           floor   outside   the gym,     I again gave what assis ta nc e           1

          could.         I then a tt en d ed    inside    the gym and a ss is te d other         officers

          wit h   listing        p ro perty and attem pt in g     to    ID the d e a d , after    they had

          been certified by a doctor.                  I then a ss is te d with the       placing of

          bodies        in body b a g s .

          I then ran a number               of messages     on the motor      cycle   to H am m er t on Road

          Police S t at io n and to the C as ua lt y Bur ea u at E c c l es f ie l d training

          centre.         I then    returned to E c c l e sf i el d Police S ta t io n where        I took

          no further         part   in the     incident.

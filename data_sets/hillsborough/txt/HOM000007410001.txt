                                                     Hillsborough Inquiry

                             I am writing you a personal letter following our
                        deputation on 25th May, 1989, because I feel that the
                        issues we put to you at that meeting are not being
                        resolved.

                             The Clerk to my Authority has had a letter of
                        1st June, 1989, from Mr. Addison (copy enclosed) and has
                        exchanged correspondence with the Clerk of South Yorkshire
                        Police Authority (copies enclosed).  I think you will agree
                        that the current position is most unsatisfactory.

                             I know you are to see South Yorkshire in a few d a y s .
                        I hope that as a result of that meeting you will be able to
                        clarify all those issues that we raised with you and accept
                        that the full costs of the Inquiry are a Home Office
                        responsibility.

            FAXIMILE TRANSMISSION


            Dear Mr A s t U n g
            HILLSBOROUGH INQUIRY
            Thank you for your letter of 6 June enquiring whether the Chief Constable of
            South Yorkshire had invited the Chief Constable of West Midlands to provide
            mutual aid under Section 14 of the Police Act 1964 or indeed any other
            provision.

            The stance of the Police Authority is that the West Midlands Inquiry is now
            reporting exclusively to Lord Justice Taylor. While the first Initiative to
            call in an outside force to enquire into the events at Hillsborough was made by
            the South Yorkshire Chief Constable, the circumstances surrounding this action
            could not in any case fall under either Section 14 of the Police Act 1964 (a
            point which Mr Addison appears to acknowledge) or any other section of this or
            any other Act.

            Furthermore, the subsequent action by the Home Secretary in establishing the
            Taylor inquiry, the considerably wider remit of this inquiry than what would
            have been originally entailed and the lines of reporting observed by the Chief
            Constable of the West Midlands have taken the inquiry completely out of the
            hands of the Chief Constable of South Yorkshire and the Police Authority.
            I sent you earlier a copy of my note of an officer level meeting held at the
            Home Office on 18 May and now attach a further copy which may be of assistance.
            Yours sincerely

                                            Gth June,   1989.

D*ar Mr. Johnston,

                     Hillsborough Inquiry

      Following my telerhone convorsntion with Mr. Walker,             I
refer to the letter dated 1st Juno. 1939. from the Home
Office, to the Solicitor to the Went Midlands Police
Authority, a copy of which ie already with you.

     At the meeting between the West Midlands Police
Authority and the Home Office on ?5th May, we made the
point very strongly that this was a Home Office Inauiry and
should be paid for entirely by the Home Office (thouqh we
thougnt that th© Home Office was likely to look to your
Authority to pay costs up to a lp precept, limit).

     'i'he main thrust of the argument was to the effect that
the Chief Constable of the West Mid lands hart b°en invited
to assist Lord Justice Taylor by the Home Office and was
working under the direction anrt control o* Lord Justice
Taylor.    He had not been invited on a mutual aid basis by
the Chief Constable of South Yorkshire, and was certainly
not under the direction ami control of the Chief Constable
   South Yorkshire.

     It -followed from this that the West Midlands Police
Authority had no powers to meet the costs incurred as part
   the Inquiry, nor to seek reimbursement from the South
Yorkshire Police Authority.    Mr. Addison at <“he Home Office
acknowledged that this was not a "mutual aid" situation
under the provisions of Section 14 of the Pol ire Act. 1364,
but "something akin to mutual aid" which he could neither
define nor explain.   He did, however, maintain that the
invitation to Mr. Pear, although transmitted by way of the
Home Office, actually came from the Chief Constable of
South Yorkshire.   It was therefor**, his suggestion that all
of the bills be paid by the West Midland.*5 p^i ir» Authority
and that South Yorkshi re be renoon?ible for their
reimbursement.


Mr. R. c. Johnston, BA. ippa.
Clerk and Financial Adviser,
South Yorkshire Police Authority
P. O. Box 37,
Regent Street,
Barnsley,
South Yorkshire,
- Mr. R. C. Johnston.

- 6th June,   1989.


     Mr- Addison's argument was and is totally
incomprehensible to us, and h.is letter of the 1st June
again seems to miss the point of whether the Chief
Constable of West Midlands is under the direction and
control of Lord Justice Taylor or the Chief Constable of
South Yorkshire, nor does it address the difficulty that,
whilst the Chief Constable of West Midlands may have a
contractual obligation to moot the costs incurred, the West
Midlands   Police Authority has no powers to meet them.

     The   above is an attempt to set out shortly the
background to where we are now.   What I think I need from
you now,   is a reply stating whether the Chief Constable of
South Yorkshire had invited the Chief Constable of West
Midlands to provide mutual aid under Section 14 of the
Police Act, 1964, or any other provision (whatever that
might be), and whether the South Yorkshire Police Authority
is prepared to meet the total costs incurred by the Chief
Constable of West Midlands in the conduct of this Inquiry,
and to pay the bills direct.

     I shall be pleased if a faxed reply could be sent to
me as soon as possible, so the matter can be out back to
the Home Office.

                      Yours sincerely,




         Clerk to West Midlands Police Authority

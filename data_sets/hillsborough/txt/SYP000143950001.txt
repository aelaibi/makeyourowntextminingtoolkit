             pitch.

Q20.   AT WHAT POINT AND AT WHAT TIME DID YOU FIRST REALISE THAT

       A TR AG E D Y SUCH AS THIS WAS UNFOLD ING ?                PLE ASE EXPLAIN.



       When    the game was stopped            I went       to the halfway      line and

       realised the extent            of the     incident.

       After about       10 mins      from incident,          someone   came    past and said

       there was an old man dead and then after                     12 mins      I heard a

       policeman say there were 40 dead.

        I thought         that   there were     too many      people being allo wed           into

        that end -- that          someone had made a mistake              in the amount           of

        people      they had al lo w e d     in.

                the game should have been a b a nd on ed much sooner.

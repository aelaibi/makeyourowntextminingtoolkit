       Dear Sir

       On 1st April 1990 I was appointed to take over the Hillsborough Disaster
       Inquiry following the appointment of Mr G Dear to the post of Her Majesty’s
       Inspector of Constabulary. Mr Mervyn Jones, Assistant Chief Constable, is
       overseeing the Coronal aspects on behalf of the Coroner Dr Stefan Popper
       and I shall take charge of the Criminal Investigation.

       We are now in a position to commence the interviews of your client at your
       earliest convenience. To assist this if you contact Detective Chief
       Superintendent Foster direct on              the necessary arrangements can
       be made.

       Yours faithfully




       L SHARP

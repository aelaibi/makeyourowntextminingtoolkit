                We     tr av el le d by car from                           a rr iv in g   in S h ef fi el d after a short

                 stop on the M ot or w ay S er v i c es at betw ee n                   10 am - 11 am       (1000 - 1100

                 hrs).     We spent most            the morning        shopping         in S h ef fi el d town.



                We then went by car               to the ground after                 first   going     to the Liverpool
                                                                                            PAGE        2

end by mistake,           we f in al ly    parked about     1.30   pm (1330 hrs)     near to a

building        site at our       end and made our way on foot to the ground,

a r r i v i n g at the S pi o n Ho p turnstiles at appro;-: 1.45 pm (1345 hrs),                   we

had free access at            the turnstiles and found our match viewing                point

w i th o u t   problems.



I remember        seeing    on my    route     to the ground a large^fmount          of fans       in

the    street     drinking       f/'om cans.    All   the   publ i c b^fuses we   passed were

full     and had crowd's outside            drinking.



The    route we took        to the ground was         thro ug h the Liverpool      s up porters

and    I w ould say the          large m aj or i ty were    drinking.



A l t h o u g h some fans were       b oisterous      I didn't     see any disorder    or

f i g hting and a lot of Forest              fans were walking        through without any

problems and there was a general                  feeling    of friendliness.



The    four     of us took       up a position to the        right    hand side of the goal

as you face           the West    stand some 3 to 4 yards           from the front    fence.



At that        time    I noticed the       standing a rea    in front of the West S tand

and thought           how full    it was    that time.



I took we me to the m a tc h by P ra kt i ca 8CA 35m m                camera as   I am a been

a mat eu r     photographer.



At    1.53     prn (1353 hrs)      I started to take        pictur>Kg of the ground         in

                                                                                                                        S2462

           At    that     time    the    large     score    board showed             1352.      I took      in all      13

           shots     of the area at            that time.



           We    remained at the same               viewing      point        but    I took, no more         pictures         for

           some     time.        The four of us were             talking and a lt ho ug h             I could see the

           stand i n g area behind the Liverpool                        goal was        filling      I d i d n ’t pay

           particular        a t t en t i o n as there d i d n ’t appear any great                      difficulty.



           The     t h i rteen    photographs         I took at         1.53 pm        (1353 hrs)       have been

           d e v e l o p e d and when the          prints were          returned to me           I numbered them              in

           time     sequence       from     1 - 13 on the             rear.



           The     next time       I started taking             photographs            of the    players       running        out

           onto     the    pitch the        clock     on the score            board shows         1455 as      in

Orr        took another           10 p h o t o g ra p h ^ y^ h ic h    I n um bered up to and             including

           two     centre Pensyltfere full               to capa ci ty and                    how tightly           packed      in

           the     fans ws



           I carried on taking               photographs and used up the whole 24 exposures,

           which     took up till           just    prior     to kick         off.



           Whe n    the m atch had been             in progress             for some 3 to 5 minutes                 I noticed

           that     fans    in the       standing a rea behind the Liverpool                         goal    were       climbing

           a n d being      hauled up into           the    seated area and others                   trying        to   climb

           the     side and front           fences.        It was w it h in seconds              of this that           the

           referee        stopped the game and the                    players       left   the field.
                                                                                               PAGE            4
                                                                                               S2462

W it h the amount       of fans       being    pulled over      the fences and being            hauled

into    the seated area         I d i d n ’t get a very good view of what was                   going

on and    I formed the opin io n that they were                   fighting amongst          themselves

an d spilling     onto    the     pitch.



I could by this         time    see     that   literally hundreds              of fans were on the

pitch some      lying m ot io n le s s and others app ea ri ng                 to give first aid.



After a few minutes            some were       being moved on temporary s tretchers                  to

our end of the ground w hi ch              caused the Forest             fans to start      jeering

an d started waving           of singing       "Cheerio,     cheerio".



This w ould be        going    on foj^'Some time and at one stajg^T Liverpool                    fans

ran towarct us        •*-n a tJ^eat e n i ng manner and thij^/fras when the Police

cordon was      put across        the    pitch.    This    c o j/a o n   did    i t ’s job an d stopped

what    might   Yyfoe    been a problem.           Even at this          late stage       I didn't

realise    the gravity of the             incident,    neither did any Forest                fans and

it was about      this     time    some forty minutes after                the game was       stopped

that we found out by wor d of m outh how serious                          it was,     the attitude        of

the Forest      fans     changed and       clapped every effort                that was   being made.



Just after      the     line of Police were          put across          the    pitch my brother

           fainted from the             heat and    shock and was          passed onto the       pitch,

and he e v e n t u a l ly went     to hospital



I left the ground wit h the               two girls about 4.15             pm    (1615 hrs)    to go

and    find my brother.



Whilst    I was at the         ground     I d i d n ’t see a ny thing          that   I class as a

criminal    offence.

Under   the     conditions and the amount            of    casualties       I think all    the

s ervices Police,          fire and St J o h n ’s m a na ge d very well.           The only

c r itisism     I can make      is the d if fi cu lt y that was e xp er ienced            in getting

injured fans        to the a mb ul an ce s and the a mb ul an ce s          into the ground.


                    1055
I a t t e n d e d the same    fix tu nr ^l as t year and thie^Ko 1 ice o p er at io n was

very    smooth and       in toj^il     control   with fj^rs being filtered thr ough

a cordon some disj/^rice from the q r o j y / m            to their     respective

turnstiles.         This    seemed     lacking^his        time,   and   I cannot    say    I noticed

any Police       outside     the     ground with fans milling about u n su p er v is e d and

it was only their           good behaviour       that     no problems were e x pe ri en ce d

outs i d e .



I cannot       remember     seeing any stewards and            I feel    the   club must     be held

r esponsible       due to lack        of stewards.



T. cannot      u nd er st an d why    it took so    long to       put out    i nformation about

the s er i ousness       of the      incident over      the   public address and          I feel a

lot of nasty        incidents        of jeering and the Police           line across       the   pitch

w o ul d have    been a v oi de d     if i nformation had been passed.



I produce       the 24     colour     photographs    that     I took together w ith         the 24

n eg atives and      I now    produce     them a Exhibit No SMC1.

                        states:-


1.   I am employed as a qualified ambulance man at SYMAS.


2.   My date of birth is 28th March 1941.


3.   I began work with the Sheffield Ambulance Service in 1973
     and qualified in about 1975.         I have been with SYMAS since
     the ambulance service was transferred to them from the
     Sheffield City Council.       I am based at Longley Ambulance
     Station.


4.   I was off duty on Saturday 15th April and was listening to
     Radio Hallam, some time after 1500.         I knew there was an
     incident at Hillsborough because they were asking over the
     radio for doctors and nurses.        I rang control and asked if I
     was required.   I spoke to a control assistant who asked me
     to report to my own station.


5.   I arrived at Longley Ambulance Station a little after 1530.
                  and                 were already there.    They told
     me they had already radioed control who had said to take any
     vehicle to Hillsborough using the ERC channel.        I went with
                     I drove.      We booked off station on ERC and
     were told by control to go to the ground.          I don't recall
     being told which end to go.

6.   We arrived at Penistone Road from Herries Road south at
     about 1540 and parked up behind three or four ambulances
     which were already parked in Penistone Road.          Station
     Officer Eason came up to us.    We were driving a day vehicle
     whose call sign was S462       and which could only transport
     patients in a sitting position.    We waited for two to three
     minutes for our turn to come up to drive into the yard off
     Penistone Road    and we drove in front first.    We loaded up
     with ten walking wounded and were told by                  to go
     to the Royal Hallamshire and we did so by going north up
     Penistone Road to the roundabout and then down Leppings
     Lane.

7.   We arrived at the Royal Hallamshire Hospital at about        and
     unloaded the casualties at the fracture clinic.      I radioed
     control that we were green at Royal Hallamshire and we were
     told to go to Netherthorpe Parkway but before we got there
     we were told to go to the Herries Road Bus Garage where we
     arrived at about 1620.


8.   Mr Eason was in charge at Herries Road Bus Garage and I
     waited there until about 1750.     During that time Mr Eason
     told             to proceed on foot to the ground to assist.


9.   On Mr Eason's instructions I drove to the ground at 1750 and
     parked in Penistone Road, opposite the ground.       Mr Eason
     came    over   to me and told me to call         control    for


                                 177
        instructions.     I called control on channel 4 and was told to
        return to station and book off.


10.     I arrived back at Longley at about 1830 and booked off.


Dated    this   ^       day of   Mfoj     1989.

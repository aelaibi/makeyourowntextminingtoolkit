Dear Mr Dabbs

Re : Murray and Duckenfield

You will recall my instructions on behalf of Mr Bernard Murray. In answer to the summons
issued by the Prosecution against the South Yorkshire Police, a number of videos were
brought to Court.

An Order was made by Mr Justice Hooper that the videos could be released into the personal
custody of a Partner of this firm. We have therefore made an approach to the Crown Court for
the release of the videos. We have had a call from Sharon Grimes at the Leeds Crown Court.
She says that the videos have never been in the possession of the Crown Court and that when
all of the paperwork came over the videos were not there and that they are locked in a room at
the Magistratesâ€™ Court.

At the present time save for the composite video, we have not been able to view any of the
other videos. Would you be good enough to confirm that you have located the videos. Would
you then confirm what arrangements can be made by the writer to uplift these videos so as to
view the same.

 lours faithfully



R B Manning

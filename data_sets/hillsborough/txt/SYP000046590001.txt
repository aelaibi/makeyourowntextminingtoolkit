  Dear Hr Birts

  I enclose statements from Chief Superintendent Mole and Chief
  Superintendent Denton, South Yorkshire Police, which cover the areas we
  discussed at the meeting on Friday 20 April 1990.

  Detective Superintendent Taylor is pursuing the BOWNES statement and once
  that is received it will be forwarded.

  The statements enclosed are numbered for insertion in the relevant part of
  the file, Chief Superintendent Mole in Part II and Chief Superintendent
  Denton in Part V. Amended alphabetical witness lists are included with
  the statements to insert in each Part.

  Yours sincerely




  M J FOSTER
  DETECTIVE CHIEF SUPERINTENDENT

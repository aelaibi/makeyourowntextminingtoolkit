                  Note For Hillsborough Enquiry File
Approx. 3 p.m. on Thursday, 8th August 1996,1 received a telephone call from a former
police officer, Mr Derek Bruder. (                   Mr Bruder had been a Merseyside police
officer at the time of the Hillsborough Disaster and had been present at the scene.

Mr Bruder stated that he had recently received a letter from Katie Jones o f Granada TV via his
parent's home address. Ms Jones informed him that she was making a 'factual drama' based on
Hillsborough and she was interested in the death of Kevin Williams. She went on to say that
she was aware that a great deal o f pressure had been put on Mr Bruder by the West Midlands
Police to alter his statement to the enquiry and to the Coroner's Court. The letter was marked
'private and confidential' and she requested to speak with Mr Bruder in confidence.

Mr Bruder contacted Ms Jones                        md informed her that he was not interested
in participating in the making of the 'drama', having previously refused to become involved in
the making of a similar programme concerning the death o f Kevin Williams last year. During
the conversation that Mr Bruder had with Ms Jones she implied that the Chief Constable of
Cheshire, whilst heading the Hillsborough Enquiry, had exerted pressure on Mr Bruder to
change his statement. Mr Bruder told her that this was not the case and that both the Chief
Constable and Merseyside Police had been very supportive of him and had most definitely not
tried to pressurise him into altering any statement that he had made.

Since the conversation with Ms Jones, Mr Bruder had become aware of further approaches
being made to his parents, presumably by Granada, in an attempt to locate his home address.

The purpose of this telephone call was to advise the Chief Constable of Granada's intentions
and of the allegations that were being made by them in case any attempts were made to
compromise him.

I thanked Mr Bruder for bringing this to my attention and our conversation was concluded.

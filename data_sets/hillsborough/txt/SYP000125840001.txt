            CONTROL THE CROWD BUT WERE UNSUCCESSFUL, MORE OFFICERS CALLED TO
            ASSIST WITH THE CROWD CONTROL.CROWD WAS PUSHING EVERYONE INTO THE
            POLICE HORSES.PEOPLE WERE GOING UNDER HORSES JUST TO GET AWAY
            FROM THEM. THE HORSES WERE BEING PUSEHED SIDEWAYS, THATS WHAT THE

POLICE WERE TRYING VERY HARD TO CONTROL THE CROWD BUT THERE WERE NOWHERE NEAR
ENOUGH OFFICERS, ALTHOUGH THEY WERE DOING THEIR VERY BEST. I SPLIT UP FROM MY
FRIEND. I WAS IN THE CRUSH AND GOT STUCK AGAINST THE WALL BUT SOMEBODY HELPED
ME THROUGH THE TURNSTILES. I HAD A TKT AND HANDED IT IN AT THE TURNSTILE. I
GOT INTO THE GROUND AT ABOUT 145QHRS. I TRIED TO FIND MY FRIENDS BUT COULDNT.
I THEN WENT UNDER THE STAND THROUGH THE TUNNEL AND IN TO PEN B. I SAW THE
GATE BEING OPENED. I COULD SEE IT WAS PACKED IN THE TERRACES BUT COULDNT GET
OUT AS PEOPLE STILL COMING IN. MORE AND MORE SURGES AS THE TIME CAME CLOSE TO
K1QK OFF. I WENT DOWNTOWARDS THE FRONT AND TO MY LEFT-JUST BEHIND THE LEFT
B M B GOAL POST AS I WAS LOOKING AT IT. IT WAS STILL GETTING WORSE,AND
DIFFICULT TO BREATHE.PEOPLE WERE SHOUTING FOR THE GAME TO BE STOPPED.THERE
WERE NO ANNOUNCEMENTS ON THE TANNOY SYSTEM AND THE NEXT THING WAS THAT THE
GAME WAS STOPPED. DAZED CHILDREN WERE BEING LIFTED OUT THERE WAS A YOUNG BALD
HEADED POLICEMAN AT THE FRONT OF THE FENCE TRYING TO OPEN THE FENCE. HE WAS
NOT SUCCESSFUL BUT HELPED ALL THE SMALL CHILDREN AND WOMEN OUT ON TO THE
PITCH. THE CRUSH STATED TO EASE AFTER ABOUT 10 MINITUES. A FEW OF US GRABBED
HOLD OF EACH OTHER AND PULLED EACH OTHER OUT. I SAW A FEW PEOPLE WHO HAD BEEN
CRUSHED AGAINST A FENCE I SAW ONE MAN WHO WAS BLUE, HE HAD BEEN CRUSHED
AGAINST A BARRIER HE WAS ABOUT MID 40S AND OBVIOUSLY DEAD. SOMEONE WAS
SCREAMING HES DEAD TO THE POLICE. AND THE POLICE WERE SAYING THAT HE WAS
DOING HIS BEST TO HELP. THE POLICE WERE ALSO VERY AGITATED THAT THEY WERE NOT
ABLE TO REACH THE DEAD AND INJURED BUT WERE TRYING THEIR BEST TO HELP
EVERYONE THAT THEY COULD. I WISH I COULD HAVE HELPED THOSE PEOPLE WHO DIED. I
WENT BACK OUT THEN AND PEOPLE WERE CARRING OUT THE INJURED THROUGH THE
TUNNEL.ALL SERVICES DID THEIR BEST ESPECIALLY THE FIREMEN AND THE POLICE.
POLICE WERE ALSO TRYING TO CONSOUL THE PEOPLE UPSET BY THE DEATHS. I SAW TWO
STEWARDS STANDING IN THE OPEN AREA BY THE LEPPINGS LANE TUNNEL. THERE SHOULD
HAVE BEEN MORE STEWARDS TO GIVE PEOPLE DIRECTIONS.

WHERE TO GO. ALSO THE POLICE WERE MOSTLY BETWEEN THE TURNSTYLES AND THE
TUNNEL AND THEY SEEMED MORE CONCERNED WITH THE PEOPLE CLIMBING OVER THE WALLS
BUT THEY WERE JUST TRYING TO GET OUIT OF THE CRUSH. WHEN I WENT DOWN THE
TUNNEL I STOOD BEHIND THE GOALS BUT I WAS QUITE A WAY BACK BUT ALL OF A

NO|j|ING I COULD DO. AFTER AS WHILE SOME POLICE OFFICERS CAME AT THE BACK AND

ONLY INJURY I OBTAINED WAS A LONG SCRATCH ON MY ARM AND MY LEGS WIRE BRUISED.

BEHIND US. THERE WERE BARRIERS TO THE LEFT AND RIGHT OF US SO WE COULDN'T GET
OUT. WHEN THE BIG SURGE STARTED MY FEET WERE LIFTED OFF THE GROUND AND AT ONE
STAGE I WAS VERY WORRIED ABOUT MY MATE. WE RECEIVED BRUISES AND CUTS. THE
BIGGEST PROBLEM WAS THE LACK OF POLICE AND STEWARDS INSIDE THE GROUND
COORDINATING THE PUBLIC.

CARRIED AWAY AGAIN WITH THE GROUND. WE THEN MADE OUR WAY TO THE PEN TO THE
FAR RIGHT OF THE GOAL BUT THERE WAS NOONE TO TELL US WHERE TO GO AND IT
JUSTED LOOKED LIKE A BRICK WALL BUT SOMEONE HAD SAID THERE WAS A PEN THERE SO
WE WENT. ONCE WE GOT INTO THAT PEN THERE WAS ALOT OF SPACE.
I NOTICED THAT THE CENTRE PENS PACKED IN LIKE SARDINES BEHIND THE GOAL AND
p||j>LE WENT ONTO THE PITCH. SUPPORTERS HELPED A HEFTY MAN OVER THE FENCE
BlltND THE GOAL. THERE WERE MEN ON THE FLOOR. POLICE WERE BANGING ON THE
CHEST. FANS THEN WENT AND GOT THE STRETCHERS AND WE REMAINED WHERE WE WERE.
WE DIDIN'T WANT TO GO ON THE GROUND AS IT WOULD HAVE GOT OVER CROWDED. WAITED
FOR AND ANNOUNCEMENT TO SAY WE COULD LEAVE... THIS DID TAKE A LONG TIME TO
COME.
I WOULD LIKE TO SAY THAT   THE POLICE HAD NO CHOICE BUT TO OPEN THE GATES BY
THE TURNSTILES AS PEOPLE   WOULD HAVE BEEN KILLED OUT THERE.....ALSO THE LOCAL
PEOPLE WHO LIVED NEAR TO   THE GROUND WERE VERY GOOD LETTING PEOPLE INSIDE TO
SIT DOWN UNTIL THEY FELT   BETTER

WERE TRYING TO GET THEM OUT OF THE CRUSH. THE GATE WAS EVENTUALLY OPENED AND
I MADE MY WAY THROUGH AS I HAD SPLIT UP FROM MY FRIENDS. I MADE MY WAY
THROUGH THE TUNNEL TO THE PEN AND STOOD IN THE STAND. IT WAS FAIRLY BUSY
THEN. THERE APPEARED TO BE A SUDDEN SURGE AND I WAS TRAPPED CLOSE TO THE
FRONT ABOUT SIX FROM THE FENCE. ALL I COULD REMEMBER WAS THAT I COULD NOT
BREATH AND MY CHEST WAS HURTING ME. I WENT BLANK AFTER THAT AND PASSED OUT
WHILST STANDING UP. THE NEXT THING I CAN REMEMBER WAS WAKING UP. THERE WAS
A DEAD PERSON ON TOP OF ME AND I THINK A COUPLE UNDERNEATH. A FAN HELPED ME
UP-&ND TOOK ME THROUGH THE TUNNEL AND TO THE FORECOURT OUT OF THE GROUND.
Th QPe WERE BODIES ALL OVER THE PLACE AND WOUNDED PEOPLE. THERE WAS LITTLE
MEDICAL ATTENTION BUT THE CONVEYANCE OF THE INJURED AND DEAD APPEARED TO BE A
LITTLE ORGANIZED. THEY PLACED PEOPLE INTO THE AMBULANCES THAT WERE WAITING
AND THE WALKING WOUNDED WENT LAST.
_____ t A S FOR WHAT TOOK PLACE DURING THE CRUSH I AM AFRAID I CAN NOT HELP AS
 I WAS UNCONCIOUS THROUGH MOST OF IT. ALL I CAN REMEMBER IS WHAT HAPPENED
 AFTERWARDS AND THE SCENES IN THE TUNNEL.
MY FRIEND IS                     CONTACT NUMBER.

I MANAGED TO GET THROUGH TURNSTYLE B . ONCE INSIDE ONLY 4 OF US GET IN AND WE
ALL WAITED ON THE STEPS INSIDE THE TURNSTYLES FOR MY OTHER FRIEND.
WHILST WAITING HERE A POLICEMAN OPENED THE GATE IN THE WALL. THERE WERE 2
STEWARDS BY THE GATE AND THEY REFUSED TO DO IT SO THE POLICEMAN OPENED IT
HIMSELF.
WHEN THE GATE OPENED EVERYONE JUST PILED IN IT WAS LIKE A STAMPEDE. THEY ALL
WENT DOWN THE TUNNEL ENTRANCE.
THERE WAS NO-ONE ASKING FOR TICKETS AND NO ONE DIRECING THEM WHERE TO GO.
I WAS STILL WAITING FOR MY FRIEND AND THE GATE IN THE WALL WHICH HAD BEEN
CLOSED WAS OPENED AGAIN AND THE SAME THING HAPPENED AGAIN.
TH^pfEXT THING I SAW WAS SHOUTING AND SCREAMING
PEOPLE WERE SCREAMING AT THE POLICE AND THE STEWARDS TO OPEN THE GATE BEHIND
THE GOAL WHICH GOES INTO THE TUNNEL WHICH HAD BEEN CLOSED
THIS POLICEMAN MADE HIS WAY OVER TO THE DOOR AND OPENED THE GATE. PEOPLE WERE
JUST THROWN OUT. PEOPLE WERE CRYING. THERE WERE SOME MEN ON THE FLOOR AND
WERE BEING TRAMPLED ON BY THE CROWD. PEOPLE WERE TRYING TO RESUSITATE THE
INJURED.
THE NEXT THING THERE WERE LOTS OF POLICE WHO RAN FROM BEHIND THE TURNSTYLES
AND INTO THE GROUND.
I FOUND MY FRIEND EVENTUALLY AND WE LEFT THE GROUND

ELSE. IT ISN'T UNTIL YOU GET INTO THE PEN THAT YOU REALISE HOW PACKED IT IS,
BUT YOU CAN'T GET BACK OUT BECAUSE OF ALL THE PEOPLE BEHIND YOU AND THE FACT
THAT YOU ARE PENNED IN AT THE SIDES. ONCE INSIDE THE TERRACE YOU WERE GETTING
PUSHED TO THE FRONT. IT WAS GETTING WORSE ALL THE TIME. I WAS GETTING THAT
CRUSHED THAT I DIDN'T NOTICE IF THE MATCH HAD STARTED OR NOT. I WAS CRUSHED
UP AGAISNT THE FRONT FENCE FOR ABOUT 15 OR 20 MINUTES, NOBODY COULD MOVE. MY
ARMS WERE REALLY HURTING, PEOPLE STARTED TO CLIMB OVER THE FENCE, I TRIED TO
FOLLOW AND GOT ABOUT HALF WAY UP BUT COULDN'T GET ANY FURTHER. A POLICEMAN
r a m CAME OVER AND PULLED ME OVER. ON THE PITCH I LOST CONSCIOSNES FOR ABOUT
TEWklNUTES. A THE TIME I DIDN'T THINK THE POLICE WERE BOTHERED EXCEPT THE
ONE THAT PULLED ME OVER THE FENCE, HE MUST HAVE SAVED MY LIFE.

SMALL GATE AND ONLY ONE PERSON COULD GET OUT AT A TIME. I SPENT ABOUT AN HOUR
WALKING ROUND THE PITCH LOOKING FOR MY MATES,I FOUND ONE,THAN WENT LOOKING
FOR OTHERS,I WAS SENT TO A TEMP.MORGE BUT THEY WERE NOT THERE THANK GOD,I
FOUND THEM LATER,ONE CALLAPSED AND WAS TREATED BY THE ST JOHNS MEN,WE WERE
ALL ARIGHT IN THE END.I THINK THE MAIN PROBLEM WAS THAT A LOT OF THE PEOPLE
OUTSIDE THE GROUND HEARD THE START OF THE MATCH AND PANICKED THAT THEY WOULD
N O B E E IT AT ALL SO THEY STARTED PUSHING, IF THE WAS SOME SORT OF
ORGANISATION OUTSIDE THEN THIS WOULDN'T HAPPENED,I HAVE BEEN TO MANY MATCHES
AND THERE WES POLICE TELLING PEOPLE TO GET INTO ORGANISED QUEUES AND GO
THROUGH ONE AT A TIME.THE MATCH SHOULD HAVE BEEN DELIED THAN THOSE OUTSIDE
WOULDN'T HAVE BEEN PANICKING AND PUSHING.THE LACK OF ORGANISATION WAS VERY
OBVIOUS.
THEY SAID WE PUSHED AND GOT IN WITHOUT TICKETS BUT I STILL HAD MY WITH ME
AND THE NEXT DAY WROTE A LETTER TO THE LIVERPOOL ECHO AND SEND MY TICKET
WITH IT.                                                             ____

INFO      »   I ARRIVED AT THE GAME EARLY, AT ABOUT 215PM, I WASNT AWARE OF
              PEOPLE OUTSIDE TRYING TO GET HOLD OF TICKETS, IT APPEARED THAT
              MOST PEOPLE HAD TICKETS. AT NO-ONE TIME WAS I AWARE OF ANYBODY
              BEHAVING BADLY. I WENT LAST YEAR AND THE SAME SECTION HAD TOO
              MANY PEOPLE IN THEN. INSIDE THAT PARTICULAR SECTION WAS OVER
              FULL WHEN I GOT. AT ABOUT 245PM, THAT AREA WAS REALLY PACKED,
              UNCOMFORTABLY SO...PG3

WE TRIED TO GET OUT OF THERE INTO THE SIDE PARTS BUT COULDNT MOVE, I HEARD
PEOPLE SHOUTING TO THE POLICE BEFORE THE PLAYERS CAME OUT, THAT THERE WIRE
FAR TOO MANY PEOPLE IN THAT SECTION AND THAT THEY SHOULDNT LET ANY MORE IN.
THE POLICE DIDNT SEEM TO TAKE ANY NOTICE. WHICH IS A FAIRLY TIPICAL REACTION
FROM THEM TO HOOLIGANS. ONCE THE PLAYERS CAME OUT ONTO THE PITCH, I COULD
SEE NOTHING BECAUSE WE WERE SO PACKED IN. THE DESIGN OF THE TERRACES THERE
SEEMED POOR AS ONCE YOU WERE IN THERE WAS NO WAY YOU COULD MOVE OUT TO THE
SIDE OR TO THE BACK. ONCE THE GAMEHAD STOPPED THE POLICE WERE TELLING
    ?LE TO MOVE BACK, WHICH WAS IMPOSSIBLE TO MOVE BACK BUT IT FELT AS IF WE
      AGAINST A BRICK WALL. I SAW SOME POLICE BASHING THE SPIKES DOWN WITH
THEIR BARE HANDS TO GET PEOPLE OUT. THE WORST CASUALTIES APPEARED TO HAVE
BEEN WERE THE GATE WAS OPENED, PROBABLY BECAUSE PEOPLE RUSHED TO TRY AND GET,
THEY WERE TREADING ON PEOPLE TO GET OUT. I WHISLT I WAS STILL INSIDE I
HELPED TO GET SOME OF THE PEOLE OUT, TAKING THEM OUT THROUGH THE TUNNEL. I
HELPED CARRY ABOUT FOUR PEOPLE/BODIES OUT, I WENT BACK IN AND COULD SEE THAT
99PER CENT OF THOSE THAT WERE LEFT WERE DEAD. BY THEN I WAS EMOTIONALLY
DRAINED, SO MY FRIENDS AND I MADE OUTR WAY OUT TO A PHONE TO NOTIFY OUR
FAMILIES.
IT WAS OBIVIOUS THAT THESE PEOPLE HAD SUFFOCATED FROM THEIR COLOUR AND THE
LOOKS ON THEIR FACES. ONCE PEOPLE REALISED WHAT WAS HAPPENING EVERYONE WAS
MARVELLOUS, AND THEY ALL COPED VERY      WELL.
THERE WAS NO CONTROL TO ENSURE THATTHE MIDDLE SECTIONS DID NOT GET TO FULL.
I WAS WITH TWO FRIENDS

            OVER 1,000 PEOPLE OUTSIDE.THERE IS A ROW OF SMALL GATES BETWEEN
            THE ENTRANCE AND THE TURNSTILES.THEY HAD ONLY        OPINED THE
            CENTER ONE AND THE 2 MOUNTED POLICEMEN WERE DIRECTING EVERYONE
               THROUGH THE SMALL OPENING SO PEOPLE WERE BEING CRUSHED CONT

AND PUSHED ALONG.THERE WAS TOTAL CONFUSION.I COULD ONLY SEE THE 2 MOUNTED
OFFICERS.THERE WAS NO FOOT OFFICERS OR STEWARDS.I HAVE BEEN TO THE GROUND
BEFORE BUT OTHERS SEEMED LOST AND NO ONE WAS DIRECTING THEM.THERE WAS ONLY 3
TURNSTILES OPEN AND EVERYONE WAS TRYING TO PUSH THERE WAY THROUGH.THE BIG
GATE WAS OPEN AND THE CROWD JUST SURGED FORWARD.NO ONE ASKED FOR MY TICKET
WHICH I STILL HAVE.ON ENTERING LEEPINGS LANE I TURNED TO MY RIGHT AND HEADED
TOWARDS PEN 2
I^HINK THAT IF MORE OFFICERS AND STEWARDS HAD BEEN OUTSIDE AND DIRECTED AND
CONTROLLED THE CROWD BETTER THIS TRAGEDY WOULD NOT HAVE HAPPENED

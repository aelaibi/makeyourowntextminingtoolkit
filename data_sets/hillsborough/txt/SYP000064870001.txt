Throughout            this    period        I spoke        to m any of the Liverpool                  supporters

arriving          in the S t an d all             of who m were           friendly,          happy and none          of

w h o m a p p e a r e d to have           been drinking             intoxicants.

At a p p r o x i m a t e l y 2.5 0        pm a s the         players       c^roe onto         the f i e l d , I

remember          looking at the L ep pi nq s Lage ter ra ci ng                          immediately        in front

of my      po si tion        in the S t a n d and noticing                  there a pp e a r e d to be an

unusual         a mount      of spaces          in the sections             of terracing             behind Gates          ~1

a nd 2.

I was a ware           that the m a t c h was all                  ticket and          I felt that         10 minutes

before      kick off          the g ro u n d w ou ld have been               completely            full.

As   the m a t c h kic^^edToff at 3.00                        pm I noti ce d a          sudden surge         of

approximately             150 to 200            spec^artors rush             past the side            of the West

S t a n d onto        the t e rracing           behind Gate           1, w h i c h     had    previously been

r e la t i v e l y spars ely          populated.             This     seemed strange             because     prior        to

this     s pe ct at ors       had        been filing              into this      part of the ground          in      a

s te ad y flow of 8 or                   10 at a time.               At    the   same time       I saw a surge            of

s p ec t a t o r s    pushi.ng/'f'orwards             in the^tyo           centre      'pens*     of the L ep pings

Lane     t e rr ac ing       resulting          in a sort of domino                  effect wit h all

supporters            surging        onto     the     fencing ar ou nd           the    perimeter       of the

te rracing.            As suppo rt er s           continued to st re am                past the side         of the

s ta n d w h er e      I was       positioned,            several         of them tried to climb over                     the

        to become          very   crowded w i t h         people       standing      all along          the    front of

        the S t a nd a nd         it became          difficult        to move a ro u n d the S t an d at all,

        with       people    s tanding        in the gangways.              B e c au se   of this myself,              PS

        B U R M A N and PC S C H Q L E Y stayed by the e m e r ge nc y gate at the                             front    of

        the s tand and pre ve nt ed                  people     coining into         the stand over            the   fencing

        a nd sto pp in g       the s it u a t i o n      in the stand becoming any more                        crowded.          I

        n ot ic e d at this           time    that     the attitude         of the supporters                 on the

        L e pp i ng s Lane        terracing          star te d to become          hostile        towards       the Police,

        a cc u s i n g    ’u s ’ of    causing        this by opening a gate.

        As more and more               s p ec ta to rs    got onto the ground,                I saw      people      being

        g iv en m o u th to m o u t h and heart massage and                          it became a pp ar en t          that

        people were           badly     injured or even dead.

        However,          from the time          the game was            stop pe d    it seemed 20 m i n u t e s            or

        so before any message                   or    instructions were              passed over the Police

        radio and          I cannot       remember        any d irections            for Police O ff ic er s           to go

        onto       the    pitch or stay where               they were and            it was a p p a r e n t l y      left to

        individual           officers        discretion.

        We    r e ma in ed    in the S t a n d        in an effort         to keep the si tu at io n              calm and

        to try to          prevent any w o r s e n i n g         of the o v e r cr ow di ng        in the Stand.

        A f te r    it was     eventually announced                    the m a t c h was abandoned,             we

        c on t in u ed to prevent             spect at or s       leaving     via the e mergency gate as the

        e m e r ge n cy ve hi cles        had    cleared.

        A f t er    the    crowd had e ve nt u a l l y          cleared we        returned to the g^jpftasium

        w h i c h was w h e n      I was      first aware             of the numbers        of    casualties.

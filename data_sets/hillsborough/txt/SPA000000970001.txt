    TO: All South Yorkshire Police Authority Members


    Dear Member

    Hillsborough

    I am writing to inform you that, having spoken to the Chairman, I will be arranging a
    special meeting of the Authority for Friday 5 February at 11am. The venue is still to be
    decided.

    At that meeting, representatives of the Hillsborough families, the former police officers,
    and the Chief Constable will be invited to make statements to the Authority. Members will
    also receive a report from Garrett & Co, the Authorityâ€™s legal advisers on this matter,
    setting out their proposals as to how the matter should be handled.

    A formal notice of meeting will be sent out on Friday, and papers will probably be
    delivered by Monday at the latest.
%   Yours sincerely




    Bill Wilkinson
    Clerk and Treasurer

A     \ \ ^           Before we got to She£<TL e 1d we stopped                            a pub on the outsio

                      the town.            Ldon'^t know the name of The                pub but         I remenroer that    there

fans having a drink.

When we got to the end of the H67 Hator^gfy We were d e l a y e d h e a v y

traffic for about an hour.

We eventually arrived at Sheffield at a boy#''2.30prn (1430) and I
                                      jrZ '
parked 1 n the road between Leppi ngs Lajxr
                                          “
                                            and P arksLsre R o a d .                                  When I got

there I saw 2 police oj/piTcers by                         police building and they said that

it would be allrighJc to park my car there.                               We then made our way to

the ground after the 2 police officers told us «hich way to go.                                                We

got to the entrance of the ground be twee 0^^735                               (1435) and £.40 pm (1440)

and on the way from where we parked trfe car                               I didn't see any fighting

or drunkeness at allv"              When we gotto the turnstiles there was                               a

great mass of pejyple outside then.                             They wern't        in any sort of qu^ue

just a mass urnts i de . JfJtitside the turnstiles                          I saw      Z p o 11 c        i ce r s

who were on ho r s e 't/^ c k „       One/of the               officers was to t>te left of

turnstiles n ear t h e c o n c e r t i n §/>*ga t e s and the o'Vaj&F officer was on the

other side of the crowd tar the r :i.ghit of th^ /f ur ns1 11 es ,                               These two

officers were directing               the people           in between them to the middle and

towards the turnstiles.

Beforegot          to   the      turnstile area I a l s o .saw about 3 o r 4                             ice

see any stewapas at all at the                       turnstiles.           1 didn't      have any problem

finding rsty entry point but                   I had problems getting               in the ground

because of all the            people          packed so tightly t o g e t h e r .           I ended       up

getting pushed against the concertina gate on the left of the

turnstiles and I was then pushed towards the                                first turnstile           on the

left.     I went t h r o u g h this f i r st           turnstile not as a matter of choice

1 was just p u s h e d through.                  1 went through the turnsj/lie and handes

over my t ij^fet .       They gave me back the ti cjji^ stub and. I. went

through.       The turnstile          only allows orfe person to go through at a

time.     I have been to this football                         ground before and as              I got

thro u g h the t u rnstiles            I went       straight          to the toilets w h i c h were

right    in front       of me.        When I went to the toilet                           there were           no

problems with the             crowd and all the                people        could walk about                  quite

freely.       When    I came      out     of     the toilets           I was     facing           the    turnstiles         I

saw that the gate             to the      left of the           t u rnstiles         was         open and       people

were wal king through.                 The      people w e r n ’t rushing                 through the gate

they were walking             quite     orde r l y towards             the     ground.            I also       saw a

police officer          who was        standing        on top of the J ^ ^ n s t i le I had come

terraces which is next to the toilets                             I had been                            went    in the

tunnel    following the crowd and at the entrance                                  I could see the

football      pitch at the other side and I could see players                                            running on

the pitch so I knew that the match had already started

As I was aboot three quarters of the way along                                     the J t unnei           I saw 3

them /faying       tfiat it      was full          in the stands and they were not going to

stay in the stands.              They then walked back against the on coming

crowd but they d i d n ’t seem to have any difficulty getting thra*Sgh.                                                     I

            about half way down when I was pushed a 1ong y r t h e                        crowd over towards

            my left as I was looking at the pitch.                         this point I saw about 5 o r

            6 people fall over on the ground and I was stuck                        in the crowd there

            for about 30 seconds.           During this time one of the people on the

            floor asked me to give him a hand to get up again.                             I tried to help him

            up but it was not possible so I tried to help a man next to him on

            the ground.       The person who asked me to help was a wfcHfte man,, about                        IS-

a/ YY1-     19 years old and he was wearing a light blue juriyrer.                           I remember that

ffc>_ Vfe   he spoke with a L.i v e r po o 1 a c c e n t .   As I was Vrying to help the other

            man on the floor       I suddenly got carried away agaijyby the crowd over

            to my right and over to the r a 13. i n g s 1 ea d i n g ]/6 p e n N o 2 .            During

            this   time the crowd were being           pushed by preople coming from behind me

            and leaving no room for the people               in JUrfe stand to move back.               This

            pushing happened from about G|_.02 pm            502 ) onwards .

            When I was by the railings             l e a g   to pen No 2 I saw a young                  ite

            boy aged about      10 y e a r s who        struggling        to ge t j / o ut of J m e   crowd

            and over the fence        into jj/rt No 2.       I helped             boy over this fenci

            and I then climbed ovyr          it myself.       1' r e m p b e r   that when I. was       in the

            middle of pen No 3 and the people had fallen over                        I. saw a pplice j>sn

             ho was on top of the fence between the crowd and' the pitcn.      f saw

            him bend over the metal          on top of the femre and then he leaned over

            the fence to try to help the people / v e r                 the f e n c e .    He was a young

            jU^oking police officer with fa i r                     I di dn 't see if he was able

                help anyone as I was forced along again in the crowd.                            I didn't

            get any injuries and I d i d n ’t, see anyone killed or injured although                           I

            saw the bodies      lat^F- on on the pitch.            1^                      the match till

            about 4.30 pm (jx*>3Q) after        I heard a tannoy jffrnouVicernent.              Before     this

            at about 3.20pm (1520) I heard over the tannoy that they were asking

        people were not able ^Co get out that way,

        I think that      people would have got out of the situation a lot quicker

        and that under the         c i r c umstances    the Police o f r s            han ds were

        tied.     I also think that p u t s i d e the t u r n s j A i . e s the 2 m o u r ^ f ^ d   p o 1 i ce

        officers should, have broken the- c r o w d hat were                       pusffi*ng to g e t

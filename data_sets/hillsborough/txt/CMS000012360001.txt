A "WEMBLEY" FOR THE NORTH


As the Minister will know, Mr John Tavare is Chairman of the
Secretary of State's Â£4billion, 25-year, Campaign to clean up the
River Mersey Basin - both water and immediate environment.

Mr Tavare takes a wide interest in regional regeneration, and
following the Hillsborough disaster has on his own initiative
asked several of the North West's big businessmen - including its
major developers - whether they would be interested in building
the equivalent of Wembley Stadium in the North West.    They have
all said "yes".

Mr Tavare envisages

       (i) the usual kind of private/public partnership which is
       required to get big projects off the ground, certainly in
       the North, though mainly (if not wholly) private sector
       financed;

       (ii) the stadium being in the North West (which has half
       the total population of the 3 Northern regions), hut
       between  (rather than in either of)      Manchester  and
       Liverpool;

       (iii)   the stadium becoming a key feature of the Olympic
       Games if they are held in North West England in 1996 or
       thereafter, but not being in any way dependent on the
       Games coming to the North West.

There are large tracts of essentially suitable but presently
derelict land - with excellent national/international motorway,
rail and airport connections - in the Wigan/St Helens area,
offering an ideal opportunity both for the stadium and, thinking
of wider Government policy, to clear up a swathe of dereliction.
I advised Mr Tavare yesterday to go to see the Minister with all
speed;  and I hope that Mr Moynihan will be able to find time to
see Mr Tavare within the next few days. My secretary will try to
fix up a time.

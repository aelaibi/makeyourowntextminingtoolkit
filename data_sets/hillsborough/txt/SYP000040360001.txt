    Dear Sir,

         I refer to your correspondence of 27th September 1989, relating
    to the questionnaire completed by                    and his mother


         On Thursday 5th October 1989, I interviewed them in Liverpool, and
    subsequently obtained statements in respect of the actions of the
    Police officers.              tfas accompanied by
                     Liverpool     He too witnessed the incident and has
    made a statement accordingly.

         It will be noted that the description supplied by        does not
    match that supplied by the three complainants,                    and
                                                      ]was clean shaven.

         The incident described by        and         took place at
    Gate !A !, and whilst the enquiry I am currently conducting centres
    on the Lepping Lane entrances to the football ground, I am satisfied
    that the allegations of        and         are not connected with my
    enquiry and I ask that you continue the investigations.

         I have advised Chief Inspector Drabble at South Yorkshire
    Complaints Department this date of the result of my visit to
    Liverpool and I have forwarded to him a copy of this correspondence
    together with copy statements.

                                          Yours faithfully,

             I am a Police C o n s t a b l e          in the S o u t h Yor k s h i r e Police           force     currently

             At 8.30am on S a t u r d a y           15 M a r c h / 1989     I paraded on duty at Main Street

             to our a p p r o p r i a t e     duties.

             At     11am along wit h                                          , I commenced duties at Wads 1 ey

             B ridge Rai 1w ay S t a t ion            Hal i fax Road,         awaiting a train of Liverpool

             supporters        that was        scheduled       to arrive a little after 2pm.                          Part     of

             our     duties was also           to    police a small           area of Halifax Road,               close to

             two     public    houses across            from each other.              At this       time there were a

             few supporters          from both Liverpool                 and Notts.        )-orest walking            along

             Halifax Road,         in each direction,                c ontinually asking             police      officers

             directins        to open       public      houses.       Myself       being u n familiar with the

             a rea was     unable      to assist         them,     but     I advised       numerous       supporters           of

             the     possible     consequences           of a t t e m p t i n g   to gain entry to

             H i l l s b o r o u g h drunk,    ie arrest,        not a lot of notcie was                  taken by what

             I said to them and they all                    continued         their     search for        public       houses.

At around      1 .30pm PC 2929 Bennett,                PC    1429 Bashforth,          PC    1266 Adsh e a d

and myself       were     instructed by our            supervising          officers       to    cross

Halifax Road from Wads 1 ey Bridge and                       patrol    a small area of footpath

adjacent     to the       public       house,   due to the          large amounts          of    supporters

that were by now walking                 down Halifa:-; Roa d towards               the ground.

V i r t u a l l y every adult male         carried a number            of    cans of       lager       or beer

in his hands and            it was      plain to see that           the vast m a j o r i t y       of them

had had a quant i t y of alcohol                to drink.           I also    remember          hearing quite

a few,    what    I can only describe as M e r s e y s i d e •a c c e n t , asking                     other

supporters       if they had any           "spares".          I can only       imagine          that    they

were   seeking        tickets       for the game.           A short while after             this a number

of officers       from my serial           a t t e n d e d at a shopping        precinct          further        up

Halifax Road,           away    from Hillsborough,            due to a report          of trouble          in

one store.        Myself       and the other 3 officers                I have m e n t i o n e d stayed

in position       in Halifax Road.              A few minutes          later M o u n t e d       officers

at t e n d e d at that      location to assist              in what was de s c r i b e d         via    personal

radios as a large              crowd of supporters            sat   on a grass        bank       drinking

heavily.       S h o r t l y after      that a group of a p p r o x i m a t e l y 6 Liverpool

supporters,       aged about           1S-22 years,         stopped at our          location,          one o+

them was a ss i s t e d        by the    others    to sit       on a small      wall at the             side of

us.    This y outh was              obviously very drunk as he had to be s u p ported by

his    friends as        he sat        there.     We   spoke     to the group and a s c e r t a i n e d

that they were           from Liverpool,          they had all         been drinking             but were

very amenable and              listened to our advice without                  question.           Ihey

a s s i s t e d their    friend to his feet            from the wall          and    continued on

their way towards              the ground.        I must      stress    that they were             not

shouting,      abus i v e      or    causing trouble         to anyone.

S h o r t l y after     this    group    left us another            group of Liverpool             fans

walked     past, our      position.        This    time      this    group were       singing          in very

loud voices,          one y outh       in particular,         with dark       hair,    white       f— shirt,
                                                                                                      PAGE
                                                                                                      R3 62

and Union Jack          shorts,      they were          suitably advised by myself,               all      had

been drinking,          some still         had    cans of beer       or lager       in their      hands,

although      I must       say that       this group did not          respond to ad v i c e          given

in the same way as            the    previous       group,    these       seemed to take no notice

w h atsoever and only a matter                   of so or so yards          further and they

started up their            chants,       but were      spoken to again by other                officers.

At about      1.50pm my       colleagues          and    I were    called back across Halifax

Road    to the stat i o n to await               the arrival       of the Liverpool           train.

This arri v e d between 5-10 minutes                     later,   a little earlier            than

ex p ected and our          serial       along w ith serial         36,    Insp.   Ellis,       other

supervising         officers and M o u n t e d officers             from Merse y s i d e Police,           met

the Liverpool         supporters          off    the train and held them             in a group

alongside a public            house on the same side                of the    road.       The

supporters         were well     behaved and seemed quite                 quiet.      W hen     they were

altogether         we then pro ceeded to escort               them down Halifax Roa d                towards

the ground.          I then a c c o m p a n i e d PC S c h of i e l d a p p r o x i m a t e l y half way

down the supporters.                As we wa l k e d wit h these          supporters       they were

very well         behaved and seemed only                intent    upon getting       to the ground,

which was         totally opposite          to the groups          of supporters       sat around on

walls and pavements,             drinking alcohol,            singing and shouting.                  At the

junction of Hali f a x Road and L e p pings Lane my serial                          was    instructed

to    continue      the escort       to the Leppings Lane             end of the       ground,        which

was    directly opposite            to    instructions       on the order          for the game which

stated      that    serial    37 was       not to escort          supporters       to the ground.

Also    on the way         there were       numerous Liverpool            supporters       continually

asking      for    spare    tickets.

Wh e n we    reached the Leppings Lane                  end of the ground there was a large

crowd of supp o r t e r s al ready              building    up outside       but    there was        no

recognisable         queueing       taking       place,    it seemed       to be just a mass              push

for the t u rnstiles          by the fans.

                                                                                                                    R36Z

      Along with a number                 of other     officers            I was     then    instructed        to patrol

      a s e c t i o n of the           bridge    opposite L e p pings             Lane entrance,           instructions

      were    to    clear        the    large groups        of       youths       that        were    congregating upon

      it.     Upon speaking              to them I found that                large numbers          of these were

      not    in possession of tickets and they did pose a problem, because                                                I
                         y"'
                       /
      could only advijre them to leave the queue and once off the bridge                                                  I

      do not know Ujmere they went.                       At this          time    I remember        looking       back

      towards       tjj®    ground and seeing a number                      of youths a ct u a l l y on top of

      the    boundary walls              to the ground,          gaining          access     I presumed without
c     payment.         A number          of youths    on the          bridge also           saw this and

      immediately made                 their way across          to the what was              by now a very          large
S c
      mass    of    people        outside       the Leppings Lane             entrance.          I took      it that

      they d i d n ’t have             tickets and were          proposing          to enter        by this method.

      Other    officers were              calling ground             control       via their        personal       radios

      informing        them that          people were       getting          crushed at        the    front    of the

      turnstiles           but were       having diff i c u l t y          in getting        their messages

      under s t o o d by the            control.     E x t r a horses were               brought a r o u n d to

      assist       but were        unable       to make any headway                into the      large      crowd.        1

      can only think             because      of danger         to    people      by trampling.

      A van was then brought around and                          Ins p. Ellis            climbed on top and

      requested the              crowd to stop       pushing,          but he was          unable     to make

      himself       heard above           the noise of the             crowd.        A number        of    requests       by

      officers       outside Leppings Lane                  to the groy^id control                   inside were made

      to delay the           kick      off time and         at one j / a i nt        I        was    convinced that the

      kick    off was        going      to be 3. 15 prn, to^the              point       of myself        telling a

      number       of s u pporters         that    this              so.

      The n all at once             I can recall          one    big       push and seeing the              large

      concertina gate             to the North S tand being                   openedand         the       crowd,    or a

      section of           it,                        h.        I was      unaware        of any other        gates

      being    opened at          this     time.     All    of a sudden            it went      quiet where we
                                                                                                     PAGE       5

were and officers              looked at       each other       in disbelief at what             they had

just witnessed?          some        officers were       very shaken and some             stated        that                            J

they feared at         points         for    people    lives.                                                                       j

Just as this ws          happening a message              came over       personal       radio    for all                           i

officers      to a t t e n d    inside       the ground at       the Leppings       Lane     end.       Along                       j
with other       officers        I    ran through the open gate             that    I have

p r eviously mentioned,               through the N o r t h Stand and onto the               pitch at

tijp Leppings Lane             end.     I can remember          seeing    the    players     still      on

wie    pitch at this           time.        My first    reaction was       that    there was                                    J


flighting taking         place        inside the       standing area at the          centre       of the                        ]

Leppi n g s Lane      stand,         because    there was       quite    a large    number       of people                  j
                                                                                                                            J


^already on the        pitch around the               rear of the goals.           .1 ran to this area                      j


and    immediately jumped              onto the b o u ndary wall and a s s i s t e d            other

officers      in pulling and kicking at the wire                        perimeter    fence,       because                   j


I then realised          that     this was       not a riot       but    something       more    serious,                   J


the wire      fence was a very thick                  guage wire and were          unable       to make                     J


any headway       .in what we were             doing,    so    I then started to          pull    people                I

from the stand thro u g h the gateway and small                          hole    in the    fence     that               J

had been made.          These         people were       handed    to other       officers who        laid               j
                                                                                                                        I


them on the       pitch and           perimeter       track.     At one stage       there appe r e d no                 j

one to take       the y o u t h       from me    so I pulled him free and started to                                    ;
                                                                                                                .       i

then    laid him on a stretcher and he was                       carried    by officers and the                         !

a m b u l a n c e m a n away on the stretcher.                                                                      j

        at t e n d e d at   the g y m n a s i u m under n e a t h    the North S t a n d where       I was    then

         told to a c c o m p a n y    other      officers     whom    I do not know        in a transit       van

        and we did a patrol                around the    immediate area of the                outskirts    of the

         ground.      In rny opin i o n this was a complete waste                      of time as     the only

         thing we did was            get    held up in traffic and were-no                 use whatsoever.

        U po n    returning     to C 1a y w h e e 1s Lane at about 6. 3 0 p m we              boarded a coach

         and     returned to Rotherham,              where    I was       stood down from duty at 7pm.

         I was     on duty at        the same Semi-Final             last year and a l t h o u g h    I was      not

         present at the L e p p i n g s Lane end of the ground,                       I was    on the streets

         leading up that            section of the stadium,                I can remember       that the

         Liverpool        s upporters       then were    heavily          drinking,    a l t h o u g h no mention

         of any spare         tickets was made          then.

         It appeared         to me    this year       that    one    single    senior    officer     a p p eared

         to be attem p t i n g       to take      control     of the       situation,    that    could at

         times     be only     called       chaotic.

         I am also        sur p r i s e d that    from the     position of the ground             control

         room,     that     no one    in there       could see what was             happening    inside    the

         L e p pings Lane      stand and that          officers       on the    perimeter       of the    pitch

         ware unable         to assess       the s i tuation        correctly and out swif t l y from                it.

         Fro m where        I was    positioned outside             the    ground    I have    to say that       I

         have     never     seen so many supporters             arriv i n g at a m a t c h as      late, as the

         vast m a j ority      did that       day,    which    in my mind       is the most       significant

         factor     that     caused the tragedy.

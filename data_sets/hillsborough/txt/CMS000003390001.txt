As I mentioned this is not directly of DNH concern but we have done our (,
best to see if we can help, and have unearthed a couple of leads. How have
you left things with David Fawcett, do you want us to draft something for  S
him to send to LCD?

The Private Secretary to the Lord Chancellor wrote to Mr Fawcett on 18
November enclosing correspondence from Joe Benton MP and two of his
constituents asking for the names of the Hillsborough Steering Group
Members.

There has been a problem in identifying who was on the Steering Group which
neither ourselves, the Home Office or the Lord Chancellor's Office have
been able to resolve.

From what I have been able to glean from an extensive search of newspaper
reports of the period, the Hillsborough Steering Group consisted of a group
of solicitors who co-ordinated legal claims on behalf of 300 firms
representing the victims of Hillsborough. The only name that was mentioned
in the press was a Ms Nicola Harrison.

From the correspondence from the consituent, there appears to be some
connection with the Hillsborough Disaster Fund, a charity which ceased to
exist in November 1995. The Liverpool office of the Charity Commission gave
their last Chairman and address as:

JOE BENTON MP AND CONSTITUENTS MR & MRS CHURCH

Thank you for sending me a copy of your letter of 18 November to Ken Sutton,
enclosing correspondence from Joe Benton MP and his constituents, about the
names of the members of the Hillsborough Steering Group. Whilst this Department
had no responsibility for the Group, and- indeed, it is HR-l i k e l y that-any-Department
had-such responsibility, we have made every effort to find f e information Mr
Benton has-^equesteck       ^          ^      ,

FoUowing-an extensive-search- of -the Newspaper reports of the period, it-wouM
appear that the Hillsborough Steering Group consisted of a group of six solicitors
who co-ordinated legal claims on behalf of 300 firms representing the victims of the
Hillsborough disaster. The only representative of the Group that was named in the
press was a Ms Nicola Harrison, unfortunately her law firm was not named.

From the correspondence from Mr Benton's constituents, there appears to be some
connection between the Steering Group and the Hillsborough D ie te r Fund, which
was a charity which ceased to exist in November 1995, and4ms^may provide
another lead. The Liverpool office of the Charity Commission gave their last
Chairman and address as: Mr C M Reddington, PO Box 220, Liverpool, L69 2PN
(tel: 0151 236 0044).
I hope this goes some way to help^esolvmg this issue, C-




DAVID FAWCETT
Principal Private Secretary

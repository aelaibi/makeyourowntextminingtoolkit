                                states:

      1.   I was born on the 4th April 1954.
      2.   Occupation - Paramedic.        I am a qualified Ambulanceman.

      3.   I have been with SYMAS for about seven years.            I work in the

           main on accident emergency duty.              I am qualified          as an

           extended trained ambulanceman or "paramedic".                The training
           for this is an extension of basic training beyond Miller

           standard and equips us with various extended skills.

      4.   I work on an eleven week rota system covering various hours.

           I am based at Middlewood Station in Sheffield. I ordinarily

           work as a two man crew.
      5.   In the week prior to the Hillsborough incident I was working

           a float duty which involves covering for colleagues who are

           away ill or on holiday.

      6.   On   Saturday   the    15th,   my    shift was   0600   to   1400     and   I

           finished work at about 1415.

      7.   At about 1555 or 1600, whilst out shopping,              I noticed two
           West Yorkshire ambulances together with what I believed to

           be a red cross ambulance and a SYMAS ambulance all with

           lights and horns heading towards Hallamshire Hospital.                      I

           realised that because the West Yorkshire vehicles were in

           the area SYMAS were obviously in need of help.                 I decided

           to go straight to the Station about three miles away.                   The

           traffic was very heavy in both directions.
      8.   Because   of    my    paramedic     training which   might     have    been

           required I thought it best to get there as soon as possible.
           As far as I can recall I arrived at the Station at about


                                               \ 2&

      1615      As I arrived I contacted Control and Informed them
      that I was at station together with                     who was
      also present.      As far as   I can recall    I told them that

                had checked a vehicle and that we were ready for

      duty.     The vehicle was Sierra 105.    The Controller told us

      that there was a 999 call        for a patient with an asthma

      attack at Shenstone Road, Sheffield 6 (off Leppings Lane).
9.    We set off in Sierra 105 with myself driving.      The ambulance

      is an out-patient vehicle that has a dual purpose role.       We

      were on Channel 4 the out-patient Channel.      We booked out of
      station and Control told us to stay with him on Channel 4.

      As far as I can recall that was

10.   We made our way to the scene but could not get via Leppings

      Lane. We spoke to police and could see that Leppings Lane
      was blocked with crowds and emergency services.         We then

      drove around to Penistone Road. Near to Herries Road South

      we could see that up towards the roundabout the road was

      blocked with traffic.
11.   I therefore turned up Herries Road South, left along Herries

      Road and up to the roundabout.        There were police on duty

      there.      I drove on to Leppings Lane,      using my horn and

      lights to part the crowd.      Supporters were pouring out away

      from the ground.

12.   We turned off right into Shenstone Road, off Leppings Lane,

                got out while I turned the vehicle around in the cul-

      de-sac.

13.   I went into the house and the patient turned out to be a



                                     \ZSK
      Liverpool supporter who had suffered an epileptic fit and

      had been taken to the house by his friend.                    We took him to

      the Northern General. On arrival casualty was very busy and
      there were a number of ambulances present.                We offloaded the
      patient as quickly as possible and radioed Control as clear.

14.   Control sent us to Halifax Road to a Liverpool supporter who

      had collapsed on a coach.            He was brought to the ambulance

      and    loaded   on   by    his    friends.    He    had    received    crush

      injuries and had got back to the coach and then collapsed.
      We took him to the Northern General casualty and then called

      clear.
15. I cannot recall exactly but there may have been periods of
      standing by at the Northern General between these calls.

16.   Control radioed for us to do a discharge from the Northern
      General casualty to a Chapeltown Nursing Home.                    We checked

      casualty and physio but nobody knew where he was.
17. We informed Control who told us to              leave that job.         As far
      as I can recall we were standing by at Northern General

      casualty.
18.   Control asked us to do a transfer of a Liverpool supporter

      from Northern General Intensive Care Unit to the Hallamshire

      Transit Ward together with medical team and equipment.

19.   We took the stretcher to Intensive Care.                  It took about 20

      or    30   minutes   as   the    equipment   has    to   be    prepared   and
      checked for such transfer.           We loaded the patient, equipment

      and   medical   team      and    it was   a query    spinal     injury.     I

      therefore drove extremely slowly, blue lights only and via



                                           \ 2>0
      the smoothest route I knew to the Hallamshire transit ward.

20.   I arrived at Royal Hallamshire and disposed of the intensive

      care patient to the transit ward. We then called clear to

      Control.

21.   Control told us to attend a 999 call at                      Road,
      Eccleshall which was a sudden death.         We took the "patient"

      an old man      to Hallamshire    casualty   for certification of

      death.     We radioed Control to inform them that the "patient"

      was deceased but they told us that the Medico Legal Centre

      was full and to leave the "patient" at Hallamshire.
22.   We then called clear at about 2000 and were instructed to

      return to station.       We arrived at station at about 2010 to
      2015.      On arrival Leading Ambulanceman            had come in

      early    for night shift.     He was due to work nights with

      Debbie and I was therefore told to go home.         I was due back
      on duty at 0600.      I signed out at 2015.

QUALIFIED AMBULANCE MAN (SYMAS)


1.        I have worked with Symas for about 6 years.       I have obtained
          the Miller Certificate      and   have    att e n d e d   the   post
          proficiency courses providing an up date on techniques and
          equipment.


2.    In relation to major incidents there is a manual on station
          and a check list to the rear of our identity cards.


3.    I am stationed at Bentley ambulance station in Doncaster and
          I work on an emergency shift rota.     The rota is a nine week
          period covering various hours.


4.    Although Saturday and Sunday were days off I had worked
          Saturday morning 0600 until       1400 to cover           for other
          personnel.


5.    On Saturday the 15th I left work at about 1410 and returned
          home.   At just after 1500 I was watching the football on TV
          when I became aware of the incident.     At this time I was at
          my parents and as Symas would not be able to contact me
          there if required I telephoned control.


6.    It took about 2 or 3 minutes to get through.            I explained I
          was from Doncaster station and asked if they were calling in
                                                                         I




     staff.   The control assistant asked me to wait while she
     asked the controller.     She then replied yes and asked me to
     go to the station as soon as possible.     I then drove the two
     miles to the station.       I was still in uniform from my
     previous shift.


7.   I arrived at Bentley station at about         1510/1515.     The
     afternoon emergency crew were         on   station.      Leading
     Ambulanceman          telephoned control to inform them that I
     was on station.     A few minutes afterwards Station Officer
                  arrived on station.            phoned Control and
     asked what they wanted us to do.    I understand they asked us
     to crew up and proceed to Tinsley Viaduct, Sheffield in an
     ambulance.


8.   I drove and             attended in vehicle number Delta 903.
     Upon leaving the station we tuned to channel one ERC.         The
     vehicle was a fully equipped emergency ambulance.               I
     proceeded at speed with lights and horns towards Sheffield.
     As far as I can recall              radioed control to inform
     them that we were en route.


9.   On the way we heard a message from control the gist of which
     was "control to all mobiles - proceed to Hillsborough
     Football Ground - report to gate O " .       I recall
     radioed control and informed them that 903 had received and
     understood the message.    En route to Sheffield,     channel one



                                 2.%7
      was very distorted with interference.     We had to ask for
      repeat messages.    I heard a further message en route
      requiring attendance at the gymnasium entrance of vehicles
      going to Hillsborough.


10.   We approached the ground down Herries Road South and parked
      in line at the bottom of Herries Road South.      There were
      about 10-15 ambulances in front of us.    In accordance with
      major incident procedure we switched off lights and horns.


11 . We waited in the vehicle for about 10 to 15 minutes and the

      queue did not appear to be moving.              then went to
      the front of the queue to ascertain what was happening.


12 . As             returned the queue before us moved and we
      therefore drove across Penistone Road into the line of
      ambulances at the football ground side.   We were approached
      by Mr D Jones who shouted to us and to the other vehicles to
      take of all blankets.    We handed those over to a St Johns
      Ambulance Brigade attendant, but retained one for our use.


13.   D. Jones then told us to take on board a Leading Ambulance
      man together with a crash team of doctors.          We were
      instructed to drop the Leading Ambulance man at the Herries
      Road Bus Depot and to take the team of doctors to Barnsley
      General Hospital.   He also instructed           |to set up a
      control point at Barnsley District General.   The traffic was



                                 2SS
      not a problem, but pedestrian supporters who were milling
      about did cause problems.      I drove to the depot, then onto
      Barnsley District General as soon as possible.        On arrival
      we dropped off the medical team and parked the vehicle.


14.              radioed in to control that we had arrived at
      Barnsley District General.          We both went into casualty
      department and this had been cleared for preparation for an
      influx of casualties.                 telephoned to ask what to
      expect and when.


15.   I was informed that control had asked him to wait and they
      would get back to us.   Shortly afterwards another ambulance
      officer arrived in his own car.       He had also been called in
      by control to establish a control point at Barnsley District
      General.


16.   We waited for about 2 hours.                   again contacted
      control requesting an update of the position.           Shortly
      after, Control contacted us to take an outpatient home.      We
      took the outpatient home and radioed into control that we
      were clear.   Control told us to return to base and call




                                  Z<6<\
before signing off.       At about 1930 we returned to base.   We
telephoned control who informed us that we could stand down.




Dated this       day of    K^y    1989.

but      have    never       been to an away             game     previously,,               When    I saw the

crowds       initially            I wasn't       frightened           bat whe n we had gone                  through        the

outer      perimeter          and were        trying       to get        thro u g h     the     t u r n s 1 1 1es    then     I

did start         to become          frightened.            We were         probably waiting                 for about

15/20 minutes               outside     the      turnstile        to get         into     the    ground       it was

just      chaos       outside       there was       no     c o n t r o 1 >■ queue       or    line     of    people     I

there      I have always             found       there     has    been a lot more                police       to

su p ervise       the queueing             and    keep     the    crowds         under       control.         I was

bruiseci and shaken                 by tne       time    1 go t h r o u g h the          turnstile.               Kei tn and

D a v i d were        trying       to keep me with them because                         obviously           the     crowd

was      pushing around             to try and get             through and K e i t h had my t i c k e t .

back      to allow us to get                into    the     turnstiles            I heard        people       shouting            to

to the toilet and then w h e n they                         came       back we made             our way       down     the

thro u g h          the   crowd     I remember             thinking       to myself         I hope      it     is not

going          to be like this                the whole       of the game             because       :i.t was    very

crowded             then.     We made          our way down the               t e rracing         towards      the front

there was             just    one       row of       people       in front       of    us and then there was a

We    had almost a r r i v e d at                   the    point were we were               going      to stand        before

the     pressure            built       up,    you always          get a last minute                surge      before       the

whether             this was       brought          before    or after         the    game        started, you

    black    out     1 just w a n t e d      to go to sleep             I        was    gasping for air         ail    the

    the    supporters         came up and helped me                up       1 wanted         to   look     for my

    bo y f r i e n d K eith    but    in fact        he was     coming           towards me at           this    point.

    There was       a message         over     the    tannoy to         clear          the   pitch that was            the

    shocked       I couldn't         feel    anything         I was     totally          numb we made           our way

    out    to the     first aid area we sat down and M a l c o l m                            came    in and we met

    up with him and           it was        then that he told us that Arthur                             had died,             W«

    tried    to     comfort another            lad who was         in a trance               he was      very

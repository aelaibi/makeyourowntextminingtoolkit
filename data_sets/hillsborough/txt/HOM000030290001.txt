         Dear Sir

         On 3 June 1998 I wrote to you about the urgent matter o f the outstanding correspondence, I
         am very concerned that there has been no reply.

         On 28 May, PC Greenway o f SYP spoke to this office. He confirmed that he would be
         replying to one o f your requests that day. I should be grateful if you would provide all
         outstanding documentation and any information by return.


         Yours faithfully

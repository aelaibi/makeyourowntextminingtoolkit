 REPORT
       Notes of Trevor Turner P.S. 2759 Stationed at F1. Re Semi Final duties 15»^»89.


     I reported on duty at Haamerton Road Police Station at 9»15a® that day* My duties were on

     Serial 3 which entailed duties in the upper level of the South Stand where the Nottingham

     Forest Supporters were to be seated* At 10am I was at Hillsborough Football Ground and was

     given a full briefing in the North Stand with other officers. I was given a personal radio.

     Inspector Darling was the senior officer in charge of my particular serial. From about 11.30am

     together with my Serial we were on our points which included duties at several turnstiles

|    giving access to the South Stand. From about 12 noon the gates were opened and a steady stream

     of Nottingham Forest Supporters began to enter the groung. There were all sorts of fans, men,

     women, children all were in good spirits   and seemed to be looking forward to the match.

     Towards 2.30pm the influx of fans indreased but still they were well behaved and good humoured.

     About this time I became aware of a slight fault on the radio. After a message from contol was

     passed there seemed to be a noise as if the handset were faulty# We were to take our cooked

     meal in the grounds gymnasium during the game and as 3 o'clock approached it had been decided

     that shortly after the kick off myself and P.C. 7 0 Whiteley an officer on my Serial would go

     and eat* Shortly before 3 p® I became aware of there being some concern Re the size of the

     crowd at the Leppings Lane End. I heard on the radio calls from an officer there (I can't recall

    who) wanting more manpower to assist with the large crowd* I cannot say if anyone was directed

     to assist. I then remember an Office* believed to be Supt. Marshall requesting that some gate

     be opened to relieve pressure on the crowd at Leppings Lane. I think this request was made more

     than once but dur to the noise of the crowd near this office# and the interference on the radio

    ft was difficult to hear him clearly. I remember him telling control that if the gate were not

     opened to relieve crowd pressure there was a great risk of injury to fans. The reply from

     control was to the effect that if lives were in danger to 'OPEN THE GATSSl   By this time it

    was just gone 3p® myself and P.C. 7 0 made our way down the players tunnel onto the perimeter of

     the pitch. The game was underway and I saw that a few of the crowd at the Liverpool End

     (leppings Lanei had spilled onto the perimeter track around the pitch. This seemed to be just

     overspill and there seemed to be plenty of officers in the area to deal with the problem. We

      continued around the pitch. Passind the Nottingham Forest Fans on the Kop end who were becoming

     rather agitated at the behaviour of the fans at the other end* There were no instructions

    given on the radio so we went off the pitch to go into the gymn. As we were entering other mf

    officers were coming out and we were directed by a senior Officer personally ( not known who) to

    go onto the perimeter of the pitch and stand facing the Nottingham   Forest Fans on the Kop as it

                 was feared that they may invade the pitch* We did this and on looking towards

                 leppings Lane I saw more people on the piteh milling about* I remember seeing BtteJ

                others being pulled up from the standing areas into the seating above* The Forest

                fans were becoming very agitated as they thought the Liverpool fans were invading ti

                the pitch and that they had caused the game to be halted* One liverpool fan then

                ran from the Leppings Lane end the fill length of the pitch and stood in the goal

                area facing the Forest Fans* He began gesticulating to them with his two fingers

                and shouting abuse at them* This obviously enraged the Forest fans further. After

                about a minute he turned and went back on the pitch towards the Leppings Lane End

                where he was eventually apprehended by an officer and kntx taken away* Another fan

                came towards the Forest End from the Leppings Lane End* He was older and appeared

                to be drunk. He was not abusive but was just waving.t a x * * *   However the Forest fans

                were becoming more and more irate. Myself and others including P.C. 70 went onto

                the pitch and tried to usher him back towards the other end to prevent any trouble.

                At this time there were more and more Liverpool fans on the pitch at the Leppings Li

                Lane end maybe stretching upto the halfway Line. I cannot recall any radio messages

                at this time as to the reason for this. We continued walking to that end. A line of

                Police were across the pitch near the halfway line and when we passed through this

                line that is the first time I became aware that people had been injured* Some were

                lying on the ground getting their breath back others were obviously injured. Some

                were just milling about. We cam across a man with a leg injury and we took him

                half carrying him to the First Aid post near to the gym®. There were many injured

                people at the first Aid post being tended to. An officer I know from C1 Division

                P.C. 2910 Cammock was in posession of a stretcher and myself PC 70 and another

                stayed with him and the stretcher and went back        to the pitch to assist where we

                could. Lying on the pitch we came across a young man who had an injuty to the

                lower part of his stomach. He was unable to walk and obviously in pain. We placed

GEN/2           him on the stretcher and took him to the first Aid post. I remember one ambulance

                being there but the First Aid staff seemed to be having difficulty coping with

                the ammount of injured. The casualty was laid on the floor on a blanket. We

                returned onto the pitch with the stretcher as there seemed to be a great need for

                 them. By now I was aware that many people were suffering from bad injuries as they

                were laid on the pitch* I was aware of Police Officers Ambulancemen, St JohnsxiudHi

                ambulancemen and other fans giving assistance to persons in need* Other fans just

                 seemed to be milling about and it was difficult to see who was in the most need of

                 treatment. Fans had broken down boardings and were running the fill length of the

                 pitch with injured. By this time the Forest fans seemed to realise the serious

                 nature of the incident and were applauding Liverpool fans as they carried off the

                injured. When we returned to the injured we came across a man laid on the floor.

                A woman was giving him cardiac massage and a man giving him the kiss of life.

                A bottle of oxygen was also being used to try to revive him. A man who stated he was

                a doctor came and was also assisting. After about 5 minutes of working on him and no

                sign of life the Doctor said he was dead. I decided we should remove hime as

                quickly as possible and he was put on the stretcher. As we neared the gymn as the

                man was dead we were instructed to take him to the gymnasium which we did. It was

                then on entering the gymn that I became aware of other fatalities as several

                 bodies were luqnui laid out with white blankets covering them. We put the body

                down it was covered and I instructed an officer who had assisted in carrying the

                stretcher to stay with the body. (I don't know who the officer wasX* The body was

                a white male heavy build about 6'00" tall* He had brown hair* Wearing a grey/white

                shirt.

                                   I went back again onto the pitch and was seperated from the other

                officers I had been with. By thid time there seemed to be more medical assistance

                on the pitch* Ambulancemen and ambulances were in the     vicinity and most of the

                injured had been moved or were being moved. I can still not recall what was being

                said on the radio* Officers were just trying to clear     the pitch of fans so that
GEN/2
                medical assistance could be given to those in need.

                At this time I met up with PS Gardner who was part of my serial* He indicated to

                me that other people had been injured and bodies were at the rear of the Leppings

                Lane stand outside in the Lane and assistance may be required there* At this time

                I became aware that the fencing at the front of this stand had large holes ripped

                in it and a saw a barrier had been knocked over. We attended at the rear of

                Leppings Lane.Some bodies had been laid out near the fence to the river . Officers

                had placed barriers in front of them and were stood around them. Several injured pxi

                persons were also there next to the wall* Officers and medical personnell were

                assisting them whilst an ambulance arrived. I assisted there as some fans had s±xx£i

                started to leave the ground. They were calling Police 'Murdering bastards and other

                similar phrases but all officers kept quiet and concentrated on the job in hand.

                I recall a lodspeaker message going out asking fans to remain in the ground as

                their departure was hampering the arrival of ambulances. I was necessary from time

                to time to prevent the crowd from leaving to allow ambulances to attend to treat

                the injured. The injured persons were removed prior to the bodies being moved*

                Officers were subjected to much abuse and ridicule by upset Liverpool fans

                leaving. I remember a number being passed over the radio for persons to ring re

                casualties* I made a note of the number and gave it other officers as lots of

                people were making enquiries. After a time I remember a message being passed on

                the lodspeaker that the game would be cancelled and that fans should keep tickets.

                Officers who were not engaged in special duties were then asked to attend at

                the North Stand where they were to be given duties as required* I attended there

                with my Serial. At this time the extent of the seriousness of the incident had

                become apparant and all officers seemed very upset depressed and confused by the

                days happenings* There were no further dities for us to do and we went off duty

                at 7pm.

                The only time I became aware of the serious nature of the incident was when I


GEN/2            came across the injjired people and the bodies. I felt sick and helpless that there

                 was little that I could do to imProve the situation or say to Liverpool fans._____

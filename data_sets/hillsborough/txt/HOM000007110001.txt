 J R IB U N A LS O F INQUIRY: COSTS AND GUIDELINES


 You sent me a copy of your l e t t e r of 16th March to the Treasury inviting c o m m e n ts on the
 most r e c e n t d r a f t of the Guidelines.   1 have one point of substance and tw o draftin g
 com m ents.


 The point of substance re la te s to costs.         Paragraph s 25 and 26 of the d r a f t Guidelines carry
 the heading "Legal expenses of witnesses".             This is a li tt le odd because the paragraphs go
 wider than w itnesses and deal with the costs of p a rtie s to whom the tribunal has p e r m itte d
 represen tatio n .   The question is w hat the p aragraphs should say about the principles which
should be applied in deciding which p a rtie s should g e t their costs out of public funds.            The
problem has arisen in relation to r e c e n t inquiries (which w ere not 1921 A ct inquiries, but the
principle is th e sam e unless th e re is exp ress provisions about c o sts in the legislation under
which a p a r tic u la r inquiry was held) and th e Treasury have expressed concern about the risk
th a t any organisation or body which can persuade the tribunal t h a t it has an i n t e r e s t in the
subject m a t t e r will be allowed its costs a t the end of the hearing.         The u ltim a te decision
about the pay m en t of costs m ust lie with Ministers but it is exceedingly difficu lt to go
against th e advice of the tribunal.         What I think we need is guidance to the tribunal so th a t
the tribu nal's ad vice is not a t odds with Ministerial policy unless the tribunal has consciously
decided th a t on the f a c t s of the p a r tic u la r c as e the policy produces the wrong result.   I
suggest th a t paragraph 25 should be replaced by th e following:-


        "25.    The tribunal should announce a t the o u ts e t the principles which d e te rm in e
        w h eth er those who apply to be re p res en ted a t the hearing will have th e costs of th a t
        re p re s e n ta tio n m e t out of public funds.   At the end of the hearings the tribunal will
        make recom m endations and these will be considered sypathetically by Ministers.
        Decisions in e a rlie r cases have established the following principles.           The costs of legal
        rep resen tatio n for any person injured (or the families of any persons who died) as a
        result of the ev en ts under investigation will be m e t from public funds, as will be those
        costs of any individual who reasonably believes th a t he may be prejudiced by the
        inquiry.   The costs of com panies, local au thorities, and o the r public bodies and tra d e
        unions will not be m e t from public funds unless th e re a r e exceptional circu m stan c es.
        However, th e re can be cases where a tra d e union provides the rep resen tatio n for an
        individual who would o therw ise be legally rep resen ted a t public expense under the
        principles discussed earlier and in such cases th a t p a r t of the union's costs will be m e t
        from public funds".


This leaves the second s e n te n c e in the existing paragraph 25 unsupported and it can perhaps
go in p aragraph l^f or 15 which deal with preliminary hearings.


The d raftin g points a r e - in paragraph 15, line 3, a f t e r "Counsel" th e r e should be added "or
solicitor" b ecau se re p re s e n ta tio n is not re s tr ic te d to Counsel; and in paragraph 2 ($ in the first
sen te n ce, for "allowed" s u b stitu te "recomm ended"; and in the third line for "common fund
basis" su b stitu te "standard costs basis" (the c u r r e n t basis)".   It might also be worth
substituting for the words in p aren th esis in the firs t s e n te n c e of paragraph 26 som ething like
this: "(this is the general rule in relation to litigation in the co u rts and in the absence of the
co u rts m achinery for taxing co s ts the solicitors bills will be taxed on an informal basis by the
Treasury S olicitor's D ep artm ent)".


I am copying this l e t t e r to those to whom you sent yours.

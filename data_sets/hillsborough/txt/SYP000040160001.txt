                                      NATURE OF

      Mr Trevor Hicks of                                  Pinner, Middlesex has
      complained that at the football match between Liverpool and Nottingham
      Forest on the 15th April 1989 at the Hillsborough Football Ground you
      neglected to discharge your duties in that you:-
      (a) failed to prevent a dangerous build up of supporters outside of the
           gates;
      (b) failed to control the movement of supporters subsequent to the opening
           of Gate 'C'; and
      (c) failed to respond to the developing tragedy and were slow to effect a
           rescue operation.
      If established, these complaints could disclose possible offences against
      the Police (Discipline) Regulations 1985.
        You are not, as the Regulation explains, obliged to say anything concerning the matter, but you may — if
        you so desire - make a written or oral statement concerning the matter to me or to the Deputy Chief
        Constable. (The.Chief Constable has delegated his authority under Regulation 15 of the above Regulations
        to the Deputy Chief Constable)

        YOU ARE, HOWEVER, WARNED THAT IF YOU MAKE SUCH A STATEMENT TO ME OR TO THE
        DEPUTY CHIEF CONSTABLE, THE STATEMENT MAY BE USED IN ANY SUBSEQUENT DISCIPLIN­
        ARY PROCEEDINGS.

        You have the right to consult a friend at all stages of the investigation and service of this form does not
        necessarily imply that disciplinary proceedings will follow. It is served to safegu>H^your interest.

           numerous           public       houses          in the        city         centre        where       football        supporters

           were     causing           problems.             In all           instances           the     fans      concerned           w e re

           Nottingham            Forest        supporters,               a    great         number       of w h o      were     dr un k ,        but    in

           general        were        j u st   a    little         too       loud a n d        boisterous           for     the    likings             of

           the    pub     landlords.                I attended               at   one       incident        of    fighting         in K i n g

           Street,        Sheffield,               where     one     Notts            Forest        fan was       arrested         for      Section

           4 Public           Order.

           As    th e    kick-off          time      grew     nearer,             a    lot     of    fans       were    still      a    long       way
                                                                                                                                                     S39Q5

             from     the      ground           in the          pubs    and        it w as           certain            that      they      would    not    get

             to    the     ground          in    time       for       th e    kick-off.

             At 3 . 1 5       pm    (1515)        that          same     day       I received a message                             for     all    dog

             handlers          to a t t e n d      at       the       ground        which            I duly            c omplied with.              U p o n my

             arrival          we    were        deployed          together           with            all         other      handlers         with    our

             dogs     along         th e    front          of    the    Nottingham                   Forest            supporters           in the S p i o n

            Hop.         At    no    time        did       I a t t e n d at         or       near          the W e s t       Stand.          During      the

             day    I had my           radio        tuned         to     the       channel              dedicated            to     the     city    centre

             p o 1 i cing      from        West    Bar.           The        call    to           attend           Hillsborough             was    received

          Further to my questionnaire which I completed earlier last year in

          relation to the Hillsborough Enquiry.                                  I can refer to the paragraph

          which relates to a casualty that 1 dealt w i t h , the time would have

          been about              1315 - 15E0 hrs,                  I was initially sat at the front row of

          the South S t a n d „             I became aware of a stretcher being carried passed

          me and I jumped up to help-                               I believe the other helpers were Police

          Officers and perhaps an ambulance person.                                      They were having difficulty

          lifting the stretcher over the stands and that is why 1 a s s i s t e d .                                  1

          did so until we Kgot to the rear of the South Stand*                                     The man on the

          stretcher appeared to be deceased,,                                He had a travelling companion who

          was obviously upset*



          The Police Officer was unable to communicate with him as he was so
                                                                                      PAGE     2
                                                                                      S3731

             distressed and his accent was difficult to understand.          I tried to

             speak with and ascertain the dead p e rs o n ’s name*    I w a s n ’t sure but

             believe I heard the name           it the same time,    I d o n ’t know whether

             or not 1 identified the name with what I read at a later stage in the

             newspaper containing the names,,
        Aw
        /.L

             I would describe the deceased person as being 3Q-35 years? about 5*8

p ti         ^a H>- heavy build*   reddish/sandy coloured h a i r r moustachioed,, blue

       /L-   j e a n s 7 short sleeve shirt with about three buttons down the front with

heavy,        many fans were            lining     the    route    on Penistone Road,             and

congregating around the g r o u n d .

At about 2.13            pm (1415)         I e s c o r t e d a second PSV to the             ground,         all

N o t ti ng ha m Forest            f^ns and after         leaving      the bus,     I a t t e n d e d at about

2.3 0    pm    ( 1430)     i/ n    the g y m nasium at H i l l s b o r o u g h where        I was   provided

with a meal.          /At         this time     I was with the           remainder     of rny serial           and

a p p r o k i m a t e 1y 150 o t p d r     officers.

At a r o un d 3.0 5        pip/T 1505)      w hilst      still    in the gymnasium,           as a result               of

a message          I resumed with my serial                   and went     to the     perimeter         track at

the     side      of the     pitch.        I had no       idea at this time what              the   nature           of

the trouble was.                  From the gym n a s i u m end I wa l k e d briskly along                     the

perimeter          track towards           the L e p pings Lane          end of the ground.

Pla y a t this        time was          still    in progress        on the field.           As    I reached

about     level with the               half way     line      I saw a senior        officer       run onto           the

field and           persuade          the referee to halt         play.      It was appar e n t          that

there was           some      form of trouble in the L e p p i n g s Lane             terrace,          many

officers were alre a d y                Congregating          on the track at         the    pitch side            of

the     fencing,      and         I could see      people      being     pulled into the stand from

the terracing.

As the        players      left the        pitch    I a p p r o a c h e d the Leppings Lane             end and

began to          run across         the   field towards          the goal.         I could see         that       the

crowd were          surged forward            into the        fence and     that many       people       were

obv i o u s l y      in distress, pressed against                  the    fence-.    Other       fans    had

begun climbing             onto       the fence and over onto J t t \ b          pitch side.            I heard

people        screaming           for help and a lr e a d y       i t j f i k s apparent    from the smell

that many          people were          dead or dying.            Meny were      pressed,        blue faces

dis t o r t e d against            the fencing.          At   this stage      1 was    standing         to     the

right     of the goal at the Leppings Lane                         end.     Myself and other             officers

shouted at the             crowd to get          back and        prevent further           crushing.          Other

officers were a t t e m pt in g              to open the         perimeter     gates.        Bodies were
                                                                                                       PAGE       3
                                                                                                       S3 5 4 5 A

    being    lifted by the          crowd    in an atte m p t        to get them over        the fence.

    Throwing my helmet             off,    I stood on the ad v e r t i s i n g      boards and took

    hold of 2 or 3 bodies,                all young     children about          10-12 years      old and
V
    pulled them over with the assis t a n c e                  of other      officers and       passed them

    down to the          pitch side,        The   bodies a p p e a r e d   lifeless,      but, it was

    impossible       to tell       whether     they were       dead or alive        or even what        sex

    they were,

    As    I assisted       pulling    one body over         I was s p a ttered with vomit.                The

    prongs    on the       top of the       fence    proved a major         hindrance,       digging      into

    flesh and      clothing and preventing               quicker action.            When no more        bodies

    were    lifted from the          crowd side        I began       to climb   over the fence and

    into    t h e terraced area.            It took 2 or        3a t t empts    to get a       good

    foothold before          I mana g e d    to   clamber      over and drop down.             I landed on

    the    legs of somebody          lying on the ground who a p p e a r e d to be dead?

    people    on the terrace          fans and police           were pulling at          legs and arms          of

    people    trapped under          other     bodies.

    I shouted at the mai n body of fans                   to get back,          but of    course many

    were    trying       to help and at this stage              there was enough space               on the

    terrace     behind the fence and the                line    of bodies the move about

    r easonably freely without               being     in danger        of getting     caught    up in the

    crush,      I pulled at         a number of        limbs    but     could not free      them      from

    the    crush of       bodies    at the front.          Some      people were o b v i o u s l y    alive

    but were     trapped under            people who were         either     unconscious       or dead and

    were    in the well          area behind the fence and below the                   pitch    level.

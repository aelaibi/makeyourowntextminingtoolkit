P Wright Esq CBS
Chief Constable
South Yorkshire Police

Snig Hill
SHEFFIELD
S3 ELY




I acknowledge receipt of your letter of 30 March 1990 which concerns the enquiries
in the aftermath of the Hillsborough disaster, and to say I accept the appointment
of Investigating Officer.

The Police Complaints Authority and the South Yorkshire Police Authority have
written to me already and I have agreed with them that I shall continue to
use the West Midlands Police team and the material already gathered,

In so far as the allegations made against yourself are concerned, I intend
to use my own resources from Cumbria Constabulary.     In respect of those matters
I shall make contact with you in the very near future.




Chief Constable

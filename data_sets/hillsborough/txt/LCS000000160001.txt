N.B.          1.    It was originally proposed to have separate posts to co-ordinate
                    Helpline and Outreach. These have been amalgamated into one post
                    at this stage.

              2.    The training co-ordination post has been deleted as there is a
                    training officer post financed by NWASSA.


              3.    Four posts of Social Worker to develop outreach work have been
                    deleted. Input from SSD trains as available and required.

Dear Mr Bone

Requests for Access to Hillsborough Related Material

I attach a letter I recently received from Ms Ann Adlington. I also attach the reply I have
faxed to her.

The Chief Constable has responded to many similar requests over the years and has no
objection to responding to this request. However, as explained in my letter to Ms Adlington,
I feel I should consult you first.

We have received a number of similar requests in recent weeks and have acknowledged
them in similar vein. Again I am happy to respond to them but do not wish to do so without
your approval.

Yours sincerely




Ian Daines

Dear Ms Adlington

I refer to your letter dated 17 July 1997 asking for copies of statements.

We have always co-operated fully with all such requests. However, in view of the
establishment of Lord Justice Stuart-Smith’s Sc-utiny on aspects of the Hillsborough
Disaster, I feel we must take a slightly different approach now.

I have written to Lord Justice Stuart-Smith to ask his permission to comply with your
request. I am anxious not to cut across his work. As soon as I hear from him, I will contact
you again.

Yours sincerely




Ian Daines

 Dear Superintendent,

 I refer to a conversation which I had with P.C.     Greenway on
 Tuesday 15th July concerning the release to me of witness
 statements.  At his request I enclose a copy of the       signed
 authorities of Roger Houldsworth and Dr. Ed Walker.

 You may be aware that Lord Justice Stuart Smith has requested that
 the families written representations should reach him by the end
 of August.  In the circumstances I should be grateful if you would
 let me have the above mentioned statements by return.

 I thank you for your assistance.

 Yours faithfully,

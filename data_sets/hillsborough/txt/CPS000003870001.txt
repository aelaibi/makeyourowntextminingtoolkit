Dear Mr^Jones

HELLSBQRCKJGH INQUIRY - BARRIER 124A

In your letter of 26 October 1989 you wrote concerning various matters which we
had previously discussed on the telephone. The one outstanding item concerns
barrier 124A. We have completed our studies on this barrier and have no
further use for it. I have discussed this matter with Professor Maunder and he
too agrees that no further work is required of HSE.

As you know, your colleague from the Forensic Science Service has examined the
barrier at our laboratories and will shortly receive a draft copy of our
metallurgical report. He will then be able to give his view on the need for
any further work.

As far as HSE are concerned, I am ready to release the barrier upon your
instruction following your communications with Lord Justice Taylor, HM Coroner
and the Director of Public Prosecutions as outlined in your letter.

TWo sets of the HSE photographs are enclosed as reguested.                            An invoice will be
sent to you in due course.

Yours sincerely




DR C E NICHOLSON

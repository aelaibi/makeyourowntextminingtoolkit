                Fu rt h e r    to my statement               d at ed 5th July            1989,    I my statement           I refer to

                several        bodies w hi ch a p p e a r e d to me to be deceased.



                I refer        first       to the      body on the floor                 of the     'enclosure'',          This

                person was            lying on the           floor      of P e n 4 lying          close    to and     parallel      to

                the       perimeter        waii. ,     ihs body was           face       up avid was      to the    right

                hand side         o f t he pen,         a s y o u f a ce       it fro m t he        pi t c h , i e near     t o Pe n fo,

                I cannot         be certain          but     in my opi ni on            the ma n was      dead.



                I w ou ld say the man was                    in his thirties?              but am unable          to give any

                further        description,            nor    do    I recall        his    clothina.



                I have        viewed m o r t u a r y       ph otographs         and      photogr aph s     of   clothing worn by
                                                                                                                      PAGE


those    that       died    in the H i l l s b o r o u g h    disaster,          but      am unable         to

i d e ntify     the    person to w h o m       I refer.



In my original             st atement      I refer      to enter ing           the enclos ure             and pulling

a body to the wall                where    I handed      it to other             Officers.            The       body was

passed     thr ou gh a gap          in the     fencing.            The    fencing was            rolled upwards

and tied up wi t h orange                 rope.      I am happy that              this was Pen 4,



I have     no r e c o l l e c t i o n of this       body and           can give         no description;                       ag ain

I have     viewed       p ho to gr ap hs and also            video w i th ou t          being able             to

ident if y the         body,       In fact     thinking           about    it,    I cannot           be certain

that    the     body was       passed      out of the Pen t h ro ug h the fence                         or through

the gate,



1 refer        in my original          sl-atement to then mo v i ng two further                                bodies.

In fact        I think      now    I m o v e d only one           further      body,        that     of a child.

This    child was aged about                "IE-13 years           of slight           build and male,.                       I

I am of the o p i n i o n that this                 child was          dead;      but I cannot              be certain.

I ha n d e d   the     child to other,           unknown,          Police Offi cer s             either at               the

fencing,       as     1 recall      having     to   raise         the body over a wall,                         I do          not

r e c.a 11 a ny s t e p s ,.



Having     then       left the enclosure,             1 went        onto the           pitch.        I recall

assisting       fans and Pol i c e O f f icers               to    carry a body off the                   pitch and

place    it u n d e r n e a t h the       stand outside            the    gym,



The    body was       that     of a well       built male,           I do not           recall      any     clothing.
                                                                                                                     PAGE


            I think       the   body was       laid face down,              on an ad v e r t i s i n g    hoarding,



            I have      examined       video     footage      and at        <R e f        | E mh               ) Tape

            I can      identify a P o l i c e       Officer,       balding,          with a f u l l      beard.      I am

            almost      sure    that    it was      this Of fi c er         who as si s t e d      to    carry the   body

            which      I have    just made        reference.           I am sure           that this man      was     dead,.



            The      persons    mentioned        in this      statement, are           the only         persons   I dealt

              O n Saturday,             15 April,          1989      I was      on duty            and together with

a r r i v e d at S h e f f i e l d W e d n e s d a y Football     S t a d i u m at about 2 . £ 5 pm a n d

were met        by a friend of my fathers I                                    |who is an

ambulanceman.             We were all        posted to the W e s t f i e l d D i s a b l e d S ta n d

near    to the S p i o n Kop»

At this        time,-    I could see       that       the ground was           quite      full    and that

the    terraces         behind the goal          in the West S ta n d were                full    to capacity.

As    far as     I can remember           ever y t h i n g was     normal       leading up to kick                off.

The game        had star t e d and. at about             3;06pm     I     noticed a d i s t u rbance              at

the L e p p i n g s Lane      end,    my view of the West                 S t a n d was     clear and

unobstructed.

At first        I thought, it was a pitch invasion                       I could see fans trying                   to

climb over        the     perimeter       fence and onto           the    pitch      I could also           see

fans    trying      to    climb out       of the terraces           behind the            goal    into the

adjoining        ones.

It was at this            time    that    I noticed a large              number      of    policemen

stand i n g     in front      of the West S t a n d           looking     into the         crowd.

I could see more            than one       policeman          climb onto        the fence and try and

knock     the fans        hands    off    the    barrier       I could see that             the were        using

what    I think was their             trunchions,.        I d o n ’t      know who        they are.

We all     stood watch i n g         what was         going   on an d noticed a policeman run

up to the        referee      and the      game       stopped,,

1 could see         that a       lot of    people were          climbing       over       the    fence and

onto    the     pitch,,    they were       being helped           over    by the       police,      St Johns

Ambulance        people,      other      fans,    the whole       of the        IS yar d box was            full       of

p e o p 1e .

I'hen my dad and another                 adult    member were           told    by                    to get

d own to the West Stand,                 he said that         they were        needed,          |
                                                                                                ______and

m yself were        left with                             we wai t e d     for about            five minutes

We    climbed over         the a d v er t i s i n g    boards and went           down onto         the   pitch

towards        the halfway          line   near    to the N o r t h Stand,        ____________ .Mas wit h

us by now.

I first went           over    to a man who was            clutching      his    stomach.      I would

d e s cribe     him as a white man of about                   30 years      of age,    clean shaven,

bald,        wearing    dark     clothing.         I asked       him   if he was alright,         hegave

me the        thumbs    up sign a n d said to go and help someone                      else.

My s e l f    and        [
                         t hen went        over to a man and woman,               the man was sat

beside        her w ith his ar m a r o u n d her shoulder,                I could see that        she was

finding        it difficult          to breath and a p p e a r e d to be          in shock,     she was

crying        and kept      shivering.

I w ould       describe       this    lady as white with            long blonde       hair    of about 29

years        of age wearing a skirt an d a white                    blouse.

We then saw fans              carrying a man on an               ambulance      stretcher.

told us        to take them to the a m b u l a n c e             room while       she stayed with the

1a d y .

We   left      the    casualty       in the amb u l a n c e      room and    returned to the          pitch,

it was        then that a pol i c e m a n told us that                 they needed more stretchers

we   continued         over    to |_J_________ and gave her the                 stretcher,     she was

helping a man who a p p e a r e d            to have       bruising      to his    hips,     he couldn't

m ove    his    legs    but, was      concious and b r e athing           normally.         I would

des cr :ibe this man as wh:i. te of m e d i u m bui 1 d and he i g h t , 3'. cannot

remember        a n y thing    else about this man.

At   this      time           was    called away         from us a n d myself' and                       pu t

this man        onto    the stretcher we were               help of a Liverpool             fan we then

carried        him over       to the a m b u l a n c e    room   in the N orth Stand.

As we a p p r o a c h e d     the S p i o n Ko p N o t t i n g h a m Forest     fans started to

swear an d shout at the Li v e r p o o l                 fan who was     helping      us.

Once     inside       the a m bulance       room                   told me to stay with the man

whi 1e she          returned back onto            the    pitch

Wh i l s t    there    he was trea t e d by -------------(St Johns Ambulance Member)
                                                                                                          PAGE            4


I heard, her       tell    him that, she w o u l d get an a m b u l a n c e               for him as soon

as she     could.       The man asked me to                pour water        onto his          legs he said

that    he was     hot a n d he         couldn't move         them.

I stopped w i t h him until               the amb u l a n c e      took    him away to hospital,

                   hen a s k e d me to keep an eye on a man who                           kept    going

unconscious        she told me to shout                 if he stop p e d breathing.                I would

d e s cribe   this man as white of m e d i u m                build a n d height,             short     brown

hair,    clean shaven,            wearing     blue      d u n garees and a brown jumper                  I w ould

say he was about 34 years of a g e .

This man kept          drifting         in and out of         c o n s c i o u s n e s s and    the doctors

who were      there kept          coming over a n d          checking       on his      condition.

I cannot       remember who          these    doctors were           I remember an a m b u l a n c e m a n

who    came over and            put an a i r w a y    into his mouth,            this kept        slipping          out

of his m o u t h and        I kept       putting      it     back    in.

I r e m ained w ith this            man for about            one    hour before an am b u l a n c e           took

him away to hosptial.                   Whilst    I was w i t h this man             I noticed a man

being t r e a t e d for a broken han d and a n o t h e r                   for a nose          bleed.        I don't

think    anyone      else was        brought      in.

Once    the a m b u l a n c e    had taken       the man      I was w ith a w a y         I was    told to go

and sit       in the    police       riot van with                  and some       other       cadets.

I sat    in the front            seat   of the       van and       I could over         hear two men

talking,       I heard one          say to the        other     that      he had stabbed a policeman

I c o u l d n ’t see what         these me n      looked      like,       they were       in the      back     in

small    cubical s.

We    remained     in the        van until       about 6pm,         w hen the      fans       had gone and

things     had calmed down,              I went      to look       for my dad and we went                home.

I can remember          smelling        drink     on the      breath of all           the      people    I

treated.        I w o u l d describe my s e l f as a white                  lad of 5* 4 tall             of slim

build,     short     blonde       hair,    blue      eyes,    I was w e a r i n g my St Johns

              I am a m a r r i e d man       residing at the a bove address w ith my wife and two

              chiIdren*

              I have     been a Liv e r p o o l       supporter       all    my life and fact           come from the

              L i verpool       area.

              On S a t u r d a y    15 April     .1989 <150489)           together w i t h a friend of mine

              named                                                                               W inchester      I

              went    to H i l l s b o r o u g h to w a t c h Liverpool         play N o t t i n g h a m Forest,

             We t r a v e l l e d to H i l l s b o r o u g h   in my own private           vehicle      leaving      the

             Winchester            area just after         1000 am.         We did not stop en            route to the

              game,     I did however          e x p e r i e n c e slight    delays     due to h eavy traffic on

              the M1 m o t o r w a y and near          to the ground.

             We a r r i v e d at a p p r o x i m a t e l y 2 . 0 5   pm    (1405)    u n f o r t u n a t e l y missing   the

              signs dir e c t i n g     us to the        ground ending          up somewhere         in the City
                                                                                                                PAGE


Centre.       It was          t h erefore    n e c e s s a r y to a p p r o a c h   the ground from the

•Spion K o p ' end this              part of the ground                 being a l l o c a t e d to the

N o t t i n g h a m Forest      contingent.

I had tr ouble           parking my vehicle                 there was no-one            directing         us to a

parking     place,         eventually         I m a n a g e d to park          in a road off P e n i s t o n e

R d f it was      a side        road near        to a school            but    I cannot tell you the                  name

 of this      road.

We star t e d     to walk        to the       ground together wit h                 large    numbers       of

N o t t i n g h a m Forest      supporters.              I o b v i o u s l y took my L i verpool           scarf

off.   I4e passed several                pubs on our way full                  of N o t t i n g h a m Forest

supporters.            The y were however                g e n e r a l l y well   behaved       but     n a turally      in

high     spirits.             I also    saw some          of them drinking            from      cans as they

were walk i ng along.

We had not got a ticket                    for the m a t c h and           intended to try and buy one

from someone           outside       the ground.

At about 2 . SO          pm    <1420)      we got to the            'Spion Kop'         area and then

c o ntinued on towards               the    leppings Ln end,               it was at        this      point     that we

came across           a N o t t i n g h a m Fo r e s t    supporter who sold us his ticket for

ten pounds.

At about 2. 3 5          pm <1435)         we a r r i v e d at the L e p p i n g s Ln end and

c o ntinued ask i n g          people      if they had any tickets                  for     sale,       the crowds

were    now s t a rting         to build up          in and a r o u n d the turnstiles.                    We

started, to walk a long L e p p ings                     Ln where we m a n a g e d to purchase                  two

tickets     off       supporters.           One was a standing                 ticket     for    the terrace

costing     us    ten      pounds      the other was             for a seat         in the West          stand

 costing us thirty                 pounds.         It was        not    easy      finding       someone       to

purchase      these       tickets       from,      there was           c e rtainly a s c a rcity of

tickets.         We    then star t e d to walk               back along L e p p i n g s Ln towards                 the

g round a n d we sold our original                        ticket       on route.

We got back           to the turns t i l e s        by L e p p i n g s Ln about 2.45               pm    <1445)       and
                                                                                                   PAGE        3


tossed a coin as         to who M,>ould have w h i c h ticket.                _______pon so he had

the seating      ticket.          He then went         his separate way.

The    crowd was     growing       near    to the turnstiles.            I saw three m ounted

officers almost         immediately          in front of me,          there was      also a Po l i c e m a n

on foot    standing      on a w a 11 adja c e n t        to the Police         horses.      The police

horses were      o b v iously      trying     to prevent       further       supporters     joining the

crowd    irt front     of the      turnstiles.         The Police      horses    prevented me from

joining    the   crowd Miaiting to go through the turnstiles,                           I was   there

for about     f ifteen minutes            during w h i c h time       supporters were        coming up

behind me and arou n d me.                The P o l i c e m a n on more than one         occasion told

us the gates were          shut and        not   to push forward.             It was at     this    point

that    the P o l i c e m a n on foot asked on his             radio for       the gates     to be

opened.     I a s s u m e d he meant         the turnstiles and o b v iously wanted to get

people    into   the    ground more          quickly because          by now    it was     very close

to kick off      time.       I    could not see any other              reason why he should want

the gates     open,     however       I did not have a particularly good view of the

crowd    in front of me           because     of the Police          horses.     The    policeman that

radioed    in the      i n s t r uction    re the gates was wearing a flat                  cap.

After about      five minutes          the police        officers      on the horses        told us to

come    through and they moved out of the way..                        I then started        to walk

towards    turnstile       ’8 ’ r easonably freely together with the                       crowd.     The

crowd walked to the              right of the t urnstiles and                in through a large

blue sliding       gate.         The m a j o r i t y of us went       through this       gate however

people were      still     also      going    in t h rough the turnstiles.               I did not see

one on the gate         to take our          tickets     off   us    in fact    I still     have my

ticket    intact.       I have handed this             ticket       to the Police,                 refers.

I was very su r p r i s e d that we were a l l o w e d to go through this gate.                           I

have    been going      to football matches              for   twentyfive years and never

before have      I gained access             to a football          ground    in this manner.

Ones    inside       the ground         c omplex            everyone      headed          for a              tunnel            leading

to the terraces.               There were           still       no o ff icials around                          to direct                   us.

we were m oving           forward.           The    tunnel          was   full          for    the whole                   length.               As

voluntary movement               ceased and            I was t a k e n s li gh tl y to my left onto the

pressure          increased,         it was     like a          vice g r ad ua ll y tightening                                 up an my

body.        At times my feet were                  not       in contact with the ground.                                       We          were

just    like a solid mass mo v in g                  slowly forward no one                             could do anything

crush was         still           intense,       this        s eemed to go on for                          two or three

minutes,,          1 then saw some                  of the          fans who were a l re ad y on the                                  pitch

               On S a t u r d a y    the    15th April      1989    (150489)         I was     part    of Serial         13

               supervised           by Police      Sergeant 840 WRIGHT.                 At    10.0 0am that day            I

              a r r i v e d at M i d l a n d R a i l w a y Station,        Sheffield/          a long with other

               o f f icers    in Serial        13.     Our duties were             to s u pervise        the Liverpool

               football       fans      from the trains          and onto        spe c i a l l y   laid on S ,Y ,I', buses

              At the      stat i o n       1 found the Liverpool               fans very f r i endly and             co­

               operative.           F r o m what     I saw there was            no trouble at all at               the

               station,       a l t h o u g h a small     q u a n t i t y of    intoxicants was taken from the

              fans     before       they boar d e d the buses.

              As each bus           became     full    of s upporters           it t r a v e l l e d to H i l l s b o r o u g h

              s u p e r v i s e d by two officers           on each bus.            PC 405 FENW I C K and            I boarded

              one     of these        buses and made         the    journey to H i l l s b o r o u g h wit h fans.

              During      this      journey     there was        no ill        feeling       from the fans,          in fact      I
                                                                                                                 PAGE


found them to be very friendly,                          a l t h o u g h some of them did seem to

be the w orst          for drink.           After       d epositing       the    bus    load of

su pporters         in H i l l s b o r o u g h   near    to the stadium,            PC 40 5 FENWICK and

my s e l f    r e t u r n e d to the M i d l a n d S t a t i o n on the now empty bus.

A f t e r a r r i v i n g at the s t a t i o n a n d finding              that     there were        no other

members        of our S e r i a l , we made             our way back         to H i l l s b o r o u g h along

w ith other         officers       on a S.Y.T,           bus.      Whilst       trav e l l i n g   from the

centre        of S h e f f i e l d to the H i l l s b o r o u g h S t a d i u m      I saw that a large

number        of the      pubs were        open an d      large     crowds       of supporters             had

g a t h e r e d outside and          in the       su r r o u n d i n g area.       F rom what       I could

see a large           number of these             supporters        were d r i nking         intoxicants*

At S . 4 0 p m     (1440)     PC FENW I C K       and    I arrived at the              stadium,      M/e

ente r e d the gro u n d an d w a i t e d for our Serial                        to reform.         At aro u n d

3.03pm        <1503),      while PC F E N W I C K and           I were     awaiting        the     remainder          of

our Serial          we were a p p r o a c h e d      by a Sergeant           who d i r e c t e d us to join

his Serial          as some trouble              had been seen          in the ground.              We

wa l k e d as a Serial            a r o u n d the gr o u n d     in front        of the N orth S tand

to the L e p p i n g s Ln side             of the       ground.       As we w a l k e d around the

track        I noti c e d that       the     centre      pen a p p e a r e d a b s o l u t e l y   packed

w i t h supp o r t e r s    and some        of these        s u pporters a p p e a r e d to be fighting

 at    the     front      of the terrace           near to the wire m e s h fencing,

I saw one or two              people       b egin to      climb over         the top of the wire

barrier        fence a n d fall          onto     the    track at the           rear of the goal area,

  I then saw one            football        fan,    a man aged          late SO *s , well           built        to

fat,    5'10 tall,          wearing        jeans an d a white            shirt w h i c h was         not     tucked

into     his trousers,            this man        ran onto the          pitch and took hold of the

Liverpool         g o a l k e e p e r and he a p p e a r e d     to be r e m o n s t r a t i n g with him,

PC FENW I C K       and    I ran onto the            pitch and took             hold of the m a n who was

  crying an d shouting,                "Why w o n ’t they s t o p ? 11           He a p p e a r e d very

upset,        u n s t e a d y on his     feet and was           shouting        constantly.          It was
                                                                                                                PAuE


our    intention to eject                 this man under                the ground          regulations an d as

 we w a l k e d ar o u n d        the    track       I saw he was u n s t e a d y on his               feet.

After we had w a l k e d a little way he began to complain of                                          chest

injuries        and he       calmed down s u f f i c i e n t l y to enable PC FENWICK and                             I

 to u n d e r s t a n d what        he was         saying.         He    informed us that a number of

 people        had been       crushed at the front                      of the L e p p i n g s Ln terrace

and were        lying       injured,           I saw he a p p e a r e d        injured and

i m m e d i a t e l y handed       him to a S t . Johns Am b u l a n c e attendant,                       a woman,

 to be t r e a t e d for his              injuries.

T o g ether     w i t h PC 405 FENWICK,                    I ran back       towards the Leppings               Ln

side of the ground and                    I saw a line of Police Offic e r s against

the    perimeter           fencing-           Ha v i n g    reached the wire             fencing      I saw on

the    te r r a c i n g at the front,                  under the fencing,                   were a large number

 of    persons        lying       piled up           one      on another       and they a p p e a r e d      to me

at    that     stage       to be dead.             Other      fans were        s t a nding up to their

wa i s t s    in dead bodies and                 I saw a bald S e r g e a n t and other                 officers

 attempting           to    pull    fans       out of the Ho p onto                the      track    through a

small        gate    in the fencing.                   Other fans were a t t e m p t i n g           to climb

over    the     top of the fencing                     an d      1 then became parted from

PC FENWICK.            I was       unable        to assist at the              gate      in the fencing            so I

took off my helmet an d                   climbed onto             the wall        in front         of the

high fencing.               I leaned over             the     top,      trying     to reach a fan.             I

was a s s i s t e d    by PC 2 0 8 9 S t e v e n MADDOCKS,                    I d a n g l e d over the

fencing w i t h PC M A D D O C K S and a t t e m p t e d                 to reach a man who appeared

to be a g e d about EO / E E years                    who was w e a r i n g a g reen jacket.                   He wa

shouting,           "Help me,       help me".              We m a n a g e d to take          hold of

his    hands a n d         pull    him upwards             but    had d i f f i c u l t y    in getting him

over    the     top    part of the fencing,                      which    is covered wit h spikes and

 at an angle           to the       rest of the fans,                   to stop fans          from climbing

over.        He kicked off              his    shoes and was able                to   insert his shoes
                                                                                                              PAGE   4


into the holes             in the fencing and with PC M A D D O C K S                    I was able

to pull       him     over       the top of the fence.              W hen we       got    him to the

track other           officers took this man from us.

Toget h e r    w ith PC M A D D O C K S     I a gain       leaned over       the fence and

w ith his a s s i s t a n c e      I managed        to   reach two more men,               both    in

their    early        20's       and pull them both over             the fence-            Both

these men were             hysterical        by this       time and       I saw that as           fast       as

 the Po l i c e were            releasing     the    crowd from the          front        it was

filling       up from the          back,      I then saw that             police officers              had

b r o k e n down a s e c t i o n of the          fencing and were able                   to gain

entry    into       the    crowd.        Ma n y more were         pulled out        here,     I also

took    hold of the wire              fence    and       rolled    it back     partially to

assist,       where       upon    I was    ha n d e d the body of a rnan in his                   late

teens    or    early 20's and             I carried him onto the               grass at the

side of the gaol                posts.     He a p p e a r e d u n c o n s c i o u s a n d a fan who

appeared       to be a Liverpool              supporter,          male,   w i t h jeans and a

white    sweat       shirt a s s i s t e d me to attempt             to    carry out artificial

respiration.              This man felt at his              chest and a t t e m p t e d to         carry

out    cardiac m a s s a g e and          I held his        neck an d head          in the

a p p r o v e d manner      to    carry out m o u t h to m o u t h         resuscitation.

This    fan smel l e d s t r o n g l y of intoxicants a n d as                 I     carried       out

m o u t h to m o u t h     I got a m o u t h        full of vomit,         w h i c h tasted       of

alcohol.        We    turned the          casualty onto his           back a        couple of times

 to clear       his m o u t h of vomit and               continued artificial

respiration and             cardiac massage.

We were       then joined          by a f i r e m a n     in unif o r m who        had a plastic

a i r w a y and this was           inserted         into his mouth,          this time we          were

joined     by a man who            stated     he was       a doctor and he started                 to

carry out       cardiac mass a g e          on the victim.            This     a p p eared    to

have    no effect          so    I said to the fan who had been helping me,
                                                                                                               PAGE


“ I think he          is dead".         The    Fan screamed at me              to continue,           so we did.

The doctor           then     took          from the f i r e m a n an oxygen mask

and    placed this            over          the airway,        he then turned on the oxygen

from a small           bottle     in a kit        bag,      w h i c h the fire m a n held.

After a time           the     doctor    took     off    the mask and said,                  "I think h e ’s

 dead".        He     tried his       pulse     in his       neck and u,<rist but              got   no joy.

 We were        then joined by a couple                  of fans who          had a ma k e s h i f t

stretcher.            T hey    placed him on this and                carried him awa y

towards        the    police     room.        I never       saw that       injured man again.

I remember my           radio was        s w i t c h e d on but the m e s sages               appeared

n o n - s t o p and garbled and             I could not         tell a w ord of what was

said,      I then a s s i s t e d other           persons       to make       t e m p o r a r y stretchers

 from a d v e r t i s i n g     boards,        I then saw that a large                   number      of

Liverpoo l       fans who were on the                 pitch aro u n d the goal                began to

storm up the           pitch towards           the N o t t i n g h a m s u p p o r t e r s    on the far

Kop.     I saw a number              of officers         run towards          the half M/ay line

and    I joined        them and together             we forced the Liverpool

supporters           back     towards    the L e p pings        Ln side       of the ground.              As

I wa l k e d    back    towards       the L e p p i n g s     Ln    Isaw most       of       the   officers

in my Serial,           including PS WRIGHT,                  then joined them.              Every o n e at

 that    side        of the ground was            clearly upset and was                  crying,

including my s e l f and other Police Officers,                             After        staying     on     the

 track    for some            time we were        d i r e c t e d by Inspector           DEW S to leave

 the ground a n d walk               towards      the    parked S.Y.T,           buses        to   convey

L i verpool      supporters          back     to M i d l a n d Station.          As we w a l k e d to

those    buses        I can clearly           remember       fans    calling me a "MURDERING

BASTARD"       and a "KILLER",              they also         said "I BET         YOUR G LAD OF THE

OVERTIME".           T hese     comments made me              very upset.

After    r e maining at W a d s l e y Bridge wit h the buses                         for      some time and no

more    fans appeared,            Inspector DEWS             i n structed us to make up a van and
                                                                                                   PAGE


            to travel        into S h e f f i e l d C ity Centre    on Pu b l i c Order Patrol,

            I went     off    duty at 8 . 0 0 p m   (2000)   that    same   day.

I don't        know the           name of       it.      Outs i d e was a. group of supporters                    who

were wear i n g            red/white*           I w ould estimate              the   number     between 20 and

50    people,         As     we    continued our journey we t r avelled along Fox                                Hill

RD where        there        were     I think a couple              of    pubs open wit h Suppo r t e r s

stood outside              them.       I am not          sure      of the names         of any of       the   pubs.

We    parked the            car    in Baxter DR and walked                     to the    ground along Fox

Hill    RD,      into Penis tone             RD and        into     the ground         reporting to the           first

aid    room;      we a r r i v e d at        about S pm         (1400)

On our walk           from the         car      to the ground            the   pubs we      passed were          busy




people       outside         as    I d i d n ’t take that much notice.

Whs n we a r r i v e d at t he first                   aid    r o om we     s i gned the      book and we r e

asked to all           go     to the       corner        of the West and N orth Stands*

All    of us,        thats        the 3 cadets and my husband, and                        me then went        into

the ground and onto                  our     post,, we       got    there      about      '£,.10 pm (1410).

was          in shock,                       I took               charge         of him and w a l k e d                        him    into       the       first       aid

to make                  sure          she was alright,                                 she had started                       to    improve         her        breathing

1 then                looked a r o u n d and saw a man                                            in the      same area,                  he was white

about S 3 - 3 5 years                               lay on the                   grass.                 I went       over          to him and              checked

him.                 He was            conscious                  and        1 layed him                   in the             recovery         position,               I

went     to     look for a. stretcher,                          which        I found       but as          I went    to get    the

stretche r          another         man was              put, on the          stretcher,          a fan had          carried him

and    placed him on the stretcher.,                                     X went         over    to the stretcher             looked

at the man who was                    in the age                 group 2 3-35 yrs wit h dark                     hair and

found he had severe                     bruising               on the        left side of his abdomen,                      he was

conscious          and      in pain,            1 made             sure he was            c omfortable and got               the

stretcher           pushed towards                   the first aid                 room.        As we were making             our

way towards             the      first        aid        room one         of the Li v e r p o o l           fans who was

pushing         the     s t r etcher was                 shouting          at the N o t t i n g h a m fans           that    it was

their       fault.,         I told him to                  push the stretcher and help which ha

did.       We got         to the        first            aid     room w i t h the man,                wa    put- the    stretcher



I then stayed               in that area and a s s i s t e d                        people who were              there.       There

was     not a lot           of    room        in that            area      because        of the       two mobile        police

cell      vans,        w h i c h were         parked           in the area              (marked on map).

In the a re a           I was       most       of        the     people were             not    seriously        injured,

there was           one       man about 20 y ears old,                         who was          beariy       conscious,.        I ’m

not    sure what              his      injuries were, he was                       lay    in     the       recovery     position

and     I kept         checking         he was            still alive,.

I did see           the       Po l i c e      doing m o u t h to m outh on a                     person       near     the gym

and then went               back.          There was also a young man who                                   had his mother

with him-             He was a r o u n d 20 years                       old,       he    came    into       the area     late on,

he had a p o s s i b i l i t y of a collapsed                                lung,       his    breathing was           noisy and

he was        pale.        He w a s n ’t in the area                        very        long before          he was    taken

away      by ambulance.

There was           a man        brought        into the area on a board by a group of
supporters*            The     person on the          board was         dead,    he was a man and his

face was        blue whe n he was             brought      in.     I can't       describe       him at all,

he was      put     down     inf rant     of the       police/first        aid    room at       first*        The

ma n was     blue       in the face          and his eyes were            just    staring,

                saw to him.            I d o n ’t know where he was m oved to,                    but he wasn

in the area very               long.

I ’m not sure           of the time          I left the area and went               back    to the       pitch,

the P o l i c e     line was       still     across      the     pitch and most       of the fans             had

left.       The     people      on the       pitch were         upset    but not    in need of

a t t e n t i o n at   that     time*        I had a look         round the       people    to see       if

anyone      needed a t t e n t i o n and then went                back    to where     I was      before.

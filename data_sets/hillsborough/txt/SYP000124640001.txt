 TERRACING.

 Q54

 IS THERE ANYTHING THAT YOU WISH TO ADD WHICH YOU FEEL IS VITAL TO THIS

 JUDICIAL INQUIRY?

 I FEEL THAT THE POLICE SHOULD HAVE RESPONDED QUICKER TO THE FANS'        REQUESTS

 FOR HELP INSTEAD OF BLATANTLY IGNORING T H E M .

 I THINK THAT THE GATE AT THE BACK OF THE PEN SHOULD        HAVE   BEEN OPENED SOONER

 TO LET THE FANS OUT.        ONCE ON THE PITCH THE POLICE   TOLD   ME    TO GO AWAY BUT

 THEY D I D N ’T TELL ME WHERE.

 ALSO THE 100 OR SO POLICE LINED UP ACROSS THE 1/2 WAY (HALFWAY) LINE SHOULD

           HELPED MORE INSTEAD OF STANDING THERE.

 I ALSO FEEL THAT THE POLICEMAN WHO GAVE THE ORDER TO OPEN THE GATE SHOULD

 HAVE BEEN IN CONTACT WITH OFFICERS INSIDE THE GROUND.

 GATE SOONER THAN HE DID,          THERE WAS A LACK OF ANNOUNCEMENTS ABOUT WHAT WAS

 HAPPENING.

 Q54

 IS THERE ANYTHING THAT YOU WISH TO ADD WHICH YOU FEEL IS VITAL TO THIS

 JUDICIAL INQUIRY?

 I THINK THAT THE GATE SHOULD NOT BE OPENED BECAUSE PEOPLE WITHOUT TICKETS

 COULD GET IN.          THE GAME SHOULD HAVE BEEN DELAYED IN ORDER FOR FANS WITH

 T|J^ETS COULD GET IN.          ALTHOUGH IT HAD WORKED LAST YEAR I FEEL THE TEAMS

 SHOULD HAVE BEEN ALLOCATED THE OPPOSITE E N D S , LIVERPOOL HAD SAID THAT THEY

 WANTED THE GAME PLAYED AT A LARGER GROUND IE OLD TRAFFORD.

Q54

IS THERE ANYTHING THAT YOU WISH TO ADD WHICH YOU FEEL IS VITAL TO THIS

                               e^rr
•1) I CANNOT UNDERSTAND WHY JD
                             ONLY A HANDFUL           PEOPLE ON MY COACH WERE
                            w:--------------
      RCHED FOR TICKETS AND ALCOHOL AND i] T THE WHOLE COACH.             I CONSIDER THIS

TO BE A WASTE OF MANPOWER UNLESS p4E JOB IS DONE PROPERLY.                 t^TT

2) COMING IN I SAW ALL THE PUB^/WERE CLOSED,          YET ALCOHOL WAS FREELY

AVAILABLE FROM OFF LICENCES, AND AGAIN A COLOSSAL AMOUNT OF POLICE TIED

UP WATCHING FANS DRINKING.                      *

I DIDN'T SEE ANY STEWARDS,     EXCEPT AT THE VTOP OF THE WEST STAND.

ONE OF THE LADS ON THE COACH ACTUALLY LOST 3 OF HIS FRIENDS                (THEY DIED).

tA    e   WAS NO DIRECTION FROM THE POLICE TO WHERE HE SHOULD GO Tp^FIND THEM

OR THEIR PROPERTY.      THE POLICE D I D N ’T HAVE ANY RADIOS.        T H C O U L D N ’T TELL

                                    p/r/ T n w / v / o V /
WHEN THE INCIDENT HAPPENED NOBODY COULD HEAR THE PA SYSTEM,                IT WAS POOR.

PEOPLE WERE FRUSTRATED BY FOREST FANS CHANTING VWD yBAR RAC KING .

WHY WERE PHOTOGRAPHERS TAKING PICTURES INSTEAD Of/ H E L P I N G PEOPLE.

 STOPPING COACHES ON THE APPROACH TO SHEFFIELD AND CHECKING THAT FANS HAD

 TICKETS.     THEY DIDN'T DO THIS THIS YEAR LAST YEAR YOU WERE ONLY ALLOWED TO GO

 TO THE GROUND BUT THIS TIME YOU HCOULD WALK WHERE YOU WANTED TO

 TUNNEL DIRECTING PEOPLE AROUND J              -iE SIDES OF THE TERRACING BECAUSE THE

 CENTRE WAS FULL U P .

 WAS GOING ON IN THE TERRACES BECAUSE AS PEOPLE WERE TRYING TO CLIMB OUT A'i

 THE FRONT MORE PEOPlyE WERE STl'ILL GETTING IN AT THE BACK MAKING THINGS

THERE SEEMED A TOTAL LACK OF COMMUNICATIONS^ [WHEN I FINALLY LEFT THE WEST

STAND AND SAW 12 DEAD ON THE GROUND OUTSIDE THE TUNNEL,        I COULD S EE PEOPLE

STILL IN THE TUNNEL AND BELIEVE THE CRUSH WAS STILL ON.         THE POLICE SHOULD

HAVE BEEN AWARE BY THEN, OF THE SIZE OF THE DISASTER AND BEEN GETTING PEOPLE

OUT FROM THE B A C K .

•rHE POLICE SEEMED CALLOUS AND IN DIFFERENT TO THE FEELINGS OF SUPPORTERS

i W l N G TO FIND RELATIVES,   THEY WERE UNFEELING IN THE WAY THEY DEACT WITH

THEM,   JUST TELLING THEM TO    "GO A W A Y 5 INSTEAD OF HELPING OR EXPLAINING THE

SITUATION.

G53

DID YOU ATTEND THE GAME IN 1988?

NO

Q54

IS THERE ANYTHING THAT YOU WISH TO ADD WHICH YOU FEEL IS VITAL TO THIS

JUDICIAL INQUIRY?

T®?E    APPEARED TO BE A LACK OF STEWARDS AND POLICE ENGAGED IN CONTROLLING THE

INCOMING C R O W D S .

THERE WAS ALSO A LACK OF SIGNS TELLING FANS WHERE THEY COULD GO.

THERE SHOULD BE SOME METHOD OF STOPPING FANS ENTERING THE PENS WHEN THEY ARE

FULL.

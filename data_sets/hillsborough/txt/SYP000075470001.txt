            I am                        and live at the above mentioned address

            On Saturday 15th April     1989,    (150489),
                                                      I travelled to H i l l s b o rough
                                                                  _________
            Football Stadium,    together with a friend of mine,                      , The

                                      Scarcliffe,    in his motor car, a Volkswagen Golf,

                     We intended to watch the Liverpool and Nottingham Forest F A

            Cup match,    and, at the time of travelling,     neither of us had purchased

           a ticket to enter the ground, and thought          it likely that we would be

            able to buy a ticket each at the ground. We set off from Scarcliffe at

           about 8.45am (0845) and arrived in Sheffield at about 9.30am

            (0930). We did not stop on route,        nor did we suffer any delays at all.

           We then walked towards the ground and, at a distance of about 50 yards

            from the Leppings Ln entrance,       I was able to buy a ticket, having a

            face value of £6.00,     for £15,   for the Leppings Ln standing afrea. The
                                                                          PAGE    2
                                                                          S1973

walk from the car to the ground took approximately 5 minutes. Both

John and I were able to buy tickets easily and,       because    it was still

fairly early in the morning,      we went for a walk and something to eat

in the town area. We later made our ^ a y     back to the ground and reached

the entrance at approximately 11.4!j^am (1145). There was hardly any

other spectators at this time ned4r the turnstiles,       there was a few

Policemen standing nearby. There were no queues and we were able to

simply walk up to the turnstiles and hand our tickets          in without any

directions being given by Police or Stewards.

Once    inside the ground,    the obvious route to the terraces    is the

tunnel which directly faces people entering the turnstiles from

Leppings Ln and gives a view of the pitch.       I walked towards the

entrance which had about 5 or 6 Police Officers standing by.          I walked

through the tunnel with ease and on entering the terrace whic         y was
virtually empty,    I think there was only six people already / h e r e , I

easily found a match viewing point,       that was about 11,5Q^mi (1150).

As the afternoon went on leading towards kick-off time,          I was able to

stand and talk to            as the terrace slowly started to fill. Up until

about 2.15    (1415)-2.20pm (1420),    the crowd was fairly comfortable

After this time,    the crowd gradually filled even more,       people be^an to

be packed tighter together and I lost contact with                Just,

before 3.QQpm    (1500),   the crowd was extremely crushed togeffier and it

was very uncomfortable to be in there.

The match kicked off and I was physically lifted off my feet by the

movement and size of the crowd. Other people were obviously having the

same    problems as myself and began screaming out.    I literally began to

panic and feared for my own safety. There was an immense build-up £if

heat,    I sweat a lot and the steam was visible rising above the c/owd.

The crowd had been crushed forward,       I was about 20 feet ahead off my

initial viewing position and could not move       rearwards.    People/in front
                                                                        PAGE      3
                                                                        S1973

of myself were experiencing the same effects as myself and general

panic appeared to set      in. In desperation I managed to lift myself

above    people, and crawl over standing spectators shoulders to the

b a r r ier between Pen 3 and PenyS,   where I was able to climb over where

there was hardly any crowd,/in fact I fell off the fence onto the

concrete floor of Pen 2. A gentleman in the pen came over and helped

me up. He lead me over to a gate which lead to the pitch where a

Policeman then took me to the St Johns.        I sat on the edge of the

pitch, winded,      waiting for the St J o h n ’s Ambulance team when another

Officer,    standing near the corner flag told me not to sit there,        but

made me go back into the terraces       in the corner. This Officer    probably

did not know what was happening        in the centre pens due to his position

at the very corner of the field.

I didn't get treated,      and once I started to gather my senses,      I walked

back across the terrace towards terrace 3, hoping to find              |. As I

got near the fence,            tapped me on the shoulder,    he too had managed

to get out of       the pen. This was about 3.'10pm   (1510) and the crowd was

still    crushed.

As the time went on, the Police appeared^to slowly recognise the

problem and in a disorganised manner,ysome started to help fans over

the fencing and towards the pitch.

I did not actually see anybody die,        but it was obvious due to the

position of bodies and attempts being made to revive people,          that some

had died.

I eventually left      the ground at about 3.40pm     (1540). Due to the mental

state of            and I, we lacked communication    and lost track of each

other.    I returned to where we had parked the car,        it had gone and I

had to make my own way home.

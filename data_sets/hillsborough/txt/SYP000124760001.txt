 Q46

 WERE YOU INJURED, IF S O , DID YOU ATTEND HOSPITAL IN SHEFFIELD?

 NO.

 Q47

       YOU WITNESS ANY DEATHS?

 SOME OF THE DEAD WERE BROUGHT UP TO THE HOP END AND LEFT BY THE GOAL,          I SAW

 SOMEBODY WORKING ON A YOUNG LAD, THEY HAD AN OXYGEN MASK AND SOMETHING

 ATTACHED TO HIS C H E S T .   THEY WORKED ON HIM FOR A TIME THEN HE WAS TAKEN AWAY

 IN AN AMBULANCE.

 Q48

 DID YOU ASSIST ANYONE WHO WAS DEAD OR INJURED,       IF SO, BRIEFLY EXPLAIN,

 FROM MY POSITION I COULDN’T HELP,


Q 17

  •
 DID YOU WITNESS ANYTHING THAT YOU CONSIDER WAS A FACTOR IN THE DEATHS, OR THE

 INJURIES TO ANY PERSON?

 THE ONLY THING I COULD SEE WAS THAT WAVE, THE SURGE THAT CAME DOWN.

 G5Q

 WHAT TIME DID YOU LEAVE THE FOOTBALL GROUND?

 ABOUT 3.45 PM (1545),

 Q51

 DID YOU LEAVE ON THE DIRECTION OF EITHER A POLICE OFFICER, A STEWARD, A

 LOUDSPEAKER ANNOUNCEMENT OR OF YOUR OWN ACCORD?
                                                                             PAGE   8

 THERE WAS AN ANNOUNCEMENT ON THE TANNOY THAT THE GAME HAD BEEN ABANDONED IN

 MY POSITION IT WAS QUITE CLEAR.


Q18

 Q52

 DID YOU WITNESS ANYTHING THAT YOU CONSIDER TO SE A CRIMINAL OFFENCE?

 NOT THAT I CAN THINK OF.

 Q53

 DO YOU HAVE ANY VIEWS OR OBSERVATIONS ON THE WAY THE INCIDENT WAS HANDLED,

 AFTER THE MATCH WAS STOPPED?

 THE WHOLE THING SEEMED TO BE DISORGANISED CHAOS,      THE POLICE DIDN’T SEEM TO

  »     WHAT TO D O .   WHAT REALLY INFURIATED THE FANS WAS WHEN A LOAD OF POLICE

 CAME INTO THE GROUND AND LINED UP ALONG THE FRONT OF OUR STAND.       THERE WAS

 SOME CHANTING FROM THE KOP, THE NOTTS FOREST FANS PROBABLY DIDN’T KNOW WHAT

 WAS GOING ON, SOME LIVERPOOL FAN S, CLEARLY INCENSED RAN TOWARDS THEM, THEN THE

 POLICE LINED UP ACROSS THE PITCH.       THERE WAS NO CROWD TROUBLE THOUGH AND I

 C O U L D N ’T UNDERSTAND WHY THEY JUST STOOD THERE AND DID NOTHING TO ASSIST THE

 INJURED.    THE FANS WERE HAVING TO DO IT ALL, CARRYING DEAD AND INJURED ON

 MAKE-SHIFT STRETCHERS.       THEY WERE CARRYING THEM THROUGH THE LINE OF POLICE, SO

 THE POLICE MUST HAVE KNOWN HOW SERIOUS IT WAS, BUT THEY JUST STAYED IN LINE,

J^JHEU^NG.

 THERE WAS A LACK OF INFORMATION OVER THE TANNOY SYSTEM.

 OUTSIDE THERE WAS ALSO CHAOS WITH PEOPLE CLEARLY UPSET RUNNING ROUND,
 PRESUMABLY TRYING TO FIND FRIENDS AND RELATIVES AND AGAIN THERE WERE VANS FULL

 OF POLICE WHO WERE DOING NOTHING.

 Q53A

 DID YOU ATTEND THE MATCH IN 1988 (000088)?

 NO.

 IS THERE ANYTHING THAT YOU WISH TO ADD WHICH YOU PEEL IS VITAL TO THIS

 JUDICIAL INQUIRY?

 WHAT WAS ANNOYING WAS THAT AT ABOUT 2.55 PM (1455) A BLOKE CAME UP INTO THE

 STAND SAYING “THEY'VE SMASHED A GATE DOWN THERE 7 THERE5S GOING TO BE

 T R O U B L E “ THIS REMARK CAUSED A BIT OF FRICTION AS THE INCIDENT OCCURRED.

 AFTER THE MATCH WAS STOPPED?

 SNORTERS    HAVE GOT THE POLICE THOUGHT THERE WAS VIOLENCE GOING ON AND FAILED

 TO REALISE THAT PEOPLE WERE BEING CRUSHED.

IS THERE ANYTHING THAT YOU WISH TO ADD WHICH YOU FEEL US VITAL TO THIS

JUDICIAL INQUIRY?

1) BETTER ACCESS TO TURNSTILES, NOT ALL IN SAME PLACE.                 __

2) THERE SHOULD HAVE BEEN BETTER POLICING OUTSIDE THE GROUND OPERATING A

 FI I T crO ‘ SYSTEM FOR CHECKING TICKETS ETC.   AND I ALSO THINK THAT STEWARDS

COULD HAVE BEEN USED OUTSIDE TO GET QUEUES FORMED.

3) KEEP THE PERIMETER FENCING BUT MAKE IT EASY TO BE OPENED LIKE THE FRENCH

S ^ T E M WHERE THE WHOLE FENCE CAN BE OPENED AT THE PUSH OF A BUTTON.

4) I THINK 1 HA F IF LIVERPOOL HAD HAD iHE U 1G g ER ALLOCATION Of' TICKETS.

the    left        of     the      main       press        box.           lytifas       in    general          conversation                 with

other       reporters              and       in    generaL/conversation                             we    commented             on     how

crowded        the        centre         part        ofyuie          terraces            of       Leppings       Ln     in      comparison

to    the     ends        parti c u l a r lyAthe                left        hand        cover       where       there        was       room.

                                                   was     recognised               by       some    of    the       Nottingham              Forest

supporters              in    f r o n y of         me.         It w a s        a mixed            reception          some       formally              and

some     abusive             whiors      I just           passed          off.          I remember             the    kick        off       and

while       w a t c h i n g /the         play        at    the       West         End    I recal 1 thinking                     there        was

likely        to     be      problems             behind        the       goal      because          of    the       crowding.               I then

cont in u ed         to w a t c h        the       play        and       Peter      BEARDSLEY             hit    the       ball        and       my

attention            was^drawn               to    peopie           climbing            over       the    fencing          at     the       West

Stand.         Nottingham                Forest           fans       in     front        started          calling          out        abuse

thinking           it w a s        a    pitch        invasion             but      I did          know    what       was     wrong          at    this

time.         The       match          was    continuing                 and      you    didn't          realise        what          was    going

on    u n t i 1 the          Policeman             came        on    the       pitch         to    stop    the       g a m e , by        then

there       w e re      people          on    the     pitch          by     the     g o a 1. iiy r e c o l l e c t i o n s            are    that

there       were        policemen             behind           the       goal      on    the       fences       but    as       people           were

climbing           out       over       the       fence        they       w e re    back          onto    the    fence          helping           to

pul 1 o t h e r s         out.          After        that       a    number         of       p o 1 icemen       lined        up       inf r o n t      of

the    North         Stand         and       looked        as       they       were      there       deal       with       any        trouble.

My    next      recollection                  is     of    a Liverpool                  fan       running       to    the       Nott ingham

Forest        end       and     it      was       because           the     Forest           fans    were       still        chanting,

came     back        and      the       p o 1 i ce    caught             h im .    The       next    I saw was             an     ambulance

come     in     from         the       Hop    end     with          its     be 11       ringing          and    it    seemed           calm

things        be c a u s e      it      was       chaos.            The     ambulance              went    to    the       back        of    the

goal     and       people          climbed           on    to       the     roof        of    it    and    were       pulling            peo pie

out    onto        it.        The       Forest        fans          started         chanting             again       and     about          SO    or

so    Liverpool              fans       started           to    go       towards         the       Hop    but    all       of     a    sudden

they    stopped              and       went       back     so       as    not      to    cause       trouble.              I think           that

caused        the       police          to    move        across          the      pitch          rather       than     stand          in    front

of    the    North          Standi.             They          must       have       been        two       deep       end    probably             about

two    hundred             in    number.

There       was       still          total          confusion                upto       about        15    minutes          later          and    I

remember          hearing             a       tannoy          message,             asking           people       to    get       off       the    pitch

and    it    was       apparent                he    couldn't                see    what        was       going/bn.              Confusion

continued             people          were          pumping          people             chest,        a n ^          recalled          seeing             two

people       being          carried             away          on    hoardings                w i t h /the i r f a c e s          covered          up       and

people       were          still          coming          out       of       the    crowd/and              c o 1 l a s pi n g .        People             were

helping       each          other             and    look          for       each       ofTier       and       policemen             were    h el pi ng

to    revive          people.             I then          heard          a    setyond m e s s a g e             asking       people          to       get

off    the    pitch.                 This       must          have       beam       about 3.30pm                 (1530).              About       ten

minutes       after             this          I saw       Kenny          DALGLISH             and     Brian          CLOUGH          come    onto          the

pitch       and       go    off       again.              K e n n / then            broadcast              a    message          asking          for

eveyone       to       co-operate                   with       tne       Police          because           there       was       a    problem

This    had       a    bit       of       a    calming             effect.

However,          before             this       somaf N o t t i n g h a m               Forest        fans       were       very       abusive

shouting          and       swearing                at    me       and       Liverpool              people       on    the       pitch       i nf r o n t

of    us.     I       recall          one       lad       got       out       of    hand        a    Liverpool             fan       shouted          him       "

My    mates       dead          out       there          now       I'm       going       to     kill       you"        He    tried          to    get

at    the    man       but       was          stopped          by    the       police.               Some       other       Nottingham                fans

pointed       out          the       trouble             maker       to       the       police        who       came       into       the    crowd.

That    happened                on    three          occasions.                    One       fan     was       took    away,          one    was

warned       by       the       police          and       one       got       away.

By    then    police             were          on    three          sides          of    the        ground,          across          the    halfway

line    and       down          each          side       to    the       West       Stand.            In       comparison             to    what          was

happening             there          were       few       more       police             around        the       edge       than       those       were

helping       the          injured.

I    decided          to    leave             the    box       to    see       if       my    wife        was    alright             who    had       a

seat    in    the          North          Stand.              I tried          to       walk        around       the       Leppings          Ln       end

as    I had       done          the       year       before          but       was       stopped           by    a    policeman             because

                      of         what       happened.                I heard         mention           of    between             5    and       9    dead       and       I

                      wondered               what       had        really       happened.               I went             out       of    the       ground          to       the

                          right        and       walked          around        the     ground          and       passed          Leppings                Ln    on    my       right

                      hand            side.        I    c o u l d n ’t       see     what      was      going          on       because             police          were

                      stopping               people          going        down       Leppings           Ln.           I eventually                   got       to    the       car

                          park        for    the       Executive             coach      and       rjsrj o i n e d      my       wife.           After         about

                      another               hour       we    left        after       we J^eard          on       the       radio          what       was       happeninbg.

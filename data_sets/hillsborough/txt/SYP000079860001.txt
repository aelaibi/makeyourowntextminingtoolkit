           a bo ut 30 years who was                 standing          nearby and said,           "How long          has    this

           The man        we were      t re ating was a bluish                  colour and       I knew he was             dead.

           The    doctor said, "We will               move onto the            next          one."      With the help of

      The    second         person who           I went      to assist was            s it ua te d on the       right       side

      of the         18 y ard a re a        (as    per     patient       two on map)

      This     person was a white                  male,        age d 2 5 - 3 0 years        old and he was           placed

      in the         recovery       position.            By his side were              two adults who were

      co mforting           him.      I ascertained              that the       patient was            still breathing

      and    the      two ad ul ts were            looking after him.

      In view of this,                I then went            to a white male,               aged approx        35 years.              I

      cannot         give any other              description.            He was       s it ua te d     at a p o i n t next to/

      or on the          penalty spot             (as     per    pa'Urattt 3 on map).                This man was          lying

      on his back,             and a white             m an w a / / r o u c h e d over       him.      At    this    point,       I

      saw    that      the     patient was             not Isreathing and             there was        no signs       of a

      w hite male.

      I saw that            the    patient was            lying     on his back,            and was     s ur ro u nd e d    by

      two    or three          people.           One    of w hom     I beleive         to be a doctor,              bent    his

      head    back,         a l t h o u g h to    clear      the    patients airways,                and he a s k ed me          if

      I could obtain an a i rw a y and some drugs.                                   I gave    the     p er so n/ do ct or an

      a ir w a y from the           ’Mot iv u s ’ resuscitator and he                       carried on from there.

      At    this      point,       on the        request        of the doctor,           I tried to seek some

      drugs,         but my finding were                  negative.        I r et urned to the               doctor and

      informed him that                I could get              no drugs.        At the same           time,    I could see

              that      the    patient a p p e a r e d        to be dead.          His   face was     blue and    there

             w ere      no a p p a r en t    signs      of     life.

             Although          I then went            to assist        other     injured    persons,       I cannot    recall

              I cannot         recall       what      time     it was      but after      this,    I was    i nstructed    by

              an u n k n o w n senior         fire      officer,        to go to the        gym na si um and assist with

              o xy g e n as and w h e n they                 required      it.

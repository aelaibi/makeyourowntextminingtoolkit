HILLSBOROUGH INQUIRY: HOME OFFICE EVIDENCE
This note seeks your advice on how we might deal with the
question of police radio communications if the issue is raised by
the Hillsborough Inquiry in the course of our oral evidence to
the Inquiry.
The Home Office will give oral evidence to the Inquiry in the
fairly near future. The end of September or early October have
been mentioned and it is possible that we shall be called upon as
soon as the 29th September.    Mr Turney will probably head the
team which is likely to include colleagues from the police
department (F8 Division).
The Inquiry touched upon police communications in the Interim
Report (a copy of relevant extracts is attached). I also attach
a copy of the relevant comments of the Popplewell Inquiry set up
after the Bradford fire.
The Hillsborough Inquiry was originally inclined to make some
sort of recommendation in the Interim Report to the effect that
the Home Office should devise a police radio system capable of
overcoming background noise.   I do not know what persuaded the
Inquiry to drop the recommendation but it seems likely that it is
something which will be considered for inclusion in the Final
Report. If you have already dealt with this (unbeknown to me) I
apologise for troubling you again but I wish to ensure that we
are prepared should it be raised in the course of our giving oral
evidence.

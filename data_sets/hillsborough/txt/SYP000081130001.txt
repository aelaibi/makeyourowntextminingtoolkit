                On    the    afternoon          of    Saturday      April       15th          1989,    I was       engaged       on

                motorway         patrol       duties       in    company       with       P C . 1323    A X U P , in      the    Doncaster

                Divisional          area.

                At    3 . 15pm     we    were    requested         to   attend,           along       with    other       mobiles,        to

                the       Hillsborough          football         ground.

                We    arrived       there       at    about      3.30pm    and       were       engaged       on    minor       logistical

POLICE CONSTABLE 1715



HACKENTHORPE POLICE STATION



At 8.20 am,          15-4.89,    I reported for duty at Hackenthorpe Police Station, I

ascertained then that I was on Serial No 16 under Police Sergeant 1288 Payne.

Bus    transport      to Hillsborough            and arrived          for briefing      in the North Stand

well before 10.00 am.                During the briefing found we were to work turnstiles

A-G on Leppings Lane - outside the ground.

Packed meal was provided and eaten in the stand prior to taking up positions

at the turnstiles.

Positions were taken up at the turnstiles in plenty of time for them opening

at 12 noon.          One turnstile opened up at about 11.50 am, they were all open by

about 12.10 pm.

Initially       I    was   paired         up    with    Police    Constable      3066    Huckstepp   at   the

turnstile nearest the barrier, furthest away from the wall.

Once    spectators began             to   arrive       the numbers were low enough to allow that

EVERYONE       was    searched       before      entering       the   ground.     Other officers     on the

serial made arrests for various offences committed by persons attempting to

enter the ground.

The    first    arrivals        at   the       ground    were    generally      good humoured,   sober and

caused few problems.

As the numbers arriving at the turnstiles began to grow - from about 2.00 pm

onwards,       the searching of spectators became                      selective - but the atmosphere

was generally still good.
At this time,       the number of Police Officers on duty had decreased at these

turnstiles due to prisoners having been arrested.

At 2.30     pm or      thereabouts, the        numbers    at the gates swelled considerably.

Many of     these late arrivals were worse for drink but may                  not be classified as

drunk.      They    were      singing and      chanting    and   began to     push    from    the back,

causing     congestion        between the barrier and the wall on             the approach to the

turnstile.

Further problems were caused by numerous supporters working their way to the

turnstiles      and finding that            they had to ticket at all,         or that they had a

ticket for another part of the ground.

Many Liverpool supporters had bought their tickets                      from the Nottingham area

where they lived, but they wanted to stand with the Liverpool supporters, not

with the Notts Forest.

Earlier in the afternoon, the turnstile operators, on the instruction of the

Stewards,     had allowed people into the Leppings Lane end of the ground, even

though their tickets were for the Notts Forest kop end of the ground.

When the turnstiles became very busy, however, this policy was changed and no

one was allowed through unless they had the correct tickets.                            Consequently,

people arrived at the turnstile, weren't allowed through,                           but then couldn't

get back, they were blocked in.                    This happened at most of the turnstiles and

the crowd built up without being able to get through.

After    2.30    pm,    the   push     at    the    turnstiles   was   so   great    that    the   Police

Officers on them had to go back through the turnstiles themselves.                            I managed

to get through the barrier and stand outside the crush.                        Despite shouting to

the   crowd     to get back      and    stop pushing       - the   rowdy mob at        the back kept

pushing forward.           It was apparent at that time that a number of people were
                                                    -    3    -




in difficulty up against the barrier where I saw two young boys (separately)

who were just tall enough to have their wind-pipes pushed up against the top

rail of the bar.           With the help of their respective parents I managed to push

some room and pull the boys to my side of the barrier.

By this time there were a large number of youths and men - considerably worse

for drink - many were drunk.                They came down the outside of the barrier and

tried to force themselves in at the turnstile.                                 This caused a great deal of

trouble - resulting in fights taking place                              between fans, and scuffles with

Police Officers who were trying to prevent them.

The push on the crowd at the front of the turnstiles was so great that many

of the suffering fans were begging for the large                                  gates to be opened,        they

kept saying that they had all got tickets and that people were getting hurt.

A   number    of     children     were    lifted    out           of    the    crowd   and   carried   overhead

towards      me,   and     to   where    Inspector Purdy               stood    near to the     barrier.       We

helped to lift them out of the crowd.

Of the drunken youths trying to push in at the front of the turnstiles, one

was causing particular problems, he was so drunk that he had no idea where he

was.      I had pulled him out of the crowd twice already, he hadbeen assaulted

several      times    by        other    spectators      but           still    continued to    make   for    the

turnstiles.        He was                         [ had to arrest him and remove him from the

area.     I took him through the side gate to the Police room.                                  I should have

been assisted         in escorting him but              the       situation was that Police Officers

were required more urgently on the                 outside of the ground.

        was    detained         at the Police room and I had to stay with him                          until he

could be      booked       in   - there    were    already             numerous    prisoners   waiting     to be

booked in.
I did not have a Police radio, and there was no radio on in the Police room.

No one there knew what was happening outside that building.

Once    booked    in - I completed the pro forma statement - in the                        gym in the

company of other officers who also had no radio, and who were also oblivious

to what was happening anywhere else.

At approximately 3*10 pm,              I made my       way backunder the North Stand towards

Leppings Lane to return to my serial.                   At that time       I still had no idea      that

anything was wrong.

On arrival at the rear of Leppings Lane I saw what can only be described as

confusion.        Police Officers and spectators were carrying people from an area

near to, and in, the tunnel back towards the lane outside the gates.

I had no        idea what   had    happened      and could not          see any members     of my    own

serial.        I helped to carry persons from that area.

One man I helped to carry was large,                    approximately 25-30 years,          fair hair,

not wearing any shirt - he was breathing when I put him on the lane.                            Moments

later    when     I   returned    with      someone   else   I    saw    that   he was   dead   - I was

shocked that this would happen at a football match.                         When I saw an ambulance

man he     suggested     putting       him at the side of the lane with the others.                    I

carried him with other officers to where I saw about 7 people                            covered up -

obviously dead.         I still had no idea what had happened.

Many    spectators       were    swearing      and      abusivetowards the        Police    -    a high

proportion still in a drunken state.

After most dead and injured had been removed from the Leppings Lane stand, I

stood     at    the   entrance    to    the   tunnel    with     other    officers   - attempting     to

prevent        fans, re-entering       to     find    relatives     -    many   became   violent    when

prevented from entering the tunnel.
Once   the    game   was   abandoned   and   the    majority   of   spectators   had   left   the

ground,      I made my way through the tunnel on to the pitch where I rejoined

other members of my serial.

I later attended at the de-briefing and went off duty at 'El' at 7.30 pm.

During    the   push   outside   the   ground      - my   fears were   for the   other Police

Officers      pushed up    against   the gates and the walls,          and for the children,

especially the ones with their necks pushed up against the barriers.

If I had been        in charge   outside     the    ground I would not have hesitated in

opening the gates - at that time.

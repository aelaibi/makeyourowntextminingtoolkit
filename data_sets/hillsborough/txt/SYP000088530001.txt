              Further to my statement regarding my work at the Medicoydegal Centre

              following the Hillsborough football stadium disaste U                      i   have been

              asked to clarify the following point.

              I refer to Body No 52 as Christopher Michael BELL.                       I have checked my

              original notes and this is how it appears there.                     This is obviously a

              mistake,    possibly picked up from the Gen 18 unwittingly.                        There is no

              doubt that the blood sample I labelled Christopher Michael BELL is in

              fact from Body 52 Simon BELL.             I apologise for this error.

              Also regarding the taking of b lood samples.                   During each post-mortem

              the pathologist took a blood sample from w hichever part of the body he

              saw fit to take it from.

              The blood was put into a clea/ glass vessel by the pathologist and

              then decanted into a clean /nd unused 5 ml plastic tube.                           The tube
                                                                        PAGE   2
                                                                        S3279A

         was sealed by me and the victims name and unique body number written

         on the label.

         The sample was then handed to



                                                                       SIGNED

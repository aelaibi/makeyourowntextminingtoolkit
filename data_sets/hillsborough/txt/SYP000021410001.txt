Dear Sir,
I am enclosing a copy of I          account of
what he saw and experienced at Hillsborough
on the 15th April,   it was four days before
he could speak in detail about what happened
and this is what he has now put down on paper.
I have written, and then typed it, exactly as
he told it to me.
I have also sent a copy to the Police Enquiry.
Yours faithfully,

 I am a Season Ticket holder in the Kop end of Anfield and on April 15th I left my home
 in            Stockport, at 12. a.m.   Due to roadworks on the M 62 there was a build up of
 traffic and the hour long journey took two hours.     I arrived at the ground at 2.15 - 2.20
 There were long queues but everyone appeared to be happy and"cheerful. F la tT a n ly 'o n r
 mounted policeman and one policeman on each turnstile.
 At 2.25 approximately I went through turnstile B - Leppings Lane stand.       On passing throug
 the turnstile I looked for the marked entrance to the terraces.       I did not thin* they were
 clearly marked.    I did not see any steward or policeman directing fans into sections of
 the ground.   There appeared to me to be only one clearly marked entrance straight ahead.
 I went through this and into the ^tunnel along with a large crowd, although nothing unusual
I then turned to my right and moved about ten yards, so that I was more or less level with
the end of the tunnel.
At this time I tried to read my programme but because of surges this was impossible, and
by about 2 . 35 the cage was full to capacity, whilst there was plenty of room in the side
pens* 1 lost myj3hoein the^crush.       During the next few minutes I was pushed further and
further,, down the terraces and was unable to regain my position at the back because of
sheer numbers.     I esti i»te the time to have been 2.40^- 2.45.    After this time it is not
possible for me to give an accurate assesment of the timing of the events which followed.
The surging and crushing took me down against a crash barrier.        By this time I realised
something was seriously wrong.     People were screaming in agony and shouting to three
policemen.Jbehind the goal to open the gates because people were dying.        At this time a
young boy standing next to me aged approximately 14 collapsed and fell dying to the floor.
People tried to help him, they tried to move to pull him up but this was impossi tie.
Nobody could move.    Two or three fans climbed over the fence behind the goal but were
pushed back in by the police.     Things got worse and we could not move an inch, the
pressure was intense and I could not breathe.     My hand was crushed against my stomach
and the pressure caused me to vQmit.     At this point the gate in the wire fence was opened
and fans started to empty out onto the pitch.     At this time'the crash ba^I^T^ta^Ud to
bend and people were screaming, and shouting for fans to move b ^ k T U T a r o u n d nuTpiople
were being crushed and dying.    The b a r i ^ l ^ t a l l v SonB people must have then
fallen, but the density of numbers must have held up others.        I was crushed and being
pushed forward and under me was a young man my own age slowly slipping under.       I tried to
help him up and talk to him but was too exhausted to do either.       He slipped further and
further down, and I could feel myself slipping down also.     I believe he died.    I tried to
make a space for myself to breathe but I could do nothing further and gave up trying to
do anything more.    I believed I was about to die.   I could not see anything now, but could
still hear people moaning and screaming.     1 was going down then.    Someone grapped my hair
and shoulder and started to drag me out.     I opened my eyes and saw a row of people who
had died or were dying.    I was pulled to a small space and five or six men lifted
threw me on top of the wire fence into the pen to the right of the goal.       I was unable to
move and was pulled and caught by people on the other side who carried me across the pen
  onto the pitch, where I was helped to recover alongside the advertising hoardings.
  After a short time fans started to rip up the hoardings to use as stretchers and
  then a young fan helped me to the other side of the pitch where I lay for about
  one hour.     I had lost all sense of time.   When I checked my watch it was 4 .15 p.m.
  I thought it must have been 8 p.m.     At approximately 5 p.m.   I made my way back to
  the car still very shocked.
  As I was sitting recovering on the pitch I did not see any looting or fighting.       I
  did see a camera man being jostled and lunched when he was taking pictures of the
  dead and dying.    Many fans were giving artificial respiration.
  As I was walking away from the ground I witnessed a group of Notts. Forrest supporters
  run across the park and attack Liverpool fans accusing them of causing the trouble.
  The Liverpool fans responded by telliig them people were dead and dying and then they
  retaliated.
v The accurate timing of events is difficult but I believe fans started dying
  approximately 2.40 p.m. - 2.45
  I have written the above account whilst events are still very real to me.      This is
  the best I can do and all that it is possible for me to remember of the terrible things
  that happened.

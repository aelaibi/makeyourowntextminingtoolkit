               On Saturday,             15th April     1989,     (150489)        I left home early in the

               morning         round about 9 o ’clock            (9000) and I went ove

               pick up my brothers                                     and                 ass we intended to go to

               the Liverpool -V- Notts Forest match at Sheffield.  I personally am.a
               CAT
               season ticket holder and got my ticket from Anfield it cost £6 and was

               for Leppings Ln standing.

               We all travelled in my car and went straight through/to Sheffied all

               except that is for a traffic jam just as we c4une ~  the motorway into

               Manchester,             this delayed us for about half an he                       During the

               journey I d i d n ’t see anyone drinking or any drunkeness.

               We arrived in Sheffield about                     11.45 am (1145),           because we were so

                                                                 tt

                                                                                              S2360

                  After   lunch about   1.43 (1345) we left the pub and went back to

                  Sheffield.    We parked the car and made our way towards the ground.

                  Although we saw Police they weren't actually directing people to the

                  ground or escorting    people just there so people could see them.

                  I d i d n ’t see on the journey to the ground any drinks or/fighting just

                  one bloke who looked worse the wear for drink,
5,0. £_
                  At about 2.30 pm <1430) we arrived at the ground at                ^/nstiles the
   U
                  queues were out of control there was just a mas

j h s i J C f--   In the mass of people I saw 4 mounted Police try                       1 the
     ArP                                                                                  could
                  crowd there were Policemen on foot but there wa
       I
       |          do.  Although I saw Police I d i d n ’t see any stewards at the turnstiles.
                               C /\rr l & '& S     )
                  Because I had been last year I didn't have any difficulty finding my

                  turnstiles.

                  I went through the fork type gates and saw the mass of people           I stood

                  on the edge of the crowd for about a minute but decided no way - i t

                  was   getting hairy and so I moved around to      the side by the gate -         gate

                  ’C ' at this time the gate was closed and there were 2 or 3 policemen

                  standing outside it.

                  One of the policemen appeared to be the one in charge,           he had a flat

       ^          cap on and pips on his shoulder he kept walking away from the gate and

                  putting his radio up to his ear, he did this a couple of times and

                  seemed to be getting more     and more agitated.

                  It seemed that one of the     mounted Policemen was shouting to the

                  officer to do something as he cou ld n’t control the situation.

                  I saw the mounted Police go towards the fork gates and close some of
                                                                               \
                  them it was then that there appeared a break in the crowd.            The

                  horses remained inside the gates and one Policeman wa^^left           in charge

                  of the gates.

                  I remained on the edge of     the crowd by gate    ’C ’ afnd I could see     a

                  Policeman trying to hold the fork gate closed p / u t he d i d n ’t stand a

                 chance and the crowd surged through again.                  ople fell over and I

                 went over to help,

                 went over to help.

                 I picked up     a couple of people but decided to get out of       the crush    and

                 returned to     my position by gate    ’C ’.

O                As far as I know this gate had been open partially f a r         a few minutes

                 to allow injured people through.         The surge of tne    crowd forced it
£ n I T iL r f
                 open wider and about       100 or so people got through,     but the Police

                 managed to shut it.

                 I remained outside the gate for a few more minutes and I could see the

                 senior officer,    the one I mentioned earlier,      pacing up and down

                 listening to his walkie talkie,        then he made a determined walk to the

                 gate   (gate   *C*) and appeared to shout something through the gate to

                 the Police on the oth ejr side and then the gate opened fully and the

                 crowd surged through.!

                 At this point the Police       inside the gate about half a dozen tried to

                 slow the crowd but they had no m a n c e ,

                 I let the initial surge go an<y then went through.           I got swept   in

                 really by and with the crowdyi

                 As I got in I went towards the tunnel and saw my brothers,           I went to

                 the toilets by the tunnel and when I came out they had gone.

                 I looked down the tunnel,       by this time the tunnel was fairly empty.          I

                 could see that there were a lot of people in the pens so I decided

                 not to go that way.

                 There were no Police at this point but I went towards the N Stand,

                 through the gap in the wall       it was here that I saw a group of about &

                 stewards standing       in a group,   not paying any attention to anything

                 at a l 1.
                                & f— r
                 I made my way to the high terracing to watch the matcl~ys I didti\t see

                 any signs telling me where to go,         I just picked a staircase and went

                 that way.

                                                                       S23<b0

I didn't see anyone    inside the ground drinking or fighting or behaving

badly,   just enthusiastic spectators.

From where I was I could see that the centre pens of Leppings Ln were

crowded and the pens either side were quite empty and I thought at the

time why don't they move people into the empty pens.          I then saw a fan

run onto the pitch and    go to Bruce GROBELLAR after a tussle a

Policeman took the fan    off.

After a while a policeman ran up to the referee and the match was

stopped.

I came off the terracing to find my brothers back to the tunnel

entrance to Pens 3 and    4.     Icouldn't find my brothers and went    back

to the upper terracing    but Isoon realised that the game wpuld be

stopped for a long time and so I came back off the terracing and it

was then that I saw all the dead and injured lyingy^n the floor by the

toilets.   A Policewoman asked me to move on and j f h e n   I got worried

about my brothers.     I left the ground and went into the road and the

Fire Brigade arrived and brought with them resuscitation masks and all

them sort of things.     They gave 1st aid to people and then ambulances

carne and dealt with the dead and injured.

I later found our          by the tea bar and a while later I found

We couldn't find         but we saw him later by the/car,

Shortly after we all got in the car and came straight home.

Finally as far as I'm concerned the Policemanrthat made the decision

to open the gate made the right decision.

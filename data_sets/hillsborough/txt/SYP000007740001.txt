Traffic           was     flowing well             as we went South                        from H u d d e r s f i e l d          on the

A &29      but     from the         j u n c t i o n of the A629 with                          the A61 we              encountered

very heavy              nose    to tail           traffic         jams and so went                     into S h e f f i e l d            by

way      of a       *8'    road     route         that                     was       familiar with.                   I had a car­

way      of P e n i s t o n e Roa d        reaching              there at about                    13.43.      The P e n istone

vicinity           of the       ground.            On arrival                  at    the     car     park we were

shepherded              into our         space,         it was            ex t r e m e l y    busy and once                  1 had

             from the        terraces       into       the West Stand.              There        was   some     initial

             reluctance           by the    teams       to    leave the field but                they went          quickly

             as    the overspill           of    crowd built        up and         increased onto             the    playing

             ourselves,           they w ould         have    had no    idea of       the seriousness                or

             e nor m i t y   of what       had happ e n e d and they were                  chanting at          the

             L i v e r p o o 1 supporters         on the       pitch.

             I will     emphasise          that at       no stage       did    I think           that what was

             h a p pening was a pitch                 invasion though               to me        it was      over-spill          and

             escaping        from the o v e r c r o w d e d      pen at the Leppings                   Lane    end although            I

             had no      idea of serious               injury or death at             those       early stages,,

             1 stayed        in my seat and             it was a long          time       before       the    crush was          eased,

             In the meantime a Police                    cordon had formed                on the       pitch across          the

             pitch to        prevent Liverpool               supporters        reaching          the Kop end,,             I think

             it was about           twenty m i nutes           before    I reals, sed something                 serious was

             wrong,     I saw fans          being       treated on the             pi ten but the            seriousness

             became apparent            whan an Am b u l a n c e        cams       onto    the    pitch,,       I had seen

             the Football           A s s o c i a t i o n Official      go    down from the Directors                     box and

             felt    it app r o p r i a t e      to join them and             so    I went down and            into the

             company of Graham K E L L Y and others,,                         I imagine / 1 might              have been

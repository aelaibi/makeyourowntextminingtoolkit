.IVERPOOL - NOTTS FOREST



FA SEMI FINAL HILLSBOROUGH



Statement by St. Johns Ambulance Cadet




I arrived at Hillsborough football ground at 1423hrs, and reported for

duty with Cpl                    ind my stepfather___________

We were put by the Westfield Disabled Stand,        nearest to the new Kop

Stand. About 6 minutes       later when the game had started there was a

disturbance at the Leppings Lane end. At first         I thought   it was just

fans    climbing over the barriers.

Then my dad and another adult member were told by                    to get

down your needed.

       and myself were    left with               We waited for about 5

minutes then          iaid lets go to see if we can help.

        Aient to help someone.        and myself went with               I saw a

man clutching his stomach I aksed him if he was alright he gave me a

thumbs up sign and said go and help,        someone else.

       and myself went to the aid of a man and women. She appeared to be

in shock. She was crying and shivering.        We saw somone being

transported on an ambulance stretcher by fans,                     told us to

take    it to ambulance    room and she stayed with the lady in shock. We

left the Casualty at the ambulance room and returned to the field with

the stretcher.

As we passed a policeman he told us to hurry up we need more

stretchers. When we got back to                   she had another casualty

was    called over to help. Me and                put the casualty on the

stretcher, with the help of his mate. When we got near to the Kop a.
                                                                               PAGE       7
                                                                               D735

        Notts Forest fans started swearing at the Liverpool man helping us. He

        started to shout back.I              said are you helping us or not he

        then carried on with us. When we got to the ambulance room

        told me to wait with him while she returned to the field.



                        ame to look at him, she asked him could he move his legs

        He said no, she said I'll get you on an ambulance, as soon as          I can.   I

         stopped with him until the ambulance took him to hospital.



                       Look me into the ambulance room to keep an eye on a man who

         kept going unconscious she said shout    if he stops breathing. Doctors

         kept coming and looking at him. A ambulance man put a Brook airway in

         the mans mouth,    it kept falling out and I kept putting it back in.

         When the ambulance took him away to hospital,        I was told to go to sit

         in the Police riot van withl       [and some other   cadets.   I heard two men

         talking    in the back about why they were in there,     one said he stabbed

         a Policeman,    I began to get worried about my dad. We stayed there

         until the fans had gone and things had calmed down on the field. Then

                and I went to look for my dad we waited until about ISOOhrs and

         then we went home

          between then and 1974 I worked on general out-patient
          duties, emergency duties, »and did shift work. During that
                                                            /

                   be repeated every five years but in SYMAS the ambulancemen
                   receive repeated training between each attendance on
                   national courses.            The next grade is that of leading
                   ambulanceman,, who takes responsibility for a shift on an
                   ambulance station in the absence of a station officer.


             14.   Station Officers are in charge of an ambulance station and
                   are responsible for the vehicles, manpower, and operational
                   resources of that station.                  The next rank is that of
                   Superintendent (Operations),                  We have two in SYMAS,
                   Superintendent Dale who is responsible for Sheffield and
                   Rotherham, and Superintendent Horner who is responsible for
                   Barnsley and Doncaster*                They co-ordinate manpower and
                   vehicle resources, monitor wages and salaries, and advise
                   the Support Services Officer of any difficulties relating to
                   finance.     They report to the Assistant Chief (Operations) in
                   relation to operational matters.


             15.   The Assistant Chief Metropolitan Ambulance Officer

                   of operational cover.         He reports to Mr Hopkins, my deputy.


             16.   On the control side the lowest rank is that of Control
                   Assistant.       The Control Assistants have no ambulance service
                   experience in operations.              They receive telephone aecponoag

                   After 1700 only the Cpntrol Officer on accident^ and
                   emergency remains on duty.and the situation is the same for
                   the whole of Sunday.           On Saturdays there are two Control
                   Officers on duty during the day.


             18.   The control room is supervised by a Control Superintendent.
                   There is always a Superintendent on duty and they work on a
                   shift basis.       On the afternoon of Saturday 15th April the
                   Control Superintendent on duty was Mr Clarke.


             19*   The Assistant Chief Metropolitan Ambulance Officer (Control
                   and Communications) has overall responsibility for Control*
                   This is Mr A. Smith.              He is responsible for control,

                    the following officers:-


                    1.      The Assistant Chief Ambulance Officer (Training), who
                             is responsible for arranging all aspects of training
                            all SYMAS personnel.         This is Mr Wade.

             Paramedics
             22.   Thirty three of the SYMAS ambulancemen and woaen are
                   paramedics*       Ten of them having qualified as paramedics only
                   recently.        Paramedics are also referred to as "extended
                   trained”.        In 1985 we began our own paramedics training in
                   SYMAS.    There had been a national paramedics training scheme
                   for some time but it was slow in getting off the ground, and
                   I was anxious for some of ray staff to receive extended
                   training and I knew that there were a number of ambulancemen
                   and women who wished to receive such training*          We began our
                   own paramedics training in 1985 and the national scheme was
                   started in the following year.           Those people who had done
                   the SYMAS paramedic course simply had to pass an exam rather
                   than attend a national course.              The SYMAS paramedics
                   training goes beyond that required by national guidelines
                   and SYMAS has been certified to do its own paramedics
                   training by the National               Health Service Training
                   Asseeiotion.


             23.   The most important aspects of paramedics training are
                   intubation, infusion, defibrillation, cardiac monitoring,
                   and drug administration*               At the end of that course
                   paramedics take an exam and every twelve months thereafter
                   they must prove to a consultant surgeon that they are
                   proficient in each of the aspects of paramedic training.            An
                   ambulanceman who has not received extended training is not
                   permitted to deal with the matters referred to in the

                      preceding paragraph*        There is strict control over the work
                      done by paramedics.         They should only put their extended
                      training into practice when it is absolutely necessary.
                           o-=>  \<>js)r
                      They must do a case summary for each patient they treat and
                   provide a copy of the case summary to the accident and
                   emergency department of the hospital to which the patient is
                   taken, and to ambulance headquarters.          These case summaries
                   are later reviewed by consultants.             ©a m-   <xvo-<n   Vi


             Vehicles
             24,   SYMAS has the following vehicles:-


                   1.     (How many?)Front line vehicles*             These are fully
                           equipped emergency ambulances*       They carry essential
                           rescue equipment, special stretchers, oxygen, entonox
                            (a pain killing gas), splints, immobilisers, and (if
                           there is a paramedic on the ambulance) a defibrillator,
                           infusion kit, a paramedics kit and cardiac monitoring
                           machine*


                   2.     (How many?)         Sitting case vehicles.            These are
                           essentially mini buses which are normally used for
                                                    Of ^
                           transporting the elderly, general outpatients who can
                           walk with the assistance of one person*                  They carry
                           little in the way of equipment, but they do have a
                            first aid kit, blankets and a carrying chair.

                   3*          We have one major incident vehicle (emergency tender).
                               This is essentially a mobile stores and communications
                               centre.     A schedule showing the equipment carried by
                               the major incident vehicle appears in a separate bundle
                               of documents.


                   4*          The special incident unit*      This is essentially a riot
                               vehicle and is a fully protected Range Rover.           It was
                               not used at Hillsborough and is intended for lifting
                               casualties from civil disorder incidents.


                   5.      Marked and unmarked staff cars.          The marked staff cars
                               are used by Station Officers and are occasionally used
                           on operational duties.


                   6.     A marked Range Rover which is the management incident
                               vehicle.     It contains back up equipment to be used in
                               support of an ambulance at the scene of an accident.


             The Control Centre
             25.   In the control centre we have a separate incident room which
                   was set up earlier this year following the Kegworth and
                   Lockerbie disasters.             Saturday 15th April was the first time
                   that the incident room was used operationally although it
                   had, of course, been tested previously*             The intention is to
                   be able to manage a major incident from a separate room
                   without disrupting the general services or "domestic"

                   emergency work being dealt with in the control room which is
                   next door.


             26,   SYMAS use four radio channels:-


                   Channel X is the emergency reserve channel which is a
                   national emergency channel.                The intention is that any
                   ambulance using ERC can pass from one area to another
                   without having to switch channels.


                   Channel 2 is the SYMAS emergency channel.


                   Channel 3 is the domestic channel for use on out-patient
                   duties in the DerwasrsTSf/Barnsley areas.


                   Channel 4 is the domestic channel for out-patient duties in
                   the Sheffield/fietherRSta areas.


             27. On Saturday 15th April ambulances were using the SYMAS
                   emergency channel and only one of               the domestic channels
                   because it was a Saturday*              During the incident many of the
                   ambulances were told to use the emergency reserve channel*


             Changes Following the Bradford Fire
             28. Following the fire at the Bradford City Football Ground in
                   May 1985 I arranged to meet with                John Davis, the Chief
                   Metropolitan Ambulance Officer for the West Yorkshire

                 Metropolitan Ambulance Service, to find out about the sort
                 of problems which they had experienced in dealing with the
                 Bradford fire, in order to improve the SYMAS planning for
                 major incidents*            He identified the following main areas of
                 difficulty:-


                 1.        Locating off-duty officers because they were not
                           equipped with radios or pagers.


                 2.        Once contact had been made they did not have marked
                           cars to go to a major incident              and no radio
                           communications in their own cars.      As a result of this
                           the WYMAS officers had great difficulties getting
                           through crowds to reach the Bradford City Football
                           Ground and to gain access to the ground itself.


                 3*        When the arrived at the ground they had no radio
                           communications to their control.


         29.     I immediately implemented an on-call rota call for the
                 operational ambulance officers in SYMAS in order to give
                 senior officer availability 24 hours a day.           There is a pool
                 of six senior officers who work an on-call rota outside
                 normal working hours so that one of them is always
                 available.              In addition the Deputy Chief Metropolitan
                 Ambulance Officer and I work an on-call rota on a weekly
                 basis, taking alternate weeks.               When this system was
05-05-1989    09=12       S YORKS.AMBULANCE SERUICE          0709 829842   P.12




                  introduced by me in 1985 it was done on a totally voluntary
                  basis, payment was only introduced by national agreement in
                  1987.


         30. In 1987 because of the ambulance officers salary increase, 1
                  restructured the service by inserting another line of
                  operational officers*      I now have a station officer on duty
                  with the emergency tender from 0600 to 2400 every day.


         31. Therefore, outside normal working hours, there is always a
                  Station Officer on duty, a Senior Officer on-call, and the
                  Deputy or myself also on-call*


         32. All senior officers had been issued with pagers before the
                  Bradford fire but these were upgraded after*


         33. All senior officers have had portable radio sets since the
                  Bradford fire.


         34. All officers on duty now have marked vehicles with radios.


             35. The senior duty officer is equipped with a vodaphone as are
                  the major incident vehicle and the Range Rover which acts as
                  the management incident vehicle.


             36. All senior officers now have magnetic blue lights for their
                  own vehicles.

         Major Incident Planning
             37.   There has been a major incident plan in SYMAS for as long as
                   I have been there.              It is reviewed from time to time,
                   specifically after each exercise.


             38.   When a major exercise takes place only a few senior officers
                   know about it, and none of those who would be taking part
                   are informed.           The last exercise was in November 1988 at
                   Doncaster Railway StateLoA.               In 1987 there was an exercise in
                   Rotherham where a building which was being demolished was
                   used to simulate a collapsed building, and in 1985 there was
                   an exercise in Sheffield where there was a simulated railway
                   incident.


             39.   Following each exercise each of the emergency services and
                   the hospital involved have an in-house debriefing followed
                   by a co-ordinated debriefing.                  The major incident plan is
                   then updated*          The current version of the major incident
                   plan is dated 1985.            It has been reviewed, but not altered
                   since then.


             40.   In fact, we were in the process of preparing a new major
                   incident plan at the time of the Hillsborough disaster and
                   the plan had reached its second draft.                 A meeting had been
                   arranged for the working party to discuss the second draft
                   on 19th April, but this has been postponed as a result of

                   the Hillsborough disaster.              The working party consists of
                   myself, my Deputy, the four assistant Chief Officers, the
                   Assistant Divisional Officer (Support Services) and the
                   Public Relations Officer (|                     who also acts as my
                   secretary)*


             The Hillsborough Plan
             41.   Following my meeting with John Davis of WYMAS in 1985 I
                   delegated to an Assistant Divisional Officer (Mr Wilkinson)
                   responsibility to co-ordinate plans for ambulance service
                   involvement at five football grounds within South Yorkshire*
                   Those football grounds are the grounds of Sheffield
                   Wednesday, Sheffield United, Rotherham,               Barnsley,       and
                   Doncaster.


             42.   In January 1986 I wrote to all five football clubs.              A copy
                   of my letter of 16th January 1986 addressed to the clubs
                   appears in a separate bundle, together with a reply from
                   Sheffield Wednesday dated 29th January 1986.            Following that
                   correspondence Mr Wilkinson contacted the club and the
                   police and started a process of drawing up plans in
                   conjunction with the Station Officers local to each of the
                   football clubs.         in the case of Hillsborough the plan was
                   prepared by Mr Wilkinson, Station Officer^Higgins and^M^




             43.   The plans relating to the football grounds were prepared in

                 the late summer of 1986 and appear in a separate bundle of
                 documents.             The incident plans for the grounds are intended
                 for use by control and senior officers.               I would not expect
                 individual ambulancemen to be aware of the contents of those
                 plans.


         Provision of Liaison officers and Ambulances to Hillsborough
         44.     The circular HC( 78)45 from the Department of Health and
                 Social Security is entitled Health Services Management-
                 Ambulance Services: Operational Control and Use.                         The
                 circular summarises and updates advice and practice about
                 the control and use of ambulance transport,               paragraph 28 of
                 the circular deals with sporting and other public events and
                 states


                          "Although the voluntary aid societies usually
                          provide first aid cover at sporting and other
                          public events where accidents and emergencies
                          are likely to arise, NHS ambulances may be
                          p r o vided       if   appropriate.         In   such
                          circumstances a written undertaking should be
                          obtained in advance from organisers to meet

                          though no charges                 should be made for
                          conveying any patient to hospital.          It may be
                          inappropriate           to make       a charge   when
                          ambulances are provided at public shows as a

                             public relations exercise to benefit the
                             ambulance service.        This is a matter for
                             discretion of Authorities."


             45.   Following the Bradford fire I decided that irrespective of
                   finances we would place ambulances and crews into grounds at
                   games where we felt it advisable;             this would happen at
                   Sheffield Wednesday if the ground was going to be full or if
                   the supporters had some particular reputation for trouble.
                   In the case of the FA Cup Semi-final between Liverpool and
                   Nottingham Forrest an ambulance was provided at the ground
                   with its crew (with another ambulance and crew on standby
                   nearby) because of the size of the crowd.


         46.       Our policy is for either or both of Station Officers Eason
                   and Higgins to attend all matches at Hillsborough.


         47.       I recall that after Mr Wilkinson attended one meeting with
                   Club Officials at Sheffield Wednesday he came back and told
                   me that if it was going to cost the club money to provide
                   ambulances then they were not interested.                    For major
                   matches, therefore, the ambulances are provided in breach of
                   the terms of paragraph 28 of DHSS circular HC(78)45.


         48.       The Club were, however, prepared to provide free tickets for
                   the two liaison officers at every match and they regularly
                   sit in the same two seats in the South Stand behind the

                  directors box from where they have good views of most of the
                  ground.            Whore, however, the club knows that they can sell
                  all the tickets for a match the seats are taken away from
                  the liaison officers to be sold to the general public.                      The
                  liaison officers then make arrangements with the police to
                  gain access to the ground and they position themselves at
                  pitch level and I understand that this would normally be at
                  the North East corner of the pitch.


             49. In April 1988 I wrote again to the five football clubs and,
                  in addition, to Doncaster race course.                 I sent this letter
                  because there had recently been a pop concert at the
                  Sheffield United football ground and they had refused to
                  allow ambulances to be on standby because we had given them
                  a price estimate of £1,000.                  The attitude of the clubs
                  generally seems to be that they would prefer to make a
                  donation to the St. John’s Ambulance Brigade or the Red
                  Cross of about £50 and rely upon 999 calls if they need us,
                  St. John's Ambulance Brigade and Red Cross do excellent work
                  but they are not in a position to give Immediate help beyond
                  first aid.


             50. Another reason for my writing in April 1988 was that I
                  thought that it may generate some income for the ambulance
                  service.                This was a secondary motive.    There had not been
                  any pressure put on me from any source to generate income
                  but there was a lot of talk generally at the time about

                      income generation within the National Health Service.



             15th April 1989

             51.   On Saturday 15th April 1989 I would normally have been on
                   call but Alan Hopkins had agreed to do my on call duty
                   instead because 1 was on a course at Sheffield University
                   that morning in relation to my position as a Justice of the
                   Peace.        The course finished at 1230 and I arrived home at
                   about 1330.


             52.   At about 1535 ___________ telephoned.            She was at ambulance
                   control in Rotherham and she told me that there was a major
                   incident at Hillsborough.            I told her that I was on my way.




             53.   I left home and arrived at ambulance control at about 1550.
                   I saw Mr Jones leaving in a staff car to go to Hillsborough.
                   He told me that there was a major incident at Hillsborough,
                   that people had died, and that Mr Hopkins and Mr Morley were
                   at the ground*        He was going down to the ground to back them
                   up.


             54.   I went into the control centre and met Mr Clarke in the
                   incident room (which had been set up by then) with Albert
                   Smith.       They briefed me of the situation, providing details
                   of the officers present at the ground, vehicle deployment.

                      and the backup from the neighbouring ambulance services.              I
                  gave instructions to call additional officers into the
                  Northern General and Royal Hallamshire Hospitals to act as
                  liaison officers.           Standards and efficiency officer
                  was sent to the Royal Hallamshire Hospital and Control
                  Superintendent                      to the Northern General Hospital.
                  It was clear when I arrived that we had sufficient officers
                  at the ground but we also needed eyes and ears at the
                  hospital.            I was told by Mr Clarke that there were eleven
                  ambulances which had already been to the ground.
                  was in the incident room dealing with press enquiries.                    I
                  went into the control room to speak to                            about the
                  out-patient vehicles deployed to the ground.                     He told me
                  that a further twelve vehicles had been deployed to the
                  scene.          I also spoke to                     to ensure that the
                  ’’domestic" emergency services were still being provided.
                  Having satisfied myself that they were in control of the
                  situation I went back to the incident room where I remained
                  until about 1755.


             55. Whilst I remained at control I was basically monitoring what
                  was going on.           I was satisfied that my officers knew what
                  they were doing and that they were doing an excellent job*
                         it wdb iiuL ncooBoary for mo to liklmimrui.


             56. There was no point in my going to the ground whilst the
                  incident was at its height*               Mr Hopkins was at the ground
1?         S YORKS.AMBULANCE SERUICE            0709 829842   P .20




 and I was more use supervising the control end of the
 operation. t ThjCL nrratw^wismt that in the event o£ a major
                              gr"
 incident ona ■ef Mr Hopkins -and I will attend the Incident
 itself and the other will be at control.         The decision as to
 which of us is in which position depends purely upon our
 locations when the incident arises.               As I live near
 Doncaster it clearly made more sense for me to travel to
 control in Rotherham.


 Whilst at control I spoke to a number of the officers at the
 scene and took a number of phone calls.         It is difficult for
 me to recall the exact content of those conversations or the
 order in which they happened.         I do remember that I tried to
 contact Mr Hopkins at the ground and that there was some
 difficulty with communications (which I shall deal with
 later),   At one point I was able to speak to Mr Hopkins whom
 I believe told me that either 27 or 37 were then dead but
 that he thought there would be many more.         I told him to try
                                                                      VwA - m v
 to keep in contact.        I spoke to him again later whcwy l•
<4hlnie, he told me that there were 53 dead.         I also spoke to
 Mr Jones and Mr Morley during this time in order to receive
 up dates relating to the situation at the ground.


 I also remember a police inspector coming through to me at
 about 1605 requesting more body bags.


 As well as receiving up dates from the ground Itself I was

                   being kept informed of the position by the staff both in the
                   main incident room and in the control room.           I took about
                   six telephone calls from the media which were mainly from
                   television or radio*         1 had wanted to speak to them myself
                   because I knew that their reports would be going out almost
                   immediately and there would not be an opportunity to correct
                   any matters*


             60.   I recall speaking to David Jones at about 1920 when he told
                   me that all live casualties had left the ground and that
                   ambulances should be sent to Herries Road Bus Depot.              By
                   that time we were also transferring patients from the Royal
                   Hallamshire to make more space available for the incoming
                   casualties.


             61.   Throughout the whole of my time at Control I was satisfied
                   that we had sufficient vehicles and manpower at the scene.
             62.   I spoke to the Regional General Manager of Trent Regional
                   Health Authority twice whilst at Control.        He rang at about
                   1615 and I outlined the situation to him and he said that he
                   would do anything he could to help if we needed further
                   resources*        X told him that we had sufficient resources at
                   the scene and that we were receiving additional help and
                   cover from other ambulance authorities.        I then telephoned
                   Mr |          ] at about 1745 to give him an outline of some of
                   the statistics involved in the operation.

             63.      I went to the ground with Noel Wade, leaving Control at
                      about 1755.    At that stage I was satisfied that, as far as
                      live casualties were concerned, the incident was closed.
                   When Mr Wade and I arrived at the ground we saw Mr Hopkins
                   and Mr Jones*           They briefed me as to     the then current
                   «po®i-tdron and how the incident had gone.Mr Hopkins said
                   that he thought we had moved about 200 casualties.            I also
                   spoke to each of the crews (about 8 crews) who were then
                   still at the ground before going into the gym to meet Chief
                   Superintendent^ Addis and Inspector Mole.         We arranged that
                   our ambulances would take the deceased to the Medico Legal
                   Centre in Sheffield when they had been identified by
                   relatives.       Dealing with the deceased is actually a police
                   responsibility but it is normal for the ambulance service to
                   co-operate in moving them in a situation such as this.             I
                   left the ground at about 1850 and went back to headquarters.
                   X gave a press statement to reporters who were there from
                   the Sheffield Star and Sunday Mail and an interview to the
                   BBC with Mr Hopkins.            They basically wanted details of
                   statistics.


             64.   I went of duty at 2100*


         Statistics
             65.   Forty two ambulances attended the ground, of which 31 were
                   SYMAS vehicles and 11 came from outside areas.              Most of
                   these vehicles made several trips between the ground and the
05-05-1989    09:19        S YORKS.AMBULANCE SERUICE           0709 829842   P.23




                   Sheffield Hospitals*        In addition further vehicles were
                   brought in from outside SYMAS and were put on standby.           172
                   casualties were taken to hospital by ambulance, initially to
                   the Northern General and then to the Royal Hallamshire.
                   Three patients were taken to Barnsley District General
                   Hospital.     Ninety Four fatalities were taken to the Medico
                   Legal Centre in Sheffield, some having been returned from
                   the Northern General and Royal Hallamshire Hospitals to the
                   gymnasium at the ground.        The last of the fatalities left
                   Hillsborough at 0528 on Sunday 16th April 1989*                  The
                   incident itself was closed by Mr Hopkins at 0530 on Sunday
                   16th April.


             66.   Four paramedics attended the ground and three others were on
                   duty.   There was no point in deluging the ground with
                   paramedics because it is difficult for them to put their
                   extended training into practice in crowds.      In any event, by
                   1620 there was no need for them.        I understand that there
                   has been some criticism about            the   failure    to use
                   defibrillators.      I should explain that a defibrillator
                   should not be used in a crowd situation.         It must only be
                   used on a patient without a pulse.          If it is used on a
                   patient who has a pulse, however weak, it would kill that
                   patient, and if anyone was to touch a patient whilst the
                                                             ^    ,r
                                                                   t11,
                   patient was being defibrlllated then that patient would
                   receive an electric charge sufficient to kill                    *

       67. We received a large number of calls from the media.              The
            transcripts of our tapes show that by 1630 we had received
                           calls (although some calls may have been
            counted twice if they were transferred from one telephone to
            another).     These calls caused a problem in that thesjblocked
            lines which were much needed, for example by nurses doctors
            and ambulancemen calling in to see if they were needed at
            work.         AW.            ^ \ s ^                              ,


   68. Between 1500 and 1800 hours on 15th April we also dealt with
            49 domestic emergency calls.


   61.      As a result of the Hillsborough incident we have put in
            three additional telephone lines to the incident room to
            handle press calls.


   Difficulties Experienced
   62.      We did experience some difficulties in relation to access to
            the ground.     One problem was simply the crowds outside the
            ground, and another was vehicles in the way.        At one stage
            the yard in the area of gate 0 was partially blocked             by
            police vehicles and police horses.      It would have been our
            intention to drive ambulances into the entrance by the
            gymnasium which has recently been made in the row of
            terraced houses, collect patients and drive out through gate
            0 but that road was blocked because of a police feeding unit
            being parked outside the gymnasium and because of other
05-05-1989   09=20          S YORKS.AMBULANCE SERUICE          0709 829842   P.25




                 police vehicles parked in the area of the entrance between
                 the terraced houses.        As a result of this ambulances had to
                 reverse into the yard through gate 0 which slowed down the
                 rate at which we were able to remove casualties away from
                 that area.


         63*     In addition a number of the ambulances (and the major
                 incident vehicle when it first arrived at about 1540) were
                 trying to proceed up Penistone Road to gate 0 but were
                 directed by the police into the service road to the south of
                 the ground.


         64.     we did experience some difficulties in relation to radio
                 contact.     There were three main areas of difficulties


                 1.   The handsets did not always work properly because of
                      the stands at the ground.         I understand that there is
                      not normally any difficulty in using the handsets from
                      the seats in the South Stand which Mr Eason and Mr
                      Higgins would normally sit in because these are well
                      above ground level*


                 2*   The sheer weight of radio traffic caused some
                      difficulties*        Most ambulances were told to use the
                      emergency reserve channel but one or two used other
                      channels in order to reduce the pressure on ERC.

                      3.     There was Interference on the emergency reserve
                           channel.      This seemed to appear only on 15th April but
                             is still present.         Phillips (who supply and maintain
                           our radio equipment) were called in immediately after
                             15th April and they are still trying to locate the
                             source of the interference*


                      The problems with the radio transmission has only caused us
                      minor difficulties.         They did not result in the operation
                      being handled any differently.


                Conclusion
                65.   My attitude and that of my officers is that we wish to
                      provide a swift and efficient service.        We have always tried
                      to be at the forefront of the ambulance services.                   The
                      equipment obtained prior to the Orgreave civil disorders,
                      our training of paramedics, the setting up of the incident
                      room, and the changes introduced following the Bradford
                      fire, are all evidence of this.            Since the Hillsborough
                      incident we have, as I mentioned above, already put in new
                      telephone lines to the incident room and a television and
                      commercial radio are being installed so that, in any future
                      major incident, contemporaneous media reports will also be
                      received in the incident room.          We shall be reviewing the
                      position to see if any further changes should be made but
                      the only alterations which we have put in motion at present
                                     /
                      relate to the incident room which had not previously been
      used other than for testing




Sports Grounds;   The Future
66.   SYMAS would wish to make submissions to phase two of the
      Inquiry as to safety of sports grounds in the future.     The
      fire service have a degree of involvement in the question of
      safety both because they issue a fire certificate and
      because they are consulted by the local authority who Issue
      a certificate under the Safety of Sports Grounds Act 1975.
      I would wish the ambulance service to fulfil a similar role*
      Such a role would, in particular, deal with the question of
      ambulance access ja*dj^the provision of equipment and
      ambulances at major sporting events.        Our views and
      recommendations will be set out in more detail in due
      course.

totally self-contained.    This was a station of 40 men, it
included its own control unit plus workshops and stores.   In
February 1987 I transferred to SYMAS and was appointed

                       trained in all aspects of the ambulance service including
                       dealing with emergencies.                            They do six weeks training and
                       two weeks driving training after twelve months of general
                       experience.            The national guidelines are for the training to

                   be repeated every five years but in SYMAS the ambulancemen
                   receive repeated training between each attendance on
                   national courses.               The next grade is that of leading
                   ambulanceman, who takes responsibility for a shift on an
                   ambulance station in the absence of a station officer.


             14.   Station Officers are in charge of an ambulance station and
                   are responsible for the vehicles, manpower, and operational
                   resources of that station.                    The next rank is that of
                   Superintendent           (Operations).          We have two in SYMAS,
                   Superintendent Dale who is responsible for Sheffield and
                   Rotherham, and Superintendent Horner who is responsible for
                   Barnsley and Doncaster*                   They co-ordinate manpower and
                   vehicle resources, monitor wages and salaries, and advise
                   the Support Services Officer of any difficulties relating to
                   finance*        They report to the Assistant Chief (Operations) in
                   relation to operational matters.

                   (Operations) is Mr Jones who is responsible for every aspect
                   of operational cover.            He reports to Mr Hopkins, my deputy.


             16.   On the control side the lowest rank is that of Control
                   Assistant.          The Control Assistants have no ambulance service
                   ex                    operations.     They receive telephone gecpoi'iofrc

             Paramedics
             22.    Thirty three of the SYMAS ambulancemen and wc .ten are
                    paramedics.         Ten of them having qualified as paramedics only
                    recently.          Paramedics are also referred to as "extended
                    trained".          in 1985 we began our own paramedics training in
                    SYMAS.      There had been a national paramedics training scheme
                    for some time but it was slow in getting off the ground, and
                    I was anxious for some of my staff to receive extended
                    training and I knew that there were a number of ambulancemen
                    and women who wished to receive such training.              We began our
                    own paramedics training in 1985 and the national scheme was
                    started in the following year.            Those people who had done
                    the SYMAS paramedic course simply had to pass an exam rather
                    than attend a national course.               The SYMAS paramedics
                    training goes beyond that required by notional guidelines
                    and SYMAS has been certified to do its own paramedics
                    training by the           National      Health   Service        Training




             23.    The most important aspects of paramedics training are
                    intubation, infusion, defibrillation, cardiac monitoring,
                    and drug administration.                At the end of that course
                    paramedics take an exam and every twelve months thereafter
                    they must prove to a consultant surgeon that they are
                    proficient in each of the aspects of paramedic training.                 An
                    ambulanceman who has not received extended training is not
                    permitted to deal with the matters referred to in the

                      preceding paragraph*          There is strict control over the work
                      done by paramedics.           They should only put their extended
                      training into practice when it is absolutely necessary.
                                 \o_c>
                      They must do a case summary for each patient they treat and
                      provide a copy of the case summary to the accident and
                      emergency department of the hospital to which the patient is
                      taken, and to ambulance headquarters*         These case summaries
                      are later reviewed by consultants.


             Vehicles
             24,   SYMAS has the following vehicles:-


                   1*      (How ma ny?)Front line vehicles.            These are fully
                               equipped emergency ambulances.     They carry essential
                               rescue equipment, special stretchers, oxygen, entonox
                               (a pain killing gas), splints, lmmobilisers, and (if
                               there is a paramedic on the ambulance) a defibrillator,
                               infusion kit, a paramedics kit and cardiac monitoring
                           machine.


                   2.      (How many?)          Sitting case vehicles.            These are
                           essentially mini buses which are normally used for
                           transporting the elderly, general outpatients who can
                           walk with the assistance of one person.                They carry
                           little in the way of equipment, but they do have a
                               first aid kit, blankets and a carrying chair.

                   3.             We have one major incident vehicle (emergency tender).
                                  This is essentially a mobile stores and communications
                                  centre.          A schedule showing the equipment carried by
                                  the major incident vehicle appears in a separate bundle
                                  of documents.


                      4.          The special incident unit.                    This Is essentially a riot
                                  vehicle and is a fully protected Range Rover.                                   It was
                                  not used at Hillsborough and is intended for lifting
                                  casualties from civil disorder incidents.


                      5.          Marked and unmarked staff cars.                       The marked staff cars
                                  are used by Station Officers and are occasionally used
                                  on operational duties.


                      6.          A marked Range Rover which is the management Incident
                                  vehicle.         It contains back up equipment to be used in
                                  support of an ambulance at the scene of an accident.


             The Control Centre
             25.      In the        c o n tr o l   centre   w e    h a ve   a separate Incident room which
                      was set up earlier this year following the                                        K e g w o rth        and
                      Lockerbie disasters.                  Saturday 15th April was                 th e     first time
                      that the incident               ro o m      w as   used   o p e r a tio n a lly    a lth o u g h        it
                      had, of course, been tested previously.                               The intention               is    to
                      be able to manage a major incident from                                   a   separate room
                      without disrupting the general services or "domestic"

                   emergency work being dealt with in the control room which is
                   next door.


             26.   SYMAS use four radio channels:-


                   Channel 1 is the emergency reserve channel which is a
                   national emergency channel.                     The intention is that any
                   ambulance using erc can pass from one area to another
                   without having to switch channels,                     Vaax.             cjcrv-Xouc^t


                   Channel 2 is the SYMAS emergency channel.


                   Channel 3 is the domestic channel for use on out-patient
                   duties in the DenccrsrtSr/Barnsley areas.


                      Channel 4 is the domestic channel for out-patient duties in
                      the Sheffield/fietlitilliclriR areas.


             27.   On Saturday 15th April ambulances were using the SYMAS
                      emergency channel and only one of                 the domestic channels
                      because it was a Saturday.                During the incident many of the
                      ambulances were told to use the emergency reserve channel.


             Changes Following the Bradford Fire
             28.   Following the fire at the Bradford                  City Football Ground in
                      May 1985 I arranged to meet with                  John Davis, the Chief
                      Metropolitan Ambulance Officer for the west Yorkshire

                   Metropolitan Ambulance Service, to find out about the sort
                   of problems which they had experienced in dealing with the
                   Bradford fire, in order to improve the SYMAS planning for
                   major incidents.                  He identified the following main areas of
                   difficulty:-


                   1.          Locating off-duty officers because they were not
                               equipped with radios or pagers.


                   2.          Once contact had been made they did not have marked
                               cars          to go   to a major    incident     and     no   radio
                           communications in their own cars*              As a result of this
                               the WYMAS officers had great difficulties getting
                               through crowds to reach the Bradford City Football
                           Ground and to gain access to the ground itself.


                   3.      When the arrived at the ground they had no radio
                           communications to their control.


             29.   1 immediately implemented an on-call rota call for the
                   operational ambulance officers in SYMAS in order to give
                   senior officer availability 24 hours a day.                  There is a pool
                   of six senior officers who work an on-call rota outside
                   normal working hours so that one of them is always
                   available.                 In addition the Deputy Chief Metropolitan
                   Ambulance Officer and 1 work an on-call rota on a weekly
                   basis,          taking alternate weeks.            When this system was

                   introduced by me in 1985 it was done on a totally voluntary
                   basis, payment was only introduced by national agreement in
                   1987.


             30.   In 1987 because of the ambulance officers salary increase, I
                   restructured the service by inserting another 1 ine of
                   operational officers*             I now have a station officer on duty
                   with the emergency tender from 0600 to 2400 every day.


             31.   Therefore, outside normal working hours, there is always a
                   Station Officer on duty, a Senior Officer on-cell, and the
                   Deputy or myself also on-call *


             32.   All senior officers had been issued with pagers before the
                   Bradford fire but these were upgraded after*


             33.   All senior officers have had portable radio sets since the
                   Bradford fire.


             34.   All officers on duty now have marked vehicles with radios.


             35*   The senior duty officer Is equipped with a vodaphone as are
                   the major incident vehicle and the Range Rover which acts as
                   the management incident vehicle.


             36.   All senior officers now have magnetic blue lights for their
                   own vehicles.

             Major Incident: Planning
             37.   There has been a major incident plan in SYMAS for as long as
                   I have been there.              It is reviewed from time to time,
                   specifically after each exercise.


             38.   When a major exercise takes place only a few senior officers
                   know about it, and none of those who would be taking part
                   are informed.           The last exercise was in November 1988 at
                   Doncaster Railway                         In 1987 there was an exercise in
                   Rotherham where a building which was being demolished was
                   used to simulate a collapsed building, and in 1985 there was
                   an exercise in Sheffield where there was a simulated railway
                   incident.


             39.       Following each exercise each of the emergency services and
                       the hospital involved have an in-house debriefing followed
                       by a co-ordinated debriefing.              The major incident plan is
                       then updated.      The current version of the major incident
                       plan is dated 1985.        It has been reviewed, but not altered
                       since then.


             40.       I* fact, we were in the process of preparing a new major
                       incident plan at the time of the Hillsborough disaster and
                       the plan had reached its second draft,              A meeting had been
                       arranged for the working party to discuss the second draft
                       on 19th April, but this has been postponed as a result of

                    the Hillsborough disaster.               The working party consists of
                    myself, my Deputy, the four assistant Chief Officers, the
                    Assistant Divisional Officer (Support Services) and the
                    Public Relations Officer (                        who also acts as my
                    secretary).


              The Hillsborough Plan
              41.   Following my meeting with John Davis of WYMAS in 1985 I
                    delegated to an Assistant Divisional Officer (Mr Wilkinson)
                    responsibility to co-ordinate plans for ambulance service
                    involvement at five football grounds within South Yorkshire*
                    Those football grounds are the grounds of Sheffield
                    Wednesday, Sheffield United, Rotherham,                   Barnsley,          and
                    Doncaster.


              42.      In January 1986 I wrote to all five football clubs.                  A copy
                    of my letter of 16th January 1986 addressed to the clubs
                    appears in a separate bundle, together with a reply from
                    Sheffield Wednesday dated 29th January 1986.               Following that

                    the late summer of 1986 and appear in a separate bundle of
                    documents.          The incident plans for the grounds are intended
                    for use by control and senior officers.              I would not expect
                    individual ambulancemen to be aware of the contents o£ those

             Provision of Liaison Officers and Ambulances to Hillsborough
             44.    The circular HC( 78)45 from the Department of Health and
                    Social Security is entitled Health Services Management-
                    Ambulance Services: Operational Control and Use.                           The
                    circular summarises and updates advice and practice about
                    the control and use of ambulance transport. paragraph 28 of
                    the circular deals with sporting and other public events and
                    states:-


                            "Although the voluntary aid societies usually
                            provide first aid cover at sporting and other
                            public events where accidents and emergencies
                            are likely to arise, NHS ambulances may be
                            provided         if   appropriate.         In     s uch
                            circumstances a written undertaking should be

                            though       no charges          should be made    for
                            conveying any patient to hospital. It may be

                              public relations exercise to benefit the
                              ambulance service.               This is a matter for
                              discretion of Authorities."


             45.      Following the Bradford fire I decided that irrespective of
                      finances we would place ambulances and crews into grounds at
                      games where we felt it advisable;                  this would happen at
                      Sheffield Wednesday if the ground was going to be full or if
                      the supporters had some particular reputation for trouble.
                      In the case of the FA Cup Semi-final between Liverpool and
                   Nottingham Forrest an ambulance was provided at the ground
                   with its crew (with another ambulance and crew on standby
                   nearby) because of the size of the crowd.


             46.   Our policy is for either or both of station Officers Bason
                   and Higgins to attend all matches at Hillsborough.


             47.      I recall that after Mr Wilkinson attended one meeting with
                      Club Officials at Sheffield Wednesday he came back and told
                   me that if it was going to cost the club money to provide
                      ambulances then they were not interested.                         For major
                      matches, therefore, the ambulances are provided in breach of
                      the terms of paragraph 28 of DHSS circular HC(78)45.


             48.      The Club were, however, prepared to provide free tickets for
                      the two liaison officers at every match and they regularly
                      Sit in the same two seats in the South Stand behind the

                    directors box from where they have good views of most of the
                    ground.      Whore, however, the club knows that they can sell
                    all the tickets for a match the seats are taken away from
                    the liaison officers to be sold to the general public.                  The
                    liaison officers then make arrangements with the police to
                    gain access to the ground and they position themselves at
                    pitch level and I understand that this would normally be at
                    the North Bast corner of the pitch.


             49.    In April 1988 I wrote again to the five football clubs and,
                    in addition, to Doncaster race course.            I sent this letter
                    because there had recently been a pop concert at the
                    Sheffield United football ground and they had refused to
                    allow ambulances to be on standby because we had given them
                    a price estimate of £1,000.             The attitude of the clubs
                    generally seems to be that they would prefer to make a
                    donation to the St. John's Ambulance Brigade or the Red
                    Cross of about £50 and rely upon 999 calls if they need us.
                      St. John's Ambulance Brigade and Red Cross do excellent work
                      but they are not in a position to give immediate help beyond
                      first aid.


             50 .     Another reason for my writing in April 1988 was that I
                      thought that it may generate some income for the ambulance
                      service.        This was a secondary motive.     There had not been
                      any pressure put on me from any source to generate income
                      but there was a lot of talk generally at the time about

                      income generation within the National Health Service.




             15th April 1989

             51.   On Saturday 15th April 1989 1 would normally have been on
                   call but Alan Hopkins had agreed to do ray on call duty
                   instead because I was on a course at Sheffield University
                   that morning in relation to my position as a Justice of the
                   Peace.        The course finished at 1230 and I arrived home at
                   about 1330.


             52.   At about 1535____________ telephoned. She was at ambulance
                   control in Rotherham and she told me that there was a major
                   incident at Hillsborough.              I told her that I was on my way.




         53.       I left home and arrived at ambulance control at about 1550.
                   I saw Mr Jones leaving in a staff car to go to Hillsborough.
                   He told me that there was a major incident at Hillsborough,
                   that people had died, and that Mr Hopkins and Mr Morley were
                   at the ground.         He was going down to the ground to back them
                   up.


         54.       I went into the control centre and met Mr Clarke in the
                   incident room (which had been set up by then) with Albert
                   Smith.       They briefed me of the situation, providing details
                   of the officers present at the ground, vehicle deployment,

                      and the backup from the neighbouring ambulance services.              I
                      gave instructions to call additional officers into the
                      Northern General and Royal Hallamshire Hospitals to act as
                      liaison officers.        Standards and efficiency officer
                      was sent to the Royal Hallamshire Hospital and Control
                      Superintendent                   to the Northern General Hospital.
                      It was clear when I arrived that we had sufficient officers
                      at the ground but we also needed eyes and ears at the
                      hospital.         I was told by Mr Clarke that there were eleven
                      ambulances which had already been to the ground.
                      was in the incident room dealing with press enquiries.                I
                      went into the control room to speak to                        about the
                   out-patient vehicles deployed to the ground.                    He told me
                      that a further twelve vehicles had been deployed to the
                      scene.       I also spoke to                     to ensure that the
                      "domestic” emergency services were still being provided.
                      Having satisfied myself that they were in control of the
                      situation I went back to the incident room where I remained
                      until about 1755.


             55*      Whilst I remained at control I was basically monitoring what
                      was going on,         I was satisfied that my officers knew what
                      they were doing and that they were doing an excellent job*




                      There was no point in my going to the ground whilst the
                      incident was at its height,            Mr Hopkins was at the ground

                         and I was more use supervising the control end of the
                         operation.      ThjBbaaErangjeiwaiTt^ty^hn't in the event of a major

                         itself and the other will be at control.            The decision as to
                     which of us is in which position depends purely upon our
                         locations when the incident arises.                   As I live near
                     Doncaster it clearly made more sense for me to travel to
                     control in Rotherham.


             57.     Whilst at control I spoke to a number of the officers at the
                     scene and took a number of phone calls.                It is difficult for
                     me to recall the exact content of those conversations or the
                     order in which they happened.                I do remember that I tried to
                     contact Mr Hopkins at the ground and that there was some
                     difficulty with communications (which I shall deal with
                     later).        At one point I was able to speak to Mr Hopkins whom
                         I believe told me that either 27 or 37 were then dead but
                     that he thought there would be many more.         I told him to try
                                                                                      w Vmv
                     to keep in contact.            I spoke to him again later whotty -I-
                                 he told me that there were 53 dead.             I also spoke to
                     Mr Jones and Mr Morley during this time in order to receive
                     up dates relating to the situation at the ground.


             58.         I also remember a police inspector coming through to me at
                     about 1605 requesting more body bags*


             59.     As well as receiving up dates from the ground itself I was

                      being kept informed of the position by the staff both in the
                   main incident room and in the control room.                I took about
                   six telephone calls from the media which were mainly from
                      television or radio*           I had wanted to speak to them myself
                   because I knew that their reports would be going out almost
                   immediately and there would not be an opportunity to correct
                   any matters.


             60.               I recall speaking to David Jones at about 1&20 when he tol
  I\               me that all live casualties had left the ground and that
                   ambulances should be sent to Herries Road Bus Depot.                    By
                   that time we were also transferring patients from the Royal
                   Hallamshire to make more space available for the incoming
                   casualties.


             61.   Throughout the whole of my time at Control I was satisfied
                   that we had sufficient vehicles and manpower at the scene.
             62.   I spoke to the Regional General Manager of Trent Regional
                   Health Authority twice whilst at Control.             He rang at about
                   1615 and X outlined the situation to him and he said that he
                   would do anything he could to help if we needed further
                   resources.            X told him that we had sufficient resources at
                   the scene and that we were receiving additional help and
                   cover from other ambulance authorities.              I then telephoned
                   Mr               1 at about 1745 to give him an outline of some of
                   the statistics involved in the operation.

             63*         I went to the ground with Noel Wade,               leaving Control at
                         about 1755.          At that stage I was satisfied that, as far as
                         live casualties           were concerned, the incident was closed.
                         When Mr Wade and I arrived at the ground we saw Mr Hopkins
                         and Mr Jones ♦            They briefed me as to the then current
                     ■pooitd-on and how            the incident had gone.    Mr Hopkins said
                         that he thought we had moved about 200 casualties.              I also
                         spoke to each of the crews (about 8 crews) who were then
             /
                         still at the ground before going into the gym to meet Chief
                         Superintendent^Addis and Iirepactor Mole.           We arranged that
                     our ambulances would take the deceased to the Medico Legal
                     Centre in Sheffield when they had been identified by
                     relatives.              Dealing with the deceased is actually a police
                     responsibility but it is normal for the ambulance service to
                     co-operate in moving them in a situation such as this.                   I
                     left the ground at about 1850 and went back to headquarters.
                     I gave a press statement to reporters who were there from
                     the Sheffield Star and Sunday Mail and an interview to the
                     BBC with Mr Hopkins.                  They basically wanted details of
                     statistics.


             64.     I went of duty at 2100.


             statistics
             65.     Forty two ambulances attended the ground, of which 31 were
                     SYMAS vehicles and 11 came from outside areas.                   Most of
                     these vehicles made several trips between the ground and the

                   Sheffield Hospitals*                  In addition further vehicles were
                   brought in from outside SYMAS and were put on standby*                          172
                   casualties were taken to hospital by ambulance, initially to
                   the Northern General and then to the Royal Hallamshire.
                   Three patients were taken to Barnsley District General
                   Hospital.                Ninety Four fatalities were taken to the Medico
                   Legal Centre in Sheffield, some having been returned from
                   the Northern General and Royal Hallamshire Hospitals to the
                   gymnasium at the ground *                     The last of the fatalities left
                   Hillsborough at 0528 on Sunday 16th Apri 1 1989.                                The
                   incident itself was closed by Mr Hopkins at 0530 on Sunday
                       16th April.


             66. Four paramedics attended the ground and three others were on
                       duty.        There was no point in deluging the ground with
                       paramedics because it is difficult for them to put their
                       extended training into practice in crowds.                 In any event, by
                       1620 there was no need for them*                   I understand that there
                       has been some criticism                    about   the   failure     to use
                       defibrillators.             I should explain that a defibrillator
                       should not be used in a crowd situation.                   It must only be
                       used on a patient without a pulse.                     If it is used on a
                       patient who has a pulse, however weak, it would kill that
                       patient, and if anyone was to touch a patient whilst the
                       patient was being defibrillated then that p a r e n t would
                       receive an electric charge sufficient to kill 'Wfcntr                       ,

              67. We received a large number of calls from the media.                    The
                     transcripts of our tapes show that by 1630 we had received
                                        calls (although some calls may have been
                     counted twice if they were transferred from one telephone to
                     another).         These calls caused a problem in that the^jblocked
                     lines which were much needed, for example by nurses doctors
                     and ambulancemen calling in to see if they were needed at
                     work.             A W                                                 .


              68. Between 1500 and 1800 hours on 15th April we also dealt with
                     49 domestic emergency calls.


              61.    As a result of the Hillsborough incident we have put in
                     three additional telephone lines to the incident room to
                     handle press calls.


              Difficulties Experienced
              62.    We did experience some difficulties in relation to access to
                     the ground.         One problem was simply the crowds outside the
                     ground, and another was vehicles in the way.           At one stage
                     the yard in the area of gate 0 was partially blocked                 by
                     police vehicles and police horses.          It would have been our
                     intention to drive ambulances into the entrance by the
                     gymnasium which has recently been made in the row of
                     terraced houses, collect patients and drive out through gate
                     0 but that road was blocked because of a police feeding unit
                     being parked outside the gymnasium and because of other

                    police vehicles parked in the area of the entrance between
                    the terraced houses.             As a result of this ambulances had to
                    reverse into the yard through gate 0 which slowed down the
                    rate at which we were able to remove casualties away from
                    that area.


             63.    In addition a number of the ambulances (and the major
                    incident vehicle when it first arrived at about 1540) were
                    trying to proceed up Pen!stone Road to gate 0 but were
                    directed by the police into the service road to the south of
                    the ground.


             64.    we did experience some difficulties in relation to radio
                    contact. There were three main areas of difficulties:-


                    1.          The handsets did not always work properly because of
                                the stands at the ground.       1 understand that there is
                                not normally any difficulty in using the handsets from
                                the seats in the South Stand which Mr Eason and Mr
                                Higgins would normally sit in because these are well
                                above ground level.


                    2.      The sheer weight of radio traffic caused some
                                difficulties.      Most ambulances were told to use the
                                emergency reserve channel but one or two used other
                                channels in order to reduce the pressure on ERC.

                   3.        There was interference on the emergency reserve
                             channel ♦ This seemed to appear only on 15th April but
                             is still present.             Phillips (who supply and maintain
                             our radio equipment) were called in immediately after
                              15th April and they are still trying to locate the
                             source of the interference.


                   The problems with the radio transmission has only caused us
                   minor difficulties.               They did not result in the operation
                   being handled any differently*


             Conclusion
             65.   My attitude and that of my officers is that we wish to
                   provide a swift and efficient service.               We have always tried
                   to be at the forefront of the ambulance services.                          The
                   equipment obtained prior to the Orgreave civil disorders,
                   our training of paramedics, the setting up of the incident
                   room, and the changes introduced following the Bradford
                   fire, are all evidence of this.                   Since the Hillsborough
                   incident we have, as I mentioned above, already put in new
                   telephone lines to the incident room and a television and
                   commercial radio are being installed so that, in any future
                   major incident, contemporaneous media reports will also be
                   received in the incident room.                 We shall be reviewing the
                   position to see if any further changes should be made but
                   the only alterations which we have put in motion at present
                   relate to the incident room which had not previously been

              Sports Grounds: The Future
              66.     SYMAS would wish to snake submissions to phase two of the
                      Inquiry as to safety of sports grounds in the future.               The
                      fire service have a degree o£ involvement in the question of
                      safety both because they issue a fire certificate and
                      because they are consult&d by the local authority who issue
                      a certificate under the Safety of Sports Grounds Act 1975.
                      I would wish the ambulance service to fulfil a similar role,
                    / Such a role would, in particular, deal with the question of

1.    I was born on 16th April 1949.


2.    I am the Chief Metropolitan Ambulance Officer with the South
      Yorkshire Metropolitan Ambulance Service (SYMAS).    SYMAS is
      a part of Trent Regional Health Authority and provides
      ambulance services for the whole of South Yorkshire, an area
      which covers the District Health Authorities of Sheffield,
      Rotherham, Doncaster and Barnsley.


3.    The SYMAS headquarters and control are at Heather Close in
      Rotherham.


4.    I am a Justice of the Peace and a Fellow of the Ambulance
      Service Institute.


5.    I joined the ambulance cadets in Liverpool in 1966 and spent
      18 months as a cadet.   I became an ambulance man in 1968 and
      between then and 1974 I worked on general out-patient
      duties, emergency duties, and did shift work.     During that
      time I became a qualified in-service instructor and spent
      time at the Liverpool training school and was seconded to
      the regional training school for short periods.     In 1974 I
      was promoted to the position of sub-officer in charge of the
      headquarters station on a shift basis, and my duties
      primarily involved administration and responsibility for
control.   In October 1974 I was promoted to Station Officer
over three stations in Liverpool.       I was promoted to
Superintendent in January 1975 and was put in charge of the
St. Helen's Station which was a large sub-unit and was
totally self-contained.   This was a station of 40 men, it
included its own control unit plus workshops and stores.   In
February 1987 I transferred to SYMAS and was appointed
Assistant Divisional Officer (Operations) in charge of six
ambulance stations in Doncaster and Rotherham.     I became
Assistant Chief Metropolitan Ambulance Officer for SYMAS in
1978 and was appointed Chief Metropolitan Ambulance Officer
for SYMAS in 1982.


Since 1986 I have been an instructor at the National Health
Service training establishment in Harrogate on courses for
senior ambulance officer development.


I am a member of the Association of Chief Ambulance Officers
Working Party To Review Control Procedures For Ambulance
Services, which ha^f^just re-written the control procedures
for ambulance services nationally.


From 1979 to 1986 I was a member of the Institute of the
Certified Ambulance Personnel Executive.


In the new training notes for ambulance personnel there is a
section written by me on the ambulance service response to
      civil   disorder.      This was as a result of the SYMAS




      operational division and the control division.


11.   On the operational side most ambulancejnen now start as
      cadets when they are 17 and spend two years training in all
      fields of the ambulance service.   They have no contact with
      the public other than in observing.


12.   The next stage is the basic grade ambulance man, some of
      whom will not have been cadets.       They normally begin on
      part-time work before moving on to full time transporting of
      general outpatients.


13.   The next grade is that of qualified ambulance men.   They are
      trained in all aspects of the ambulance service including
      dealing with emergencies.    They do six weeks training and
      two weeks driving training after twelve months of general
      experience.   The national guidelines are for the training to
      be repeated every five years but in SYMAS the ambulance^men
      receive repeated training between each attendance on
      national courses.      The next grade is that of leading
      ambulance man, who takes responsibility for a shift on an
      ambulance station in the absence of a station officer.
14.   Station Officers are in charge of an ambulance station and
      are responsible for the vehicles, manpower, and operational
      resources of that station.         The next rank is that of
      Superintendent (Operations).         We have two in SYMAS,
      Superintendent Dale who is responsible for Sheffield and
      Rotherham, and Superintendent Horner who is responsible for
      Barnsley and Doncaster.        They co-ordinate manpower and
      vehicle resources, monitor wages and salaries, and advise
      the Support Services Officer of any difficulties relating to
      finance.     They report to the Assistant Chief (Operations) in
      relation to operational matters.


15. The Assistant Chief Metropolitan Ambulance Officer
      (Operations) is Mr Jones who is responsible for every aspect
      of operational cover.     He reports to Mr Hopkins, my deputy.


16. On the control side the lowest rank is that of Control
      Assistant.     The Control Assistants have no ambulance service
      experience in operations.     They receive telephone responses
      from the public, hospitals, ambulance stations and the
      police and fire services and they work in shifts.      They do
      not deal with calls themselves but pass the calls onto the
      Control Officers.


17. The Control Officers decide on the deployment of ambulances
      in response to information passed to them by the Control
      Assistants.     During the working week day there are three on
      duty.   On£,dealing with accidents and emergencies, one
      dealing with out-patients for Sheffield and Rotherham, and
      the other dealing with out-patients for Doncaster/Barnsley.
      After S «00 p.m. only the Control Officer on accidents and
      emergency remains on duty and the situation is the same for
      the whole of Sunday.    On Saturdays there are two Control
      Officers on duty during the day.


18.   The control room is supervised by a Control Superintendent.
      There is always a Superintendent on duty and they work on a
      shift basis.    On the afternoon of Saturday 15th April the
      Control Superintendent on duty was Mr Clarke.


19.   The Assistant Chief Metropolitan Ambulance Officer (Control
      and Communications) has overall responsibility for Control.
      This is Mr A. Smith.       He is responsible for control,
      planning, registration (the pre-booking of general out­
      patients),     ambulance liaison posts, and standards and
      efficiency officers.   The standards and efficiency officers
      are of superintendent rank and their job is to monitor the
      standard of services to individual hospitals,           the
      investigation of complaints about services provided, and
      liaison with the hospitals.


20.   Mr Smith is accountable to Mr Hopkins.


21.   In addition to the personnel mentioned above there are also
       the following officers


       1.       The Assistant Chief Ambulance Officer (Training), who
                is responsible for arranging all aspects of training
                all SYMAS personnel.     This is Mr Wade.


       2.      The Assistant Chief Ambulance Officer (Support
                Services).     He is primarily responsible for advising
                upon and procuring equipment, and giving budgetary
                advice.     This is Mr Truman.


       3.     The Assistant Divisional Officer (Support Services).
                  W H lv \     ,
             ^He is responsible for the investigation of complaints,
                certain disciplinary matters, strategic and operational
                planning,    joint planning with hospitals and emergency
                services, and he plays a supporting role to Mr Truman.


       4.      Myself.      I have overall responsibility for all aspects
                of the ambulance service in SYMAS.

22.    Thirty three of the SYMAS ambulance men and women are
       paramedics.        Ten of then having qualified as paramedics only
       recently.          Paramedics are also referred to as "extended
       trained".         In 1985 we began our own paramedics training in
       SYMAS.         There had been a national paramedics training scheme
        for some time but it was slow in getting off the ground, and
        I was anxious for some of my staff to receive extended
training and I knew that there were a number of ambulance
men and women who wished to receive such training.   We began
our own paramedics training in 1985 and the national scheme
was started in the following year.      Those people who had
done the SYMAS paramedic course simply had to pass an exam
rather than attend a national course.    The SYMAS paramedics
training goes beyond that required by national guidelines
and SYMAS has been certified to do its own paramedics
training by the National Health Service Training
Association.


The most important aspects of paramedics training are
intubation, infusion, defibrillation, cardiac monitoring,
and drug administration.       At the end of that course
paramedics take an exam and every twelve months thereafter
they must prove to a consultant surgeon that they are
proficient in each of the aspects of paramedic training.   An
ambulance man who has not received extended training is not
permitted to deal with the matters referred to in the
preceding paragraph.   There is strict control over the work
done by paramedics.    They should only put their extended
training into practice when it is absolutely necessary.
They must do a case summary for each patient they treat and
provide a copy of the case summary to the accident and
emergency department of the hospital to which the patient is
taken, and to ambulance headquarters.    These case summaries
are later reviewed by consultants.
SYMAS has the following vehicles:-


1.   (How many?)Front line vehicles.        These are fully
     equipped emergency ambulances.   They carry essential
     rescue equipment, special stretchers, oxygen, entonox
     (a pain killing gas), splints, immobilisers, and (if
     there is a paramedic on the ambulance) a defibrillator,
     infusion kit, a paramedic^ kit and cardiac monitoring
     machine.


2.   (How many?)     Sitting case vehicles.      These are
     essentially mini buses which are normally used for
     transporting the elderly, general outpatients who can
     walk with the assistance of one person.     They carry
     little in the way of equipment, but they do have a
     first aid kit, blankets and a carrying chair.


3.   We have one major incident vehicle (emergency «M$y).
     This is essentially a mobile stores and communications
     centre.    A schedule showing the equipment carried by
     the major incident vehicle appearis in a separate bundle
     of documents.


4.   The special incident unit.   This is essentially a riot
     vehicle and is a fully protected Range Rover.    It was
     not used at Hillsborough and is intended for lifting
           casualties from civil disorder incidents.


      5.   Marked and unmarked staff cars.      The marked staff cars
           are used by Station Officers and are occasionally used
           on operational duties.


      6.   A marked Range Rover which is the management incident
           vehicle.   It contains back up equipment to be used in
           support of an ambulance at the scene of an accident.


25.   In the control centre we have a separate incident room which
      was set up earlier this year following the Kegworth and
      Lockerbie disasters.   Saturday 15th April was the first time
      that the incident room was used operationally although it
      had, of course, been tested previously.     The intention is to
      be able to manage a major incident from a separate room
      without disrupting the general services or "domestic"
      emergency work being dealt with in the control room which is
      next door.


26.   SYMAS use four radio channels:-


      Channel 1 is the emergency reserve channel which is a
      national emergency channel.       The intention is that any
      ambulance using ERC can pass from one area to another
      without having to switch channels.
           Channel 2 is the SYMAS emergency channel.


           Channel 3 is the domestic channel for use on out-patient
           duties in the Doncaster/Barnsley areas.


           Channel 4 is the domestic channel for out-patient duties in
           the Sheffield/Rotherham areas.


     27.   On Saturday 15th April ambulances were using the SYMAS
           emergency channel and only one of the domestic channels
           because it was a Saturday.   During the incident many of the
           ambulances were told to use the emergency reserve channel.


     28.   Following the fire at the Bradford City Football Ground in
ft         May 1985 I arranged to meet with John Davis,          Chief
           Metropolitan Ambulance Officer for the West Yorkshire
           Metropolitan Ambulance Service, to find out about the sort
           of problems which they had experienced in dealing with the
           Bradford fire, in order to improve the SYMAS planning for
           major incidents.   He identified the following main areas of
           difficulty:-


           1.   Locating off-duty officers because they were not
                equipped with radios or pagers.


           2.   Once contact had been made they did not have marked
                cars to go to a major        incident and no radio
              communications in their own cars.   As a result of this
              the WYMAS officers had great difficulties getting
              through crowds to reach the Bradford City Football
              Ground and to gain access to the ground itself.


      3.      When the arrived at the ground they had no radio
              communications to their control.


29.   I immediately implemented an on-call rota call for the
      operational ambulance officers in SYMAS in order to give
      senior officer availability 24 hours a day.     There is a pool
      of six senior officers who work an on-call rota outside
      normal working hours so that one of them is always
      available.      In addition the Deputy Chief Metropolitan
      Ambulance Officer and I work an on-call rota on a weekly
      basis, taking alternate weeks.         When this system was
      introduced by me in 1985 it was done on a totally voluntary
      basis, payment was only introduced by national agreement in
      1987.


30.   In 1987                                     salary increase, I
      restructured the service by inserting another line of
      operational officers.     I now have a station officer on duty
      with the emergency tender from 0600 to 2400 every day.


31.   Therefore, outside normal working hours, there is always a
      Station Officer on duty, a Senior Officer on-call, and the
      Deputy or myself also on-call.


32.   All senior officers had been issued with pagers before the
      Bradford fire but these were upgraded after.


33.   All senior officers have had portable radio sets since the
      Bradford fire.


34. All officers on duty now have marked vehicles with radios.


35. The senior duty officer is equipped with a vodaphone as are
      the major incident vehicle and the Range Rover which acts as
      the management incident vehicle.


36.   All senior officers now have magnetic blue lights for their
      own vehicles.

37.   There has been a major incident plan in SYMAS for as long as
      I have been there.     It is reviewed from time to time,
      specifically after each exercise.


38.   When a major exercise takes place only a few senior officers
      know about it, and none of those who would be taking part
      are informed.    The last exercise was in November 1988 at
      Doncaster Railway Station.       In 1987 there was an exercise in
                                   *


      Rotherham where a building which was being demolished was
      used to simulate a collapsed building, and in 1985 there was
      an exercise in Sheffield where there was a simulated railway
      incident.


39.   Following each exercise each of the emergency services and
      the hospital involved have an in-house debriefing followed
      by a co-ordinated debriefing.    The major incident plan is
      then updated.   The current version of the major incident
      plan is dated 1985.   It has been reviewed, but not altered^
      since then.


40.   In fact, we were in the process of preparing a new major
      incident plan at the time of the Hillsborough disaster and
      the plan had reached its second draft.    A meeting had been
      arranged for the working party to discuss the second draft
      on 19th April, but this has been postponed as a result of
      the Hillsborough disaster.   The working party consist*^? of
      myself, my Deputy, the four assistant Chief Officers, the
      Assistant Divisional Officer (Support Services) and the
                                               who also acts as my
      secretar'
 -TC«-                C\
41.   Following my meeting with John Davis of WYMAS in 1985 I
      delegated to an Assistant Divisional Officer (Mr Wilkinson)
      responsibility to co-ordinate plans for ambulance service
      involvement at five football grounds within South Yorkshire.
      Those football grounds are the grounds of Sheffield
      Wednesday, Sheffield United, Rotherham, Barnsley,       and
      Doncaster.


42.   In January 1986 I wrote to all five football clubs.      A copy
      of my letter of 16th January 1986 addressed to the clubs
      appears in a separate bundle, together with a reply from
      Sheffield Wednesday dated 29th January 1986.     Following that
      correspondence Mr Wilkinson contacted the club and the
      police and started a process of drawing up plans in
      conjunction with the Station Officers local to each of the
      football clubs.    In the case of Hillsborough the plan was
      prepared by Mr Wilkinson, Station Officer Higgins and




43.   The maJ 01 iiioiidsat ■plans^were prepared in the late summer of
      1986 and appear in a separate bundle of documents.          The
      incident plans for the grounds are intended for use by
      control and senior officers.    I would not expect individual
      ambulance men to be aware of the contents of those plans.


44.   The circular HC( 78)45 from the Department of Health and
      Social Security is entitled Health Services Management-
      Ambulance Services: Operational Control and Use.            The
      circular summarises and updates advice and practice about
      the control and use of ambulance transport.     Paragraph 28 of
      the circular deals with sporting and other public events and
      states:-
           "Although the voluntary aid societies usually
           provide first aid cover at sporting and other
           public events where accidents and emergencies
           are likely to arise, NHS ambulances may be
           p r o vided   if   appropriate.      In    such
           circumstances a written undertaking should be
          obtained in advance from organisers to meet
           the cost of providing special standby cover,
           though no charges should be made for
          conveying any patient to hospital.      It may be
           inappropriate       to make   a charge when
          ambulances are provided at public shows as a
          public relations exercise to benefit the
          ambulance service.      This is a matter for
          discretion of Authorities."


45.   Following the Bradford fire I decided that irrespective of
      finances we would place ambulances and crews into grounds at
      games where we felt it advisable;        this would happen at
      Sheffield Wednesday if the ground was going to be full or if
      the supporters had some particular reputation for trouble.
      In the case of the FA Cup Semi-final between Liverpool and
      Nottingham Forrest an ambulance was provided at the ground
      with its crew (with another ambulance and crew on standby
      nearby) because of the size of the crowd.


46.   Our policy is for either or both of Station Officers Eason
      and Higgins to attend all matches at Hillsborough.


47.   I recall that after Mr Wilkinson attended one meeting with
      Club Officials at Sheffield Wednesday he came back and told
      me that if it was going to cost the club money to provide
      ambulances then they were not interested.        For major
      matches, therefore, the ambulances are provided in breach of
      the terms of paragraph 28 of DHSS circular HC(78)45.


48.   The Club were, however, prepared to provide free tickets for
      the two liaison officers at every match and they regularly
      sit in the same two seats in the South Stand behind the
      directors box from where they have good views of most of the
      ground.   Where, however, the club knows that they can sell
      all the tickets for a match the seats are taken away from
      the liaison officers to be sold to the general public.   The
      liaison officers then make arrangements with the police to
      gain access to the ground and they position themselves at
      pitch level and I understand that this would normally be at
      the North East corner of the pitch.


49.   In April 1988 I wrote again to the five football clubs and,
      in addition, to Doncaster race course.   I sent this letter
      because there had recently been a pop concert at the
      Sheffield United football ground and they had refused to
      allow ambulances to be on standby because we had given them
      a price estimate of £1,000.     The attitude of the clubs
                                       o*a           <w                 vt.
                                   /
      generally seems to be /that they would prefer to make a
                               /
      donation to the St. John's Ambulance Brigade or the Red
                           /
      Cross of about £50i      St. John's Ambulance Brigade and Red
      Cross do excellent work but they are not in a position to
      give immediate help beyond first aid.


50.   Another reason for my writing in April 1988 was that I
      thought that it may generate some income for the ambulance
      service.    This was a secondary motive.       There had not been
      any pressure put on me from any source to generate income
      but there was a lot of talk generally at the time about
      income generation within the National Health Service.
                    \<w\

51.   On Saturday 15th April 1989 I would normally have been on
      call but Alan Hopkins had agreed to do my on call duty
      instead because I was on a course at Sheffield University
      that morning in relation to my position as a Justice of the
      Peace.     The course finished at 1230 and I arrived home at
      about 1330.


52.   At about 1535                    telephoned. -She^-i-s my secretary
      -and- tho public relations •officer.       She was at ambulance
      control in Rotherham and she told me that there was a major
      incident at Hillsborough.        I told her that I was on my way.




53.   I left home and arrived at ambulance control at about 1550.
I saw Mr Jones leaving in a staff car to go to Hillsborough.
He told me that there was a major incident at Hillsborough,
that people had died, and that Mr Hopkins and Mr Morley were
at the ground.    He was going down to the ground to back them
up.


I went into the control centre and met Mr Clarke in the
incident room (which had been set up by then) with Albert
Smith.   They briefed me of the situation, providing details
of the officers present at the ground, vehicle deployment,
and the backup from the neighbouring ambulance services.    I
gave instructions to call additional officers into the
Northern General and Royal Hallamshire Hospitals to act as
liaison officers.    Standards and efficiency officer
was sent to the Royal Hallamshire Hospital and Control
Superintendent             to the Northern General Hospital.
It was clear when I arrived that we had sufficient officers
at the ground but we also needed eyes and ears at the
hospital.     I was told by Mr Clarke that there were eleven
ambulances which had already been to the ground.
was in the incident room dealing with press enquiries.       I
went into the control room to speak to               about the
out-patient vehicles deployed to the ground.       He told me
that a further twelve vehicles had been deployed to the
scene.      I also spoke to               Ito ensure that the
"domestic” emergency services were still being provided.
Having satisfied myself that they were in control of the
      situation I went back to the incident room where I remained
      until about 1755.


55. Whilst I remained at control I was basically monitoring what
      was going on.   I was satisfied that my officers knew what
      they were doing and that they were doing an excellent job
      and it was not necessary for me to interfere.


56. There was no point in my going to the ground whilst the
      incident was at its height.     Mr Hopkins was at the ground
      and I was more use supervising the control end of the
      operation.   The arrangement is that in the event of a major
      incident one of Mr Hopkins and I will attend the incident
      itself and the other will be at control.   The decision as to
      which of us is in which position depends purely upon our
      locations when the incident arises.          As I live near
      Doncaster it clearly made more sense for me to travel to
      control in Rotherham.


57.   Whilst at control I spoke to a number of the officers at the
      scene and took a number of phone calls.    It is difficult for
      me to recall the exact content of those conversations or the
      order in which they happened.   I do remember that I tried to
      contact Mr Hopkins at the ground and that there was some
      difficulty with communications (which I shall deal with
      later). At one point I was able to speak to Mr Hopkins whom
      I believe told me that either 27 or 37 were then dead but
      that he thought there would be many more.    I told him to try
      to keep in contact.    I spoke to him again later when, I
      think, he told me that there were 53 dead.    I also spoke to
      Mr Jones and Mr Morley during this time in order to receive
      up dates relating to the situation at the ground.


58.   I also remember a police inspector coming through to me at
      about 1605 requesting more body bags.


59.   As well as receiving up dates from the ground itself I was
      being kept informed of the position by the staff both in the
      main incident room and in the control room.      I took about
      six telephone calls from the media which were mainly from
      television or radio.   I had wanted to speak to them myself
      because I knew that their reports would be going out almost
      immediately and there would not be an opportunity to correct
      any matters.


60.   I recall speaking to David Jones at about 1820 when he told
                    lw«_
      me that all        casualties had left the ground and that
      ambulances should be sent to Herries Road Bus Depot.         By
      that time we were also transferring patients from the Royal
      Hallamshire to make more space available for the incoming
      casualties.


61.   Throughout the whole of my time at Control I was satisfied
      that we had sufficient vehicles and manpower at the scene.
62. I spoke to the Regional General Manager of Trent Regional
    Health Authority twice whilst at Control.   He rang at about
    1615 and I outlined the situation to him and he said that he
    would do anything he could to help if we needed further
    resources.    I told him that we had sufficient resources at
    the scene and that we were receiving additional help and
    cover from other ambulance authorities.     I then telephoned
    Mr           at about 1745 to give him an outline of some of
    the statistics involved in the operation.


63. I went to the ground with Noel Wade, leaving Control at
     about 1755. At that stage I was satisfied that, as far as
       Vw*.
    ^ligh^te- casualties were concerned, the incident was closed.
    When Mr Wade and I arrived at the ground we saw Mr Hopkins
    and Mr Jones.     They briefed me as to the then current
    position and how the incident had gone.     Mr Hopkins said
    that he thought we had moved about 200 casualties.     I also
    spoke to each of the crews (about 8 crews) who were then
    still at the ground before going into the gym to meet Chief
    Superintendent Addis and Inspector Mole.    We arranged that
    our ambulances would take the deceased to the Medico Legal
    Centre in Sheffield when they had been identified by
    relatives.    Dealing with the deceased is actually a police
    responsibility but it is normal for the ambulance service to
    co-operate in moving them in a situation such as this.      I
    left the ground at about 1850 and went back to headquarters.
    I gave a press statement to reporters who were there from
      the Sheffield Star and Sunday Mail and an interview to the
      BBC with Mr Hopkins.       They basically wanted details of
      statistics.


64.   I went of duty at 2100.


65.   Forty two ambulances attended the ground, of which 31 were
      SYMAS vehicles and 11 came from outside areas.       Most of
      these vehicles made several trips between the ground and the
      Sheffield Hospitals.      In addition further vehicles were
      brought in from outside SYMAS and were put on standby.    172
      casualties were taken to hospital by ambulance, initially to
      the Northern General and then to the Royal Hallamshire.
      Three patients were taken to Barnsley District General
      Hospital.     Ninety Four fatalities were taken to the Medico
      Legal Centre in Sheffield, some having been returned from
      the Northern General and Royal Hallamshire Hospitals to the
      gymnasium at the ground.     The last of the fatalities left
      Hillsborough at 0528 on Sunday 16th April 1989.          The
      incident itself was closed by Mr Hopkins at 0530 on Sunday
      16th April.


66.   Four paramedics attended the ground and three others were on
      duty.   There was no point in deluging the ground with
      paramedics because it is difficult for them to put their
      extended training into practice in crowds.   In any event, by
      1620 there was no need for them.      I understand that there
      has been some criticism about the failure to use
      defibrillators.       I should explain that a defibrillator
      should not be used in a crowd situation.      It must only be
      used on a patient without a pulse.        If it is used on a
      patient who has a pulse, however weak, it would kill that
      patient, and if anyone was to touch a patient whilst the
      patient was being defibrillated then that patient would
      receive an electric charge sufficient to kill him.
                    ( ^ v   —                         'U. t -v ** *
67.   We received alafge number of cal^s from the media, MBy 1630
      we had received                calls.   These calls wcmct ne-t

      the blocked lines which were much needed, for example by
      nurses doctors and ambulance men calling in to see if they
      were needed at work.


68.   Between 1500 and 1800 hours on 15th April we also dealt with
      49 domestic emergency calls.


61. As a result of the Hillsborough incident we have put in
      three additional telephone lines to the incident room to
      handle press calls.


62. We did experience sane difficulties in relation to access to
      the ground.    One problem was simply the crowds outside the
      ground, and another was vehicles in the way.     At one stage
      the yard in the area of gate 0 was partially blocked       by
      police vehicles and police horses.      It would have been our
      intention to drive ambulances into the entrance by the
      gymnasium which has recently been made in the row of
      terraced houses, collect patients and drive out through gate
      0 but that road was blocked because of a police feeding unit
      being parked outside the gymnasium and because of other
      police vehicles parked in the area of the entrance between
      the terraced houses.     As a result of this ambulances had to
      reverse into the yard through gate 0 which slowed down the
      rate at which we were able to remove casualties away from
      that area.


63.   In addition a number of the ambulances (and the major
      incident vehicle when it first arrived at about 1540) were
      trying to proceed up Penistone Road to gate 0 |were directed
      by the police into the service road to the south of the
      ground.


64.   We did experience some difficulties in relation to radio
      contact.     There were three main areas of difficulties:-

                                 «>y
      1.   The handsets did not|w°rk properly because of the
           stands at the ground.     I understand that there is not
           normally any difficulty in using the handsets from the
           seats in the South Stand which Mr Eason and Mr Higgins
           would normally sit in because these are well above
           ground level.
 2.    The sheer weight of radio traffic caused some
           difficulties.   Most ambulances were told to use the
           emergency reserve channel but one or two used other
           channels in order to reduce the pressure on ERC.


 3.    There was interference on the emergency reserve
           channel.   This seemed to appear only on 15th April but
           is still present.    Phillips (who supply and maintain
           our radio equipment) were called in immediately after
           15th April and they are still trying to locate the
           source of the interference.


           The problems with the radio transmission has only
^ , ) caused us minor difficulties.        They did not result in
           the operation being handled any differently.
 d* ©'A-
 My attitude and that of my officers is that we wish to
 provide a swift and efficient service.       We have always tried
 to be at the forefront of the ambulance services.            The
 equipment obtained prior to the Orgreave civil disorders,
 our training of paramedics, the setting up of the incident
 room, and the changes introduced following the Bradford
 fire, are all evidence of this.           Since the Hillsborough
 incident we have, as I mentioned above, already put in new
 telephone lines to the incident room and a television and
 commercial radio are being installed so that, in any future
   major incident, contemporaneous media reports will also be
   received in the incident room.               We shall be reviewing the
   position to see if any further changes should be made but
   the only alterations which we have put in motion at present
   relate to the incident room which had not previously been
  used other than for testing.

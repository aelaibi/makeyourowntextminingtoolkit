             I do not support any one                 particular          football   team and       I do not attend

            man y matches.                I do go to the odd big game.



            On S a tu rd a y         15th April     1989    <150489)       Liverpool      were to play Not ti ng ha m

             Forest      in the FA Cup Semi            final at H i ll s b o r o u g h S ta di um      in Sheffield.

             I had purchased a t i c k et for the                         th S t and for this game          from a

             local      business          friend,

I tr avelled to Sh e f f i e l d with                           in a hired mini-bus,           we    left

our area between            10 am     <loggf) ^akd ±0.30 am        <1030)     that morning,          also

in the bus was a                              TrUIII clV i .lage     nearby,        his    phone number

1   s                    andl                          son.       We stopped to pick up two

other men,        that    I d o n ’t know,    at the Lord Da rs bu ry Public Hotel,

sit uated just        off    the mo to rwa y at Runcorn.



We stopped once on the journey at a restaurant in Bararley. I c a n ’t
                                       cat—   r&Krf&CL
remember the name of it.  We had been delayed on tfyf M62 due to an

accident    in whi ch a           mo tor cy cl e was   involved.



We ar riv ed      in S h e f f i e l d at about 2 . 5 0    pm    <1450)     and the driver          dropped

us off near the football                ground.                    his son                   and    I ran

down a couple of side streets                 to the ground.          The area was           deserted,

just a sea of         cars.       It was my first         visit       H i l l s b o r o u g h Stadium.



As we got outside            the ground the a r e a /was a mass              of    p e o p l e , I ’ve never

seen anything         like      it,   the urine fSJaj^ running down the street



Outside,    I was        pushed a bit,       there was a lot         9 ^'   an xie ty     in the    crowd

to get    inside the ground.

Once    I got     in, I can remember evteryojife urinating                   inside       the ground.

It was a warm dry day.                 I saw a lot of drunkenness                 inside    the ground,

there was       literally hundreds           urinating against            brick walls,        you    could

smell    the alcohol         in the air.       A lot of the people                inside the ground

were    disorientated,           due to the    consumption of alcohol.



I only saw one P o l i c e m a n am horseback              outside    the ground,           he was

ma rs hal lin g    the    crowd[, yasking     people      to stop pushing an d general ly

doing     his job.



We had just        got    into the^g-round when a large             roar went      up from the

crowd.      We were all ^'unning to our seats                in the N or th Stand.


   Ca i
We got     inti           stancf,    it must    have been about 3.05         pm    <1505)    when we

got seatesLxfn our          seats.      I saw the    players walking         off   the    pitch and

fans    spilling over           the terracing at the Le ppings Lane end of the

ground     into the goal mouth.              I believed this to be a pitch               invasion

by f a n s , people ar o u n d me all          thought   the fans we re fighting amongst

themselves and began shouting to them to gert back off the                            pitch.

After a while           I saw fans     carrying    injured    people o n H o a r d i n g s   across

the field.         S o me one    in the Noi        iand had a transistor            radio and we

heard that 8 people              had died in the     crowd.



I never w i t n e s s e d any deaths.           I remained    in the No rt h stand,          leaving

after a final a n n o u n ce me n t      on the    loud speaker       system that        the game

was abandoned.

As we     came    to    leave    the ground at the Leppings Lane            end,    we were     being

crushed against           fire    tenders    that had been        parked outside      the exits

and blocking           people    leaving the ground.         We    literally had to fight to

get out     past the fire           engines.     I was   crushed more      leaving       the ground,

then when        I went    in.

              there was     pushing,            seemed to me to be normal.                 The    turnstile      operator

             never     took any          part    of my ticket off me and              I gave      it back to

                           I never         saw any gates          open at the     time      I entered Hil lsb or ou gh

             Stadium.



              I met my son outside                the football        ground                     was    badly bruised

             on the hips and              chest^Tie was quite           sha             his ordeal         behind      the

             goal,     in the t£p/rac i n g .         He had been         lifted over        into the West Stand,

             someone     had a ll ow ed         himself     to be used as a human                ladder for

             and others        to climb up towards^/the West                    stand.



             On that day I had £15 O'in                   cash,    mo st l y £10 n o t e s , all       loose    rolled up

                      :ed ar ou n d       in the    crowd,    most     people were         shouting      or ag it a t e d as

             a result      of the         events    of the afternoon,           but    I saw one man behind

             me who was        smiling.          He was the only one            smiling and         it really stuck

              in my mind.           I w o u l d describe      this man as white,             25 to 30 years            old,

             with fair      hair and a nice               smile,    he was med iu m build,             about 5"7

              tall,    I can't       describe       his    clothing.       He had been very             close    to my

              back    during       the    pushing    to get out and as           I turned aro un d          to face

              him he was       smiling          broadly.



             By the time           I realised my cash was              gone,    this    person had got           lost

              in the    crowd.           I c a n ’t say this man stole my cash but he did stand out

             in the crowd as being           in a jolly mood and having       been standing    right

             up against my back.



             I never        reported my    loss to the Police,      as having found my son safe         I

             just wan te d to get home.            I thought   it is a lot of money,    but weighed

             against        the events    of that afternoon,      it ap pe a r e d to me to be totally

             irrelevant.

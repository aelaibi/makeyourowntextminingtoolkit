At   1 1 »20am that           day*    together wit h the 3 officers                 I c ommen ced my duty

in the       car      park,     towards     the    rear       of the S o u t h ,stand a n d the West

B a r r i e r s were     placed across            the    car    park,    fcelcw gate S2,         from the

wall       of the S o ut h stand to the                 b ou ndary wall adjacent           to the     river.

Furt h e r    barriers          had also      been      placed across       the    car    park entrance,              at

L e p p i n g s Lane.         The area between the               barriers was a          "sterile*      area,

w he r e    t e l ev i si o n e quipment and vehicles were                  located.        N o t ti n gh a m

F orest      supp o r te rs were         entering        the    ground below the barriers at                    the

South       stand,      wh il st Liverpool           s upporters were           entering    the    ground

above       the b ar riers at the L ep pings Lane                     end of the     car    park.       A

further       serial         of officers were            depu te d to     cover both these           barriers.

S up p o r t er s a t t e n d in g at the wrong               end of the ground were a dv i se d to

w alk ar o un d        the    ground,      to the       correct      entrance.      However,       adults

a c c o m p an i ed    by young       children,         old    people and women,          were    e sc orted

thro u g h the         ' s t e r i l e 9 area.

D uring      the f o ll ow in g       hours      I remained        inside   the    'sterile'       area

together w i t h the other                 officers       on that       duty.     I had a view of both

barriers and o b s e r v e d supporters                   of both teams         entering     the    ground

without       incident.

I realised a b uild up of s upporters at the L ep pings                                  Lane end of the

as he       passed me he a dv is ed me to w a t ch the s it uation on the                           barrier

'there to give supp or t            to officers          on that       duty..     Not   long a fterwards

it became      obvious       that       there was a considerable                build up of

supporters at         that       end,     I a tt en d ed      there wit h PC C r ai gi e an d PC

diff ic ul ti es     but    the    potential was Obviius owing                    to the    large numbers,            |

of supporters,                                                                                    !

The entrance         to the       car    park     up,to the barriers was full                  to heaving             j

about a pain           in the    region of his stomach.                      His legs and arms were

alright.         I had d i f fi c ul t y u n de r st a n d i n g him at first.                 I then saw a.

I saw a n a m bu la nc e drive around the track and stop a t the                               rear of the

goal    in front        of the West        stand.        I ran t o w a r d s      the a mb u la n ce     in

order to bring           it to the        injured       child.            I did not    reach the ambulance.

I saw two men w o rk i ng             on a boy aged           12-14 years,           one was     giving heart

mass ag e and the         other m outh to mouth.                    They were        on the    pitch,      to the

south end,        of the     centre       south enclosure.                  1 asked    if they knew what

they were        doing and       if they        required help-               The man giving m outh to

eiark hair an d blood on his forehead.                             1 he    nurse was wear in g a white

or    light   coloured       shirt.        The doctor          requested oxygen.               I ran to the

ambulance,          T remember         thinking       it w ou ld          be tragic    if someone         died.

from the      rear of the ambulance.                    I ran back to the              child.        The doctor

removed the mask            part      of the a p pa ra tu s a nd told me to turn                     it on.         I

turned the        red knob to the            'on'     position . ufitil          it w ould     not    turn any

checked by reading              the    instructions           on top of the           red knob.         It was

there we re 2 dead            peopl e i n the      back of the ambulance.                An    Inspector

shouted       'get the       dead   people    out and the           injured    inside’.        The    two

Thank you for your letter of 27 December, enclosing one from

about the tragic events at Hillsborough. I am sorry that you have not received an
earlier reply.

I am considering very carefully the points which were made in the programme
"Hillsborough", and the representations which have been made to me by the
bereaved families and by others. I will not take the decision to reopen the inquiry
lightly but will need to be convinced that it is in the public interest to do so and
that it will stand a chance of providing a better understanding than there is at
present of what happened on that terrible day.

In coming to my decision, I will consider whether there is any new evidence; I will
also consider whether that evidence appears to be of such significance that, had it
been put before Lord Taylor or before the coroner, either the outcome of the
Taylor inquiry or the verdict of the jury would have been different.

The Chief Constable of South Yorkshire has undertaken to provide a detailed
report of all the points raised by the programme. I shall decide whether any
further action should be taken as soon as I am able to consider all the issues.

Dear William Waldegrave,

I am writing this letter to demand a full public enquiry into the
Hillsborough disaster of 15th April 1989.1 was disgusted by the
evidence presented in an ITV drama in conjunction with the
families involved. I would like to make two points: Firstly, the
evidence to the various inquiry’s which set a cut off time of
3.15pm for the death of the individuals' involved should now be
declared null and void. Expat opinion differs considerably.
Secondly, 1 would appreciate it if the Home Secretary could
advise the Director of Public Prosecutions to reopen the file on
the disaster. The programme presented new details not presented
to the court, that the police officers involved could see that the
terracing was full, if not vastly overcrowded. In my book this is
gross negligence, and must be addressed even though the disaster
happened seven years ago.

I expect that you will feel it necessary to send this letter to the
Home Office but 1 appeal to you to raise this issue in Parliament
and in your privileged position in the Cabinet. If we do not have
a full public enquiry then this gross negligence will not reflect
kindly upon either the legal system nor your government.

Yours Sincerely,

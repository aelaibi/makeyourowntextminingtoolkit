          I write to thank you most warmly for the care and considerati
which you and other members of the Chapter and staff of Liverpool
Cathedral gave to planning and conducting the Hillsborough
Memorial Service this morning.         It was an occasion which managed
to combine comfort for the bereaved with giving glory to God.
If there is an appropriate opportunity,          I hope you will pass
on this expression of my appreciation to the other church
 leaders and participants who also contributed so notably to
the Service.


          May I also thank you on behalf of Denis and myself for
giving us the opportunity of a private meeting with the many
bereaved families who were present.           Here also it was clear
how much the whole occasion had comforted them.           We were also
most grateful for the refreshments which you so kindly provided
 for our departure.


          I look forward to visiting Liverpool on a happier occasion:
but in the meantime I shall retain lasting memories of a sorrowing
community which has nevertheless been finding solace in things
eternal-




                                        / /
The Very Reverend The Dean of Liverpool

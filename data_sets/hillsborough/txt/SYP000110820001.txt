                     Liverpool          supporters             were       already milling               around          outside       the       gates       on

                     that     a large            section       of    the      Liverpool          fans       were     not      interested          in

                     alcohol          from       cans    and       bottles.          Attempts          made     to      persuade        these        fans

                     of    two    cans       of    lager       together          with some            empty     cans.          The    driver         was

                     developing             in L e p p i n g s      La ne.       All      my    time was       taken       up w i t h

                     Vehicles          began       to    have       difficulty            negotiating           Leppings            Lane    due      to

                     the    large       volume          of    supporters            who    were       making       no    effort       to    enter          the

                     ground,          standing          in g r o u p s ,      drinking          alcohol       and       causing       a general

                     obstruction.                 Again       due    to    the      volume       of    numbers          and    the    fans       being

                     at    some       stage       traffic        was      stopped         by the P o l i c e         from      entering

                  Leppings         Lane       worse.           Other        officers          were      also       attempting                 to    prevent

                  obstructions             and      to    get        the     fans      into       the    ground without                      much

                       ccess.        It w a s       apparent              by t h i s       time    that       there       were       a       large       number

                  of    supporters            from Liverpool                  wh o     were       not    in    possession                of a t i ck e t -

                  I was also          approached               by     three        men who         s h o w e d me        tickets             they    had    just

                  purchased.              It w a s       quite        obvious          that       the    tickets          were       forgeries             and

                  poor      ones     at     that        ye t   these         men     ha d    paid       twenty       pounds          each          for

                  obviously          drunk         but     due       to    the     vast      numbers          of   supporters                 present

                  these      had to         be     ignored.

E N D OF   REPORT
                       POLICE CONSTABLE 2120 THOKPE.




With regards to the events of Saturday 15th April 1989, at 9.00am that date
I reported for duty at Ecclesfield Police Station and was then transported to
the Sheffield Wednesday Football ground* All officers present were briefed
at 10,00am that date* I was a member of Serial 19 consisting of 9 other constables
and a Sergeant, P.S. 323 Proctor* We were directed to perform duty outside the
ground on lappings Lane itself near to the turnstiles* This duty consisted of
general public order duty, the reception and searching of any coaches attending
directly at the Leppings Lane end of the ground and assisting turnstile officers
if so required.
At 11,00am that date ay serial made its way to the Leppings Lane end where
behind the West Stand we received a further briefing together with the serials
directly responsible for the turnstiles at Leppings Lane from Inspector Sykes.
During this briefing we were advised that it was likely that Liverpool fans
would bring alcohol to the ground. We were told to search any coaches arriving at
Leppings Lane for this purpose. The officers directly concerned with the turnstiles
were told to make selective searches for alcohol.
% serial went outside tjje ground and positioned ourselves on Leppings Lane on the
footpath adjacent to the turnstiles. This was at approximatly 11.10am and on leaving
the ground a large number on Liverpool supporters were already milling around outside
the gates on the ground and walking up and down Leppings Lane* Almost immediatly
on taking up our positions I was approached by a group of Liverpool fans enquiring
where the nearest open Public louse was* This was a common request prior to the
kick off that day. Some time around 12 noon the Leppings Lane turnstiles were
opened. It became apparent that a large section of the Liverpool fans were not
interested in entering the ground early, there were large number of fans of all ages
hanging around on Leppings lane drinking large quantities of alcohol from cans
and bottles. Attempts made to persuade these fans to enter the ground were met
either with derision or the Police were ignored, I was involved in the search of
an official Liverpool supporters coach in Leppings Lane. This search resulted in the
find of two cans of lager together with some empty cans. The driver was verbally
cautioned regarding this matter# From approximatly 1,30pm onwards the situation
seemed to get worse due to the large crowds developing in Leppings lane. All my time
was taken up with attempting to prevent obstructions to the footpath and raod.
Vehicles began to have difficulty negotiating Leppings lane due to the large volume
of supporters who were making no effort to enter the ground, standing in groups,
drinking alcohol and causing a general obstruction. Again due to the volume of numbers
and the fans being unco-operative this task became almost impossible and I believe
that at some stage traffic was stopped by the Police from entering Leppings lane.
Sometime around 2,00pm I was aware that a special train had arrived from Liverpool
and this made the situation on Leppings lane worse. Other officers were also attempting
to prevent obstrutions and to get the fans into the ground without much success.
It was apparent by this time that there were a large number of supporters from Liverpool
who were not in possesion of a ticket, I was also approached by three men who showed
me tickets trhey had just purchased. It was quite pbvious that the tickets were
forgeries and poor ones at that yet these men had paid £20,00 each for them. There
were also a large number of supporters who were obviously drank but due to the
vast numbers of suppoters present these had to be ignored.
At 2.35P® that date a large fight developed in Leppings Lane approximatly 50 yards
from the turnstiles. Kffself and PC English from my Serial immediatly attended and
we both arrested one youth each who was in the process of attacking others* We took
these youths towards*A*gate in order to transport them to the Police room but due to
the vast numbers of supporters attempting to enter the turnstiles at this time we were
unable to force a path through to the gate* We therefore were obliged to take the X
youths to the Police room via adjacent roads. As we -were taking the youths away from
Cont attached sheet.
The immediate area of Leppings lane were were approached by several youths attempting
to purchase the tickets from the arrested youths* After the prisoners had been
processed I was in the gymnasium at the rear of the north stand when around 3*00pm
Chief Insp Sumner requested that all available officers in the Qym attend on the
pitch* I then attended in front of the Leppings Lane terraces and gave what assistance
I could*

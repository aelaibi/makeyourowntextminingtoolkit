              The Right Honourable Douglas Hurd                                    rc.p.                        8th June 1989.


 Dear Home Secretary,
                                     I

                                               ro: Hillsborough Disaster


         ^e     ^a ^her         of      the         late    Sarah          and Victoria Hicks who                   unfortunately
were among the 95 people so tragically killed at Hillsborough.


You will       require          little          reminder              of    the    increasingly          acrimonious         rounds
of    accusation       and           counter          accusation             that     abounded          in    the    media      until
you had the good sense to issue your instruction to the police and request
a general cessation.
Despite     acute      provocation                   and        at    times       great    personal          anguish,      my    wife
and     I have       resisted            numerous           opportunities             to    fuel       that    deplorable         and
unseemly      state        of    affairs,              preferring             to    assist        the    Taylor       Inquiry      in
its difficult task - including being prepared to await the outcome before
making detailed comment to the media.


I write     to you         today         to request                  your comment          and    intervention          following
the statement,         widely reported                          in the media,          by South Yorkshire’s Deputy
Chief    Constable         Peter          Hayes            to    the       effect    that        "no    further      action       was
required    in  connection  with                                     the    actions        and     behaviour          of        Chief
Superintendent David Duckenfield.
J was under the            impression that Lord Justice Taylor on                                            the one hand and
the internal Police Investigation by the West Midlands force on the other,
would    draw conclusions when                        and        only when          they had       concluded         their work
and   had     time    to    deliberate.                    Despite          the    careful       wording,       the     issue     of
this statement by the Deputy Chief Constable pre-empts these findings!


Words fail me when 1 try to convey to you the hurt and totally u n n e c e s s a r y
anguish this untimely statement has given my wife,                                                myself and presumably
t e   other    families.             Apart          from        the    crass       nature    of        this action,        I find
the n t t ] to issue such a statement at this time beyond contempt.
                     07 06   ’89   13545                      2    072740004    CLfiXTON B L I N D S                    03




                                                          ?


 One can only conclude that this is yet a further attempt by South Yorkshire
 Police to divert public opinion away from                                     their      appalling          performance
 both on the fatal day and subsequent to it.


 Apart     from   obvious      offence      to    the    bereaved,             how    are    Lhe public          to view
 this premature "absolution" by the Deputy Chief Constable!
 That a senior police officer - who by his own admission deliberately chose
 to doceive his superiors (and others!) should not be disciplined is totally
 incredible,

          lf °nG b e n e V 6 S chief Superintendent Duckenfield's reasons for lying
 ^ F t h e general public at the time, (and I am bound to say that I personally
 do not!) there could have been no credible reason lo have misled the Deputy
 Chief Constable.


 Is   it   purely    coincidence           that    this           provided      an        excuse       for    the     Chief
Constables silence during the lead-in /initial week of the Taylor Inquiry,
when the fans were able to give their views?
 1 trust      that under      the     circumstances               you will       understand my               fears    of a
•'whitewash" at the least and at the worst a deliberate attempt to                                                   nelose
ranks ’ and distort the course of justice.


I regret that Mr.Hayes's insensitive and untimely public action has further
reduced my opinion of the SouLh Yorkshire senior police.
It leaves me no alternative but to formally complain directly to yourself,
and to ask you as the vanguard of a Government claiming to be ’'committed
to    law and     order"     to make       an    unequivocal           statement of             your opinion           and
intended actions in the wake of this regrettable development.


I will await your urgent response during                            Lhe course of today or tomorrow,
but   would     advise     thaL    should       I fail    to         recieve         an   appropriate          respc *.se
I reserve the right to follow Mr.Hayes                              example      and       release       this       letter
to the media tomorrow evening.


Yours ^ai^hfully,

           r/

Trovor Hicks.

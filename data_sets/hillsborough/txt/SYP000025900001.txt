     Dear Sir Harry

     Herewith letter sent to me by                 and a copy of my reply.

     This gentleman telephoned me about 2 weeks ago and claims to be in
     possession of "evidence" that Hillsborough and, to a lesser extent
     Bradford, were due to the activities of a gambling ring operating
     within football.

     I personally cannot take it seriously but felt I should pass it on
     just in case.

     Best regards




     Enc


     c.c.   Mr Whitehouse, Treasury Solicitors Office.

HAMPSHIRE




Dear

Thank you for your letter of 1 5 May (and for your earlier telephone
call) relating to the problems at Hillsborough.

I am not in possession of the names and addresses of all the
relatives and hence cannot supply these to you.

I have forwarded your letter to my Solicitor (Sir Harry Livermore)
and also to the Treasury Solicitor, Mr Whitehouse, at the Taylor
Enquiry itself and have asked them to pass this to the
police/others for investigation.

Thank you for bringing this matter to my attention.

Yours faithfully
L

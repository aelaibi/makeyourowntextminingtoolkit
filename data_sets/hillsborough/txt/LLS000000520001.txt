            to    Sheffield          with m y       boyfriend.                                   his    brother

                                  and    his    girlfriend                            Ve    travelled            by   car     and         parked

            in    a side       street,

            Ve    did    not      have     tickets        for       the   football          match      and     we     went       to       the

            Penistone          Rd    North      end      of    th e    Hillsborough           Stadium         where         we

            purchased          5 consecutively                 numbered         tickets       from     a     ticket         to u t .        I

            stocky       build,         brown    hair,         straight        with        perhaps     a     side       parting.                He

            was    casually          dressed        in    a ski        jacket     type       anor&V.          Ve      paid       him        20

the    pub    ran      out        of       glasses.                              had       half       a    lager        and        then

orange       juice,                        was    driving             and    only          had     shandy,              I w a s n ’t

At    about        1330      p m we         went       to    the       ground.              The       tickets           we        had    purchased

were    for    the        Spion            Kop    end       and       so    we    went       to       a    Police           kiosh,

something           li k e       a Portacabin,                   outside          the       ground,             in     t he       area    to    the

South       Stand,           Ve       explained             to a n         officer          that          we    were        Liverpool

Supporters           and         he    advised          us       to s e e        a steward                at    th e    Vest        Stand

Ve    went    to     the         entrance          to       t he V e s t         Stand       and          spoke        to     a    steward.

This    was    man        in      his       early       30's          and    I think             he       had     a beard,               Ve    spoke

to    him    about        the         tickets          and       he    directed             us     to      th e      far      l ef t

turnstile.            Vhen            we    got    to       the       turnstile             the m a n           there         refused          to    let

us    in.     Ve     then         went       back       to       the       Steward          and       he       directed            us    to    the

BEEN    LETTING           PEOPLE            IN.”        At       this       turnstile              we      were        allowed           into       the

ground,       th e     turnstile                 operator             looked       at       our       tickets           and        retained          the

one    half.

Once    inside         the        ground          it w a s        not       crowded          at       that        stage           and    we

entered       throuh             the       tunnel       to       enclosure             4    (as m a r k e d            on     the m a p ) .          Ve

went    towards           the         left       hand       side       of    the       enclosure                and     sat        slightly more

than    half       way       back          from    the       front.

It    was    not     crowded               but    there          were       quite          a few          people        there.            There

was    room    to m o v e             about       and       to    s it      on    the       steps.              Ve     sat        for    about       ten

minutes ,

At    about    1430          -    1 44 0     we    started             to m o v e          forward.               Not       necessarily

because       we     wanted            to,       but    because             of    the      numbers              of     people           behind

us.     Ve    reached             a barrier             and       because          of       th e      pressure              from        behind me

ducked       underneath                it.        At    this          stage      I wasn't                 apprehensive,                  it w a s

     towards          a gate               at    th e     front          to     try       and        get     out,

   the        pressure           started                to h u r t        and        I got           frightened.                The      game         had        I

   think         started             but        I c o u l d n ’t s e e              the         pitch.                         [s h o u t e d      for

  People            then       started             climbing               over       the        fence,          onto      th e     pitch.               There

were       trying          to g e t             t he    females            and       children               out,     and       these          lads

helped me             up       onto         th e       to p    of        the    fencing               by    the     corner         of     the      pen.              I

was       helped         down        onto          the p i t c h           area.            I could             fralk     to
                                                                                                                                                and

through          the       railings                and        I could           touch           them       but     you       just       c o u l d n ’t do

anything.                After            about         5 minutes
                                                                                                 was       helped        ou t      over         the
r a i 1 in g s
                                       was        still         in       there           fo r    what       seemed        like          ages       and       I

could         see    his        face            going        a funny           colour.                This       was     because             he    c o u l d n ’t

breathe.             He       then         saw     a gap           behind           him         and       faught       his      way      to       the

side      fencing             an d     got        out,        over        the       fencing.

            When           this    all       started          I saw girls               and    children             getting        to    the     front

            and       trying         to     climb        out,         or    being       passed       or       pulled        out,    and        the

            Police           were       tryng       to p u s h         them       back    into       the       pens.         When       t he    Police      di

            realize           what        was     happening                there    seemed          to    be    no   organisation                and

            they didn              t seem         to     know what            to do.           The       Police      even       seemed          to   be

            pulling           th e   people            off     the         fences       that    were       trying           to h e l p    other

            people           get     out.

            It     also       seemed         to    take       a    l on g     time       before          the    ambulances          came        onto

            the      pitch.          Ve      got    out       of      the     ground       as    soon          as w e     could.




           I am       24     years          of    age,       5 '3 "    tall,        slim,       long       blond        hair     which         was

           tied       up w i t h        a    red    scarf          in a bow.             I was       wearing            a white         sweat

           shirt           and    navy       blue      tight          trousers          with    a    thin        red      stripe.

           Whilst           in    the       pub    and       in    the      area    of    the       ground,          we     were    asked        on

           several           occasions,             a dozen            or    so     times,      if       we    had      any    spare       tickets

           to     se l l .        This      was     mainly            from    Liverpool             supporters.

           I am       a keen         Liverpool            supporter               and    go    as    regular           as     I can.

  to    give       our       tickets           in t o g e t h e r .           Having          gone          through           the        outer

 towards           the       turnstiles,                 it w a s      just        a mass          of       bodies,           all        I saw         were

 two m o u n t e d           Policemen,               one      was     getting           very          hariated,              I don't             know

 whether           they       had       radios        with        them       but        I didn't             see        t h e m.        We    had        been

 waiting           for       about       twenty           minutes           w h e n we        got       through            the      turnstile,

 Nicola           was       getting           rather        squashed and                 it w a s           very        worrying             the

 conditions.                  It w a s        worse         outside          as     your          whole       body was              moving             from

 side        to    side      and you were                   trying          to     shuffle          along.               There       was          no

 attempt           made       to    have       an     orderly           queue          or    control             of      th e      crowd,          I just

 go t   the        impression                that     th e     Police            had     given          up    completely                 in t r y i n g

 to     control          the       crowd,          people         were       climbing              up    onto           the     wall         to    try

and     get       out       of     the       crowd,        not     to      get      in      but        just        to    get       away from                the

 crush,           eventually we                go t      through           the      turnstiles                and         I handed both

tickets           in,       t he    man       at    the      turnstile              didn'thand                the       other

obviously              waited           for    everybody              else       to     get       through             from         our    group,             we

witnessed              one       lad w h o         was    being         asked          to    pay        for      his      programme                as       it

looked        as       if    he    had        gone       off     without           paying          for        it,       a Policeman                 and           ,

supporters              came       through            the      concertina               gate,          an'd I j u s t           said         to

Nicola        to       get    out       of     th e      way     because           it       looked          as     if t h e y        kicked             the

door     in,       a    then       saw a           bobby's        helmet           and       saw       the       door       being         closed

Mac     came       through          the        turnstile              and     he      went        to    the        toilet          whilst          Mac

was     in    the       toilet          the     gate        was       opened        again          and       another            surge         of        fa n s

the    tunnel           it    had       all       cleared and               we    headed            in t o     the       cr ow d ,      it    was

probably           about          ten       to    or     five       to    th re e ,       the       teams       h a d n ’t g o n e           onto

that    is       in     the       centre          terracing,              behind          the       go a l     at     the      Lepping            Lane

End,    as       he     said       it       looked           alright       over        there         so we          started           to m a k e

our    way       down        to    this          point        behind        the      goal.           We       seemed        to    lo s e      Ma c ,

Arthur       was        being          pushed           to    the       left     and      we    managed             to     get    him        back,

we    went       down        to    the       front,           almost        without            touching             th e    ground,           we     got

under       t he      bar     and       made        our       way       almost       to    the       fr on t ,        when       we     got

there,       there           were       people           screaming             and     shouting               then,        you    could           fe e l

got    ito       th e    crowd.              Then        the       pressure          just       got       gradually              worse,

initially             you     had       little           bit       of    r o o m a r o u n d you,              th e      people         were

to    what       was    going           on,       the        people       were       shouting             for       help,        they were

being       asked        to       be    got       ou t       as    they     couldn't            breath,             one     Policeman               did

have    a    radio           to    hi s      mouth           but    he w a s n ' t        speaking             into        it,    the

Policeman             just        looked          but        he    didn't        do a n y t h i n g .           Es'ent ua ll y w h e n

things       got        really          bad an d             we    thought        t ha t       we    weren't             going        to     g et    out

of    this,        eventually                they        did       open     up the         gate          at    t he      front        and     a

couple       of       supporters                 g ot    out       and    then       they       closed          the        gate       shut        and

one    Policeman              leant          on     it       to    close       it,     one      supporter                got     over        the

fence       ad     in    fact          was       fighting           with       the     Policeman               and       three        other

Policeman             jumped           on    him.            People       were       screaming                for     help       bu t      they

didn't       seem        to       be    taking           any       notice,        at      this       time       Arthur           was       O.K.      and

David       was       O.K.,        I could see                    that    Nicola          was       distressed              and       h er    face

was    going          red,        the       three        lads       who were           next         to    as    were        clearly           go n e ,

they    were          deep*       purple          and        their       mouths        were         opened.              People         were

shouting          to    th e      Police       there's         people         dying          he r e ,     we    c a n ’t b r e a t h /          we

pressure          got       worse       and worse           and     I thought             that       Nicola           had     gone

because         she     had gone a             very       deep      red a n d        her       eyes        s e e m e d to        be    glazed

and      popping           out    of    her    head,         I remember              David         shouted           to m e      is    Arthur

he    was      asleep,           I couldn't          speak,         my m o u t h        wa s     going         but     I had          no    air

to    be a b l e       to    speak,          I felt       like      being         sick.,       but       I had        to    gulp       to

keep      it     dofcn a n d          I remember Ni cola                saying.           I 'm     going         to    be     sick,         I

don't       know       how       I was able          to      talk       to    her       but o b v i o u s l y         I must          have

got      the    message           through       that         sh e      had    to     h o l d it         back,     at t i m e s           I was

mouthing          the       words        because       I just           simply       couldn't             get     any       words          out

because          I was          under     so m u c h      pressure.                I ju s t        got     the     impression               of

the      build        up    of    pressure       getting            worse         and     worse          and     worse,            rather

than      there        being          a big    push       at     the     e nd ,     the       pressure           was       such        I have

in m y      life,          it    is    the m o s t     frightening                  experience             I have           ever       been

panic       stage          before        I calmed           down       but    I actually                 thought        that          I was

going       to    die.            I was      feeling         extremely              hot      and     I    could       feel         myself

for      air     just        like a go l d f i s h .              I can't           say      how     long       this        was       going          on

longer,          as     th e      pressure       eased,           so    Arthur          was      dropping,             as     the

 pressure          eased          so    I fell       back,        there       were        people          in     front        of      me    who

 right           hand      side        section         of       the Lepping                Lane        Terracing,                  I was          then

 carried           out      onto         th e    pitch          and       I was       left.            Eventually                   I managed               to

 ge t    up      to     find Nicola,                  I can't             remember          seeing              David         or    him       shouting

at      me    to      get       o ut ,      having        found Nicola                    I then            tried        to    find        the

others.               We    eventually               got       round       to       t he    gymnasium                 where         we     saw Mac

and      he      came       over         and    told        us      about        Arthur          having             died.           I also           went

to      Hallamshire               Hospital            with          Nicola,          a man           from          the    St.       John's

Ambulance              bandaged             the      le f t      ankle         up,    the        muscle             was       tight        and        I

couldn't              put    any         weight       on       it,     they         x-rayed my                 foot       at       the     hospital

but     there          were       no      fractures              revealed            and        it w a s           then       strapped             up

again.           David       a r r i v e d at         th e      Hospital             before           we       were       s ee n .

They     wouldn't                let     me     out       of     the      hospital              for       a    couple          of    hours,             to

give     me       time       to     recover,              I was        very         upset        and          in a       daze.           I wasn't

given        a    crutch          or     a stick           when        I left         hospital                 bu t      I was       able          to     put

some     weight            on     the       le f t    ankle.

             I a m Mr                                                          and    I live            at    the    above         address       w i t h my

             I am       an    ardent          Liverpool                Supporter           and      I've       been       going      to    matches           fo r

            the     past          6 years.

             I got       my       ticket          on       the T h u r s d a y       night        before        the M a t c h ,        that      would        be

            Liverpools                 ground.

            I    paid        £6.00          for    a Standing                Ticket        for      the       Leppings         Lane       terraces           at .

            met     up w ith                           who     lives         there,        |                    afid his           brother

            At    1/4        to    10 a m we               went    to    the     bus       stop         and    caught        a 79      bus      to    th e

            City     Centre             where          we    got       something           to     eat        from a       c ak e    s h o p.

            At    about           20    past       10 a m w e           al l    got    a       t ax i    from       the    Williamson            Square

            taxi     rank          to       Priory          Road,       Liverpool              4 getting            there     about        20    to    11 a m
We     waited        there       until       3    past    11 e m w h e n             we    boarded          a white        Barnes

Travel         Coach,       I think          number       26,       which        I had          already       bought           a ticket

for.          It w a s     advertised             in t h e L i v e r p o o l          Echo       paper.           BARNES        TRAVEL

regularly            do    the    coaches          to    the       away     matches.

When      I boarded             the    coach       I was       carrying              a ba g      with       food     and       cans      of

pop and         there       were       2 Policemen             on     the       coach       and       they    were        checking

everyone          for      drink       and weapons.                 He     c he ck e d my            bag    and     let    me    board

th e     coach       without          any    problems*.

I d i d n ’t s e e         anyone       have       anything           taken          off    them       but    he     checked

anyone         carrying          anything.

WE     all     got    on    the       coach       and    set       off     at    a    1/4       to    12    noon,        with      a

full      coach.

We     drove      towards         the       Match       and    got        stuck       in a t r a f f i c          jam

on     the     Motorway,          the       M62    by    Manchester.                  This       was       because             there         werea

lot     of     people       going       to       the    various           matches          that       were    on     that       day      and    a

lot     of     people       needed          to    use    that       stretch           of    Motorway.As              we    approached

the     ground        in S h e f f i e l d        at    about       10     past       2    pm    I saw       a lot        of

supporters,              mainly        Liverpool,             walking           towards          the       ground.         I saw         some

drinking         outside          the       White       Horse       Pub     which          is t o w a r d s       the     Liverpool            en

of     th e    ground.About             S minutes             later        the       coach       eventually              parked         past

Wadsley         Bridge          Railway          Station       about        1/2       a mile           to    a mile        f r o m the*

ground.          I d o n ’t k n o w          the       name    of         the        roads      but there           was    a lot        of

coaches         parked          there.The          four       of    us     left       the       coach       and     we w a l k e d

towards         the      ground.            We    stopped          o ff   at     a    Pizza Parlour                 just        beforethe

White         Horse       Pub    and    had, a P i z z a .                We     left       t h e r e at     about        2 5 or       20     to 3

pm.We         walked       past       the    White       Horse            Pub    and        I saw about             10    or 15 p e o p l e

drinking         alcohol          outside,             supporters           that          is,    but       there     wasn't            very

many     because           it   was     late       and    everyone              was       trying       to    ge t    to    the         ground.

There         were    Police          along       the    road       keeping           an    eye       out    for     trouble            but
 we       wern't        stopped              by    any          of    them.

 I got       to        the      Leppings               Lane          entrance         at       about       20      to    3     pm a n d        it w as

 congested.                  There       were           thousands              of        people         waiting           to      get        into    the

 turnstiles              and       as        I worked                myself      forwards               I wa s      shocked             and

 surprised              to      see     that           the      gates         leading            to     the     turnstiles               were        closed

and       locked.               The     gates           were          locked        but        the      turnstiles                were       open     and

no    o ne       could          get     into           the      area      to    go       through           the      turnstiles.

I saw 4 mounted                       Police            Officers           in t h e            court       yard         between          the        gates

and       th e    turnstiles.                     They          were      on    their           own      because             no    one        could      ge t

past       th e    locked             gates.

The       4 of     us        decided          to            try and get             away         from      th e     gates          because           it w a s

getting           uncomfortable                        in    the       crush        and        it d i d n ' t       look          as    if t he

Police           were        going       to       open          the      gates.            By     this        time       it w a s        10 to 3           pm

and       everyone            w as      getting              anxious           to     get       in    to      see       th e      g am e .

We    started            to     make         our       way        back     through              the      crowd          and       were        going       to

s t a n d at       t he       rear       and          wait        fo r    a gate            to     be    opened.

As    we     were        moving          back               I saw        a group          of     about        20     lads         moving        to    the

right       and        I saw          that        a         gate       on a     line       with         the     gate         we w e r e        a t bu t       on

the       right        was      open         leading              to     the    courtyard               on      the      right          but     not      to

any       actual         turnstiles.

We    walked           forwards              into           the      couryard            and      I was         just         concentrating                 on

getting           in    to      se e     the          match.

I just           followed             th e    other             fa n s    and we          went        across          the         courtyard            and

to    a    gate        which         had      been          opened,            I ’m      no t    sure        who      by,         that        lead

directly           into         the      ground.

I was       in     the        first          50       to     go      through,            I didn't             see     any         signs       telling           us

where       to    go,        but       the        fans          in f r o n t        of    us     were        Liverpool                 fans    and       my

friends           had     been         before              so     I just        folowed              them      diagonally                left       to     the

tunnel       to        p en s    3 and            4.        I went         that          way     because            it w a s           the    only       way
                                                      I                                I                                                                PAGE


I could            see          to     get       to       the      pens.          There          were       no     signs,          or    stewards            or

nothing.

I went         into             the       tunnel            and     we    had      no          problem        going         through           to    the

pens.          Everyone,                   at     the        time        I went            through,           went       through            t he    tunnel

normally            and          at       th e    end        I went          to    the          right       of     the      fence        into       pe n 3.

The        p e n was            virtually                 f ul l   and       everyone                wanted        to    se e      the      match       so we

worked         our          way       through              towards           the       front          until        I was          about       15    feet

from        th e    front             and        about          1/2 w a y         across             the    pen.

It w a s       about             5    to 3        pm b y           this      time          and       between          that        time      and     5    past

3    pm     I could              fe e l      that          more      and      more             people       were        pushing          in a n d       we

were        being           pushed           forwards               and      to    the          left       and     getting            crushed

against            the          people           in       front      of      us.           I ducked           under         a    barrier           because

I didn't            want             to    g et       crushed            against               it.

At     about        3       pm the           match           kicked          off       and       by    t hi s      time         it w a s      getting

really        uncomfortable                           in t h e       pen.

At     5    past        3       pm P e t e r          BEARDSLEY              nearly             scorred          a goal          at     the     Kop     end

and        everyone              just        surged             forwards.                  I got       all       of     the       breath        squashed

ou t       f me     and           I blacked                 out.

I am        certain               that        if he         had     scored,                I    would       be d e a d ,         I'ml u c k y      he        hit

the        crossbar.

When        I ca m e            around           I was        lying on        the               floor        of t h e           court y a r d by         th e

turnstiles                  X     PK       n e a r to w h e r e          I    was w ai t i ng               to g e t i n        earlier             and

                    and          a guy           called                       from Kirby                   were looking                 after       me.
                                                                                                                *
I    remember               seeing           a Policeman                  and      a       doctor          c o m i n g to m e           but     I couldn*

t    talk     or m o v e              my     body.

It w a s      about              20 m i n u t e s            after        I had            come       around          that        I was       carried

outside            to       an    ambulance                  and     taken         to          the    Northern           General            Hospital.

I want        to        add          that        when        I crossed             th e         c o u r t y a r d .on t h e           way     in    I was

looking            for          someone           to       give     my       ticket             to    but     we      all       went     through          into
                                                                                                                                     PAGE
c                                                                    ^




    the     ground without                anyone       checking             our       tickets.         In    fact       no     one

    checked        my    ticket        t ha t    day*

    As    I was        crushed       I was       with I                             I we'd     got     separated             from     the

    others.

    I want        to    add     that      at 3    pm       people          were       getting        crushed       at     the    front

    and     people       were       trying       to    climb             over   the     front        fence    but       the     Police

    were        telling       them     to g e t       back.              I don't       think     that       they    saw        people

    were        getting       injured and             only      saw        people       climbing        the     fence.           I suppos

    that        they    thought        that      they werejust                  trying         to     get    onto        the    pitch.

    The     last       thing     I remember            before               p a s s i n g o u t is    a Police          Officer

    opening        the       gate    at    the    front          of       pen   3     onto   t he     pitch.        At       this     point

    the     game       was    still       going       on   even           though       people        were    being        injured and

    the     Police       ha d    opened         the    gate.

    At    no     time    once       I had       reached          the       ground       d i d I see         anyone       consuming

    alcohol.

    I    d i d n ’t s e e     any    fights       or       disorder             between       th e    fans-        There

    was     a    good    atmosphere             between          everyone.

    I    didn't        see    anyone       collapse             or       receive       any    particular            injuries.           I

    d i d n ’t s e e     any     barriers         collapse.




    I want        to    add     that      my    injuries             were       torn    ligaments           left     ankle,

    concussion,              cuts    to m y      face       &    neck,          and    nose,         bruising       to    my    arms,

    neck,        back,       chest     and      legs.

                          HILLSBOROUGH STATEMENT


  I am a Solicitor and a Partner in the firm of Messrs Hill Dickinson
  & Co of Liverpool, and am the Vice Chairman of the Merseyside
>- Branch of the Football Supporters' Association. I am a See&n Ticket
 holder for the Main Stand at Anfield and have followed football
 regularly since I was a small boy. On 15th April 1989 I attended
 the semi-final of the F.A. Cup between Liverpool and Nottingham
 Forest at Hillsborough, Sheffield.


 I travelled to the game by car and was accompanied by Rogan Taylor,
 Peter Garrett, both of whom are National Officers of the Football
 Supporters' Association, and my brother-in-law                       We all
 had tickets for the Main Stand.       We left our final pick-up point in

 hold-ups and where we were detained for approximately hailf an hourifp-
 We then proceeded along the A616 and took the right hand fork to
 Glossop onto the A57.     From that point on we had a clear run to
 Sheffield and we arrived in the vicinity of Hillsborough at
 approximately 1.30 p.m.       As I said earlier, we knew the ground wellfe
 and we managed to park very close to the spot we parked last year
 which is approximately 10 minutes from the ground.          We walked from
 the street where we had parked the car to a pub we had found last
 year.    This pub was the Freemasons's Arms and is situated by the
 bridge over the river.     Last year this pub had been frequented by
 supporters of both Liverpool and Nottingham Forest, and I was
somewhat surprised to find this year that there was a bouncer on
the door who was only allowing Liverpool Supporters to enter.


Rogan Taylor left us in the Pub after approximately 15 minutes as
he had to meet another friend of ours, John Williams, outside the
ground and collect his ticket.    Peter Garrett, |
                                                 ____________ |and I
stayed in the pub until just after 2.00 o'clock.       I remember
distinctly hearing the radio announcement that Alan Hansen would be
playing.    This was prior to the 2.00 o'clock news.     As we left the
pub the Liverpool fans were noisy and a little rowdy, but there was
no violence or drunkenness that I could see.


We then walked up the hill towards the ground, knowing from
experience that it would take us approximately 10 minutes.          When we
arrived at the other side of the hill, immediately outside the
stadium, it was clear that a large crowd was gathering.       I noticed
that there was no filter system at the first set of gates as there
had been at the corresponding fixture on the previous year.          The
time of our arrival at the stadium was 2.15 p.m.       We approached tJie
turnstiles to gain access to the North Stand and could see at that
stage that there was no semblance of an orderly queue being formed.
We stood alongside a concetina gate leading into the North Stand
and could see that there was only one policeman on each of the
turnstiles.   We could see Rogan Taylor and John Williams
approximately 10 yards in front of us but could not manage to
contact them through the sheer volume of people trying to get into
the ground.   At this stage, although it was crowded and the crush ->
was building up, it was no worse than I have previously encountered
at other football grounds.     However, as the minutes ticked away
prior to kick-off the crush did get worse and I remember one
woman standing alongside me becoming very concerned and upset.
Upon seeing her concern, the crowd made space for her and she was
pushed through the turnstiles.    One elderly gentleman in the queue
said that he felt faint and forced his way out to the side.          People
were screaming at the police officers to open the concetina gate
and allow those with tickets into the stand through that entrance.
I could see many people climbing the walls into the ground.          The
police officers were actively assisting people to gain entrance
that way.

        and I were eventually forced together through the turnstiles,
although we lost Peter Garrett at that point.           Inside the ground
people were remonstrating with several police officers asking them
to go outside and form some sort of orderly queue.           None of the
police officers appeared to be taking any notice whatsoever.


        and I then tried to make our way to our seats, but we could
not follow the signs to gangway C.           We had already heard a roar by
this time to indicate that the teams were out on the pitch.           We
walked the wrong way originally and found ourselves looking onto
the entrance to the terracing.         We realised that this way was wrong
and walked back, eventually finding the sign indicating the way to
our gangway.     I       land I had never entered the ground from this
particular part before and              indicated that he wanted to go to
the toilet.    We could see that rather than going to the lavatories
large numbers of people were urinating against a wall alongside the
stand and I          I not knowing where the toilets where in any event,
ioined them.    At that moment a large phalanx of police officers
emerged from under the stand and were clearly moving urgently                   jKf
towards the turnstile.       In my opinion they had clearly been alerted;
that there was a major problem.         However,    and despite this, one
officer tried to arrest my brother-in-law           and several others who ^
                                                                                K■ *L

were urinating on the wall.       I made my way to my seat in Row 5 of
the stand and found that there was already somebody sitting there
who had obtained entry without a ticket.            I moved him out of my
seat and advised him that the seat alongside me would           also be used;,
        then joined us and about two or three minutes later Peter
Garrett arrived.       He forced the two young men without seats out of
    ,            i

our area.     At that point we could see that the middle of the
Leppings Lane terrace was absolutely crowded, but were surprised to
see that in both the wing elements of the terrace there were quite
substantial areas of room.       The teams were out on the pitch and the
game kicked off and we could see that people were being pulled out
of the terrace and were attempting to climb over the railings.              I
was more concerned as to what was happening behind the goal and did
not really watch what was going on on the pitch.           I heard a roar
and I understand Peter Beardsley hit the bar at the other end of
the pitch but I did not see that myself.           After what appeared to




                                                                   V -

 be four or five minutes I saw Bruce Grobbelaar and what appeared to
 be a senior police officer draw the referee's attention to what was
 happening, at which point scores of fans swarmed onto the pitch.
 The referee stopped the game and the Liverpool players were taken
 off the pitch together with those of Nottingham Forest.      Police
 officers at that stage were trying to keep people off the pitch,
 although this proved impossible as more and more people spilled out
 from behind the terrace.


I had a portable radio with me and listened to whatever I could
 from Radio 2's commentary.   It was clear from Peter Jones' comments
that nobody really knew what was going on at that point.         Hundreds
of police officers then arrived and we could see that steps were
being taken to assist the injured.      We did not immediately
appreciate that people had died.     An ambulance arrived together
with officers of the St John's Ambulance and fans started to tear
down advertising hoardings to use them as stretchers.      At one
point, the Nottingham Forest fans who clearly did not know what was
going on began jeering, at which point several supporters on the
pitch ran to them in an attempt to make them understand what was
happening.   At that point the police placed a phalanx of several
hundred officers across the middle of the pitch.     We stayed in our
position on the seats and I heard over the radio commentary that
people might have died.   Soon after that we began to see the
stretcher bearers walk instead of run across the pitch and that the
bodies they were carryina were covered with coats.     We could see
                                        Many police officers were not
assisting in any way and were merely wandering round. I heard no
Tannoy announcements until approximately 3.45 when Kenny Dalglish
went up into the box alongside the Leppings Lane terrace and
announce to everybody to keep calm and remain ^in position.
Approximately 15 minutes later an announcement was made that the
game would not take place and the people should retain their ticket
stub for use if the game were to be replayed in the future.        A
senior police officer then came round with a hand microphone to
advise everybody to leave the ground quietly and slowly.
At that point we met up with Rogan Taylor and John Williams and
Rogan decided that we should hang around rather than leave the
ground and start talking to people as they came off the terrace in
the hope that we could pick up some idea of what exactly had
happened.    All five of us then walked onto the pitch and started to
talk to the many people who were milling around.     Many were in
tears or in shock.


The first people we spoke to seemed to indicate that a gate had
been opened by police officers to allow supporters in without
tickets.    This was confirmed as we spoke to more and more people.
We then went to look at the terrace which was an horrific sight.
A part of the wire netting at the front had been cut away and the
gates had been opened to allow access to the terrace.     One of the
crush barriers had been bent totally out of shape and was no
longer rigid at all.     The terrace was scattered with shoes, scarves
and sunglasses.    All of us wept as we stood on the terrace.


We then tried to talk to police officers who told us that they knew
of at least 50 deaths.     People walking past were verbally abusing
the police to a certain extent, although there were no attacks of a
physical nature.     I have to say that the police officers on the
terrace at that stage were calm and collected.     Their senior
officer , an Inspector, indicated that his particular men had only
arrived at the ground after the tragedy had occurred.


We then walked through the tunnel from the terrace and noticed that
there were no lights whatsoever in the tunnel.     We walked out into
the courtyard and noticed that immediately facing the entrance to
the tunnel was a concetina gate.    We presumed that that was the
gate that had been opened.    As we walked towards the gate at the
end of the terraces through which we had entered we were approached
by numerous supporters who were pleading with us to take
photographs of the various gates.    They told us that as they had
been walking away from the ground, police officers had been
telling them that Liverpool supporters had been at fault for the
tragedy in physically forcing open the gate.     Several of the people
 we spoke to were outraged at this suggestion and said that they
 personally had witnessed the gate being opened by police officers.
 I then physically checked the gate alongside the turnstile through
 which I had entered and it was clear to me that it had not been
 forced in any way. We did a similar check on the gate opposite the
 tunnel onto the terrace.


 At that point we all agreed that it might be useful if we were to
 speak to our local radio representatives if it was possible for us
to get into the press box.        We began to make our way towards the
entrance to the Club, although there were various ambulances
blocking our path into which dead bodies were being carried.


We asked a steward on the gate for directions to the press box and
he ushered us straight into the main stand to find the box.        Rogan
Taylor was immediately taken away by Graham Beacroft of Radio
Merseyside who started interviewing him'as to the events we had
witnessed.     I asked for a representative from Radio City and gave
an interview immediately which I understand went out on the 5.00
o'clock news.        After finishing with Liam O'Donague from Radio City,
I gave an interview to Independent Radio News.        At that point we
realised that none of us had made any attempt to phone our
                                                                              -w-i-v

out to be Ken Montgomery from the Sunday Mirror if we could use his
phone.    When I actually got the phone in my hand I could not
remember my own phone number and then once this had come back to me /
the number was engaged.       Ken Montgomery managed to find another
phone and kept ringing through on the number whilst I phoned my
s is t er-i n-law.                                                            ■,■

I then gave a long interview to BBC Radio Trent and the interviewer
lent me his personal phone to try and phone my wife again.        I got
through to |         Iwho told me that the initial reports were that
everybody who I knew was alive.
We then went down to the Executive lounge as we were told that a
press statement would be released and that a press conference would
follow at which the Chief Constable of the South Yorkshire Police
would attend.   We spoke to as many people as we could in the lounge
to ascertain what was going on, including Peter Robinson and Tony
Ensa of Liverpool Football Club.    Rogan Taylor gave interviews on
television and I was aghast to hear events described    by the
Chairman of Nottingham Forest Football Club as "a pitch invasion".
The comments were immediately challenged by Rogan.


We went back out onto the pitch and spoke to Patrick Barclay, a
sport journalist, and eventually ascertained that the press
conference would take place back in Sheffield at the headquarters
of the South Yorkshire police.   We were also told that it was
unlikely that we would be able to gain entry to the press
conference.   At that point we decided to go home and we made our
way back to the car.    As we went away from the ground an elderly
local lady asked us whether we were alright and whether we wished
to go into her house for a cup of tea.   We thanked her but
continued on our way. We were back at the car just in time to hear
the 7.00 o'clock news on BBC radio Sheffield.

 there       was    a        bit    of a         push          to    get       through             the        outer       gates          into          the

 courtyard.                  When       I get            into       the       courtyard              area          I could          see       there          were

 two    police           men       on    horses               and    I also             saw     2 other             policemen             standing

 by    the    turnstiles.                    The          policemen                on     the      horses           were       shouting                at    the

 crowd       to    stop        pushing.                   I heard             one       of    the        policemen             on    the          horse

 shouting          to        the    crowd            to       stop       pushing,             that           the    match would                   be

 delayed          until        everyone                  got    in a n d           to     try and             push       back as          by       this       time

 it w a s     beginning                 to   feel             tight          for    me       and        I was       still       only          a    few

 yards       inside           the       courtyard               from          the       first        gates.              I would          think             that

 it w a s     about           1452       pm a t           this       time.              We    were           all    trying          to    keep

 together          at        this       time         and       the       crowd          was     in a g o o d             humour          but       we       were

 being       jostled           about         a       lot.           Very       shortly after                       this     I became               aware          the

 the    pressure              of    the      crowd             was       easing           and      the        crowd       in    front             of m e

 veered       to     the       right.                I started                to     follow             it    and    by     this         time          I was

 still       with        I                                      |but         I had been           separated from my other
                                                                                                        %
 friends.            I       realised            that          the       big        gates       in f r o n t of us h a d b e e n

 opened       and        the       crowd         was          walking          through.                  As     I walked            through             this

 gate    there           was       no    crushing               at       all        but      everyone              was    walking             fairly

 quickly.            I       could       see         a    tunnel             immediately                 in     front       of m e w h i c h                all

 of    the    crowd           seemed         to          be    walking              into.           I did          notice       any       police             or

 stewards          at        this       point            directing             the        crowd          but       there       was       no       crush       and

I just        walked            into       the     tunnel          still          with       I                                      My     other

friends         were        ahead          of    us     somewhere.                 As       we    were    walking          through              the

tunne1                            said          to me,        "Dose          this       mean       we    dont       need       our

tickets,"             and       I said          “y e * "     and       I then          reached          into    my    back          pocket        and

put    my     ticket            away.           It w a s      intact             and    the       stubb    had       not       been

removed.              I looked             at m y w a t c h            whilst          walking          through       the          tunnel        and

saw     that         it    was    almost           3 o clock.                    I could          see    the    players             on     the

pitch       and       we    reached             the     end       of    the       tunnel,          there       had    been          no     pushing

through         the        tunnel          but    as        soon       as    I    reached          the    terraces             I moved           to

the     right         and       all    of       a sudden           I became             aware       of    being       pushed              from

behind.           Almost          immeidately                 I lost             sight       of m y m a t e ) ___________ |                 I do

not     remember            the       game       starting              or    any       of    the    play,       I can          remember

starting             to    be    crushed           right          at    the       top       of    the    terrace          as       I came        in

but    the      next        thing          I can        really          remember             was    my    elbows          being           jammed

into m y        ribs        and       my    hands           by m y      face       and       being       right       by    the          very     front

of    the    terrace.                 I c a n ’t r e m e m b e r             any       of    the    journey          down          the

terrace.              I was       aware          of     people          in       front       of    me a n d     everyone                crushed

all    around             me.     I was          still        standing             but       at    an    angle       bent          forward

from my        waist.             I c a n ’t r e m e m b e r                anyone          screaming          talking             a r o u n d me .

I just       knew          I had       to       get     one       of    my       arms       up    and    forced       out          of     the

crowd       s o m e — how.            My memory              is    very          hazy       but    I seem       to    remember              being

aware       that          there       was       a gate        in       the       fence       in    front       of    me,       a     policeman

standing          by       it    and       this        policeman             grabbed my             left       arm which                I had

managed        to         force       up o u t         of    the       crowd       and       he    was    pulling          at        it    and    I

can    remember             saying,             I ’m    going          but       then       I must       have       passed          out.

The    next       thing          I can          remember           was       waking          up    in t h e     x    ray       department

of    the    Northern             General              hospital             and    feeling          very       cold.           My       injuries

were     concussion               very          bruised           ribs       and       neck.        I was       very       sick           and

incontenant.

           All     of    the       blood       v e s s e l Is    in m y         face       and    eyes       had    burst    because        of

           th e    pressure             and my       face       was       very       red    and my          eyes    completley        red.        I

           had     lost       my       red j u m p e r     and my          anorak          was    torn       to    shreds.      A    ring    on

           my     finger          was     crushed        onto        my    hand       there       were       foot    prints     accross          the

           front        of m y         tee    shirt      but     I do          not    recall          being       walked    o n at    all.        I

           was     discharged                from    hospital             at    midday          the    following       day.

           Looking           at    the       grid    shown       to       me    by    the       Police       I was    in    pen 3     entering

           by     reference             1H w h i c h     is     the       last       part       I can       remember       being     in    until

           I was        at    the       bottom       and      being        pulled          out.        On    route    to    the m a t c h    I

           consumed           2    cans      of     cider       as    did       my    other       mates       apart    from     David

           Elliott           who       was    driving         and     had       nothing          to    drink.

           I paid        £6.00          for m y      ticket          and       it    was    for       the    standing       area     in    the

           Leppings           lane       stand.          There        was       still       a    very       large    crowd    of     people

           behind       me        as    I went       through          the       gates       from       the    courtyard       after        they

           had    been        opened.

            on    the       4th    March       last       year       and    since       then       I have          had    to    use       my

            knowledge             when    I have          been       at    work.

                                  I have       been       a Liverpool             Football          Fan       as    long       as    I can

            remember          and    I have          been       going       to    the       matches       since          I was       fifteen

            years       old,       week       in    and week          out.        I follow          them       everywhere                if    I

            can.        Two       weeks       before       the L i v e rp o o 1/ Nottingham                    game       at

            Hillsborough             I had          the    chance          to    buy    a ground^ticket                   from       a    cleaner

            at    my    work       because          he    c o u l d n ’ t go      for       some    reason          or    other          anyway       I

            bought          the    ticket          for    the    face       value       which       was       six    quid       the       b l o k e ’s

            name       I bought          it    off       was    a bloke          by    the    name       of

                                  Anyway       I asked          around          for    someone       to       go    to    the       match with

            but    I    c o u l d n ’t f i n d       anybody          so    I was       going       to    sell       the       ticket          buton

            the    Wednesday             before          the    match       I found          out    that       my mate          from          work.

I arranged            to       travel       with               and meet                        in M a n c h e s t e r .

                   On      the       day    of    t he      match,        Saturday,           15 A p r i l     1989       (

15048?)        I met                  at    Lime       Street         Railway         Station          at   eight     fifteen

in    the    morning            a n d we        got    the     normal        eight       thirty          train      out       of

Lime       Street       towards            Manchester              to m e e t                   it w a s n t       a football

special        and      there         was       only     me    and               travelling             together.             We    got

to    Manchester               Railway          Station        (Oxford Road)              and met                         at       that

Station        when        he    finally          arrived           at     about       eleven      o'clock          in the

morning        and we           all    got       the     normal           scheduled        train         which      left       the

station        between           half       twelve          and     one      I cant      remember            exactly what

time       it w a s     but      it g o t        into       Sheffield Railway                  Station         at    about          two

pm    on    the    same         day.        We    walked           from the           Station       part      of    the       way

and    then       got      a    taxi       the    rest        of    the     way,       it w a s    a     black      taxi       that

we    flagged         down.           The       fare     was       only      about      one      pound       fifty    between

the    three       of      us.        Although           most       of     the    pubs     between           the

Railway        Station           and       the    ground were                shut      I did      see       a few

suppor.ters           drinking             from       cans     of     beer       as    they were            walking,          they

were       supporters            of b o t h       clubs        but        they    w e r e n ’t    rowdy       or    anything

they were          just         walking          along        like.

                   When         I got       off       the     train        I only       saw      a few       coppers          in

the    City       Centre         and       they       looked         like     just      being       there      so    normal,

not    because          of      the m a t c h         but     we     didn't       see     any     others       on    the       way

there       and    no P o l i c e          were       giving         us    directions.              The      first

Coppers        I saw           were    two       on    horses         when       I got     to      the      ground    at

The    Lepping          Lane         End.

                   Because            I had a ticket                   for    Entrance            *B*    Lepping      Lane

and    the       other       two        had S t a n d         Tickets       for        West       Stand Lepping                 Lane

we    sort       of    split       up at        a   small           bridge       near        to     the    ground           a nd we

arranged          to       meet    there        after          the    match        had       finished           although

there      were        a    lot    of      people         mi 1 1 i n g a r o u n d •I d i d n t           see     anyone

obviously             drunk       and      I didnt            see    any    fighting.

                      I must       have       got        to    the    ground           at    half       two     in t h e

afternoon             and    as     I walked             from       the    bridge           I could        see        the

Lepping          Lane       end    of     the       ground          and although               I    could       see       the

turnstiles             there       were       no      queues         there        it    just        seemed        like          there

was    a    solid          mass    of      people         outside          the     ground.              Although               there

were       loads       of     people        all       around         me     I could          still        walk        towards           the

turnstile             area       without         much         difficulty.               As     I said          before           I only

saw    two        Coppers          on    horses          at    this       time        and      I didnt         see     any

stewards           and      there        were       no    persons           telling          us        where     to    go       or w h a t

to    do    or     anything.

                      About        this      time        the     people          b e hi nd me           started           to    push
                                                                                                                                         i

and    the        crowd       started           to m o v e       forward          then         it all       seemed             to   turn
                                                                                                                                         i


to m y      right          away     from        the      turnstiles,              I didnt              know where              I was

going       and       I couldnt            stop m y sel f            from        being         pushed       so       I just         went

along       with       the       crowd,         I wasnt          being       crushed              or    anything           like

that       because          at     this      time        it    was        just    a    steady           push.         Then          I saw

I was       actually              inside        the      ground,           not    outside              it a n d      I still            had

both       parts       of     my    ticket          with me           nobody          had ask ed           for       it    or       taken

if    off     me.          I didnt          see     an        open    gate       I didnt           see     one       being

opened        and       I didnt           see     anybody            trying       to        get    into       the     ground

illegally              like       climbing          walls           and    that,        al l       I know       is    that          I

didnt        go    through a              turnstile             I didnt          get        the     chance        to.

                      Once        I knew        I was          in t h e     ground,            inside          the     turnstiles

I saw        the      crowd        in f r o n t       of m e         and    to    the        side       of m e        heading

    towards    an       opening        and        I could            see      the      goalnets              of    the       pitch

    through    the        opening           and        the       crowd       surge       just        c a r r i e d me         on

    toward    the       tunnel        and        at     one       point       it a c t u a l l y        felt         like      I was

    lifted    off       the    ground            but       I wasnt          sure       but     at      this        time       it w a s n t

bothering           me       that     much        because            this        sort     of      thing           has    happened

at     a few       of     these       grounds              but    always          coming          out    because              people

wanted        to    get       home-         Getting              back       to    the    tunnel          I didnt              see     any

coppers        or       stewards            in    the       tunnel          but     I didnt            see        any    fighting

or     people       drinking           while            I was      in       there       because          it       was        just    a

solid mass              of    people        and         nobody         had       r o o m to       do    anything              else

except       walk.            At    the     time           I was       in    the       tunnel          I was        in t he

middle        of    t he      crowd       but         when       I got       out       onto       the    stand           as    you

look    at     the       ground        from           the    tunnel          I was       on       the    left           of    the

tunnel.

                    Once       out     on        the       terracing             I didnt          think        it w a s        to    bad

I got    pushed              right     down           towards          the       front       of    the       terracing              and     I

thought        "This          aint     bad        I    can       see    the       pitch        from      here"           but       then     I

thought       something              was     wrong           because             the    p e o p l e at         the       back

were    still        pushing           forward              and    I had          nowhere          to    go        I was       being

pushed       onto       a white           guy         in f r o n t     of m e          but    I wasnt             anywhere           near

a    barrier        but       I started               to    get    a    pain       across          my    chest           and       it g o t

more    difficult             to     breath            because          I was          breathing             out        I couldnt

then    breath          in     because           of        the    crush          I heard          a ’g i r l      who        was    two

or    three        people          to m y    right           screaming             but       I cant          remember              much

about    her        but      I do      remember              that      there           were       about        eight          to    ten

lines    of        people      between me and                      the       front       fence          by     the       pitch.

Everybody          was       shouting            for        the    people          behind          to    get       back        and

they    were       shouting           back        "We        cant".           Then       I saw a             loose           line    of

uniform       Police          about         a yard           away      from        the       fence       but       not        actually

       to    open        the      gates         then we              all    shouted           but       the        coppers           just

      stood        there          they         didnt        move       forward           or    back          or     look       at        us    they

      just        stood        there.           My        right        shoulder              began       to       hurt     because                 it

      —          being        pushed       back           because           the       people          behind »ere               s t i ll

      because           of    that        I was          starting            to    be    "doubled                 up".

                             Nothing           seemed           to    happen          for     a       long        time    but        then

  the        people           behind           me    started           to                back          and        a sort        of       space

  appeared              and        I was        beingpushed                 back        by         the p e o p l e        in f r o n t

  over           then.         I balanced                 myself           up a n d     looked           down       in     front              of

  me       and     I could          see        that        it     looked          like        there          was    nobody              in

  front           of    me    except           what        looked           like a wall                 of    dead        bodies

  just           lying       there        at    first           it    looked          like        a     hundred           but       I

 could           see     that       they        were        eight          high       for     about           a    length        of

 eight           foot.            I reckoned              about        Forty          were        there.           I went        to

 these           people with              another            lad       who     was       screaming                 someone's

 name        I cant           remember              the     name       but       we     pulled          a white           lad off

 the       top     of    the       bodies,               he w a s      still          alive        so    we       pulled        him

 back       onto        the        cleared           terraces              and     he w a s       breathing               so    I

 left       him        with        t he    lad       that had              helped me              pull h i m        out        and       I

went        back        to    the       bodies,            I could           see      that        some        w * re

obviously               dead       because           they        had ye llowing                   white           skin and

they        had        blue       lips    and        because           of     my      First           Aid     Training,

these        are       signs       that         I could              expect        in a d e a d              person.

                       In t h e      pile           of    bodies           I saw        an    arm       hanging           out

and       the     h a n d was        shaking              so m e       and     another             lad       pulled        on

this       arm     and       the     lad«s          head         came       out       from     the          pile     of

hair       w h i c h was         straight           and       short       I think                he w a s         wearing             a

him    on    the     terracing               and     he       didnt       appear             to    be       breathing                 but

I checked          for       a    pulse        in    his          neck    and       when          I found           that

there       was    still          o ne      there        I started             to       give       him mo uth                to

no    response          then       I tried           again          still          no       response              and    I was

                   I tried             to    pull        other          people          off       the       pile        but       I

couldn't          on my          own     because          there          was       no-one          there           to    give

grabbed        hold       of    the       back          of    my       shirt       and        shouted          "Carry

was    breathing           into          him       he       just       vomited           and       it    caught       my

face    and      the      sleeve          of       my       jacket.           I wiped              myself       and

crried        on a n d     then          he    was          sick       again       so     I rolled             him    over

onto    his     front          to    save          him       choking          on     his       vomit       then       some

other    people           came       with          something                that     looked             liked a

stretcher           and    took          him       to       the    other          side        of    the    goal

away    from        Leppings             Lane          end.

                    It    was       then       I saw          a Copper             with        his       helmet       in

only    th e    same"          and       he    turned             away       by    this        time       I was

distressed           and       crying          and          I think          he    was        feeling          the

couldnt        find       one       so    I gave             him       mouth       to     mouth          and    nothing

happened        -    checked             for       a    pulse          again       still           nothung       so     I

carried        on w i t h       mouth          to m o u t h            and    still           nothing          then     I

saw    two     Coppers          standing                close          by    and     I    s h o u t e d at       them

twice    to     get       some       oxygen             but       they       said        there          werent       any    and

I   carried         on    with       heart             massge          until       two        uniformed          lads

came    over        with       yellow          oilskin             leggings              on,       put    an    oxygen

mask    on     him       and    took          him away-

                          The        next       thing       I s a w was            a    lad b e i n g       pulled             along

 behind          the           goal      by another              lad       so     I went and          gave         him         a

 hand a nd            the          lad    being           dragged          was     shouting          “m e         legs    me

 legs       I    cant          walk"           We     took       him       through        the       solid          line        of

 Police          across              the m i d d l e        of     the       pitch       by t h e     half         way         line

 and    through                a     tunnel         off     the       pitch        where there             was       a    lot        of

 uniform             people           shouting             "This       way"       and     we    ended         up        in a        big

 sports          hall          type       thing which                 was    split        in t o     two      halves,

 one    where             the       dead      bodies         were       beause          they       had      jumpers

 over       their          faces          and       things        and       the    other        half       was          for       the

 injured.

                          We       put    the       lad w i t h        the       damaged        legs       where          the

other        injured               were       and     the        lad w h o        I helped          to     carry          him

 in w i t h      said           " I'm goi n g              to     look       for m y       brother"                and        I

said     "Do         you        know       this       lad"       and        he    said     "No,      I've          never

seen     him         before"               as    he       left     someone             came    and       in       plain

clothes          and           said       "I'm      a doctor"              and     asked       him       where           it    hurt

and     he s a i d             his       stomach          and     legs       the       doctor       felt          around           and

said     "There's                  nothing          broken"           and        told    me    to    stay          with        him

and     left.             The        Coppers          came        round a nd            took       his    name          and

address          then           left      a     short       time       later        we    tried          to       get     him       to

walk     about            which          he     did       then     I sat          him    down       for       a    bit        and

he    got       up    again           said       I think           I'm all          alright          n b w 1' a n d           we

both    walked             out        onto       the       pitch again              and       by    this          time        the

whole       place          was        virtually             empty          and     I saw       that       where           it       had

happened             the       fence          had     a    hole       in    it     where       someone             had        cut

it    down      and        I       could       see        that    some          barriers           were       bent       down

actually             on    the        terracing.                 Me    and       this     kid       then       walked

out    the      ground              and       parted        company after                 I checked                he    w as

            I am       a Liverpool             Football            Club       fan.

            On    Saturday,             15    April       1989(150489)               I travelled          on a       coach       owned

            by    Barnes          Travel,       County         Rd,       Walton.           The    trip was        independent

            of    any       agent       club.        I am      a Season          Ticket          holder       w h i c h was

            purchased             from       Anfield.          I    p a i d £.6 f o r       the       ticket     for      standing

            area.           I went       with       my    brother         -                                          of

                 , Liverpool                    and my         brother          in    law -                                          of

                                                     L i v e r pool                  The    Coach       was    booked          for

            1045       am    it    didn't       leave         until11»15             am.     The      Coach      did      not    stop
                        *



            on    the       way-        We    were       delayed         on    the    M62    Motorway          for

            approximately                20    minutes.             There       was    no    alcohol          taken       on    board

            the    Coach,          in    fact       Liverpool            Police       searched          everyone          prior       to

            leaving.              We    arrived          in S h e f f i e l d    at    approximately              1.30         pm.        We

            were       escorted          into       the m a i n         Coach    Park       which       was    only       two

            minutes          away       from    the       ground.             There    was       no    escort     from         the

            Coach       to    t he      ground.           Myself,         Brother          & Brother          in L a w     went       to

            a Supermarket                which       was     only        five    minutes          from    the     ground         and

            we    bought          beer.        We    drank         10    cans    of    beer       between        the      three       of
 us    on    the    grass           verge       by       the    Supe r m a r k e t .

 About       2.20       pm w e       walked             down    the       ground          and      arrived           at    approx

 2.30       pm.     There          was    a     few       fans       singing.              On      arrival           at    the

 ground       there          was    a     lot      of     people         at        the    turnstile             but       they

were        making          their       way     through.                There        were       Police          Officers

about        but    no       apparent           directions*                   At     this       time       it    was       just

busy     as       you       would       expect,          I didn't             feel        uneasy        at      this       time.

 I entered          the       ground          via a          turnstile.                  There       were       stewards

inside.            I saw       two       together.                 All       other        gates       were       at       this

time        closed.           I went          forward          into          the     terraces*                I didn't              see

any     gates       opened.              I did          see    fans          in a        constant          stream

climbing           over       the    walls          to       left       of    the        turnstiles             as    I

entered.            There       appeared                to    be    one       suitable             foothold           which             the

fans     used       one       after       another.                 My    ticket          was       handed        in.           I

didn't        see       any    signs          to    direct          me       in a n y      particular

direction*                  I had    been          to    l as t     years          game       so     I knew          where          to

go.    I went           into    the       tunnel             directly          behind           the     goal.             At       this

time     I had          a    free    passage             through,             there       were        no      Police           or

Stewards          there.            No    problems             were          evident          at     th i s    time,           there

was    adequate              space       around          me.        It was. n o w             approximately

2-40    pm.         I entered             the       pens       and       I went          to     the     back         of    the

full.        With           refence       to a t t a c h e d            grid       r e f e r e n c e *1 w a s         at       L4.        I

was    not    in     the       vacinity             of a       barrier.               I had          lost       contact             with

my    brother       and        brother             in    law       but       I wasn't           particulary

bothered          about        this.          The        rest       of       the    fans       were        just       singing

but    no    rowdy          behaviour.

At    2.50    pm a p p r o x i m a t e l y              there       was       swaying           in    the       crowd,             it

felt    full       at       this     timeto             capacity.              Shortly             before       the        Kick

off     I felt             a    surge          from       behind          pushing              me       over       a    crash       barrier

to a     point             with          reference                to    the    attached                 grid       reference             M6.

I was           suspended                over       the       barrier          with           my    head          facing         the

ground,              the        f o r c e was- s u c h            that        it     caused             me    to       vomit.          I had

no    idea why                  t h e r e was       such          a     surge.            I was          suspended               o v e r the

barrier              for        about a         1 1/2 minutes.                           I managed                to    get

underneath                 the       barrier             and       could       see        that          the       Police         had

opened           a gate             at    the       front          of    the       security              fence.             So     I wanted

to m a k e           my    way       towards             it       but    of    course              everyone             else       could

see     the          gate       was       open       and          they were              falling             overtrying             to      get

to    it.            There          were       more       people          falling              by       the       gate      which          is

positioned                 at       grid       reference                N8.         I was          aware          of    people

underfoot.                     I saw what                I thought             were           people          unconscious                  in

the    area           indicated                on    the          grid    reference                 L + M 7 +8.               I was

still           in    considerable                   pain myself                   and        I had          to    be       pulled       out

by a P o l i c e m a n               because             I went          underfoot                 myself          but       I was         only

a    few y a r d s             from       the       gate.              I don't           know       why       this          crush

happened.                  I saw about                   three          people           on    the       ground,             they were

all    my        sort          of    age,       certainly                no    children                 or    elderly            just

ordinary              sort          of    fans.           I didn't             see        anything                which       may      help

because              of    feeling             so    ill.              I certainly                 d i d n ’t s e e          any

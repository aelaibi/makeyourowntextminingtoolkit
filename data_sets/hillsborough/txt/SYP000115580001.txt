    ultimately         gives access            to the        football           pitch.      Upon     looking       out onto

    the    playing area          I saw that            the m a t c h was          in progress.

    However,       looking       over       to the L e p p i n g s Lane             end of the ground              it was

    clear     that     some    sort     of     incident          was     taking       place.       A number        of fans

    were     running      on the       playing area              be h i n d and at the side                  of the goal

    mouth.        Almost      immediat'ely           I noticed a senior Police                       officer       running

    onto    the    playing       area,       trying        to a t t r a c t      the a t t e n t i o n    of the     referee,

    The mal^cTv was         ha3A^d^a_Imost             immediately,              and after       some        confusion the

    players were          escorted          from the         pitch.           My first      impre s s i o n was that

    large     scale      f i g h t i n g was    taking         place amon g s t          the Liv e r p o o l      fans.           I

    immediately          left the a r e a           of the N o r t h stand and                ran across          the

    playing area to            the L e p p i n g s Lane            end of the ground.                    When    I reached

    that     section of        the     ground         it became          apparent        that a public            order

    incident       of a d i f f e r e n t      nature was              taking     place,,      The L e p p i n g s Lane

    terrace,       in the are a         behind the goal m o u t h was                      ext r e m e l y    congested

    and    panic     had set        in amongst           the- crowd,           p a r t i c u l a r l y at the     front

    where.a       large     number were             ob v i o u s l y    in distress.           The       crowd was       so

    packed that          it was       impossible           for     the       persons at the          front       of the

    terrace,       and    beh i n d    the wire mesh,                  to move.        A number          of Police

    officers were a c t u a 11y standi ng on the                              top of the wi re fsnci n g ,

     ulling       fans    over and          onto     the     playing          a rea and     perimeter           track.        A

    number     of fans        were     lying        on the       pitch s e r i o u s l y      injured.          Some     of

    them were        unconscious.              As    I looked onto               the terrace         from the        pitch            I

    realised that           it was      desperate           to     remove as many             fans as         possible

    from the       front      of the        terrace.          To       the    right    of the      con g e s t e d area

    was a narrow          '’sterile*         corridor.             The       na r r o w section      had a door at

    the front a l l o w i n g         access        onto    the        playing     area.       This      sterile area

    was    s e p a r a t e d from     the    right       of the         c o n g e s t e d area by a metal            fence.

    I went      into     this a rea and began to                       pull    persons      from the         crowd      into

the    sterile        are a and then               direct       them thro u g h the door              at     the f ront’

an d   onto     the    playing area.                 It was       e x t r e m e l y difficult         to     pull

persons       over     the       fence       because       they were        so tightly          packed,

p a r t i c u l a r l y at      the    front.        I remember          one man saying              to me as           I

pulled him over               the      top    " T h e r e ’s people        dead    in t h e r e ” .        It was

impossible          to see        into       the    crowd,       co m m u n i c a t e w ith anyone           or get             into

the    c o ngested are a              be h i n d the goal.           I had been         issued w ith a radio

and    earpiece        but       the    noise was          so    loud that        I couldn't          hear anything

over the        radio,        or be he a r d .          I cont i nu e d t o g et          p e o p 1e ou t by the

si d eways      route.           I have       no    concept       of time.         Numbers         were      still          being

pulled over           the       fence at the          front       of the      terrace         by Police          officers

s t a nding     on the wire.                 After a time           I n o t i c e d the       body of a man                 lying

on the      floor at            the    extreme       front       of the     terrace,          over    to the        right

hand side as one                 o b s erves       from the       pitch.        The    cong e s t i o n slowly

The    person was            heav i l y      built and          lying    parallel       to the        steps.            His

f ace was       blue an d h i s eyes we r e o pe n .                     i irnnie d iat e 1y f o rmed            t he

i mpression        that       he was         dead.      I gave       him m o u t h     to m outh          resus c i t a t i o n

w i.t h o u t s u c c e s s .     I I o o k e d t o rny r i g h t .         P o 1 i c e a n d f a n s a like were

pulling       down the wire               fencing       immediately           behind      the goal           in order             to

get    people      out.         As     I looked along             the wall        at   the     front       of    the

terrace       I was      shocked          to see      large       numbers      of bodies           lying        on top of

each other,           two and          three       deep.        It was     i m m e d iately     n oticeab le            that

none    of them was moving.                        They were all          at the foot           of the wire

fence.        I saw a n o t h e r         male,      a youn g e r       person     lying      on the         terrace a

few feet away.                I made my way to him.                      He a p p e a r e d   to     be    in his

thirties.          Again         his    face was       blue and eyes              open.        I a p p l i e d mouth to

m o u t h but there was                no doubt       that       he was     dead.       It was my op inion

that     these     people         had been dead for                some     considerable             time,       taken in
                                                                                                                                PAGE

               context wit h           the       incident.         The wire          fence at the front               had been

               partly        torn down.            Fans were           tearing       down the a d v e r t i s i n g        ho arding      to

               be used as stretc h e r s .                    I m o v e d further        along       the terrace           to the

               right and saw               bodies placed further up the terracing,                              a way from          the

               b o u n d a r y wall        at      the front.          One    of them     had a      coat    placed over            his

               head.         Together        with       anot h e r     officer        I attempted         r e s u s c i t a t i o n on a

               y oung       boy.      I     called for          oxygen       but none was          readily available.

               A fter a time we m a n a g e d                 to get him onto            the       pitch where        a Doctor was

               present.            O x y g e n was a p p l i e d       but the Doctor              p ronounced       him dead.         As

               I have        stated,       I have        no    concept        of time.         It a p p e a r e d    that    oxygen

               was a long           time arriving.               However,           1 arn certain that              the boy was

               dead     prior       to the arrival              of the Police.

               Wh i l s t    all    this was           going    on a great           deal   of abuse was             being    hurled

END OF REPORT

Sheffield.



Statement of facts:   F.A. Cup Semi-Final, Nottingham Forest v.
                      Liverpool, Saturday, 15 April 1989.



I am a Police Sergeant in the South Yorkshire Police at present

stationed at Ecclesfield Police Station, Sheffield.



At 10.00 a.m. on Saturday, 15 April 1989, I attended at the Hillsborough

Football Stadium vrtiere a supervisory briefing subsequently took place

in the North Stand in respect of the above named football match.     I

later briefed serial 12 (ten Police Constables) for which I was

responsible for their particular duties, viz:   Patrol the lower

concourse of the North Stand.

Attend the main doors leading from the North Stand to Penistone

Road.

Supervision of a number of turnstiles from within the ground to

Penistone Road.



 At phase three the instructions were to prevent fans from leaving

 the North Stand via. Penistone Road and direct them to leave by way

 of Leppings Lane.



 Fran the above time until the kick off time at 3.00 p.m. I kept

 within the boundary of the North Stand and did not prior to that

 time have occasion to observe the Leppings Lane end of the ground.

 Shortly after kick-off time, a matter of a few minutes, I found it

 necessary to move from the lower concourse of the North Stand, down
                                                                             fZcfK
                                                                  .2.

a ranp which separates the North Stand from the Spion Kop, and

which ultimately gives access to the football pitch.     Upon looking

out onto the playing area I saw that the match was in progress.

However, looking over to the Leppings Lane end of the ground it was

clear that some sort of incident was taking place.      A number of fans

were running on the playing area behind and at the side of the goal

mouth.     Almost irrmediately I noticed a senior Police Officer running

onto the playing area, trying to attract the attention of the

referee.     The match was halted almost irrmediately, and after some

confusion the players were escorted from the pitch.      My first

irtpression was that large scale fighting was taking place amongst

the Liverpool fans.     I irrmediately left the area of the North Stand

and ran across the playing area to the Leppings Lane end of the

ground.     When I reached that section of the ground it became

apparent that a public order incident of a different nature was

taking place.     The Leppings Lane Terrace, in the area behind the

goal mouth was extremely congested and panic had set in amongst the

crowd, particularly at the front where a large number were obviously

in distress. The crowd was so packed that it was impossible for the

persons at the front of the terrace, and behind the wire mesh, to

move.     A number of Police Officers were actually standing on the

top of the wire fencing, pulling fans over and onto the playing area

and perimeter track.     A number of fans were lying on the pitch

seriously injured.     Some of them were unconscious.   As I looked onto

the terrace from the pitch I realised that it was desperate to

remove as many fans as possible from the front of the terrace.          To

the right of the congested area was a narrow 'sterile' corridor.

The narrow section had a door at the front allowing access onto the

playing area.     This sterile area was separated from the right of the
                                                                    .3.

congested area by a metal fence.     I went into this area and began

to pull persons from the crowd into the sterile area and then direct

them through the door at the front and onto the playing area.         It

was extremely difficult to pull persons over the fence because they

were so tightly packed, particularly at the front.      I remember one

man saying to me as I pulled him over the top "There's people dead

in there."     It was impossible to see into the crowd, corrmunicate

with anyone or get into the congested area behind the goal.         I had

been issued with a radio and earpiece but the noise was so loud that

I couldn't hear anything over the radio, or be heard.      I continued

to get people out by the sideways route.      I have no concept of time.

Numbers were still being pulled over the fence at the front of the

terrace by Police Officers standing on the wire.      After a time I

noticed the body of a man lying on the floor at the extreme front of

the terrace, over to the right hand side as one observes from the

pitch.    The congestion slowly began to subside, although the feeling

was still one of panic.     I managed to jump over the dividing fence

and find my way to this man.     The person was heavily built and

lying parallel to the steps.     His face was blue and his eyes were

open.     I irrmediately formed the irtpression that he was dead.    I

gave him mouth to mouth resuscitation without success.       I looked to

my right.     Police and fans alike were pulling down the wire fencing

irrmediately behind the goal in order to get people out.     As I looked

along the wall at the front of the terrace I was shocked to see large

numbers of bodies lying on top of each other, two and three deep.

It was irrmediately noticeable that none of them was moving.        They

were all at the foot of the wire fence.      I saw another male, a

younger person lying on the terrace a few feet away.      I made my way

to him.     He appeared to be in his thirties.   Again his face was blue
and eyes open.     I applied mouth to mouth but there was no doubt that

he was dead.     It was my opinion that these people had been dead for

some considerable time, taken in context with the incident.       The wire

fence at the front had been partly t o m down.    Fans were tearing

down the advertising hoarding to be used as stretchers.        I moved

further along the terrace to the right and saw bodies placed further

up the terracing, away from the boundary wall at the front.       One of

them had a coat placed over his head.     Together with another officer

I attenpted resuscitation on a young boy.     I called for oxygen but

none was readily available.     After a time we managed to get him onto

the pitch where a Doctor was present.     Oxygen was applied but the

Doctor pronounced him dead.     As I have stated, I have no concept of

time.   It appeared that oxygen was a long time arriving.       However,

I am certain that the boy was dead prior to the arrival of the Police.



Whilst all this was going on a great deal of abuse was being hurled

at the Police from Liverpool fans, both on the terrace but in the

main from the front of the West Stand which overlooks the terrace.



I assisted with the removal of bodies from the front of the terracing

onto the pitch.     This was done quickly once access could be gained

through the wire fencing and sufficient numbers had been removed from

the terracing.     A large amount of personal property was littered

all over the terracing.     This was placed in plastic bags.



I had occasion to examine a metal barrier placed halfway up the

terracing behind the goal.     This had been broken at the base and lying

flat on the steps.    Whilst the paint was relatively new, the metal was

rusted and corroded the whole way through.     I remained at the Leppings
Lane end of the ground until such times as the whole situation was under

control, bodies removed to the Gymnasium, and property recovered.



I took no further part in proceedings.

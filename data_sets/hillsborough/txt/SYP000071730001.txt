these        gates wait i ng         to go thro ug h the turnstiles.                    We joined this

crowd to await               entry.       After a        few minu te s       these    gates we re o p e n e d and

the ground at              the    rear    of the Leppi ngs Ln terraces.                     I did not enter

via a t u rnstile and no one a sk ed                       me   for my ticket.              I -Waited for our

tunnel.         I could walk along                 until    I go v_J-o, the exit of the              tunnel        I

could see that               the game was a bo ut * to          start.        There was          then a surge

of     people       beh i n d me and        I was      forced out of the tunnel                  and to the

right        into

but     there was          then a      co nt in ua ll y b ui lding      crush behind me w hi ch forced

me down        the terrace           to very       close to the front           f e n c i n g.     I w ould say

I was about           five       feet away.            I had some    d i ff i cu l ty   in breathing            and

for    directions.               The       majority          headed          towards          the    North Stand.

I heard         f an s     shouting           '‘t h e y r ’e not           fighting".

Upon     arrival           at    the       t r a c k at        the    Leppings            Lane      e nd      I saw     that       t h ere

was    a number            of    spectators               on    the       playing         area and            police        officers

s t o o d at        the    fencing          were       pulling            people        over,           I also        saw    that

people         were       being       pulled         up    into       the      sta nd,            I immediately              went       to

the     fence        to    the    left        of     the       goal       and assisted              other        officers          in

getting         people          out    of     the      terracing.                 I together             with     other       officers

wet^e s h o u t i n g       directions               to    the       crowd        to    get       out    of    the     w a y as     I

ignore         these       directions              and s h ou te d a buse                 towards          us.        I lifted a

number         of    fans       over       the     f e n c i n g / s o me         of    these       fans, w e r e        slightly

injured and               some    more        seriously.

The    one s        that    were       slightly            injured            I carried            as    far a w a y        from    the

fencing         as    possible.               1 ensured              t ha t    these         fans       were     not     in a n y

distress.             B e f o r e returning                to       the    fen ce .

on    to a      c l ea r    area       in the         pitch and               stayed with               him    for     some      five

minutes.             He    was    very        distress              however,           didnot       appear        to    be    in a n y

danger.             A member          of    the     St     Johns          Ambulance           crew       came and           took    over.

I returned            to    the       fence.          I then          formed           part       of a     chain       of    police

officers            and    pulled          a number            of    dead* b o d i e s        out.         I wa s      in    the m i d d l e

CHARLES ALFRED BEAUMONT, PC 2118, ATTERCLIFFE, B GROUP


On Saturday 15 April 1989 I commenced duty at Attercliffe Police Station at
8.00 am.    I then travelled to West Bar Police Station in order to briefed at
9.00 am.    The briefing was given by Superintendent Bates and my duties for
that day were on Serial 13 under the supervision of Police Sergeant 840
Wright. The duties of Serial 13 were to commence at 10.00 am at the Midland
Station.    These duties were supervision of arriving Liverpool fans and escort
to Hillsborough Football Ground on the provided public service vehicle.


At 9.30 am that day I took up my position at the Midland Station and awaited
arrival of the first fans.    A number of trains were arriving throughout the
morning and those Liverpool fans who were on them were directed onto the
awaiting buses.    A number of fans who were arriving by train were very
quarrelsome wanting to go drinking in the city centre, it was noticed that
most of these fans had in fact already been drinking alcohol.    Those without
good reason for going into the city centre were directed on to the buses.


I continued this duty up until 1.15 pm that day when I bordered one of the
full buses in company with Police Constable 122 Dixon in order to escort them
to the ground.    I supervised the lower deck of the double decker bus whilst
Police Constable Dixon supervised the top deck.    I noted that the majority of
young men who bordered this bus had obviously been consuming alcohol.
However, they were well behaved with the exception of 2 youths who were on the
top deck.    These youths had been causing a nuisance on the top deck and had to
be spoken to.


I arrived at Hillsborough Football Ground at approximately 1.35 pm.     Upon
arrival the bus was met by a Sergeant and a number of Police Constables who
supervised the unloading of the supporters.    All the supporters were directed
across the road to the turnstiles.    I recall seme of the fans wishing to go
else where and remember the Police Sergeant telling them to go into the
turnstiles and then to do what they wanted.


Myself and Police Constable Dixon kept back the two youths who had been a
nuisance on the bus and advised them of their behaviour.    They were also then
directed to the turnstiles.
                                    - 2 -


Then, together with Police Constable Dixon I made my way to the Gym
under the North Stand to await the arrival of the rest of my Serial.
Eventually Police Sergeant Wright and the remainder of the Serial
arrived and we took refreshment whilst on standby.


At approximately 2.45 pm we were deployed by personal radio to assist on
Leppings Lane with crowd control.    We walked under the North Stand and
towards the turnstiles at Leppings Lane, whilst on route I was
approached by two members of the public who had just entered the ground.
One man said to me, "get those fucking gates open, its murder out there,
there's going to be people killed if you don't do something".    The other
one said "you better get out there your mates need help".
By this time I had lost sight of my Serial, I made my way to exit gate A
and approached two stewards.     I immediately noticed that the gates were
under immense pressure, people were banging on it.     I said to the
stewards "has anyone gone out of these gates".     They said "there's no
way anyone can get out, its crushed out there".


I then looked through the perspex window in the gate and saw a mass of
bodies pressing against the gate.     I then walked further round to gate b
where I saw Police Officers on the roof of the turnstiles pulling people
into the ground over the wall.     One of the officers on the roof was an
Inspector.     I saw that half my serial was at this point so I remained
there with them.     I could see that there was a tremendous crush at the
turnstiles and in fact officers were having to kick the turnstile back
so that it would click and allow the next person through.    A number of
the spectators caning through the turnstiles were apparently injured and
I went over to assist a number of people.     However, none were seriously
injured.     A number of the spectators caning through were asking for
directions to their part of the ground.     It was whilst directing seme of
the fans that I noticed that gate C was wide open.     People were just
walking through this gate at a steady pace.     I didnot see any stewards
near to this open gate.


I then returned to gate B and saw that there was just the Inspector on
the roof of the turnstiles.     I could still see through the perspex in
Gate B that there was still a crush outside this gate.
                                                   :                             f ^
                                    - 3 -


I then heard some one shout "get the gate open".       I thought it sounded
like a voice of authority.     I then saw Police Constable 1632 Smith with
other officers walk over toward Gate B.      they then spoke to the
stewards on the gate.     Gate B was then opened for approximately 30
seconds an initial burst of 50 - 100 people came through this gate.
After the initial burst these people sorted themselves out and walked in
an orderly fashion, some went to the programme hut and some asked for
directions.   The majority headed towards the North Stand.


A short time later, I made my way to Gate C and went outside where I met
up with Sergeant Wright.     All appeared to be reasonably calm outside
around this area.   A message was then received approximately 2 minutes
later that all officers were required on the perimeter track.         Together
with most of my Serial I went back into the ground through Gate C and
made my way onto the track whilst on the way round I heard fans shouting
"they're not fighting".


Upon arrival at the track at the Leppings Lane end I saw that there was
a number of spectators on the playing area and police officers stood at
the fencing were pulling people over.       I also saw that people were being
pulled up into the stand.     I immediately went to the fence to the left
of the goal and assisted other officers in getting people out of the
terracing.    I together with other officers were shouting directions to
the crowd to get out of the way as I could see bodies in a pile under
the wall bottom.    Fans seemed to ignore these directions and shouted
abuse towards us.    I lifted a number of fans over the fencing, seme of
these fans were slightly injured and seme more seriously.
The ones that were slightly injured I carried as far away frcm the
fencing as possible.    I ensured that these fans were not in any
distress. Before returning to the fence.


I then carried one man out who was close to collapse, I carried him on
to a clear area in the pitch and stayed with him for seme five minutes.
He was very distressed however, didnot appear to be in any danger.        A

member of the St Johns Ambulance crew came and took over.       I returned to
the fence.    I then formed part of a chain of police officers and pulled
a number of dead bodies out.     I was in themiddle of this chain and did
not actually set any bodies down on the pitch. They were all passed to
other officers.
                                    - 4 -


The only one I can give any description of was a man in his late
twenties who was grossly over weight.       I have no idea which officers the
bodies were handed to as everything was so hectic I did not have time to
pay attention.     Throughout the time that I was pulling the bodies out I
noticed a number were covered in vcmit and a strong smell of alcohol was
on the clothing.


Throughout the ordeal officers were continually having abuse shouted at
them, which was roost upsetting.    However, having said that, there were a
number of supporters who were absolutely magnificent and assisted us
greatly.

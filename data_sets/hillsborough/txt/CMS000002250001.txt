HILLSBOROUGH STADIUM DISASTER INQUIRY
We spoke on Friday about a further bill for costs from the
Hillsborough Steering Committee. Provision for this inquiry was
made in 1989/90 in subhead H6. The purpose of thd^s note is to
seek funds in this financial year or perhaps agreement for
payment from 1990/91 as an adjustment o£ throwback. I understand
the books for 1990/91 will not close tintil the end of June.
2. The original claim for costs, for which the Home Office has
responsibility for payment, submitted on 31 January 1990 was for
£252,184.21. This bill has been under negotiation between the
Treasury Solicitor's Department and Miss Steel, Solicitor
representing the Steering Committee, for some time. Following a
meeting between the two parties agreement has now been reached
on the outstanding costs.

3. The total costs of the bereaved and injured have been agreed
in the sum of £195,650.09 which includes Counsel's fees,
disbursements and VAT. Counsel's fees including VAT have been
paid and payments on account have already been made in the total
sum of £1 63,577.69. A balance of £32,072.40 remains outstanding.
4. As you know we have no provision in this financial year for
this expenditure, neither can we highlight any other areas within
Fire Department's budget nor Mr Faulkner's command as a whole
from which this sum could be found.
5. The total amount we are looking for is somewhat less than we
discussed ie £36,900. This is made up of £32.072.40 for
outstanding costs, £3,112.33 from Messrs Mace & Jones which is
for work subsequent to the final hearing (although this is still
to be agreed) and a possible £1,750 added to the costs if the
account is not settled within seven days.

                     j^irfrday 15th April    1989 <150489? my normal duties would have been

                     dutes on Nights,       but at about 4.30 pm (1630)    I contacted at home
                     el1.
           and attend Ecclesfield P Stn immediately to assist in a casualty
                     /v
           bureau as I am a casualty bureau trained officer.  I was already aware

           that there was a disater at the Hillsborough Football Ground and I had

           been expecting the call.

           I arrived at Ecclesfield P Stn at 6.10 pm (1810).                I was told

           initially to wait outside the Casuarfty Bureau, which was already in

           full swing.            I was then joineq/Dy other officers from about 6.30 pm

           (1830) o n w ar ds.

           Eventually three officers were requested to attend the temporary

           mortuary in the gymnasium at the ground to take Casual>y Bureau

           identification forms there,            so I together with WPC                      and
                                                                ..

                                                                         S3506

PC               went    in my vehicle to the ground with the r e l j m n t

form

On entering the g y m , this Jareing at about 7.20 pm/X l 9 g Q ? there were
                                                 f/
over 70 bodies in \the>^B. All the bodies w e w r already in body bags,

sipped up.    They were being photograpped and some property had already

been removed.    Each body had an j>fficer allocated to it.

PI CHARLES was in overall      cp^rge of the gym and the overal 1 impression

was that it was. all quij^e organised at that time, and it was quiet

I handed the forr\s V6 DI CHARLES he handed them out in numer i cal order

to a Sgt who was in charge of a number of men.

I then assisted officers in completing one forjj^xn respect of each

body.   We then became aware of the forms cxft self carbonating as they

are supposed to.     I helped one prJ^ba^onary constable       in particular

who was not quite sure what to do,        I don't know his name but I think

he came from Rotherham.

A some time later together w i t h ,WPC               I returned to Ecclesfield

with as many forms that had been completed and I photostated those,              I

left the originals      in the Casualty Bureau and returned with the copies

to DI CHARLES.

On returning to the gym some more bodies had started to arrive from

the Northern General Hospital.       ,Again I assisted the officers with

each body with regard to t c o m p l e t i o n   of the identification form.

At 10.30 pm (1Q3Q) I a^ain left with all the completed forms and

returned to the Casualty Bureau where I was engaged on duty there

until 6 am (0600)    the next morning,

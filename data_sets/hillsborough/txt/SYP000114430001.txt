                W ith     reference          to the snquir y headed         by Chief S u p e r i n t e n d e n t   Wain, I

                can answer          the      questions as follows:



                 I" reported for duty at R a w m a r s h Police S t a t i o n at 8.00 am on Saturday,

                 •15th April        1989,      at this    time,    I was    in full      Police     uniform.         I was

                 conveyed directly to H i l l s b o r o u g h Football                 Ground by force           coach,     to

                be briefed for               the days    duties.



                 I was     part     of Serial      56 under       the   leadership of PS 214 0 Taylor                 from C2

               "We were under             the direct      respons i b i l i t y   of   Inspector N E W E Y .



                F ol l o w i n g   the briefing         in the N o r t h S t a n d at the Football            Ground,       j.


                 was     deployed with the             rest   of my serial        i                                   an

                 industrial         estate      near    to the    bottom    of Herri.es Road.            At   11.15 am

                 that     date,     I took      up my    position to direct            the N o t t i n g h a m Forest,

                 contingent,          to suitable        parking     places a l l o c a t e d wilhin       the

                 industrial         estate.

                 The     football       fans    I saw were        conducting      themselves       in a good, natured

                 and     l i g h t hearted manner,        with the m a j o r i t y     of fans     parking       up eariy

and entered the           ground at the same             time.      On the a pp r o a c h        of 3.00       pm

the    roads around P e n istone Road,                Herries Road and Rawson Spring Road,

we re almost       deserted.        There w as t he odd            late arriver         to    the ground,

but the numbers           were     not so great as          to    cause any         problems.          Ihe next

stage of our duty weas               to attend C l a y w h e e l s Lane Traffic Office                    for

meal    and following         this,     we were       to be on standby duties                 outside         the

ground on the P e n i s t o n e Road end.

At about 3.05            pm that    date      I was   stood with the          rest of my serial                at    th


corner     of P e n i s t o n e Road and Herries Road               outside         the Charile Browns

shop.     We were a p p r o a c h e d      by a S u p e r i n t e n d e n t , who    had just       emerged

from the football             ground,      he   immedi a t e l y ordered us           into the         ground.

At this     time     I had no       idea of what was             happening,         I entered the

ground with the            rest    of the serial         together with PS             fAYi_0R and

Inspector N EWEY who were both                   in p o ssession         of Police         radios.       As    I

a pp r o a c h e d the    playing area from the entrance                   between the North Stand >

     d £3pi on Kop,       I saw the      players      leaving      the    pitch and a large              crowd

 f spectators            on the    pitch      round the Leppings Lane                end of the

ground.       My   immediate        thoughts were          that    there     had been a pitch

invasion by the Liverpool                  fans.      I then      ran across         the    pitch      to offer

my assistance,            there were a few Police Officers                    present        but not a

great     number.

As    I moved      closer     to the     goalmouth,        1 was still        under        uhe   impression

that    the Liverpool          fans     had     invaded the       pitch.       It was       then that         I

heard a shout            from a fan that          people were        dying     in    mere,       and    it was

at this      point       I realised      the full       horror     of what was         happening.             !-rom

only a couple            of feet away from the              perimeter      fence,      I could see

people were a l r e a d y dead,            others were         turning     blue and some were

having      diffi c u l t y   breathing.

I then with a group of other                     officers,       started to shout            to the

supporters         to move       back   but there was            no movement.         E v e r y t h i n g was       in

                                                                                                                        R37Q

               chaos,,    there was        no guidance           in what      to do .     S p ectators        in trying

               to escape       the    crush,       were    stepping       on bodies       to    lever       themselves       over

               the    perimeter       fence.        Police O f f icers were             starting       to    pull
    J
               s p e c:t a/ o r s o v e r the fence,- many of which were                    injured or dead,            as

               t h e sjS persons were         pulled over           I started       to drag the          bodies     from the

'       , ft   Fi/tch surround         onto      the     playing      service where         other      officers and

               medical       staff were       trying       to    resuscitate        the   injured.           This   task was

               made    all    the more      difficult           by the Liverpool          fans who          understartda.bly

               wanted their          own   relatives and friends a t tending                     to,     and tried to

               pull    us away from where we were                     dealing.

               1 stayed near to            the     perimeter        fence and       continued       to      carry bodies       to

               the    playing      surface,        where    by this       time     both Police Officers               and

               spectators alike were                carrying        bodies       on stretchers made            from

               advert i s i n g    hoardings.

               After what         seemed an age,           I swapped        places with another               officer as       I

               felt    physically e x hausted and                  I felt    I    could do no more.

               I then unde r the           i nstruct ion of a hi gh               ranking      officer       helped    in

               trying     to move      spectators          from the       playing surface           to the      sanctuary

               of the N orth Stand,              this     proved futile as spectators                    refused      to go.

               When    the terrace was             clear,       I tried u n s u c c e s s f u l l y to      rejoin my

               serial,       I then a t t a c h e d myself          to other 02 officers               to await       further

               instructions,          it was at          this    point    that we were         told to form a cordon

               at    the halfway       line and not to              let a n y b o d y   through to the S pion Kop

               end.

               At a p p r o x i m a t e l y 4.30    pm    I returned        to Rawson       Spring Roa d to           assist

               in the     removal      of the N o t t i n g h a m Forest          fans.        From there I returned

               to C l aywheels Lane,             then     back to R a w m a r s h Police Station.               I     booked

               off duty at 7.30            pm that        date.



               I noticed on atte n d a n c e at             the L e p p i n g s Lane      end of the ground,                that
                                                                                                           PAGE

al t hough        the spectators were            not drunk,           the m a j ority of fans           smelt         of

intoxicants.            Some      of the    supporters were             unaware     of what was

happening and were                shouting abuse at             the emergency services-                   I saw a

barrier          passed over       head by the        s pectators and then thrown onto an

I tried to            reason with spectators              but    this was       impossible        the     crowd

could not be reasoned with.

]'. did handle          bodies     on the    pitch s u r round and moved them to the

playing          surface,    these were          then tended          to by other         services.        1

cannot       give any d e s c r i p t i o n of the           bodies     I saw.



My feelings at             this    point were mixed,             I was angry that            no one

ap p e a r e d    in charge and that             everyone       seemed to be         left to their              own

devices,          I was also angry with the spectators who would                              not allow me

to do my job,            even at this        stage      I feel        I couldn't      have    done more,

yet at the time             I felt       useless      in that     situation,         but    I also feel

that     no one        could be     prepared for          it.     All    radios were         held by

su p e r visory        officers     but due to the            numbers     trying      to transmit          these

became       little more          than useless.           I also       feel   the use       of the tannoy

system       could have        been used to our              benefit.

I cannot          comment    on the work          of the stewards,            as    1 was    en g r o s s e d    in

my own work,            I. have    never wo r k e d a m atch at           the H i l l s bo r o u g h Ground,

so      I cannot       comment     on the workings            of such a large match,                but     I can

say that          1 have    been a spectator            at    previous        big games at

H i l l s b o r o u g h and that     I    have    never      known     trouble      before    even with

crowds       of the same          size as that         day,     and    I feel      that    some   external

ingredient            may have     caused this         disaster.

      With reference to the enquiry headed by Chief Superintendent WAIN,I can answer the

       questions as follows;

       1 . 1 reported for duty at Rawmarsh Poliwe Station at 8.00am on Saturday 15th April

          1989,at this time,I was in full Police uniform.I was conveyed directly to

          Hillsborough Football Ground by force coach,to be briefed for the days duties.

      2. I was part of serial   56   under the leadership of PS 21^0 TAYI0R from 02.We were

          under the dirext responsibility of Inspector NEWEST.

      3. Following the briefing in the North Stand at the Football Ground,I was deployed

         with the rest of my serial Rawson Spring Road,an industrial estate near to the

         bottom of Herries Road.At 11.15am that date,I took up my position to direct the

         Nottingham Forest contingent,to suitable parking places allocated within the
          industrial estate.

         The football fans I saw were conducting themselves in a good natured and

          lighthearted manner,with the majority of fans parking up early and entered the

         ground at the same time.On the approach of 3*00pm*the roads around Penistone Road,

          Herries Road and Rawson Spring Road,were almost deserted.There was the odd late

          late arriver to the ground,but the numbers were not so great $s to cause any

         problems.The next stage of our duty was to attend Claywheels Lane Traffic Office

          for meal and following this,we were to be on Standby duties outside the ground

         on the Penistone Road end.

          At about 3•05pm that date,I was stood with the rest of my serial at the corner

          of Penistone Road and Herries Road outside the Charlie Browns shop.We were

          approached by a Superintendent,who had just emerged from the football ground,

          he immediately ordered us into the ground.
          At this time I had no idea of what was happening,I entered the ground with the

          rest of my serial together with PS TAYLOR and INSPECTOR NEWEY who were both in

         possession of police radios.As I approached the playing area from the entrance

          between the North S and and the Spion Kop,I saw the players leaving the pitch

          and a large crowd of spectators on the pitch around the Leppings Lane end of the

          ground.My immediate thoughts were that there had been a pitch invasion by the

          Liverpool fans.I then ran across the pitch to offer my assistance,there was a

          few Police Officers present but not a great number.
          As I moved closer the goalmouth,I was still under the impression that the Liverpool

          fans had invaded the pitch,It was then that I heard a shout from a fan that people

          were dying in there,and it was at this point I realised the full horror of what

          was happening.From only a couple of feet away from the perimeter fence,I could see

          people were already dead,others were turning blue and some were having difficulty

          breathing.
          I then with a group of other officers,started to shout to the supporters to move

          back,but there was no movement.Everything was in chaos,there was no guidance in

      what to do.Spectators in trying to escape the crash,were stepping on bodies to lever

      themselves over the perimeter fence.Police officers were starting to pull spectators

      over the fence,many of which were injured or dead,as these persons were pulled over

      I started to drag   the bodies fro m the pitch surround onto the playing service

      were other officers and medical staff were trying to resuscitate the injured.This

      task was made all the more difficult by the Liverpool fans who understandably wanted

      there owa relatives and friends attending to,and tried to pull us away from where we

      were dealing.

      I stayed near to the perimeter fence and continued to carry bodies to the playing

      surface,where by this time both Police Officers and spectators alike were carrying

      bodies on stretchers made from advertising hoardings.

      After what seemed an age,I swapped places with another officer as I felt physically

      exhausted and I felt I could do no more.

      I then under the instruction of a high ranking officer helped in trying to move

      spectators from the playing surface to the sanctuary ofthe North Stand,this proved

      fmtile as spectators refused to go.

      When the terrace was clear,I tried unsuccesfully to rejoin my serial,I then attached

      myself to other C2 officers to await further instructions,it was at this point that

      we were told to form a cordon at the halfway line and not to let anybody through

      to the Spion Kop end.

      At approximately ^.3Qpm I returned to Rawson Spring Road to assist in the removal of

      the Nottingham Forest fans.From there,I returned to Claywheels Lane,then back to

      Rawmarsh Police Station.I booked off duty at 7»3Pp® that date.

 k,   I noticed on attendance at the Leppings Lane end of the ground,that although the

      spectators were not drunk,the majority of fans smelt of intoxicants.Some of the supportex

      were unaware of what was happening,and were shouting abuse at the emergency services

      I saw a barrier passed over head by the spectators and then thrown onto an ambulance.

 5.   I tried to reason with spectators,but this was impossible the crowd could not be

      reasoned with.

 6 . I did handle bodies on the pitch surround and moved them to the playing surface,these
      were then tended to by other services.I cannot give any description of the bodies    I

      saw.
 7.   My feelings at this point were mixed,I was angry that no one appeared in charge and

      that everyone seemed to be left to there own devices,I was also angry with the

      spectators who would not allow me to do ay job,even at this stage I feel I couldn’t

      have done more,yet at the time I felt useless in that situation,but I also feel that

      no one could be prepared for it.All radios were held by supervisory officers but due to
      the numbers trying td transmit these became little more than useless.I also feel the

      use of the tannoy system could have been used to our benefit.
 8.   I cannot comment o n the work of the stewards,as I was engrossed in my own work,I have

               never worked a match at the Hillsborough Ground,so I cannot comment on the

               workings of such a large m at c h tbut I can say that I have been a spectator at

               previous big games at Hillsborough and that I have never known trouble before

               even with crowds of the same size as that day, and I feel that some external

               ingredient may have caused this disaster.

    mentioned t      st Midland police interviews and I said
I would talk to'JPJR about it. We thought it was a good
idea that we submitted Kelly's statement to the police
rather than come down to London and spend two hours taking
him through his evidence.   I imagined he would only be
reading from his statement in any event.   The same applied
                      Agreed and said she would try that with
     olxce.   Would we be prepared to take a statement from
             Ion the same basis.  I confirmed we would.  She
had fixed up meetings with Graham Kelly at 3 pm on Monday to
talk about policy issues and' likewise at 11 am on Tuesday
and Wednesday.

FA/HILLSBORQUGH

    mentioned the West Midland oolice interviews and I said
I would talk to JPJR about it. We thought it was a good
idea that we submitted Kelly's statement to the police
rather than come down to London and spend two hours taking
him through his evidence.  I imagined he would only be
reading from his statement in any event.  The same applied
to Glen Kirton.      agreed and said she would try that with
the police.  Would we be prepared to take a statement from
Bobby Robson on the same basis.  I confirmed we would.  She
had fixed up meetings with Graham Kelly at 3 pm on Monday to
talk about policy issues and likewise at 11 am on Tuesday
and Wednesday.

           telephoned.  She had spoken to Chief Inspector
Burrows of the West Midland Police.    Despite her having said
that we had prepared statements they still wanted to come
down and interview Messrs Robson, Kelly and Kirton.     In
those circumstances we would not be sending statements in
advance.   I said that was a pain and would waste quite a lot
of time especially ds someone from Freshfields had to sit in
throughout.   She said they did want someone from Freshfields
there all the time on Tuesday.   I said I would discuss with
JPJR whether I should do that or whether           or she

I spoke to               Ifrom Herbert Smith. He wanted
documents. He understood we were going through them and
sorting them out.  I said we were sifting them for relevance
purring them in order.  Obviously ha was not entitled to any
privileged document/relating to insurance arrangements.   He
agreed that was entirely right. However he thought that all
other documents relevant to the issues raised for the
factual part of the inquiry and the policy part of the
inquiry would be relevant to the Commercial Union. Were we
talking about adequacy of disclosure? He said that as he
understood it no letters had been sent by the FA giving
notice of circumstances yet, but that if there was going to
be a public liability claim on the policy he obviously had
to make sure on behalf of his client that we were handling
things properly.   I said I entirely saw that and the FA were
instructing us to be as co-operative as possible^but as we
were up against various time pressurejI did not want to be
snagged with having to copy and get everything''okayed'by
Herbert Smith.   He said he was trying to make our lives as
easy as possible by getting into the case as quickly as he
could.  He said when we were running off copies of a new set
for our barristers could we run him off a copy*? He would
pay our reasonable copying charges.   I agreed to do this and
he would probably get a copy on Monday.     said that his
instructions were to attend at Sheffield sitting behind us
throughout the inquiry.   I said that surprised me as I was
not sure that he would be needed as there would be a daily
transcript.   He said those were his instructions.

I said I would phone him on Monday with regard to the
copying and I also noted the comments in his letter about
giving him witness statements before they were sent out to
third parties.  If he was not allowed to look at the
statements then it would be for the insurers to say they had
not been properly consulted.  I said I realised that but I
did not want to hold things up.  He said he was sure he
could deal with matters swiftly.

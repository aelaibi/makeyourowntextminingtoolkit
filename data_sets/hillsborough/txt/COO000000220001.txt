                     LORD JUSTICE TAYLOR'S FINAL REPORT
                           OF HIS INQUIRY INTO THE
                       HILLSBOROUGH STADIUM DISASTER


      With   permission,     Mr Speaker,     I should      like to make          a
      statement about the final report of Lord Justice Taylor's
      Inquiry into the tragedy at the Hillsborough stadium in
      Sheffield on 15 April 1989, which is published today.




      I am most grateful to Lord Justice Taylor for the Report,
      which (is a careful and thorough analysis ofj why we have
      had so many major tragedies at football grounds over the
      years and why we have had disorder and hooliganism.                       As
      the House familiarises        itself with the Report             it will
      become clear     it is addressed           as much   to the     football
      industry as it is to the Government.             Lord Justice Taylor
      explains     how in his     interim report       he concentrated        on
      overcrowding         because that    was       the    cause      of    the
      Hillsborough     disaster, but now he goes on to               talk of a
      game, the image of which has been much tarnished, and of
      a   blight    over    the   game     due     toold   grounds,         poor
      facilities, hooliganism,            excessive drinking          and poor
      1eadership.
                                       2.



Lord Justice Taylor does not spare                        those who    run the
industry.     He says indeed that the provision they make for
their customers is often not merely basic but squalid,
                                                                              \
and he says that squalid conditions can have an impact on
safetyfbulpthey also lead to lower standards of behaviour.
     Cm

Lord Justice Taylor says that the Football Association and
Football League have not seen it as any part of their duty
to   offer    guidance    to     clubs      on     safety matters       and    he
questions     whether      the        directors      of     many    clubs     are
genuinely      interested        in     the       welfare     of    their     own
supporters     or   their good          behaviour.          Players    too    are
criticised,     with     Lord Justice Taylor pointing out that
incitement from the pitch or bad behaviour by players,
which is not confined to soccer, has a major influence on
the crowd.     While he recognises that at some clubs changes
have been made towards realising a new concept of how
football     should be,     he says that the game only has a
future if the directors and the players can change their
own priorities         and give a leadership which                  is plainly
lacking at present.


He agrees with the Government that there must be a move
towards      all-seater     stadia          and    points     out     that (ih-e
                                            -fnjsection 11 of the

   E. A<■)                                                             'H t*^c° j
             Football Spectators Act.A The change will improve safety
             and   will    improve behaviour,            and we intend to bring            it
             about.   Lord Justice Taylor makes clear that the bulk of
             the   finances     for      ground    improvements       will have       to   be
             raised by the clubs themselves.               He mentions ways in which
             clubs' finances might be improved to help cover the cost
snew**-,     an(j canvasses         a    number    of     possibilities, including          a
             change   in      the       system     of     capital    allowances        which
             discourages expenditure on new stands but encourages what
             he describes as grotesque transfer fees.                    The Government
             will consider these suggestions.


             There are a whole series of detailed recommendations set
             out in Chapters 3, 4 and 5 on matters relating to
             spectator safety such as gates and gangways.                       Indeed, 43
             of the 76 recommendations appeared in the Interim Report.
             The Government accepts these proposals, some of which can
             be implemented immediately.                Some will need further work.
             For convenience I am placing in the Library of the House
             a schedule setting out the Government's response to the
             proposals set out in Chapters 3, 4 and 5.


             Hon Members will recall that section 13 of the Football
             Supporters     Act         provides    for     the     Football        Licensing
             Authority to supervise the safety responsibilities of local
         authorities in respect of designated football grounds.                                                We
          intend to implement that provision.                                           Lord Justice Taylor

         would like us to go further and extend £k£*Vemi t Qjf the
          Football          Licensing           Authority^ to                          cover      all    grounds
         designated under the 1975 Safety of Sports Grounds Act,
          and indeed all premises requiring safety certificates or
          licences under Parts III and IV of the Fire Safety and
          Safety of Places of Sport Act 1987.                                               This would require
          primary          legislation         and we will                           have     to consider Cthe
                     o>
         matter further^                There is, of course, also the possibility
          of a voluntary interim arrangement to cover other than
          football grounds, pending any legislation.


          Part III of the Report contains a number of proposals
          relating           to    crowd           control                 and          hooliganism.            It
          acknowledges            the    crucial                role       of         the     police    in   crowd
          control.           Lord Justice Taylor rightly reminds                                         us that
         without work by the police many sporting events would be
          chaotic and could not be permitted to take place.                                              He pays
          tribute to the police for their service which he says is
          often thankless.               I want to add my personal tribute to his
          and to thank the police for their invaluable efforts in
          maintaining order at sports events.
    IL -i..                                      5.


              The Report recognises the advances made in the last couple
              of years in the effectiveness of the policing of football,
oA cc.V'cA    particularly inside grounds, and to the major impact of
              closed circuit television on the hooligan problem.


              Lord Justice Taylor also recognises the great potential
              value of the police National Football Intelligence Unit in
              dealing    with   football-related        crime   and   with    hooligans
              travelling to matches abroad.


              As I have said. Lord Justice Taylor takes the view that
              better facilities and better treatment of fans will bring
              better behaviour.         Beyond that, the Report recommends the
              creation    of    three    new   specific    offences      to   apply    at
              designated sports grounds:            throwing a missile;        chanting
              obscene or racialist abuse;               and going onto the pitch
              without    reasonable       excuse:        and    it    also    asks    for
              consideration to be given to extending the courts' powers
              to impose attendance centre orders and for the use of
              electronic tagging in the case of offenders convicted of
              footbal 1-related offences.             I shall   look sar e-f ally and
              sympathetically      at Gthe— eerse— for — nmk-mg — these— e to tg e s j
              recommendations.
P l - o r d Justice Taylor then comes to the question of whether
  there should be a national membership scheme and he says
  that he has grave doubts about the feasibility of the sort
  of scheme envisaged in the Invitation to Tender issued by
  the consultants employed by the football authorities, and
  serious misgivings about the likely impact on safety.           In
  the   light   of   that,   he   says   he   cannot   support   the
  implementation of Part 1 of the Act.


  The Government have decided in the light of Lord Justice
  Taylor's advice not to proceed with the establishment of
  a Football Membership Authority.        Part 1 of the Act will
  remain on the Statute Book lest we have to return to the
  matter.   But the right course now is for us to follow the
  strategy proposed in the Report and give the industry and
  the clubs a final opportunity to put themselves in order.
  The public will not forgive them if they do not now act.

MD       OF   REPORT
JOHN PATRICK LINDLEY     D/SGT ?27 F2 CID ECCLESFIELD
Incident at Hillsborough     150^89


On duty at EPS and to Hillsborough ground for briefing about 10 am
Allocated gymnasium duties to deal with associated crime together with DC Hall TDC Stoker
and DC Blake (all F2) Inyo gymnasium set up corner for recieving complaints.
Tour of Leppings lane end together with D/lnsp Towell outside ground.
Assisted with ’pickpocket squad 1 at that end for short time.
Fans     constantly arriving and milling around.Several drinking from cans no evidence of
real drunkeness or aggravation.Mounted officers kept fans on the move together with foot
patrol.All fans directed to turnstiles by same. Several fans approached me asking for
spare tickets or the whereabouts of anybody selling the sajne.
Some fans entered    ground immediately on arrival others standing around in groups.
Still no evidence    of disorderliness.Officers coping quite well.
No time noted . Requested to return to gymnasium to take report of crime pickpocket.from Lines
bobby and friends. No prisoner
About 2.30 pm heard requests for assistance at Leppings Lane end due to large gathering and
approach of further fans. No apparent urgency.
                                   _        a
Collected meal from mobile canteen.^at down, eard reports of what sounded to be fighting.
Left meal went towards     eppings Lane end.^a • that match was not taking place and several fans
apparently invading the pitch from the Liverpool (-^eppings ^ane end).Went towards that end,
Saw PS Morton SCS HQ CID in uniform running from that end      and he shouted to me that people
were dying by the fences.He said he was going for bolt croppers. I went to the fencing and
saw several officers trying to tear the fences away with their hands.The fences appeared to be
welded on the inside making the r task difficult.They were unable to push them im^ards due to
the crowd throngs.I    thensaw several people pres    edagaisnt the fencing obviously being
crushed and to oone    side of the centre was a pile of bodies all blue faced white skinned
clothing disarrayed    apparently dead.^t looked as if they had been stacked neatly at first glance
resmblant of scenes    from the concentration camps   of WW2.I saw that some officers had managed
to open a gate in the fencing and were assisting people from the terrace.For a short time I
assisted in this and then realised that no one apperade to be in command and that everybody was

acting on instinct.I began to return to the gymnasium and spoke en route to DC Hall and Dc
Blaje.    further informed D/Supt McKay of my suspicions that at least twenty people were dead
En route I passed    several person lying ar&und the ground pitch some receiving attention forom
officers and fans    alike.Some again apparently dead.It was my intention to inform someone   that
mortuary facilities would be required and again on route I spoke to Supt Chapman.A saw
a body of officers form a }.ine across the le ngth of the pithh from the K0p to Leppings lane
due to some aggravation coming from the stands.On arrival at the gym I spoke to DI Towell of whs
I had seen and very shortly after Cl Beall came into the gym and ordered it cleard.Bodies
started to arrive together with injured.AU being carried on stretchers,bill boards or similar
by both Police officers and fans.Assisted in gym with the direction of bodies and injured,
1) to the area closest the entrance and the 2$) to the adjacent area where they were tended by
St Johns staff initially.Assistance with the laying out of bodies together with DS Smith
DC Lindsay and others 0 know but can't remember
                                                                              t n t
Some of the bodies were accompqnied by friends or relatives and understandably were
both distraught and aggresive to police officers present and assisting.
A some time I was handed a list of potential witnesses by PC 300 Hays.I told MR Addis
of this and he instructed me to take a team to HRPS and give thes to CInsp Agar
who was setting up an incident room.
I took DCs Hall and Stoker with me and then began to take reports of missing paersons
with those officers.We were then redirected to Hillsborough were we continued toassist
in the identifaction of the deceased by relatives / friends and obtain statements from
the same   until approx 5 am-^Still some bodies unidentified but assisted in the
preparation of these for despatch to the public mortuary.
To EPS 6 am off duty.
IMPRESSIONS
Initial confusion all around with officers inc myself frustrated by their own
in ability to assist further due to restricted access.
Some senior officers complete lack of information available to them immediately
Other senior officers taking some sort of   oommand of their paryicualr sector.
IP
 ear of trouble between the surviving fans not aware of thesevere nature of the incident
The ultimate organisation of things ©nee the initial shock had worn away.
The irreplceable and commendable assistance given by Socila workers,shopkeepers
the clergy Fife and Ambulance services in whatever area I found myself from time to time
working.

The enormity of the whole incident and the symathy shown my various parties towards
officers and relatives and firned alike.
The only times I seem able to recall are around 3.10pm the start d>f it all
9 pm when I rang my wife to inform her I was OK and 6 am when I finished.
I have worked this ground before on several occasions both as Uniform sergeant and as
D/Sgt I have &n faatlaz both capacities worked the Leppings Lane end.Crowds have always bui
up towards Kicg off but never has any like incident occurred or even close to it.

sounded       to       be     fighting.                  Left          meal    went          towards              Leppings             Lane       e nd .

Saw    that    match              was        not    taking             place       and       several              fans      apparently

invading           the       pitch           from       the      Liverpool               (Leppings                Lane       end).          Went

towards       that           end.            Saw    PS       Morton,          SCS       HQ    CID,           in    uniform             running         from

that    end        and       he    shouted              to    me       that        people          were       dying          by    the       fences.

He    said    he       was        going           for       bolt       croppers.                  I went          to   the        fencing          and

saw    several              officers              trying          to    tear        the       fences          away          with       their

hands.        The           fences           appeared             to    be    welded              on    the       inside          making          their

task    difficulty.                      They          were       unable           to    push          them       inwards          due       to     the

crowd    throngs.                  I then              saw       several           people          pressed             against          the       fencing

obviously              being       crushed              and       to    one        side       of       the    centre             was    a    pile      of

bodies       all        blue       faced           white          skinned           clothing                disarrayed             apparently

dead.         It       looked           as    if       they       had    been           stacked             neatly          at    first        glance

resemblant              of       scenes           from       the       concentration                    camps          of    WW2.           I saw      that

some    officers                 had     managed             to    open        a    gate          in    the       fencing          and       were

assisting              people           from       the       terrace.               For       a    short          time       I assisted               in

this    and        then          realised              that       no    one        appeared             to    be       in    command          and          that

everybody              was       acting           on    instinct.                  I began             to    return          to    the       gymnasium

and    spoke           en    route           to    DC       Hall       and     DC       Blake.              Further          informed             Det.

Supt.    McKay              of    my     suspicions                that        at       least          twenty          people          were       dead.

En    route        I    passed           several             persons           lying          around          the       ground          pitch         some

receiving              attention              from          officers           and       fans          alike.           Some       again

apparently              dead.            It       was       my     intention             to       inform          someone          that        mortuary

facilities              would           be    required             and        again       en       route          I spoke          to       Supt.

Chapman.               I saw        a    body          of    officers              form       a    line       across             the    length             of

the    pitch           from       the        Kop       to    Leppings              Lane       due       to    some          aggravation

coming        from          the     stands.                 On    arrival           at    the          gym    I spoke             to    DI     Towell

of    what     I had             seen        and       very       shortly           after          Cl       Beal       came       into        the     gym

and    ordered              it    cleared.                  Bodies        started             to       arrive          together             with
injured.     All being carried on stretchers, bill boards or similar by

both Police Officers and fans.     Assisted in gym with the direction of

bodies and injured.

1.      to the area closest the entrance and

2.      to the adjacent area where they were tended by St. Johns staff

        initially.

Assistance with the laying out of bodies together with DS Smith,

DC Lindsay and others I know but can't remember.

Some of the bodies were accompanied by friends or relatives and

understandably were both distraught and aggressive to Police Officers

present and assisting.

At some time I was handed a list of potential witnesses by PC 300

Hays.     I told Mr. Addis of this and he instructed me to take a team

to HRPS and give these to C/Insp. Agar who was setting up an incident

room.

I took DCs Hall and Stoker with me and then began to take reports of

missing persons with those officers.     We were then redirected to

Hillsborough where we continued to assist in the identification of

the deceased by relatives/friends and obtain statements from the same

until approximately 5am. (0500).     Still some bodies unidentified but

assisted in the preparation of these for despatch to the public

mortuary.

To EPS 6am (0600) off duty.

IMPRESSION

Fear of trouble between the surviving fans not aware of the severe

nature of the incident.

The ultimate organisation of things once the initial shock had worn

away.

The irreplaceable and commendable assistance given by Social Workers,

shopkeepers, the clergy, Fire and Ambulance Services in whatever area

I found myself from time to time working.

The enormity of the whole incident and    the sympathy shown by various

parties towards officers and relatives    and friend alike.

The only times I seem able to recall are around 3.10pm (1510) the

start of it all, 9pm (0900) when I rang my wife to inform her I was

OK and 6am (0600) when I finished.

I have worked this ground before on several occasions both as uniform

sergeant and as Det. Sergeant.   I have   in both capacities worked   the

Leppings Lane end.   Crowds have always   built up towards kick off   but

never has any like incident occurred or even close to it.

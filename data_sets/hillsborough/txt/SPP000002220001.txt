      Dear Stefan,

           This is just to let you know that somebody involved in
     your Inquest rang up this office a week or so ago and asked
     what I had done about warning witnesses that they might
     incriminate themselves.  I did not speak to this person, but I
     got Johnnie to send him the transcripts of what I had said on
     the subject at my Inquest.     I just thought that you should
     know.

                                   Yours sincerely,




                                   R .H .B . Sturt

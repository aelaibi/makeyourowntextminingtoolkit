15th April 1989        Hillsborough Stadium Disaster

The following are my recollections of the above date
" I was in the room I use as an office at home when my wife came to inform
me of 'trouble' shown on television at the foot-ball match being played at
Sheffield Wednesdays' Football ground and switched on and moved a
television set to enable me to watch the scenes.

It became compulsive viewing and I virtually stopped work on my word
      sor .

It became obvious after several telephone interruptions by reporters to me
I should leave home and find out what was happening, My wife informed me
that staff were being called into Hospitals.

I left home I am not aware at what time and went to the Royal Hallamshire
Hospital parked in Glossop Road and went into the hospital spoke with a
Miss          [and inquired if they were OK she implied they were it was
very busy and I left just as a physician some one that I did not know
offered to help and was instructed to see if any patients could be sent
home.

From there I decided to visit Hammerton Road Police Station which I
considered would be used by the Police, When I arrived near Hammerton Road
the police were assisting traffic ,a double deck coach from Liverpool was
parked outside Hillsborough Barracks opposite Hillsborough Boys Club on
Langsett Road ,

I went in to the Boys Club which was crowded with people including police
officers who were speaking to people present whom I deduced were from
Liverpool , I inquired of a police who was in charge , and he pointed to a
clergy man I said Hello to a police officer who recognised me and left and
went to Hammerton Road police station which was very busy and after
introducing myself to a police constable decided to move off.

The next place to visit was the Sheffield Wednesday Football Ground ,1
parked in Leppings Lane and went toward the main entrance produced my House
of Commons pass and requested to see the Chairman of Sheffield Wednesday
Football Club. After a while the person on the door informed me that he had
gone home and that admission to the club was not possible,

Leaving the ground I saw a Radio Sheffield mobile transmitter and was
invited by David Holmes a political reporter if I would care to do an
interview which   I did, Robert Jackson Radio Sheffields sports   reporter then
spoke with me .   They informed me that The Hon. Colin Moynihan   MPThe
Minister for Sport was flying to Sheffield but did not know how or where he
would land.

Having a mobile telephone I tried to obtain the ministers mobile telephone
number whilst still at the ground the mobile telephone number      ofthe
Minister from a   colleague David Evans MP but he did not have it.

Sheet 2 Irvine Patnick OBE MP,

I spoke with my Private Secretary Miss Daphne Hickson at her home in London
by mobile telephone .1 informed of a paper I had left in a file on her desk
with the ministers mobile phone number and inquired how I could obtain this
information from the file .She stated that no staff would be on duty to do
that but offered to go to her office and then telephone me back with the
phone number. She did just that and informed she had spoken to the duty
officer at the D. of E. The minister was leaving Biggin Hill at 9.00 pm was
in his car and I may just catch him. The time was then about 8. 30pm. I went
on to the S. Y Police H. Q. left my car on a double yellow line whilst I went
in^fc ask if I may see the Chief Constable I had to show my identity to the
o f ^ ^ r on duty whom I later discovered had answered a public call for off
duty police officers to report for duty he gave me a visitors pass.I
inquired where to park and was informed the Police car park was full and so
went to park my car elsewhere. I tried to telephone the Minister but was
unsuccessful, I then walked back to HQ. and was informed that the Chief
Constable was tied up giving TV interviews one crew was with him and
another waiting.

I again telephoned the minister who answered I explained the situation
looked grim offered him and his press officer accommodation if they were
staying and inquired of the place the helicopter they were to travel to
Sheffield by would be landing .He did not know but requested I should meet
him and the police would know his place of landing .

Radio Hallam rang me for an interview I took a note of the number and
stated I would call up afterwards.

The PC on duty rang the Chief Constables st^ff officer and then informed me
that the Deputy Chief Constable would be coming to see me in reception .The
Deputy Chief Constable Peter Hayes came to see me and I inquired where the
minister was to land .he was unaware of the visit but thought other
Ministers were probably visiting tomorrow (Sunday morning). He checked out
if the Minister of Sport was visiting Saturday confirmed this and would be
landing at the Niagara Ground. I inquired how long the flying time was- we
discussed this -and I concluded an hour and a quarter plus.

I thanked him handed back my visitors pass and left the building I
telephoned Radio Hallam agreed to be interviewed and then walked up to the
station and gave the interview .Jim Greensmith the head of news at the
station then inquired if the minister was visiting which I confirmed he
asked where he would be landing which I declined to give but after further
inquiry indicated it could be on the football ground side of the city. He
informed me the Prime Minister and the Home Secretary were to visit the
next day.

I left Radio Hallam and went to Niagara Ground and arrived at the SY Police
Transport dept, and wearing casual clothes was challenged by a police
officer I my produced my identity and requested information on the
helicopters landing site he directions which were the sports ground just at
the rear of the building. I then went by car to the ground and parked.

   It must have been then arounda9.30 pm, , some while later police cars
   arrived and moved on to the sjliPf^^j^ld and manoeuvred into position made
   a cross with on the ground with headlights and set the blue lights going .

   I locked my car and moved towards the senior police officers who were
   gathering. A Chief Superintendent David Duckworth whom I knew from my years
   as a senior member of South Yorkshire County Council when he had a lower
   ran^asked if I would go and speak with some of the officers that had been
   o n ^ H t y at the stadium ,he stated they were down in the dumps .This I
   readily agreed to .Someone who I think was a senior officer came toward the
   Chief Superintendent and attempted to console each other.

   I_^agved into the building there were many officers I noted a sergeant and a
   superintendents' crown on jackets amongst those present they were sitting
   around in groups they were wearing police sweaters it was very quiet and my
   reception I would describe as 'frosty1.
   I moved away from them and was greeted by a Sergeant not on duty in mufti
   who was on sick leave I had met during my South Yorkshire Council days. We
   spoke I inquired if he was better when an officer detached himself from a
   sitting around a nearby table and said words to the effect I quote 'D id I
   want to know t h e t r u t h ' I i n d i c a t e d t h a t I d i d and t h e f o l l o w i n g i s my

   I was advised by senior officers to take what had been said ’with a pinch
It of salt ".The lights of the helicopter indicated its arrival and I left to
   greet the minister and introduce him to the Senior police officers present,
   I informed the minister of what I had heard.
   On Monday the press were telephoning me with 1stories' they had heard and
   on Tuesday i8th April the media were on to the story o f looting, violence
   and drink and could I confirm this. Some calls were taken by my secretary
   andHnot returned by me .Despite the fact on those two days I did not speak
   to some newspapers and yet some took and printed a garbled tale. On the 19th
   of April a Graham Boon of Whites News Agency asked if I could confirm the
   police had found dead bodies outsided the ground I could not and asked why
   after a telephone conversation yesterday with a colleague Peter Moxon some
   comments had beeen attributed to me the day before which I had not made. He
   apologised and informed me it had been garbled by others that had used it.
   That same day a reporter from the Sheffield Star a Jane? Gott asked if I
   had heard a police horse was badly injured with over 100 cigarette burns on
  •it.   T i n f nrmorl   her   T r ntilH   nnf

           I am the chief fgotball writer for the Daily Mirror and I have been

           with the Daily Mirror for almost six years,                   Prior to then I worked

           with other newspapers both national and local.                    I have been a

           journalist for 19 years and with the exception of the first six months

           of my career,           I have always specialised     in football writing.         I have

           also written fourteen assorted books on football.                    Due to my

           occupation I have on numerous occasions visited all the major football

           clubs         in this country, and    indeed abroad both Europe and worldwide,

           such as Mexico and America.

           In addition to writing about the actual               game of football     I have

           observed crowd behaviour            including   riot situations both abroad and at

           home.         I have^also been a kee\     observer of police methods        in relation

           to football          games UtSlh home and abroad.          I have witnessed riot

             Daily Telegraph who drove us to the ground,

             Having arrived in Sheffield with the ground visible                                                                                                                                                                                    in front of us, we

             asked a Police Officer on duty where the official                                                                                                                                                                                    press car park was.

             This officer stated he did not know and there were other officers at

             this    location who also did not know.                                                                                                                                           I thought to myself that                                        it was

             quite amusing that police officers on duty at the ground did not know

             the geography of the groumL.                                                                                                        This                         is not an uncommon problem when

             visiting grounds.                                                       In ret r o s p e c t I believe this                                                                                                                     is a key area in

             find our parking area within the stadium grounds at the rear of the

             South Stand.                                We eventually entered the ground shortly before 2 pm.

             Having entered the ground we went as a group to the main entrance.                                                                                                                                                                                         I

             believe one of our group had to collect his                                                                                                                                                                          press pass.            I had mine,

             in fact     I also had a press overflow ticket.                                                                                                                                                                       In fact I was asked if I

             had a spare ticket by a group of youths near to the main entrance and

             I must admit                            I was tempted to give                                                                                                    it away.                                             I did not as           it would

             have meant the fan sitting                                                                                           in the press area.                                                                                   We then all went to the

             press    room.

                                                                                                    S1539

          From the press room I went to the press box and took up my seat at

          about S . 45 pm.       <1445)The atmosphere was as                I     expected,   a massive

          turnout of both sets of              fans, and in particular the Liverpool fans.                  I

          was aware that the West              Stand was heaving with Liverpool               fans who were

          swaying which is exactly what               I expected to see and I thought

          nothing of this at that stage.

          The teams came out and kick off was to schedule.                           Theha vi rtual ly after

          the kick off and indeed to mark tHe kick off there was a? surge by the

          Liverpool fans on the Leppingsxj^n terVaces behind the goal and at this

          point    I became aware there was trcSv^b 1e at that e n d .                  Also within a

          minute    it was clear that people at that end were in trouble and I

          noticed one guy was already over the fence and in distress.                            In fact,

          I nudged                      of the Mail on Sunday who was sat next to me

          and I said to him,         "There     is trouble up at that end."               I was trying

          to concentrate on the play but I c o u l d n ’t.                  I was totally

          distracted by the situation in the West Stand.

          During the next couple of minutes                it was    crystal        clear that people

          were in distress and escaping over the fence.    Even at this early
                                       CyV~                                   fed
          stage I saw pe^)pie receiving treatment. N^ore and more people were
                                                       --------------------------
          coming over the -na^jce and looked as if they needed help.

          I had with me a note book             in which to record the events of the game.

          However,    the o n l y n o t e   I made in r e l a t i o n X o       the game was that

          Houghton    corner, B e a H s 1ey volley over S u t t o n / N ^ t r u ck bar.         It was
FOCJTftAvL.
        "xalso    at this point that         I ^served      another massive surge at the West

          S        end,   this   looked particularly bad to me as people were trying to

          get out as it occurred.
                                                                                   MlllO
              can then say that at 3.06           <1506) X ^ a d e a note that policeman came

                       ------
          unconscious on pitch.  It was               clearly obvious to me that this was not

          a riot situation but a genuine case of fans being                          in peril on the
                                                                                      PAGE            4
                                                                                      SI 539

terraces.         I make this   point bacause althoughNit was obvious to me in
                                                        ^ -------------------
the press box that this was the case's^ was not obvious to the police

on the touchlirte who were           clearly treating this as a pitch invasion.

My next note is that the referee               led the players to the dressing           room.

Two fans mouth to mouth.             Several   fans on pitch in serious state.                    1

also noted that some were escaping by climbing up to higher terrace.

My next note is that police are now fighting to get fans free from the

crush and I put in bracl^s^ts Hyse 1.       ^
                                        c~n                 I   .


I made a note at 3.16 (1516$Vthat an ambulance came onto the pitch and
                            ^                           '
then drove around the perimeter when clearly it should have gone

straight across the pitch to the injured.                   The time that this

ambulance took to inch its way through the crowd was a nonsense.                              I

then made a note of an incident I found particularly disturbing when a
OVT"   PO\-(Cj£L A T
police officer who had gone tS^that end tried to put a fan back over

the fence.         He was clearly unaware of what was happening and a clear

indication that the police were not co-ordinated                       in their operations

or sadly lacking        in communication.

I made a note at 3.18\(1518) that police reinforcements arrived,                         this
                 —■                    "                  ""
being some twelve\mrh^tes after the game had stopped and an

extraordinary 1engthNjf t i m e .         At 3.20    <1520)         I have a note of another

ambulance-arriving but staying            in the corner of the ground.              I also

have a note of a policeman pulling a fan off the crossbar of the goal.

The fan clearly wanted to take the net down which was eventually done.

My note book has other notes            in it, some of which are timed                  31-

produce this note book as Ref No HH1,               Ex No       (         ).   My notes are

timed up to about 4.20 pm (1620) and I highlight                       certain incidents

-such as an ambulance e ventually^dr iv i ng across                 pitch at 3.40 pm.

(1 5 4 0 ) \ I   also noted the first     public announcement was by Kenny

Dalglish,        3vS7 pm.   (1557)    This was Yhot an informative announcement

however.         Also the crowd were eventua            >ld at 4.17 (1617)          that the

                                  n"
                      As art experienced sports writer as previously described I have a

                      number of observations            regarding the tragedy which I hope will    be of

                      benefit to the enquiry.

                      I would like to start with my comments             regarding the football

                      authorities but I must state that I am not holding anyone more

                      responsible than another,            it is just a convenient starting point.

                      1) 1)          The whole of football      has abdicated its responsibility for

L— lfSftC.            the safety, the convenience,         the facilities and the well being of          its
 "TO                  paying   customers.       There    is a distinct   lack of leadership in

                      formulating any policy for the benefit of the ordinary fan.                 Instead a
        'f il o   N

                      squabble over everything and anything that effects them and their

fcOTBAUl^             dubs    such    as the distribution of TV money,         the voting structure,     the

                      allocation      of cup final       tickets to County F A ’s instead of the game of

                      football.       They should have minimum criteria for major football

G £(7TC f$£S stadiums             in respect of safety and well being of the spectator and that

                      minimum criteria should go far beyond the              present Government safety

                      legislation.       It should be f o o t b a l l ’s policy to improve facilities

                      that makes the average fan feel            like a human being as if he was going

                      to the theatre,      cinema or dogs,      instead of being treated liked

                      a caged animal.

                         2)          The Football Authorities have abdicaqted their

                      responsibility in the policing of major soccer matches.                It is the

                      police not the clubs who decide on strength of numbers,               strategies,

                      treatment      of fans,    etc,    paid for by the football   club.   It should    be

                      the clubs      responsibility and therefore the League and F A ’s

                      responsibility rather than any suspicion that the number of policemen

                      inside grounds should be dictated by cost rather than necessity.

                         3)          Liverpool    football club protested to the FA that after their

                      experiences of the previous           cup semi final   they should not have been
                                                                                               PAGE      6
                                                                                               S 1539

      *   allocated the Leppings Lrt end.            The FA hid behind their insistence

          that      it is the police that decide all aspects of security and

          po 1 i c i ng .

          2)   1)           The police have failed to have a nationwide uniform policing

          strategy for crowd control            particularly in the major matches.

               2)           A whole series of errors were       made by the police   in respect

          of this match.          I suspect that officers       outside the ground did not

          f,ave detailed knowledge of the geography of the              stadium and delays may

 _   ,    have occurred if the police were unable               to give the fans direction          as
CoKN(4 rB
          to where to park for example.

               3)       There was a failure to advance         filter fans without tickets,

               4)       There was a clear breakdown in         communications from

          the events I witnessed),           not only in relation to irtsi.de the ground and

          outside the ground but also to ensure there were officers to direct

          fans when the door was opened for instance blocking off the tunnel.

          Again failure of communication to delay the kick-off.

               5)       Total failure to recognise thsKdifferertce between a riot

          situation and a genuine emergency.          n.
                                         C/VT   G O MM SS    A T  G ttC o v a J-D
             6)     Failure to publicly announce the nature of the situation

          which      would have reduced a lot of problems caused by            lack of

          i.nformat ion.

               7)           There appears    to be an unwritten policing      policy that      if

          there      is trouble outside then let the fans in.          This    seems an easy

          option to take and clearly had disastrous              consequences on this

          occasion.          It also encourages fans to turn up without tickets.

          3)                Ticket touting    is an abhorant   practice, more significantly

          it encourages fans to turn up without tickets hoping to get                    it.

          There should be Court         legislation to ban this      practice within a five

          mile radius of any football            ground.   It is also the F A ’s

          responsibility to clamp down on the sources of such tickets.
                                                                              PAGE     7
                                                                              SI 539

      •      2)        If we are concerned as we clearly are with the congestion of

          fans    building up outside the grounds   in close proximity to kick off

          time then for heavens sake    let's once and for all abandon the idea of

          the ID card.

          The points that I have made are both criticisms of the events at

          Hillsborough and items that need to be addressed to prevent such a

          tragedy again.

          Lastly a point I would like to add is the significant      lack of medical

          facilities at such a major match which should be the responsibility of

          the FA.

is f ully e qu ip pe d to            cope wit h major            incidents.



A F irst Ai d Kit           is kept        in the       cab of the vehicle.              On the a p p l ia nc e

there are         three     lockers        on the       nearside an d offside            of the vehicle and

a lso    one at the back.               All     of the equipment              kept on the vehicles            is

kept     in exactly the same                position on each a p p l ia nc e             in order      that    the

own vehicle           or not.



In the first           locker      nearest        the      cab on the nearside           is housed all         the

cutting      equi                    i st i ng of the following.                 A sengar       saw,   a zip

The     rest of the         lockers        on the nearside             house    the hose       reels and      pipes.



O n the o ffside          of the      vehicle         the     locker    nearest       to cab houses      the

The    other      o ffside    lockers also        just house         general      equipment.

On S a t u r d a y   15th April         1989   (150489)   we    came on duty at 085 8 hours

(0858)         the w a tc h officers       on duty on the day were as                I have m e n t i o n e d

previously.



At about 3 . 1 0 p m       (1510)       the audi bl e warn in g a larm sounded              in the Fire

S t a t i o n to tell me         that    the t eleprinter was working               sending    us a job.

I was      d ownstairs       in the      building a l re ad y       so   I went    to the t el ep rinter

room to read the message.



I s t a rt ed to read the message;                it said something            to the effect         that

there was a ma.jor incident at H i l l s b o r o u g h Football                     G ro u n d a nd that

a c k n o w \ ^ g e m e * £ ^ bitt-fctfrf on the machine    to tell      our   control     room we had

r e ce iv ed the message.



I went       out to the a p p l i a n c e and all        of the officers           boarded the

appl ia nc e.       Fireman                was the driver,         S t a t i o n Officer S W A I N was      in

the front arid the other                 fire me n and myself were           in the back.



We drove towards H i l l s b o r o u g h via H i l l s b o r o u g h       town    centre w it h       sirens

not    have    too m any     problems       on route.



As far as          I am a ware     there were      no further        updates      on the s i t u a t i o n at

Hillsborough           Football         Ground.    S t a ti on Officer S W AI N       i nstructed the

crew to get the           cutting        gear off the a p p l ia nc e and also           the

r e s u s c i t a t i o n e qu ipment    on arrival     at the     ground.



We a p p r o a c h e d the L ep pi ng s La jie                the ground from M i d d l e w o o d Road

t raffic      lights.      I d o n ’t know how the           inform at io n was o bt a i n e d to go

to that       end of the ground.             As we a p p r o a c h e d   the entrance.          I saw that

there was a large amount                  of football      s upporters      outside      the entrance

m i l l in g around.       T here were also some             police officers milling

around,       but    I c a n ’t put a number on either              of these.         It was about

3 . 2 0 pm   (1520)    at this      time.



The a p p l i an c e was     dri ve n to the gates and was                parked on the         left as

you    look at the ground.                I have ma rk ed the        position the a pp l i a n c e

               We were     the     r st ySlppl iA x \ c / to arrive at the ground                I knew that      there

               i n f or m at io n was    on the telex w he n we           received     it.



               The a p p l i an ce was       brought   to halt and all           the officers a li g h t e d from

               the vehicle.



               S t a t i o n Officer S W A I N went        to find somebody to find out where we were

               required.



               I saw that        there was an                   c &( w i t h its doors open along the

               p athway w h ic h       runs to the\^^jiYt of the turnstiles.                     They may have        been

               more   than one         but   I'm not sure.           An am bu la nc e w o ma n   came up to

               S t a t i o n Of ficer S W AI N and a sk ed him           if we had a resuscitator.               He

               in st r uc t ed me to get        the e quipment and go and help the                  lady.       Whilst

               he was     talking       to the a m b u l a n c e woman he had m a n a g e d to find a police

               inspector.         He a sk ed him what was             going    on and where we were

               required.         As    I was w a l ki ng    off towards        the a m b u la nc e w it h the

               ambulancewoman           I heard him say          "Kid to be quite         honest    I don't      think

               yo u' re   needed'.



^          „   I walked      towards

               I could see that he wasn't                  hr eat,            When   I looked at him closer and

               I saw that his a i r w a y vias slocked                               and she      couldn't      get

get      out    in order      that   I could get the          respirator         in the vehicle.

left      the ambulance.



I w al k e d     back     to the a p p l i a n c e w hi ch was     only about 30 feet a w a y .              I

wasn't         stopped at all        by a n y b o d y needing assistance.



When      I a r r iv ed back      there    the S t a t i o n Officer and other             o ff icers were

still      hanging        round w it h the equipment.



I believe         that     some   other a pp li a n c e s    had a r r i v e d   by that    time    but    I'm

not      sure.



W he n    I arrived        back S t a t i o n Officer       told me      to go through onto          the

pitch along wit h F i r e m a n                   am               and find the most           senior

police         officer     I could find and find out where we were wanted.



I w al k e d towards a blue             shutter     gate w h ic h     is mar ke d as gate          'B' on

the      plan.      I banged on the gate and a u n i f o r m e d police                  officer

ope ne d       it from the other          side and     let us      in.



I walked         through and saw that             there were a few           people w a lk in g about            in

the a re a between the gate and the                    stand but not many.               I w a l k e d to the

t ot al l y different.               I could see that          there were        people     injured         lying

on the floor all               over    the    place.     Some were         in the      recovery    position

and were         being       t ended to by other         people,         I d i d n ’t really   notice who

they were.



I could see a tunnel                  leading       straight    down onto        the    terraces       so       I

h ea d ed for         that.     As    I got towards         it I saw that           there were a group of

bodies       laid out on the              floor      just   before       the tunnel entrance.               I have

marked       the      p osition of        these      bodies as B1 on the plan.              There      seemed

to be a bout           15 to 20 bodies          but there were a             lot of     people about                so   I

c o u l d n ’t see      properly.            I could not describe any of                the bodies at all.



As    I approached            the    tunnel    I could see a group of                policemen at           the

entrance.             I don't       know how m ^ n y^ th er e were and nothing was                 said to me

up a ga in s t        the    side walls.        It was      dark    so    I c o u l d n ’t see how m any

there were.             As    I walked       through one or two            comments were        passed by

these      people       to the e ffect         of    ’about    time      too*.



I got to the end of the                  tunnel       beared to the          left    into   p ll/C .        My

T he re were          some    people    in pens 3 and 4 but               I had no d if fi c u l t y getting

down the terrace               in pen 4 to the          perimeter         gate   next    to the    pitch.                As

I got      to the gate a police                constable w ith a beard who was                  in his m id

thirties,          o pened the        gate    by moving a lever            up on his side         of the

gate.       He o pe ned        it i m m e d ia te ly with ou t     question.           He didn't       say

a ny t h i n g   to me.

                  As    I got onto        the    pitch          I could see          the full       extent of the         disaster.

                  T he re were      hundreds          of    people on the             pitch,       some obv io us ly dead,          some

                  injured and being              te nd ed to by others.

                  quite a high rank              in the service a l t h o u g h               I d o n ’t know what.           He was

                  giving        oxygen to a person who was                      lying       on the ground,          I don't know

                  who     the    person was       he was          treating Point C1.                 We exc ha ng ed a few words

                  an d then       I inst ru ct ed fireman                           and              to go a ro u n d and

                  do what        they    could for whoever                they       could.



                                    some       bodies were          being       lifted through a gap                in the fencing

                                          ction had been ripped up.                          There were       some       police

                  officer s       lifting       the    bodies       through the gap                in the fence.           I d o n ’t

                  know wh ether          the bodies were                dead or not          but most       of them,       as they

                  w ere    getting       the    bodies          through their head were                   being    banged on a

                  concrete wall,           parapet wall.                 I felt that          these       casualties       could have

                  been handled better,                 if they w er en 't             injured before          they certainly

                  w o u l d have    s u s t ai ne d a serious             head       injury whe n they were               being

                  I also        noticed that as the bodies were                            being    put onto       the    pitch once

                  being     laid on their             backs.            One    of the       casqaflties fetched out from

                    He    looked at the            patient and         I looked at      his face and     I saw that         it

                    was sta rt in g          to go    purple.         I realised      I couldn't    do anym or e     for him,

to    look at him when a doctor               came to me and said                I was wast in g my

time,     so     I left him.



By this         time the a re a was       being    cleared of bodies               by people          being

s tr et ch er     bearers and        carrying     the bodies          on a dv e r t i s i n g    boards.

T h er e d i d n ’t seem to be a ny th in g          further          I could do so         I deci de d to go

back    to the a p p l i a n c e and      inform my sup er io rs              of the situation.



I w a l k e d back        to the gate     in the     perimeter          fence of       pen 4.         I c a n ’t

remember whether             the   p ol iceman was still              there or not.             I w al k e d

thro ug h       it and up the terrace.              I d i d n ’t notice         the    people       in the      pen

or the         number.      I d o n ’t know how      long     I had been on the                 pitch at all.



I w a l k e d through the tunnel              and out through gate B the way                        I had come.

Everything         seemed the same          I don't      remember asking a n y b o d y to open the

gate so         I think     it was    open.



Once     outside      I saw that       there were a lot more a m bu la nc es                     outside and

fire engines.



I went         to find my s t a t i o n officer and as                I was    speaking         to hirn

A s s i s t a n t Divisional       Offi ce r R O B J O H N S was       speaking       via the       radio from

the gymnasium.              He was    requesting       r e s u s c i ta ti on equipment            and firemen

to go to the gym to assist w^th ^ casualties.                              I said      I w o u l d go there

w h i c h w asn't     being used and went            back     into the ground and down onto

the    pitch the same wa y again.                 E ve ry t h i n g    seemed the same,             as    I w al k e d

t h r o ug h but    I didn't       pay m uch attention.

Once    onto the       pitch,       we w al k e d across       the    pitch.     There was a line of

p ol i ce m en straight across              the half way         line.      I had seen the         policemen

a cr os s   the     pitch the first          time       I had gone down onto the           pitch myself.



I had seen the            casualties        being       carried towards        the are a    in between

thi                                          on K op so       I headed for that area.



I f ound the                   rum ther.         were    no a m b ul an ce s a r o u n d there at all.           I

know w het he r       there was a n y b o d y on the door.



I walked       in and saw that             in the first sect io n of the gym were                   the

d ec e a s e d all    laid out.           Some    had blankets        covering    them,     others       d i d n ’t

have a n yt hi ng      over       them.     T here were       policemen moving        from body to

body collecting            property from the bodies.



In the next sect io n there were                    injured      people who      needed to be tended

to.     Then      in the end s e c ti on there were               casualties who were             being

t en de d to.



I n ot ic e d a man who was               lying    on his s                    a point     I have ma rk ed

FI    on the      plan.    His      head was       pointing                  the gym wall.          T h e y was

a lad sitting          next       to him propped up a g a in st            the gym wall.          The    lad

was    b et we en    12— 13 years         of age a nd he was wear in g a red               ’T ’ shirt.

The    lad was       holding       his    chest    but d i d n ’t appear as       bad as     the one on

the floor.

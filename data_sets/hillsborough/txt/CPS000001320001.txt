 Dear Mrs Ross

 RE: ADLINGTON v DUCKENFIELD AND MURRAY

 Thank you for indicating this morning that you are dealing with this matter on our behalf.

 As you may know Ann Adlington, a solicitor acting for the Hillsborough Family Support
 Group, is conducting a private prosecution against Ex Chief Superintendent Duckenfield and
 Ex Superintendent Murray on allegations of manslaughter, misconduct in a public office and
 perverting the course of justice.

 The attached papers show details of the CPS review as to whether or not we should intervene
 in this private prosecution in order to discontinue any charges. Defence solicitors had
 requested that intervention. We did not consider taking over the private prosecution in order
 to discontinue it as we had not seen any new and material evidence that might affect our
 previous decision that there was insufficient evidence for a realistic prospect of a conviction
 on any charges against any person.

 The attached documents are:-

 1.     1998 CPS Review
 2.     CPS police on private prosecution
 3.     Letter 3.12.98: CPS to S.J. Wooler
 4.     CPS minute 14.12.98
 5.     Briefing note for DPP 16.12.98
 6.     Letter 18.12.98: CPS to Walker Morris
 7.     Press Release 18.12.98 & Qs and As
 8.     Letter 18.12.98 Walker Morris to CPS
 9.     Draft Letter in response to 8 above. Not Sent
 10.    Minute 21.12.98
 11.    Fax Letter 21.12.98: HFSG to CPS
The above documents give a general feel of the case and the reason for the intimated judicial
review which I now understand will be applied for by both defendants.

There are of course many more relevant papers in my possession in York.

You may consider that a conference in London would be desirable once proceedings for
judicial review have been issued, if not before. I understand that you will be unavailable until
5 January 1999. Perhaps we should discuss the matter by telephone on your return.


Yours sincerely




George R. Croston
Prosecution Team Leader

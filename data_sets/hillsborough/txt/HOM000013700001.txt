   Dear Mr. Jonhston,

   HILLSBOROUGH INQUIRY

   Further to my letter of 11th August, 1989 I attach a further account showing
   a total accumulated cost of £1,996,362.

   The account is based on actual payments to date but there are other charges
   to be considered regarding the use of computer and communications equipment
   plus overheads and administrative costs.

   This covers overtime incurred up to Sunday 30th July, 1989 and paid on
    6th August, 1989, Other costs include hotel bills, transport, subsistence
   etc. actually paid up to mid-August 1989.

   Interest is now accruing from the date of our payment, particularly of the
   overtime and other expenses paid to police officers. This interest will
   accrue until the date of settlement by your Authority on a rate to be agreed
   based on current borrowing rates.

   Yours sincerely,
                                                                                                                   13,09,89      15:36       P . 02

                  REPORT OF THE DIRECTOR OF SOCIAL SERVICES


     TEMPORARY MANAGEMENT ARRANGEMENTS    -    HILLSBOROUGH DISASTER RESPONSE


PURPOSE

1.     To outline and recommend to members a departmental management
       structure that can effectively maintain an inter-agency response to
       the Hillsborough Disaster whilst separately sustaining the operation
       of Liverpool Social Services Department.

INTRODUCTION
2.     Members will require no introduction to the scale of the disaster
       that occurred at Hillsborough.     Whilst immediate priority has been
       afforded to the bereaved families and the casualties;       it is clear that
       all those people attending, playing and officiating iji the football
       match, plus their circle of family and friends must be regarded as
       victims.   The issue for Liverpool City Council, neighbouring Authorities
       and other agencies involved.must ultimately be the quality of life of
       the survivors and those closely associated.        The nature of the services
       needed must be regarded as preventive mental health.
3.     The epicentre of the tragedy will probably be revealed, when accurate
       data emerges, as being Merseyside with adjoining parts of Lancashire
       and Cheshire.     However, the facts already available and the nature of
       the support for Liverpool F.C. dictate the Hillsborough disaster be
       regarded as a national disaster.       The response to the needs of the
       victims must therefore also be viewed in that context.
4.     It is for that reason that the seven local authority Social Services
       Departments most impacted upon, with the full support of their Councils,
       have adopted a joint approach to the issues.        The services provided
       across the region include a 24 hour Helpline, a co-ordinate approach to
       counselling, a number of drop-in and advice centres and a co-ordinated
       voluntary effort.     A similar approach has been taken to information,
       publicity, public and press relations, database, training, finance and
       administration.
5.     Members should be aware that effectively the services provided have been
       achieved through a combination of secondments, staff goodwill, free
       arrangements and/re-orientation of priorities.       Such arrangements cannot
       continue and it is the intention of the seven authorities, together with
       the Mersey Regional Health Authority, the Probation Service and the
       Voluntary Sector to work towards permanence.
                                       -   2-


6.    Members should also be aware that the leadership initiatives taken
      by the City Council, its Social Services Department and particularly
      the Director, in order to ensure that the appropriate services are
      readily available across the region have had a considerable impact
      on the operation of the Department.
7.    It must also be acknowledged that the entire workforce of the
      Department have positively responded to the needs of victims on an
      entirely voluntary basis.
8.    Additionally, considerable support has been received from other
      City Council Departments.      This has taken the form of staff second­
      ments, enabling things to happen, creating accommodation or simply
      helping the combined effort.
9.    The net consequence of all these efforts, besides a service being
      available, is that organisationally large parts of the Department
      are unrecognisable.     It is also fair to say, without detriment to
      colleagues in neighbouring Authorities and other agencies, that
      Liverpool have contributed the "lion's share" of staff time.         This
      is particularly the case in respect of management, supervisory and
      co-ordination.time.

"THE DISASTER UNIT"
10.   The agencies working together on the disaster response are exploring
      the possibility of creating a "Disaster Unit" within,but separate
      from, the Social Services Department, based in Liverpool.      The
      Director is leading this initiative and is heavily involved in
      negotiating for permanence on a regional and indeed national basis.
11.   It is envisaged that these negotiations may take some time to come
      to fruition.    In the imterim it is suggested that management arrange­
      ments are adapted in the Department to underwrite the security of
      the services that have been created.
12.   The recommendations put forward take cognisance of the possible future
      shape of a "Disaster Unit".     They should enable departmental managers
      and staff to extricate themselves at the appropriate time with minimal
      disruption to services.

STRUCTUKE, ORGANISATION AND MANAGEMENT
13.   Members are reminded that consultations have been in train with staff,
      trades unions, other Departments and agencies in: respect of the future
      structure of the Department.     It had been the intention of the
      Director to report to the June Social Services Committee on a way
      forward.    It is no longer possible to so report.
14.   However, it is pertinent to indicate to members some of the broad
      thinking that has evolved over the six months of consultations.        It
      is important to do this to demonstrate to members that the temporary
      management arrangements proposed are consistent with the future overall
      direction of the Department, in many ways allowing greater preparation
      for major change and facilitating the possibility of more in-depth
      consultations.    Furthermore, it will ensure that ultimately the
      Social Services Department is in condition to respond positively to
      Council policy directions, including decentralisation;      as well as
      Government policy thrusts such as competitive tendering and the
      NHS review.
15.   The broad objectives would see the operational side of the Department
      having three tiers of management - first line, middle and senior.
      Senior management at Assistant Director level would be generic and
      geographically based.    Middle management would maintain the current
      split between social work and resource management (or in competitive
      tendering language "client" and "contractor").       However, on the
      resource side the functional approach to management is rejected
      (i.e. residential, day care, group services) in favour of a more
      client specific model (i.e. child and family and adult resources).
      This will build in a greater capacity for resource integration on a
      neighbourhood level at first line.     On the social work side it is
      felt that the current balance between genericism, specialism and
      health-based social work should be at least maintained.      A City Council
      decentralisation of services would require a growth in generic locality
      based intake workers and a more community orientated social work
      approach.     On first line management there is widespread acknowledge­
      ment that this requires people qualified and/or experienced in the
      methods or settings of the group of staff to be supervised.      Therefore
      the objective organisational model will resemble that diagramatically
      presented in Appendix 'A'.
CURRENT POSITION
16.   Prior to the Hillsborough disaster it had been the intention of the
      Director to report to Committee recommending a phased move towards
      the objectives described above.     Priority was to be directed towards
      a rationalisation of the resource side of the Department into a child
      and family and adult resource integrated format.     This would have
      had the spin-off effect of reducing the excessive workload of the
      Assistant Director (Field Services).
17.   It is the view of the Director that the response to the Hillsborough
      disaster has placed an even greater burden on the Assistant Director
      (Field Services).     This has long term implications in the shape of
      "Helpline", the Drop-In and Advice Centre and two additional socia;
      work teams.    In order to free management time for these additional
      responsibilities the Director has gained approval for a further
      Assistant Director post.
18.   Members should be aware that the Hillsborough disaster response has
      also committed the Director and Assistant Director (Administration)
      full time, as well as part of the time of Assistant Director
      (Residential).
19.   The current situation is such that the Director now wishes to
      designate the three operational Assistant Directors as interchangeable.
      To this end a common job description of Assistant Director (Operations)
      has been drafted.(attached as Appendix 'B').     In the first instance
      these will be charged with specific responsibilities for (i) Fieldwork
      and Hillsborough services, (ii) Child and Family Resources, and
      (iii) Adult Resources.     The attraction of a common job description
      is that it builds in future flexibility and does not impinge on the
      structural objectives.     In fact, it does give the Assistant Directors
      an opportunity to organise their respective parts of the Department in
      a way that will enable the objectives to be achieved by a date to be
      determined.
20.   Appendix 'C' details the temporary management arrangements that will
      result.   The Director does not wish to recommend any further organisational
      change at this stage as he feels that the staff involved may not be
      equipped to deal with the personal anxiety;    many of them being heavily
      involved in the Hillsborough response.     In fact it is suggested that
      a moratorium be placed on any further substantial management re-shuffles
      until the autumn unless the needs of service users (including Hillsborough
      survivors) dictate.
                                     -5-


21.   The Deputy Director will temporarily cover some of the responsibilities
      of the Assistant Director (Administration) and will maintain the
      functioning of the Department whilst the Director is engaged in
      Hillsborough related issues.
22.   The Director wishes to stress two things:       Firstly the temporary
      nature of these arrangements.        He suggests that the effectiveness of
      the structure is reviewed on a monthly basis both within the Department
      and jointly with NALGO.   Secondly that, as well as catering for the
      Hillsborough services, the recommended arrangements are a small step­
      ping stone towards longer term objectives.      In no way do the proposals
      impinge on future directions or commit the Department inappropriately.
CONSULTATION
23.   Inevitably the nature of a disaster leaves little space for consultation.
      It is the belief of the Director that the workforce understand this
      and will welcome the clarity the management arrangements will provide.
      It is the members of the Management Board who are most personally
      affected and they are in favour of the changes.       Those other staff
      who have been consulted have seen the changes as logically necessary
      and of potential long term benefit to the service users.
24.   NALGO have been informed of the proposals and




CONCLUSIONS
25.   The Director puts forward this report for approval as a series of
      necessary management changes.    Firstly to meet the demands of the
      Hillsborough services and secondly to maintain the longer term momentum
      of reaching theDepartment's service providing objectives.

RECOMMENDED
      That:
        i)    it be confirmed that an additional Assistant Director be
              recruited;
       ii)    the Assistant Director (Field Services) and the Assistant
              Director (Residential) along with the new post all be designated
              Assistant Directors (Operations);
iii)   in the first instance they be made responsible -for respectively:
       Fieldwork and Hillsborough services, Child and Family Resources
       and Adult Resources;
iv)    the consequent temporary managements outlined in Appendix 'C'
       be noted;
 v)    the organisational arrangements be jointly reviewed with NALGO
       on a monthly basis - both in respect of Hillsborough services
       and as way of ensuring that longer term management structures
       are considered;
vi)    this, report be referred to the Personnel and Equal Opportunities
       Committee for information.

                    THIRD DAY'S PROCEEDINGS

                WEDNESDAY. 21st NOVEMBER, 1990

     THE CORONER:   Good morning.
      MR. KING:  Sir, could I just mention one matter in today’s.
'Yorkshire Post', I don't know if you have had an opportunity
to see it?
     THE CORONER:   I have not seen it, no.

      MR. KING: Well you ought to know because no doubt it
will be brought to your attention, that there is a parag p
on the first page which infers, and it is comments made on
behalf of a member of Parliament, questioning whether ^
sir should properly be conducting this Inquest and it raise
the fact that you sir should be replaced on the «
                                                grounds that
there is a "conflict of interests" on the grounds that you,
sir, as Her Majesty's Coroner receive remuneration through
the City Council.
      Sir, can I say on behalf of the families that we
disassociate ourselves completely with those remarks,
have complete confidence in you sir and I know I speak for
everyone along these benches and behind me and sir the fact
that you have to be paid, as we all do, can play
whatsoever in the functions of this Inquest.

      THE CORONER:  I had seen something like it in one of
the other papers so I was aware.  I did not realise    £ha
particular paper but I am exceedingly grateful to you for
that assurance, thank you, and I take it that you a
disagreeing ?
      MR. PAYNE: Yes. Mr. King, I may say, speaks on behalf
of all the representatives who appear before you.

       THE CORONER:  Thank you very much indeed. It is nice
 to hear that.  I say no more about it. There is no point
 in discussing it.
       I have been considering when to decide on this submission
 which we have been deferring, as you know.   I think jverybo y
 is here bar Mr. Isaacs, that is right, isn t it.   I    going
 to ask Mr. Jones if he will explore the availability or
 Mr. Isaacs or if he does not want to come his firm, tor
 tomorrow morning at 9.30 so that we can get on with it and
 sort it out, subject, of course, to that not being hopelessly
 inconvenient for you.  Is it, Mr. Catchpole?

       MR. CATCHPOLE:  Sir, I hate to rise. There is a very
 substantial risk I might have to go back to Lon*don-fcJ” ;s _
 evening and by the time I have finished I would not be
 to get back to Sheffield on the morning train.   I don t know
 the times of the trains.
        - THE CORONER:     So you would prefer not tomorrow morning
    at 9.30?
          MR. CATCHPOLE:     If that is possible yes please sir.

          THE CORONER:     How does Friday ....

          MR. JONES:  Sir, if you leave it with me I will talk
    to the legal representatives and find a suitable time
    everyone.
          THE CORONER: We want to make it as convenient as
    we can for all of you but on the other hand I ought to get
    on with it and reach a decision so that we know where we
    are. Okay, Mr. Jones, if you could organise that.

          Is there anything else that we need to do before we
    can st^rt wltt the business of the day so to speak? (so response)

          I think I am right in saying that we start with David
    Knight.  Is that right?

                              DAVID KNIGHT Sworn

                               By THE CORONER:

Q. You are David William Knight, that is correct, isn't it? - A.
   That is correct.
Q. And you are the licensee of the ' C o m m e r c i a l Hotel', Station
   Street, Chapeltown in Sheffield? - A. That is correct.

Q. And you have been there for about three years?           A. That is
   true.
Q. Well it is longer now but it was two years in 1989?            A. That
   is right.
O    Can you just tell me approximately how far this particular
     hotel/public house is from the Hillsborough Stadium in miles,
     if you wish? - A. I should say approximately three miles.

Q. It is a venue which is supported by both Nottingham Forest
   fans and Liverpool fans.  Is that right? - A. It isn t a
   football fan pub at all.  It just so happens that the new
   Stocksbridge bypass leads past the pub so anybody*
   from the Manchester area could quite possibly come past
   pub.
           THE CORONER:  This is not a question to you but I just
     want to make an observation.
            I made an error yesterday because I referred to the
      fans as "Liverpudlians" and that in fact is of course not
                                      D.VI. KNIGHT


 quite right because firstly the Liverpool | u P P ° r J *r* f
 l o t I n from Liverpool they come J - ^ ^ ^ o d y ‘ho
 the country and secondly, I don t suppose everyd
 lives in Liverpool is necessarily a bor£               vou
 person, .sp insofar as I used £hJndr°£gbetter for the
 wili-forgive me and I will    y exclude Liverpool supporters
 ITill's who did not originate from that particular town,
 That is nothing to do with you.
       MB KTNr-    Sir if it is of any assistance, I myself
 am a L ^ u d ^ a n ^ n and bred and some people accuse ,
 of not having a Liverpool accent but I am doing my
 cultivate one for the purposes of this.
           THE CORONER:   Well I am very P h a s e d to hear J h a t ^
  Mr. King, because one of ^ ^ ^ ^ ^ I ^ a d         been worried
     l L l ° ? ^ n 7 t \ Z able to understand possibly some of
     the people of Liverpool so you will be able to neip
     no doubt.


     is of f o i r ^ ’f a ^ V a ?
     various parts of the country.

           THE CORONER:  I quite agree •                t o ^ y 18 ■^
     reason why I mentioned it because it was                       T
     attention and I thought it was a ^e^ dP^ ® y b o d y knew that
     wanted to make quite sure that you ana everyuuu*
     I was aware of it.
                     t m -~.y.rv     Now we are thinking about
Q-        1 s S : ' » e “ S l ' i i th°aWt you know what we are talking
     about and you were working in your pub, that is rig          .
     - A. That is right, yes.
Q. Did you open at about 12, or what time? - A. Noon.

Q. Did you have a number of supporters in? - A. About
   about 1 p.m.
Q. could you distinguish these as being
   as opposed to being supporters of some other tea .
   We asked.
Q. And what did they say? - A. They were visiting fans.

Q. Supporting the Liverpool team? - A. Yes.

Q. Did the first batch, if I can call it that, come in about
   1? - A. That is right.
 Q. And then did you get any additional supporters in? - A.
    Up to about 2.30.
                                  D.W. KNIGHT


At the height, what I am trying to find out is the
number of fans that you might have had in. How many wo
you say? - A. I would say about 40.
How many do you normally have in your public house on a
Saturday lunJhtiae? - A. Possibly about two dozen.

And did you have those as well? - A. Local people, yes.

So it tripled the number of people more or       less?- A. Yes.

Do you serve food in your ....      A. Yes.

 I am interested not in the locals,:your J ^ u l a r s ^ I am
 interested in the visiting fans. Did they
 far as you know? - A. Yes.
 And did they drink any alcohol as well? - A. On yes.

 And what sort of alcohol can you recollect that they
 drank? - A. Basically draught but there was a mi.,
 some spirits.
 And what was your assessment of their behaviour whilst'
 they were with you in your public h o u s e ? - A. It go
 rather hectic towards the end.  I was glad that thecIock
 was coming round to that particular time.

. we will come back to the word" h e c t i c " but what was
 that that you were glad it was coming to? - A. I would
 lay after about 2.15 it started to get noisy.
. There wasn't any fighting? - A. No.

. was there any damage    of any moment? -A. No.    A   broken
  glass but no damage.
. so in what way was it "hectic" could you give me a
  description? - A. They became intoxicated.




                              Q. And what were they doing
L



                                                         D. W. KNIGtlf




    R   Q. And what were they-doing? Give.me a description
           waat ...? - A. Well they were playing pool ana tney
           were playing darts. They were enjoying tnenselves
           because they were within themselves. There were no _
           visiting people. The local people weren t particularly
           interested in becoming involved, so they just got
           excited.
        0. They were noisy, is that what you are saying? - A. ^es»
           noisy, laughing, shouting, cheering, out no problems.

        Q.    But you thought toyourself, "When they go I will be
             quite happy"? - A. I was sappier.

        Q.   \Jhat time did they begin to leave? - A. About 2.30.

        0. How far did you say your public house was? - A. About
           three miles.
    ^   0. Were aiost of them in vehicles or on foot that you can
         ' recollect? - A. I think there were some taxnxous.es as
           well as private cars, and they were on the hignvay
           outside.

        Q. So they were motorised? - A. Yes.

        Q. How long would you say it takes to get from your pub by
           a vehicle to the stadium?    I am not talking about
           parking time or anything like that. - A. It one snew
           the   course, I should say 15 minutes to -0 mxnutes.

        Q. And   you say they left between - what tiraedid you say
           they leave again? - A. Between 2.30 and 2.50, t.ie la^t
           group went.
         Q. So the bulk   didn’t actuallyleave until 2.30? - A.     Ho.

         Q. Not    before? - A. No.

         Q. You are sure of that? - A. Yes.
         Q. I think, can you recollect approximately how much you
            either sold or what your takings were, the excess
            amounts? - A. If normally I would have taken £50 I
            would have probably taken £120 or something lx>ce tna t.

         0. And that was on the, what I call the alcoholic sales,
            or food and everything? - A. The wet sales, tne
            alcotiolic sales.
         Q. So about £70 on top of what you normally would have
            sold, would tnat be about right? - A. I woule say so
            easily, yes.

    0. Might be more is what you are ...? - A. Could be.
B
    Q. You can't remember? - A. It is a figure I haven t
       looked at for quite a while so I wouldn t really know.

                      C r o s s -Examined by HR.   HALE

    Q. Hr. Knight, have you any previous experience of   f
       football fans at pubs? - A. No. As I said, xt xsn t
       really a football fan pub.  It is only occasionally,
       maybe two or three times a year, or a season.

    Q. I think you mentioned almost as a tnrowaway one of the
       words that occurred to you about the behaviour was tnat
       it was excited? - A. Yes.
                     Cross-Examined by HR. PAYftE

    Q. Other landlords who have given evidence have given
D      estimates of what they thought was the average amount
       of beer which was drunk by visitors.  Are you able to
       give an idea of that? - A. Well, obviously it depends
       on everyone's consumption.  I would say probably three
       to four, five pints, or equivalent.

                     Cross-Examined by MR. MANNING

    0. When you were talking about the times of arrival of the
       supporters, you said that they continued to arrive to
       about 2.30? - A. That is correct.

    0. So there were people who were c o m i n g into your public
       house at 2.30 on their way to the matcn? - A. Yes.

    Q. A match which was, by car, 15-20 minutes driving away
       if they knew the course? - A. Yes.

     0. Then to park the car, to get to the ground for a kick-
        off of 3 o'clock? - A. It would have been x.npossxble.

     0. And yet they said they were supporters going to the
        match? - A. Oh, they were going to the match, yes.

     Q. And it would have been impossible for them to be .tnere
        at the kick-off time? - A. Yes.

     0.    And the number of 40 or so made no attempt to breax      up
          until 2.30? - A. No.

     0.    So really they would have been all on, even leaving at
          2.30, to have got to the ground? - A. They might have
          just made it.
     0.. Might just have made it? - A. Yes.

    Q. But some were still in the public house at 2.50? - A.
B      Correct.
    Q. The words you used were "becoming intoxicated ? *■ A.
       Yes.

    Q. Thank you very much, Mr. Knight.

                         Cross-Examined by MR. tCII<G

    Q. Mr. Knight, just to put your evidence into some
       perspective, you are speaking about 40, you say,
       Liverpool supporters? - A. Yes.

    Q. Are you aware that the allocation to Liverpool on tne
       day of this match was sooie 24,000 tickets? - A. No.

    Q. It probably doesn't surprise you that that is the sort
       of number that attended, so you are talking about a
D      very small number of people in relation to the total ^
       who attended the match, obviously? - A. One would tains
       so, yes.
    Q. Just dealing with your evidence for a moment, wnat did
       interest me was this, you say that normally you nad
       about two dozen customers, about 24? - A. Yes.

    Q. And your normal takings would be about £50? - A. I said
       that in comparison I probably took 2-s times as mucn as
       I would have done.
    Q. Yes, because of course you had 2% times more people? —
       A. Correct.

    0. So in terms of money per person it was just the same?
       A. Yes.
     0. It follows from that, in terms of drink per person it
        was roughly the same? - A. Yes.

     0. Indeed, if one does a calculation, if, for example,      I

        normal amount you take.
                  THE COROiJER:    We should be dividing it by 24.

                  THE WITNESS:     I would not like him to operate my

                iiiv              50 divided by 24, we get just over £2

And if we do a calculation with the amount you did taice
against the number of people there, you took roughly
the same amount of money per head? - A. Could be.

I am sura in your experience you have had experience of
when people get really intoxicated there     ke
fighting, there can be damage to the public house,
can't there? - A. Yes.

What is remarkable here is there was none of that in
your pub at all? - A. Wo.
Can you help on some other matters? How many bar staff
do you have? - A. Normally on a Saturday there is one
bar staff and my wife and I.

Is that what you had on this Saturday? - A. Hmm.

About three of you? - A. Maun.

And you found it hectic serving 40 people? - A. At
times.
Can you imagine six people trying to serve 500 people?
Can I put that to you as an example? - A. Bit of a
problem I would think.

A bit of a problem? - A. Mmm.

One only has to state that to show that that would be
in your view, I am sure, a total exaggeration if one
could do it, wouldn't it? - A. Mram.

Can I put another example to you of estimates to see if
you can agree with me?  Isnagine if you will that those
six people served some 6,000 pints to 600 people.    It
is a thousand pints each.   Do you think you would have
your arm left at the end of two hours? - A. i<fo, there
would probably be no electricity left.

 Thank you very much.

 Do you think it is quite normal for young, healtny
 active people to show a zest for living and to be
 excited just before a semi-final football match? “ A.
 Yes.  I wouldn't really say there was any problem in
 enjoying what they are doing, as opposed to using bad
 language etc., etc.  The difference between people
 enjoying themselves and a possibility of problems.

       were approaching that state.
               THE CORONER:   Anybody else want to ask anything
       else?      Thank you very much indeed.
               Before I call the next witness can I say something
       else which I forgot when I came in?        I was not enti   y
       haoov with the second video whicn we saw when I was
       v i e S L T i t in court and I have been thinking particularly
       about Mr. Payne's point about the comparisons.

              YJhat I have asked to be done is for one of my
       nfj:1-r»r e to review the appropriate videos and in tact                                                to

      MR. PAYNE:        Thank you.

     THE CORONER:   There will still be a Jj-ttle     ^
confusion because you probably not^ f d        different

the way the camera was set in that year, but we av
got to give with that.

      Yes, Mr. Hale?
     MR. HALE:   I am most obliged to you, sir, for that.
I had a look at the video myself last n i g h t and I ^surne
that it is going to be as it was originally ta^en, that
is? moiinJ.S I feel it is important to see the people
moving on both.
     THE CORONER:   That may not be possible because of
the time aspects.  What we are trying to do witn that
partiuclar video is to give a compa:clSO" ^ Z l l l s £hen
years at times.   If there are moving s ^ e n c e s , then
that is what we would like to show.    I accept your
point, but if we haven't then we may have to still them.

      MR. HALE:   Yes, my understanding is, andoj;" fa^ ltXt
 has been done, is that they c a n be r u n i n sequence, but
 as you rightly say the left hand side is not solely
 Leppings Lane.   It does hop about f r o m h e r e to there.
 It comes back quite regularly and tne mind soon adjusts
 to it and the timing does run contemporaneously.
 Obviously we will see that.
      THE CORONER:   We will see what...   I am not there
 to supervise him, so to speak, because I a m n e r e , but he
 knows what I want.  What I am after is a fair               n’
 if that is the right word, as far as one can achieve it.
 I thought I ought to mention it so you know -here is
 another one coming.

You weren't able to go out into the road to have a look

                      further by THE CORONER:

 I want just to clarify a couple of things,         r just want
 +a be sure about this counter in the window. Was the
 counter at f l e v e f so that you couid c learl y^ee through
 the window or did it obscure your vision?        A. Yes,
 can see clearly.

 look and you can see.
 And the counter is one of the low ones where you display

 So there is no problem about looking out?           A. No.

, The second question I want to be       ^ h a ^ t h e r ^ w a s 11
  your correct answer is: when you said that there wa*
  more noise and more cans when there was more peopl ^
  were you saying, let’s take the noise first' th® *e ®
  of individual noise of the people was the                 MtHer
  was louder because there were ten people together rather
  than one, or were you saying that                       1iy A
  noisier than they had been earlier, ^ i v i d u a l a .     A^
  What I noticed I think it was because there were more
  people.
. More people, I see. - A. Yes, for what X noticed.

. what I am trying to find out is whether people say
  12 o'clock, say there were 100 people at 12 o cl°clc
  walking past your shop and say 80% of those we:r
  carrying cans, I am not saying they were, at 2 o
  if 100 people went past would it still nave ee
  carrying cans or would it have been 90% who w®re
  carrying cans, in other words was there a gradien
  or was it about the same whatever time it was.    a .
   just saw people carrying lots of cans.

    o. So you noticed a considerable change in behaviour? - A.
       Yes.

    Q. Were they mainly young, old, mixed, what were they? -

    Q. So this crowd was much more a young people's crowd? -
       A. That's right.

    Q. Presumably nearly all men I take it? - A. That's rignt.

    Q. Did any of them come in to see you, because I take it
       you were in the kiosk or the shop, or whatever it^is? -
       A. No, no, they just came over the forecourt taat s
       all, through the forecourt.

         And you had the job of picking up all the cans which
         were thrown onto your forecourt? - A. Yes.

          on your forecourt or in your toilets? - A. Oh yes - I
          turned away.

        . You didn't watch, yes.  Apart from that, which is
          obviously not very nice behaviour, but apart fro.ra that
          did you notice anything else about them that attracted
          your attention and maybe the annoyance at having to
          pick up all these cans, anything else? - A. Nothing




H
  really. They were just talking loud, l a u g m n g and
  joking and when they have had beer they have a bit or
  courage you see, and they shout louder and they tains
  they are bigheads I suppose, but there was no trouble,
  no fighting.  It gives them courage.

Q. 3ut there was a bit of noise and shouting and I ta^e it
   they were cheering on their team? - A. Oh, yes, having
   a bit of fun I suppose, in their way.

Q. Yes.  Tell Kie again about the control of the road

   do whsn the njain crowd comes.

   the Police.

Q. How did thiy do it? Did they have Officers standing

   the side? Did they put metal barriers across? What
   did they do? - A. Well, there are two roads, one coaling
   that way and that way and the Police stand there, bloc.<
   that off and they come on Leppings Lane.

Q. IJhat you are saying is they were closing off the other
   roads so that people would be funnelled into Leppin^s
   Lane? - A. That is right.

Q. And not go up roads which wouldn't take them to the
   Stadium? - A. That's right.

Q. So-were you on duty at the garage when otner football
   matches were taking place at the Stadium? - A. Every
   Saturday, yes. That was my-day - night.

Q. So you have seen crowds going down there .... - A.
   Definitely.

Q. For seventeen years? - A. Yes.

Q. Just in your own words tell the Jury how does the
   behaviour of this group, starting at about a quarter-
   to-3, how does it compare with what you nave seen of
   other football crowds on other occasions? - A. well on
   that particular day they was drinking heavier than I
   have ever seen before, and as I say there was no
   trouble, they wasn't drunk, but they were drinking
   heavy and throwing the cans all over.

Q. Yes. The note I have got is that you cleared up from
   your forecourt seven black sacks full of beer cans. -
   A. That is true.

Q. And something else you said, a great big something?
   A. Yes, it's a great big bag as well like what you put
   big wallpaper in, a big bag as well.

Q. Another big bag? - A .   Yes.

Q. Have you ever had to clear up so many cans? - A. Oh no,
   definitely not. That's the first time.

Q. 1 wonder if you can remember the 1983 semi-final?   Does
   that stand out in your mind in any way? - A. I have
   been there at every match and even when foreigners have
   come to this country they have been happy and that, but
   never like that on that day - never as many cans.

Q.   No? -A. No.

Q.    But Iam asking you in particular about one match out
     of very many over the seventeen years, 1 know.   Do you
     know that there was a semi-final match tae year before,
     in 1938? - A. Yes, I was there.

 Q. Yes, was tnere anything particular about tne behaviour
    of the crowd that time? - A. No, no. Everybody were
    merry.

 Q. Yes. So this 1983 - sorry, the one you have been
    giving evidence about, the 1939 behaviour, really
    stands out in your mind as quite different from otner
    times does it? - A. Oh yes, it has been all right
    before that.

        17th November, when the match between Sheffield
        Wednesday and Swindon was taking place?

           Explain it to me, then I will see if I will allow tne
           question.
                MRS. HcBRIEN:   I came over, to Sheffield

     she is sure that the roads were closed but you can t
     ask the question i the forsa that you want.  Do you
     understand wnat I am saying? what you nave to
     establish is whether it was closed on 15th April, an^.
     which roads, if you want to establish taat.

             HRS. HcBRIEil:     Yes, what I.am trying to establish
     is:
Q.   I do understand that Mrs. Ilayhew is saying that tne^
     road is closed to traffic on the day of the matcn,
     is it just whan they are coming out of the matca and
     not when they are going into it as well? ~ A. unat I
     said before is when the people are coming off the train
     the Police walk them down and they close that side^ for
     the traffic whan the people are coming down, and tne
     people go on there then, and then tney close tne road
     for the people to cone out.

Q. Getting back to the point of tne fans urinating, is. I
   could take this, when I was over on Saturday 17th I too
   was looking for a public convenience in that area, and
   I thi k I walke four miles before I found one. There
   are no public toilets as far as I could find outside
   the ground, and th - ones in the park are closed.   Tne
   nearest one I found was right down near woolwortns,
   right down the hill where there was a cafe and it was
   only in the cafe that I found a toilet.   I thin.< that
   would be a very big problem for 24,000 fans arriving at
   a football match that day. They certainly wouldn t
   want to go walki ■, away from where they were going to
   find a toilet and find they had missed the match, would
   you agree? - A. Thera are some toilets near tne main
   gate in tue park and that is not far from tne v.ednescay
    football grou d„om Penistone Road.

Q. And they would be open on that day? - A. Tiay are
   a w ys open.

Q. I am not sayi g I believe people should do this sort of
   thing.  I think they had a problem and I think it would
   be a good idea for somebody like you to suggest to tne
   club ••••
           THE CORONER:   No, I have tried to give you as’
      much liberty as I can.  I d o n ’t accept that question.
      Move to your next question, please.

        MR. KING:      I think it might be of help if we had
   a plan.
        THE CORONER:     Yes, I agree with you.

        MR. KING:    I know from the previous Taylor^
   Inquiry that there were a lot of plans there available
   of the area.   I don't know, I am sure tiiose assisting
   you probably do have plans and copies of it.    I don t
   whether it might be useful to have a breax and in tne
   meantime find them.

       THE CORONER:   We haven't exhibited a plan           **
  We haven't got a planhandy.   J t h i n k we will need to
  get a plan, I agree wita you, but unfortunately
  haven't got one here.
                itat • r o il   sir is a plan of tne ground, but

     overhead.
             THE CORONER:   Yes, it does show some of the roads
     but it doesn't *o far enough, unfortunately.      It °niy
     g o e s up to Vere Road basicllly.   Can you put up C.249     .
     and let's have a look at it?
          MR. KING:   Sir, I have a photograph.      I don't know
     whether that is of assistance.
          THE CORONER:    The aerial shot I think does actually
     show it.
          MR. KING:   Might it be helpful, we are perhaps
     getting slightly confused, if we took our break and
     could arrange with your...
          THE CORONER:     I think that would be a good idea.
     Let's do that:


«• s . - s . w . u k  ™
   you are talking about. - A. Yes.
                         (Short adjournment)

          THE CORONER:   We have got a plan.   What ^ * r
     it coins to be, C.280.   We have not got an overnead o.
     it yet.   In fact we may get a modified one:

0. Can you see the letter "A" on that plan? - A. Yes.

0.     If you look at that there is aroundabout immediately
      below it? - A. That's right.
Q. Then there is a big road called Leppings Lane, can you
   see that? - A. Yes.
Q. Then there is another big road marked called Penistone
   Road North? - A . That's right.
0. There is another road which comes off that called H e m e s
   Road? - A. Yes.
0   Then there are a few other roads off the roundabout.
Q ’ T e U me! looking at that plan, where is your petrol
                                                0.   MAYHEW


        station? - A. It ’s on Leppings Lane.        Only at the
        beginning of Leppings Lane.
0. is it opposite a road called Farndale Road?                Can you see
   Farndale Road? - A. No, it s before tnat.
        So it's a bit nearer to the roundabout, a bit further...
Q.
        - A. Yes, it's opposite the roundabout where the
        crossings are.
        When you were talking about the road being c l o s e d off^at
0   .
        two o'clock, can you remember telling me that.         •

0. Which roadswere you talking about?     Just Jake your time
 ' and look at the map.     Tell me which      you jere
    talking about being closed off? - A. It    the one
   comes down Penistone - on H e m e s Road, like       ■ facin2;
   get on Leppings Lane, you have to come, if you        Ja“ ns
    it, come on the opposite side, don t you   _ ^ eJ*0ge the
    crossing there and they always stand there and close tne
    road at that side.
0       Which road are we talking about? * A. We are talking
        about the corner of Leppings Lane where the
              There is a roundabout there and the petrol station
        is'opposite and on the other side of the road the cars
        can come from Herries Road down.

0. So you are saying they close off
 ' At the beginning of Leppings Lane they close that a m
   they stop the traffic there, what is coming down H - r n e s
   Road.   They stop it there at tne roundabout.

    Q. To let the people walk on to Leppings Lane? - A. Yes,
       that's right, they barricade it off.

    0 Do thev keep that block on all the time or only while
    Q * there are lots of crowds? - A. When there is a crowd and
        a train coming down they keep it while all tne people
        S a U d o w S 3 Salso they do that when they are c o m m g out,
        block all the road off.

    0. Just look at your plan.   Put a line o    t   ™    that
       plan where you say the road is blocked off.    Cnother
       witness marked the plan)   Can you give the lady anotn r
       unmarked plan.'  Now you remember wnere you marked it, do
       you? - A. Yes.
    0. What is the name of that road? - A. It is ta^ end of
       Leppings Lane.   It is just before Farndale Road.

    Q. Is it where the big "L" is of Leppings Lane? - A. That's
       right, yes.
                                           0.   MAYHEW


That road is actually Farndale Road.            Can you see it?

     THE CORONER:   What she has done is drawn a circle
obliterating the "LA" of Leppings Lane.

     MR. KING:   Sir, perhaps whenthe witness            has
completed, we can see what she has done.
     THE   CORONER:    Yes, I will pass it        round so you can
see what   she has actually done:
I know what you are saying now.    How long^on the 15th of
April, 1989 was that road blocked off?   What time did
they start blocking that road and what time <did they
stop, as far as you know? - A. Well, they do
last train comes.
Tell me on that day can you remember whether it was
blocked off on that day? - A. Oh, yes.

Was it blocked off right up to the time of the match or
were the blocks taken off early? - A. Oh, no, it was
taken off before the match because all tne trains
come down and the coaches.
 So you are not saying it was blocked all the time? - A.
 No, it never is.
 Can you tell me approximately what time they' sJ*°PPe£
 blocking that road? - A. I should think about half past
 two, something like that.   As near as I can    y.

 But you aren't quite sure.   In 1988, can you remember
 1988 at all, the previous year? - A. I was tnere.

 Can you remember the match when it was the
 playing, can you remember? - A. Oh, yes, tney h^
 been any trouble before.   They have been all rignt.

 We will clear up one or two other P°ints.          ^
 you thought they were L i v e r p o o l supporters and
 you deduced that because they did not have the Sheffiel
 Wednesday colours so you k n e w they had to be        i;E:f-erent
 team? - A. Well, I knew that day who was playing.            It
 on the placards all along the rails.
  In fact the two teams had very similar colours,wn° were
' p?ay?Sg that day.   Could you d i s t i n g u i s h between tne two
  teams from their colours, because it s° ™ d e d as           y
  couldn't?   I just wanted to be sure whether you knew
  what the colours were of the people wno were playing.
  A. At that time I was told it was Liverpool supporters.

. Your friend told you. - A. I don t follow football.
                                                                  4-0

Q. Did you hear any of them speak at all? - A. Oh, yes.

 Q. Are you any good at recognising accents? - A. Yes.

 Q. What sort of a c c e n t did you hear being spoken? - A.
    Liverpudlians.

 Q. You heard what sounded to you... - A * Y ®?» a r e t t e ^ a ^ ^
    cigarettes, you see, and we don t sell c 0
    that is why I knew,
 Q. Did they wear any badges or anything, rosettes or
    anything? - A. All sorts, yes.
 Q. Can you remember any of them? - A. They had scarves and
    all sorts - hats.
’ 0.     Did they have a n y    names on them apart from           A*
        Oh, yes, they had       names on the scarves and the hats.

 Q.     What did it say on the scarves? - A. It said "Liverpool

             THE CORONER:    We will give this plan a "C" number
        as well because we will be able to find it.       It is
        C.281.   Can you see the big "A" everybody            P :lan'
        Immediately below that "A" t h e r e is what looks like a
        scribble and that is the mark and that is going acros

        Lane. That is where I thought I had put it.

              THE CORONER:       Any questions of this lady?

             MR. HALE:   Only I am sorry that I missed the
        numbering of that.
              THE CORONER:       The second one will be C.281.

              MR. HALE:        No other questions.

                        Cross-Examined by MR. PAYNE:

   0.    Mrs. Mayhew, have you      got the map? - A. Yes.
   0.     Now there is a little bit of discussion ^ o u t the Place
    '     where you have marked it, but I am not going to ass you
         about ttat. What I would like you to help the jury about
         is just exactly whereabouts your garage is.      I would
         like you to point it out? - A. It s on the end
         Leppings Lane.

If you go from the bottom of LepglnSs Lane, going up the
word "Leppings", go past the " L A " you come to the
roundabout.   Do you see that on the map.

Now your garage is just on the right there at the end of
the road? - A. Yes.
On that corner of the roundabout? - A. Yes.

Are you happy with that? - A.   As youare coming    down it
it's on the right, yes.
As you are coming down Leppings Lane.     So a   ®  c0®*ur ‘
into the roundabout, with Leppings La^ e n i n d you, yo

         0. If your garage is on the right hand side of Leppings
            Lane as I look at the map? - A. Yes.

         Q.        Is that right? - A. Yes.

         Q.         So the fans, you say, were going from
     D             across your forecourt as you were looking out.
                   Ye s .

             o     I know it is difficult.  You were saying that they
                   always close the roads off when the trains come in.

Q. I ought to help you because I do f j want to be
   unkind.  In fact, only one special               JrJt
   Liverpool^that day? - A. Also t h e y had to block it _
   off because there were coaches parked up Halifax Road
       so all the coaches, with the Police m front, had
   to bring all the supporters down that way.

Q. Mrs. Mayhew, we are all grate*al.

   not like to be in your position at all. You   are
   giving us your impressions, are you not, of
   day? - A. Yes, what happened, yes.

0. Simply on the point which I know those who 1
   represent are anxious to establish, you may not have
   known this but the colours of the          teams j>;
   each other were the same.        They were both red ana
   w h i t e . D i d you know that? - A. I am not bothered
   2 S u ? football colours and that but a U       saw was
   Liverpool on their scarves and hats. That is wny
   know they were Liverpool.
               Cross-examined bv MRS. McBRIEN.:

 Q. Would you be able to differentiate between a_
    Manchester accent and a Liverpool
    imagine you could tell they were Liverpool

 Q. You would know the difference? - A. Yes.

 Q. Or even between a Liverpool accent and a Burnley
    accent? - A. Yes.
      THE CORONER:   Ladies and gentlemen, it    obvious you
 are not entirely happy with the markings but I think^we
 have got to accept what the Witness has said. We
 tried as hard as we can to establish it.
      MR HALE:     I think I am probably the only local man
 here on the Jury.   This Witness has placed the garage on
 the right hand side of Leppings Lane going down and I *a|aw
 under the impression she had previously said
 Brothers garage which to my knowledge is very large.          I
 wonder if I mly just clear that b e c a u s e i t may be I am
 under totally the wrong impression of which garage
 at?.
       THE CORONER:   By all means go ahead.

     Can I ask you first of all is the garage you are at
     the Law Brothers garage? — A. That is correct.


0     it is a very, very large one, is it not? - A. It was
      not at that time. I wasworking at that.Pa*ticular
      time but they have extended it now.  It is different
      now to what it was then.
Q. You have been asked to identify it by means of 9oi-*9
   up or down Leppings Lane. Which way do you call up
   Leppings Lane? - A. When I am coming down Halifax
   Road I call that going up Leppings Lane.

0. If you look at the plan, if you were at point A,
   which we have already looked at? - A. Yes.

Q. If you were going along Leppings Lane from there,
   would you be going up or down Leppings Lane. - A.
   would be going up.
q. on which side of the road going up is the garage that
   you worked at? - A. If you are going up it is on your
   right.
Q.    it is on the right hand side? - A. If I am going up
      Leppings Lane.
     THE CORONER:    I think we are all agreed on that, yes.

            ? - A. No, it is

    Q. Fielding Road is one of the lanes which feeds off
       Leppings Lane? - A. That is right.

    Q. In fact, it connects Leppings Lane with Penistone
       Road North, is that right? - A. That is right-

        Me and my wife took the dog for a walk.

     0. How far down Fielding Road were you living? Where is
                 Is it near the Leppings Lane end or the

        yes.
     0. When you got to the top of Fielding Road where it
        abuts on to Leppings Lane what did you see? - A.
        Quite a substantial amount of fans and I think at the
        time there was traffic because we used the pedestrian
        crossing.
         Q. So there was some traffic in the road and a lot of
            fans? - A. Yes.

            off anyway.

    Q. There was some cordon,        In what way, a rope? - A. A
       barrier.
    q   . was it manned by anybody? - A. It was.

    Q. By a Police Officer? - A. By two Police Officers.

    Q. You had no problems getting out? - A. No.

    Q. They let you through? - A. Yes.

    Q. Then when you got into Leppings Lane       ^   did
       trZ turn left or right? - A. We turned left and
       walked past the Leppings Lane entrance and up towards
       the traffic lights.
D
    q       . i think you came, as you were                       '
              near to a coffee shop.  I think it is called *fou
              Lanes Cafe or something like that? - A. Four Lane .

        Q. Is it this side of the traffic lights? - A. It is.

        0    Did you see anything in that vicinity? Anything
             specific I mean? - A. Outside we saw what we believed
             to be a fan selling tickets. I did not actually see
             anything being passed over but a crowd congregated
             and they soon dispersed again.     I think a
             Officer came near.  I c a n ’t really see that they were
             doing anything wrong but they did quickly disperse.

        Q. You saw a crowd of people together?       A. Yes.

        0. A Police Officer approached and they all dispersed

        q   . it was the impression you gained? - A. That was it.

        Q. How many people would you say were in this little
           group? - A. Possibly a dozen.

         Q. You carried on walking towards Middlewood Road m

The fans - we will forget which side they were on at
the moment - were they w a l k i n g towards you o ^ i n t h e
same direction as you? - A. Mainly walking towards
us.

in substantial numbers or what? - A \ 5 _ WShoieSSf the
ves   They were definitely covering the whole of the
pavement on the opposite side of the road on which we
were walking.  There was a steady flow.

This is about 2.20, is it not? - A. Yes.

At that point of time they were still on the pavement
a n d w e r e not spilling into the road? - A. I cannot
honestly recall.
What was your impression of the fans as they were
S    I   S     y°“ «t that time? - / - T h e y were iiust
football fans anxious to get to a football match.

How did they display that? - A. Most of them
displayed the colours of the team that they were
supporting and that is all I can say.  They w®re
heading in the general direction of the ground and
you can only aslume that is where they were going.

 What colours, can you remember? - A. Obviously red
 and white but I think it is fair to say it is a
 characteristic of away fans to try
 that they support and sometimes you will get fa
 wearing the aSay colours.   They will wear the away
 strip tops and I believe that Liverpool have or had
 an away strip of yellow.   I might be mistaken bu
 there are also the things that characterise the
 Liverpool, apart from their accents when you heard
 one or two of them talking, and that is, I think
  is, the Liver bird emblem which they wear on their
  caps and shirts.
. in your mind you were quite satisfied these were
  supporters of the Liverpool Club? - A. Yes,       *he
  fact that the prior knowledge to the game said th
  that was where the Liverpool fans were to congregate,
  at the Leppings Lane end.
. Did you   see any alcohol consumed at that time? - A .
  At that   time there was no alcohol until we actually
  crossed   over Middlewood Road and then there was
  alcohol   in abundance.
                                                                     4%

    0        How many fans are we talking about who you were
             seeing It that point when you started seeing alcohol
B            in abundance? Does it mean one fan with a lot of
             alcohol or a lot of fans or what?    What does that
             mean? - A. I would say that once we had crossed
             Middlewood Road the fans over the other side were not
             or could not be coming from any other direction other
             than the pubs they would have found up that l an® •
             which is named Wadsley Lane, because this side of
             Middlewood Road there would be just people coming
             into Sheffield, parked their cars up as a n d w h e r e
             they could, and they would be going straight to the
             match.   Over the other side where the pubs were, I
             would say progressing towards a pub calJe^ ^he Hors
             and Jockey about a half mile away, you had got ^ust
             about everybody you saw stood or walking with some
              form of alcohol whether it be in pint pojs, there
             were various forms of tinned alcohol, bottiea,
             bottles of wine.
    0. People can drink soft drinks out of cans as well.
       How did you satisfy yourself/ how can you satisfy me,
       if I can put it that way, that what they were
       carrying was alcohol as opposed to a soft drink. - .
       Well, Stones beer has been alcohol for as long as
       can remember.
        0.   y o u could read the names? - A. S o m e you could read
             the names because, in fact, I remember thinking where
             on earth have they got Stones beer from up there
             unless they were selling at a local shop.        I cannot
             think of any beer offs in that vicinity because the
             pubs up there were Whitbread pu b s .

        Q. Yousay there was a lot of this.       Were there a lot     of
           fans as well? - A.   Yes.

        Q. What are we talking about in numbers?  I am not
           expecting you to give me a precise count? - A.
           Hundreds.
        Q. What time would you say this was? You had left I
           think at twenty five to? - A. I would say it could be
           approaching twenty to three, turned half past two,
           twenty five to, twenty to as we progressed up Wadsley
           Lane.
        Q. Is that because you were actually walking away from
           the ground? - A. We were walking away from the
           ground, that is right.

The point you are now describing in that case was
what? Ten minutes’ walk away from the ground
approximately, twelve minutes, or Perhaps not qu
as long? - A. Ten minutes or less.  Obviously you are
walking back downhill.
Because it is a bit faster walking downhill I
suppose? - A. I would presume so.
Was there anything about this group of^supporters1
behaviour that struck you in any way.   A. N o , e
gathered a lot of comments as we walked up, main y
about the dog.  They seemed very friendly people.
Obviously tte fact that they had had alcohol probably
2 S ° S 2 Slightly more outward going b u V I would not
    sav they were aggressive as such.                        They were ^ ust :
boisterous but not to the point of being unruly.
    They were obviously here t o witness     ^ e y “ Ould
    imagine to be the winning of their side and they we
    certainly in high spirits.
    They liked your dog and they petted it when they got
    an opportunity? - A. One or two did.
    I do not mean hundreds but people did                          When you.saw
    these people had you   j   l   r   e   a   d   y   Kr i v e d at the B otse^
    Tockev or had you got past it? - A .                       It was in betwee
    p a s s i n g a pub called the Park Hotel which I believe
    was closed except to local people.        In between there
    and a pub called the Horse and Jockey. Y o u have got
    that couple of hundred yards. There was a steady
    flow.
    were there people at the Horse and Jockey? Did Y°u
'   s S S anybody thSre? - A. Yes, I would s a y there was at
    least a hundred just stood in the sort of outside
    area not really seeming to be making any move towards
    the ground.
     I want to just check the timings about this.  What
     time would you say you were at the Horse and
     Jockey? - A. I would say round about twenty to three.

     Not earlier? Not half past? - A. To be fair it could
     have been.  Even at the time I made m y statement it
     was difficult to say because it was not a big
     priority.
i. You were not walking around looking at your watch?
   A. Not particularly.

If you think back to where you lived for a moment,
Fielding Road, are you pretty sure about the time

that you left or is that doubtful as well? - A. No, I
think that was fairly accurate.

I f you could just think about for a moment — are you
all right? - A. Can I have a drink?

Yes, go ahead. - A. Yes.

  from the ground to shut down, so °bv       Required a

    fsSS-Snil foJ               most years since that time - d _ m y
    father being a publican I                                      say
    pvns>rience that up to and including lyo? J.
    that every year the scale of fans and a n y possible
    occurrence of trouble has got progressively worse,
    c a n sav that f r o m the amount of damage we incurred as
    publicans.             It got progressively worse f?om broken
    Sindows in the early days, which were *
     c o n c l u s i o n , to flying bottles iu the back
     serving area from various travelling fans.

 o. Where does the 1939 event then fit on “ this pattern?
    - A? Well from the events that happened 1989 was the
    crescendo.
  q. Of what? - A. well probably it was leading to something
     that eventually just got out ot hand.

      THE CORONER:  I think, Mr. Payne, I ca*
you are trying to find out but the
expressed as an opinion on matters which he has no
knowledge, so if you would like to ---

       MR. PAYNE:        I will rephrase the question.

I am only asking you to deal with the volume of ^rink^
and the amount of drink that you saw as part of a pattern
Do you see that? That is what the Coroner wants y
concentrate on? - A. Yes.
 Does that fit on to your "crescendo" Pattern? Just
 concentrate on that aspect? - A. Yes, I think tnere wa
 probably more fans any one time at m U s b G t o u g h that
 year than before and it was probably ..... f 100^ 1
 alwavs qoing to be sought after at any match.         It
 contributes towards various things.   I think when
.people are in pubs ....

 N o , d on't go o n .
        THE CORONER:       Because you weren't in the pub.

       MR. PAYNE:  It is just the behaviour of this
 particular crowd that the Court ** £nteJ®**®*       ans
 - a They were no worse than any other football fans
 for behaviour and they probably drunk no more ?ej;
 person than any other fan at fn^ 1ot^ J et^ ® b tSan Sver
 particular year there was probably more fans than ever
 before.  That was the m a i n problem.

         MR. PAYNE:       Thank you very much.


                  Cross-Examined by MR. MANNING:

  I think the house in which you used to live was in what
  the Police call a ''sterile'' area wasn't it. T h e blocKs
  at the end of the street had actually been p l a c e d tnere
  by the Police to stop fans coming m at each end o-
  both your streets and the streets that are parallel
  it? - A. Yes.
  Because they are houses occupied by people which are
  very close to the ground? - A. That is correct.

  When you walked out of your home
  and took the  route that you did, would it be fair t
  say that you were surprised by tne level of people
  that you saw   coming towards you clearly with          •
  - A It is difficult to reflect. At the time I might
  havi been surprised but I can't honestly c o m e n t on it
  at the moment. It is a characteristic of football matones
                                                                  56


                                          A. FOSTER-ASH


    0. Yes, but you have talked in answer to my learned fr^ d
       of a "crescendo” in other words what seems to be
       trend of more people with more alcohol? - A . j Q t a o r e
       alcohol per person, more alcohol m proportion t
B      number of people.
    o     Thank you. - A. I think it is fair to say that I don't
          make a habit of going out on match days ^n d wa i k i n g
           through the fans, it was just by chance that I
         • happen to be out there.
    Q. Without trying to pin this to minutes «        seconds at all,
          the fact of the matter is that on the rou_e uxia /
          took and the pace that you w e fe .w^ n| (}i^tW^ epr^a?liest
          something of the order of certain y *           Horse and
          and probably 2.40 by the time you got to the Horse and
          Jockey? - A. That is correct.
    O     And when you got to the Horse and Jockey there were 100
          o f so people Stood outside the Horse and Jockey? - A. That
          is correct.

D   Q. And the words that you used were not rea11^ ^ e^ n?heTl
       to make any move towards the ground? - A. Many o, them
       weren't, many of them were.
     0. Unless as you thought possible some of them had just come
        for the day out to travel but not h a v i n g tickets for t
        match, it would be surprising to you if they were
        supporters intending to go to the match that they were
        still outside the Horse and Jockey at 2.30/2.35/2.4
        drinking and seemingly not moving on? - A. xes.

        O And when you went past the Horse and Jockey and continued
        Q ' again away from the ground, there were still people some
            of iSom were coming out of public houses ana some of whom
            you thought were people who had had to par* quite a o ■  g
            distance away from the ground and were hur^ J n9 ^ " s e
            it-5 — A There was just one public house past tn i
            and Jockey anS S a t ' i s the wldsley Jack. There was a
            few, not many.
        Q. There were a few. Were people coming out and going to
           the ground or again standing and not appearing to move
           or some of each? - A. Well we could not a c u u a l l y see
           into the drinking area, the outside drinking area
           the car park but it certainly was not as busy a n d there
           were just one or two people coming down the road in ui
           direction of the ground.

        Q. It would be right to say all the more so if the °£®s " ho
           had been down at the Horse and Jockey were going to be
           very much touch and go whether they could get down to
           the ground and get in on time, the ones who were fu£the
           away certainly were not going to be able to do so, tney
           were going to be late, v/eren't they? - A. That is correct
                                            Q. And having given us ...

    0. And having given us as wall as you could possibly do
       the overall impression, there are none the less
       specific people that you reraeaber when you describe
       them as "Some fans had probably a bit too smca • - A.
B      Yes.

    0. Thank you very much indeed.

                      Cross-Examined by :~iR. KING

    0. iir. Foster-Ash I an* sure you appreciate tnat tne only
       evidenc which this Inquest can listan^to froa yourseli.
       is what you actually saw, and tnat isn t a criticise ot
C      you at all. There were questions being asked to you by
       ray learned friend Hr. Payne wnich seecaed to be giving
       you the opportunity of giving your opinion of way the^
       Hillsborough disaster occurred in 193>, but you weren t
       trying to do that were you, or v/ere you? - A. It is not
       ay intention to give an opinion. All I can do is say
       what I saw.

    0. Right, because you sea you gave this line to^tay learned
D      friend, "1939 was a crescendo of things getting out of
       hand” , but you didn't see anything getting out of hand,
       did you? - A. It would depend how you construe out of
       hand.

    Q. Let me take it step by step.  You make no criticism of
       unruliness, do you? - A. Not particularly.

    0. It is not a matter of not particularly.  It is your
£      evidence, isn't it, that to be fair tney were
       boisterous, these people you saw, but not unruly? - A.
       Correct.

    0. That is your evidence.   Your evidence isn't that you
       saw anyone breaking windows.   Tnat is your evidence,
       isn't it? - A. That is right.

    0.    You didn't see anybody throwing bottles, taat is your
          evidence? vrnat your evidence is, i£ we just look at
F         the evidence, is that when you cane out of your house
          and moved into Leppings Lane you saw people coning
          along Leppings Lane towards the ground, tnat is tne
          first stage, isn't it? - A. Yes.

     Q.   Can Ishow you a photograph, and tnis is a photograph
          taken at around 14.25 - 25-roinutes-past-2.  .»e don t
          know exactly what tl.aa it would be snen you got into
          Leppings Lane but you say you left about 2J-oast? - A.
          Miam•

     0. You can't be precise but you can tell us tnat the road
        clearly still had traffic in it, fron imat you
remember? That is right, isn't it? - A. I tninsc tnei.e
was still traffic.

Yes, so I am going to show you this photograph,     rirst
of all I aai going to a s k you if you can identity crow
it your road.
     HR. KING:   Sir, so there is no mystery, this is a
bundle of photographs which was produced, if I am n g n t
through the South Yorkshire Police, for tne purposes or
Lord Justice Taylor's Inquiry.  They had timings on
them and they were produced as photographs taicen at the
tilings on them.
     THE CORONER:   Mr. King, I will let you introduce
this photograph because I tnink that it is right tnat
you should have an opportunity to deal with this issue
of the opinion, but perhaps I could say that I am
exceedingly reluctant to start introducing the
photographs in this way because you can see '.»nat
problems we have already got with our exhibits. Tnis
is MWL10/20A, and "C" number 282.

     MR. KING:   Before it is shown to thewitness, can
I just clarify something for my learned friend?

     THE CORONER:   Yes.  I don't want to he
obstructive, it is just that we nave got to be careful
otherwise everything will get totally out of hand.
Carry on.
     HR. KIIiG;  Sir, can I explain, it wasn't my
intention before I heard the evidence to introduce
these photographs to this witness.

      THE CORONER;   Yes, I appreciate tnat.    That is
 the reason why I have agreed.

      MR. KING:     Sir, this is a pnotograph   wnicn hason
 it this reference, :-JUL10/20A, and for the benetit of
 those of my learned friends, the Jury and others, who
 were not present at the Taylor Inquiry can I tell
 everybody — and those who were there will know wnat. I
 am talking about - that the timings on tnase
 photographs were checked and there is attached to tne
 album an analysis of the times, and what tna actual
 time was when it was taken, so that if there were any
 errors they were   analysed and discovered. As far as
 this particular   photograph is concerned it    was actually
 taken at 14.25.   It actually has stamped on it 14.«.o,
 and so the Jury can see, it has actually on red 14.25.
 Members of the Jury, it is no secret - I an the one wno
 did that for my own benefit.    I didn't realise you vere
                                                              59

       ail going to see what I have been up to.   Let sae snow
       tnis to the witness:

    Q. Does that show - I think it is a shop with "Dunlop     on
B      tne sice? - A. Yes.

    0. VJhere is that shop in relation to the Leppings Lane
       ground?   Is that vary close to the turnstile.

            HR. PAYNE:   I wonder if before the witness
       answers - there is another copy of this paotograpn nere
       and although it will mean the Jury having to share, I
       wonder if it would be helpful if they had it in front
       of thea so that they could follow the questions?
C
            THE CORONER:   Yes.

            MR. PAYNE:    There is, in fact, quite a large
       bundle here and I know at the moment iSr. King is not
       referring to the rest of the bundle so I have opened it
       at the pnotograph.

            THE CORONER:   Do you want to check that?
D
            MR. KING:   I think the exposure is very different
       but th photograph is the same.   It is not tne one I
       would put in my holiday albun.  Sir, peraaps I will
       invite the Jury in due course to see the one waicn I
       have shown the witness, which is pernaps clearer.

            MR. RUSSELL:   I have a further copy which is
       perhaps a better exposure.
E
            MR. KING:    Sir, I wonder if I rnight borrow the
       one from tne Jury for tnv question and nv learned
       friend's could be passed round because it clearly is
       better.  Sir, I don't know wnethar iay learned friends
       want an opportunity to see it before I pursue my
       questioning.   I as happy to allow thetn so to do.  I
       look at the clock, sir ....

F           THE CORONER:   Yes, I have been looking at tne
       clock as well.  Do you want to see the photograph at
       this stage or shall we just proceed for a few raare
       minutes and see how far we get?

    Q. You had some problems, I think, with regard to
       availability, didn't you? - A. Yes.

    0. What time do you have to be away?  I can't remember
       now. - A. I have got an appointment at half-past-1, or
       ratner I did.

    0. I/think we will press on.  I a:n not promising you will
       make it but we will do our best. - A. well, it has been
       made flexible and it has been re-arranged to nalf-past-
       2.
B   0. well, we will still press on.

            MR. KING:      I think we ought to press on:

    0. Don't hold it against me. - A. well I      might.

    0. Look at the photograph - we see, it looks like a shop,
       and alongside it is the word "Dunlop” ? - A. Yes.

    0. If one went past that shop going down the road would we
       cone to your road? - A. If you follow tne line of
       houses, the frontages, you have got four frontages then
       a break. The break is just a yard entrance.   Follow
       the next line and you come to a poster with a lorry on.
       That is the road.

    0. That is the      road you come out   of?   -    A. Yes.
D   0. And then you turn left and you would come up the road
       where we sea people obviously on the pavernant coding
       past tne houses? - A. Yes.

    Q. And if one continued on past where the photographer is,
       would we come actually to the turnstiles at tne
       Lepp ngs Lane end? - A. You   would reach the tnain
       entrance in   about 30 yards, I     would say.

    0. Yes, there are no more houses after the "Dunlop” sign?
       - A. There is a block.    There is a barber's snop and
       th .n a small sweet shop.

    Q. So we are almost at the end? - A. Yes.

    0. Froa your   aemor/ and recollection, does_the photograpn
       snow what   you recall of what was happening in Leppings
       Lane whan   you canie out at around tnat tioie? - A. I
       would say   so, yes.

    Q. Looking at it, clearly there is not question, just
       looking at that photograph, of any sort of unruliness,
       of anybody getting out of hand or anything, on that
       photograph,' is tnere? On the face of the photograph? -
       A. On the face of the photograph, no.

     0. I know it is sometimes said caaecas can't lie - pernaps
        they can.  I will deal with that perhaps when we cowa
        to looking at tne evidence as a wnole, but just dealing
        then with your recollection, you then cross into the
        lane you have described, which I nave forgotten the

      name of - wadsley Lane? - A. Yes.  uadsley Lane is some
      difference from where we are in the photograph.

    Q. If we look at our plan, you cosne out of Fielding Road,
       which we can see, you turn left, and tnen you nave to
B      pass Vere Road, then you aave to pass the football
       ground, don't you, and then you come to the road
       junction? - A. Yes, that is right.

    Q. When you got into Wadsley Lane the picture you have
       painted to us is simply of fans who to your view were
       no different from other fans you had seen at other
       football matches? That is your evidence? - A. Tnat is
       correct.

       You make no criticism of thera as far as tneir behaviour
       to you is concerned, do you? - A. Kone at all.

       Indeed, you went as far as to say,fdon|t you, that one
       of them patted your dog? - A. That's right.

    Q. It wasn't a hostile act, it was a friendly act, wasn't
       it? - A. Yes.
D
    0. So putting your evidence of what you saw actually in
       Leppings Lane itself, you didn't sea anything which
       would lead you to say, "Here is something getting out
       of hand", that is true, isn't it, in Leppings Lane? -
       A. In Leppings Lane itself that is true.

       And as far as what you saw in Uadsley Lane and going up
       to the public houses, what your evidence is, is that
       none of the behaviour could be described as unruly, and
       that is your evidence? - A. The individual behaviour,
       that is right.

    0. Thank you.

            THE CORONER    Anything else?   well, we aave dons
       rather better - yes, Mr. Payne?

            HR. PAYNE:   How the photograph has been produced
       I wonder if I might be allowed  to ask a further
       question or two about what can be seen in the
       photograph, sir?

            THE CORONER:    If you wish, certainly.

            MR. PAYNE:   I don't know  if the Jury are in a

     Jury and there are four rows.  Hayoe we will be
     gat a few more copies, but perhaps it does underline
     the need - I realise that you couldn t c.o any»nin6
     about it and I am not criticising you in any sansa ot
     the word, but it illustrates the problems i*. one
B    doesn't have enough copies of whatever xt is tnat on_
     is looking at.
           MR. SI UGz  I agree, sir, and I might have s.oae
      submissions generally on that matter.

             THE COROHER:       I am not in any sense criticising
      you.
             HR.   KI.,G:    I am obliged, sir.

      Now, the entrance to the ground, Hr. Ash - look at tne
      photograph, won't you? The entrance to trie ground is
      behind the photographer's right shoulder, is it. - -.
      That is rignt.

D    . And your street is up to the rigiit as we look at tne
       pnotograph - I haven't got a copy in tront ot me. - A.
       Yes, that is right.
     . And the fans at the time shown on the photograph, wnich
       Mr. King corrects to 2.25, they are walking aown on tne
       paveraent and just in the road thera is a line or
       Policemen, is that right? - A. Yes.

    u. And i the foreground there isa Policenorse?                 “ A.
       That is correct.

    Q. And if you look at the photograph, in the distance
       tnere is anotner Police norse.    It can be just maaa out
       at the t p of tha photograph?   - A. Yes.
       From what you saw would an appropriate word               to cascrioa
       this lina of Policemen, would it be fair to               use the
       word that there is a cordon of Police along               tne road,
       keeping tha fans on tha pavament, trying to               keep trie
       road clear? - A. Yes, that is fair to say.

    Q. And this cordon o f .Police than extended, we can see in
       trie photograph, a good way up Lappings Lane, as we <-an
       s -v ? — A • Ye 3 •

            THE COROtlER:         As far as one can see in the
       photograph, yes.
              MR. P a YNE:      I was just going to ask about that:




H
When you came -out of your road, Fialdings Lane, if one
looked to the right that would take you off tne
pho'tograph? - A. Yes.

Wouldn't it, at the top? Did the cordon axtana further
up tne road in that direction? - A. when wa came out of
Fielding Road there w~s certainly no horses.   I can t
tell you that from remembering but if tiiera had been
the dog would have gone a bit wild.

Sight. That is very helpful because we have got you
coming out at 2.20, you said you sat off on your walk.
2.20 - "I went out. Me and the wife took the dog for a
walk" - and this photograph was at 2.25, five ninutes
later, so on that basis it looks as if these Police
horses nmst have taken up station between 2.20 and
2.25. - A. It seems that way.

So whan you canie out were the line of Policemen on
foot, ware they then in position as we can see or ...?

     THE CORQKER:   Can you just stop one minute while
the reporter takes that 'phone out?  I a^i sorry, it
distracted me and I didn't catch your question.

     MR. PAYNE:   I was asking, when he came out onto
Lepp ngs Lana, he doesn't remember the horsecnen, so
that must put them arriving within the next five
minutes if Mr. Ash is right, and I am asking now about
the Policemen on foot:

Whether they ware in position when you casia out? - A.
The only Policemen I remember were the ones at tna end
of Beech Road controlling tha barriers.

I see, so if there v/ere a - I usa tha word - cordon of
Policemen - pernaps it is not exactly right, but a line
of Policemen, you didn't notice it at 2.20? - A. .Jot
specifically.

tfhat time did you get home? - A. I think we arrived
nome about between 10-past and 20-past-3.

Thank you.

     iiR. KING:  Sir, might I just ask a very snort
question arising out of that?

      THE CORONER;   Yes.

          Further Cross-Examined by MR. :CIIIG

 Is your evidence tnan, Mr. Foster-Ash, that whan you
 caaa out of Fieldins Lane the only Police you
remembered seeing ware those who- v/ere blocttii^ otf tne
sida roads? - A. They were the only ones I can reaenber
because of personal contact.

Yes, thank you very much.
     THE CORONER:   I atn very much obliged to you.  It
depends where your appointment is - you raight even aasce
it at 1.30 - but I an obliged to you. ThanK you cor
being here and you may leave us. - A. Thank you.

      THE COROHER:   Wow, we are going_to rise in two
niinutes but I just have to say two things. Tne first
is this business about when we are going to deal witn^
the submissions.   I understand tnat your colleague, ..t.
Isaacs is only, I repeat only, available on Friday_
morning, which I understand is jolly inconvenient tor
you, but th difficulty is that if I ans going to
inconvenience somebody --- is Friday morning a 11
together inconvenient for you or is it just tne i.-iu
bit that is inconvenient?
     MR. MANHIS'G:  It is all together inconvenient
sir, but having said which, I nave said what I have to
say.  I thi k that either Mr. Hale, wao will be nere,
or Mr. Isaacs who will be coming specially, and tnere
will be somebody from ay office here altnough I would
have preferred ....
      THE CORONER:    I am glad you have said that
 because ay feeling is that as it was ur. Isaacs
 submission, if you like - he took the lead in it anyway
 - it would be right, if I have to cnoose, to allow ni..i
 to be h re, so I hope you will forgive ae,^ir. uanning.
 Is tfiat convenient for everybody else? V. j Q Friday
 morning, and we will press on with our legal
 submissions then.

          THE CORONER:    I don't think we are going to_get
     through all the witnesses I have warned.     The first tew
     days are obviously guesswork.     There are four whom I
     would like to deal with if at all possible 1^ a u s e tney
     are what I call the lay witnesses.     1 know it is hard
     police officers but they                        tham that
     Helavs and I have asked o u t Officers to alert
     the chances of their being called today is very remote.

          I hope vou don't think I am being cruel or u^ nd
     but obviously it is more convenient to allow the 1 y
     people.
           We are going to take the next witness       slightly out
     of   order. It is Diane Guilland-Cummmg.

               DIANE FINDLAY GUILLAND-CUMMING Sworn

                          Bv THE CORONER:

   bus?   Where did you get off the bus. - A. At
   Hillsborough corner.
0     Where is that in relation to the football ground? - A .
      Well, as I do n’t go to football m a t c h e s it is abit
      difficult, but I think it is ten to fifteen minute* a           y,
      walking.
0. When you say Hillsborough corner, which roads
   Hillsborough corner? What shops are there?    What snop
   did you go to? - A. I went up towards tne football
   ground, the main road.
                                           D.   F . GUILLAND-CUMMING


That's Middlewood Road, is it? - A. That's rignt.                 I
went to the Co-op.   I went to my butcher.

What's -the name of him, do you know? - A. The butcher?

Yes. - A. He has shifted now.
OK, carry on. - A. Then I       w e n t   to Safeways.

    Is that in Middlewood Road as well? - A; Yes.             All tne
    shops I went to were on Middlewood Road.

    Did you get as far as   Wadsley Lane? - A. No.

    So you were this side of Wadsley Lane, more towards the
    centre of Sheffield? - A. Yes.
    You estimated about a ten minutes' walk from the football
    ground? - A. I think it would be about that, yes.

    At about 2.20 or so you went into the Co-op to do some
    shopping? - A. That's correct.

    Once you were inside that store did you notice
    - A. Yes, I noticed young people buying quantities
    alcohol.
    Were these young people...    Let]s deal with tne
    Quantities.   What sort of quantities were they
    purchasing that you can recollect? - A. I
    buying four cans each.  Some of them even nad six cans,
    or two litre bottles of beer.
    These were mainly young men or young women or mixed? - A.
    No, they were all young men.
    Did they appear to you to be          supporters of any particular
    football t e L ? - A. They had        red and white scarves on.

.    Did they wear any other distinguishing marks atall?         - A.
    Some of them did h a v e t n o s e scarves tnat nad tnattunny
    little thing in the middle.

. An emblem? - A. Yes.
. What do you associate that emblem with?              Which team?- - A.
  Oh, I know that is Liverpool s...
. You knew that? - A. I didn’t know then, I              did after all   .
  the publicity.
. You are quite sure which you discovered is
  with Liverpool was on some of the scarves of ,he people
  you saw? - A. Yes.

0         The reason why I ask you is that red and white is by
Q ‘      S L c e the colour...    Both teams have the s a m e colours,
         so red and white doesn't necessarily d, 1 3tinSVJsn^ *     r
         teams.    Did you hear any of them speak?     Did you hear
         the sound of their voices? - A. I wouldn t even
         recognise...
Q.       You wouldn't be able to tell the accent anyway?      - A. No.

Q.       Any rosettes on any of the people you saw? - A.      Oh, yes,
         some of them had rosettes on.

0. Could you see what was on those rosettes or           u '
 " just red and white? - A. Red and white.   I wasn t really
   looking.
Q. How many would you say were in the store purchasing? - A.
   In the Co-op?   There would have been more than ten.
   They were in a group.
0.        Then you left the Co-op and went    to Safeways? - A. Yes.

Q.        Which is how many yards from the    Co-op, approximately?
         A. Twenty-five.

 Q.       Quite close? - A. Yes.
 Q.      Was the situation the same?Were there youngsters m
         there as well? - A. Yes.
 0. How many would you say you saw           there?- A.   Againabout
    ten to fifteen.
 0. As far as their behaviour was concerned was that   J^ny
    wa y... - A. They were very noisy and some    t^em
    obviously been drinking.    They gave the attitude that
    they weren't going to take no for an answer.

    0. They didn't actually speak to you or         approach you? - A.
       Oh, no.
    0. You mean in the way they approached the shop assistants,
       is that what you are saying?  - A. Yes,and the way t ey
       marched into the shop.
    0.     Were you    already in the shop when they came in? - A. Yes.

    Q.     Did you feel you had to move out of the way?      - A. I got
          out of the way, yes.
    Q.     You were    in the store for a little while andthen         did you
          come out again? - A. Yes.

Did you then see another crowd of youngsters? - A.
there were obviously lots of people around.      The ot
crowd that I really remarked were a                     °^t
of a pub which is on the corner.    I c a n t remember wnat
it is called^-  The Freemason s Arms, I thxnic.

Fisherman’s Arras? - A. Th a t ’s right.  There was        a crowd
came out of there and that would h a v e been about        twen y
to three and they were obviously heading for the           mate
but they would have had trouble getting there in           time.

I think you have said you thought it was about a ten
minute walk, or so? - A. Yes.
And it was twenty to three or thereabouts when you saw
them come out? - A. Yes.
How many approximately would you say? - A. More than
fifty.   The bus came before they stopped coding out of
the pub.
You were waiting to get on a bus? - A. Yes, I was waiting
to get on the bus.
Did they appear to you to have taken alcohol or not? - A.
Oh, yes.
You are very confident on that. What makes you feel
that? - A. It was the way they were walking and sort of ^
s lurching.  There was y o u n g lad who
to hold ud the traffic.
                                                          an^f1tr™d
                             At H i l l s b o r o u g h corner, it you
kno w Hillsborough,    that was a very dangerous        thing to do.

You did not see violence or anything of that sort? - A.
No, I didn’t see anybody pushing anybody or...

 Are there any other words which you can use to give us,
 particularly the jury, an impression of what you saw in
 relation to!.. - A . Am I allowed to be subjective?

 You are allowed to be subjective, but you aren't allowed
 to comment.    You are not allowed to give us tne
 explanation as to why it happened, but you are a!llow.ed
 be subjective. - A. No, I wouldn t do that.           _   , |
 that I was trving to explain that I have lived in tnat
 area since 1981 and I have often been down Hillsborougn
 shopping on a Saturday and I have never felt an
 atmosphere like there was there that day.          I said to my
 butcher, "There's going to be_trouble here coday.           He
 said, "Yes, I think you are n g n t . ^ _ Itf.wa®*
 odd.    I think it was perhaps s o m e t n m g to do with
 weather, it was fine, but there was a really tense
 atmosphere there.

Because you regularly go shopping on a Saturday
afternoon in that a r e a ? ^ A. That is true. Probably
normally I would have been'a bit earlier.

You say you might have been earlier? - A. Yes.

             Cross-examined bv MR. PAYNE:

Dr. Cumming, are you a Doctor of Medicine? - A .   No, I
eon a Biochemist.
Was there something you were going to say a moment
ago about the difference in behaviour about those who
you first saw when you first arrived in the area and
those you saw while you were waiting for the bus? —
A. There was a difference.

Can you explain that? — A. What I mean is that when I
first went down I think the people I saw were
generally going to the match and probably when I was
first down there it was just after two.  It was about
ten past two and, though I have no evidence for this,
of course, I think they probably had tickets whereas
the ones I saw buying all those cans of beer they
could not drink them in the time before the match I
am sure.  They could not take them in and I believe
those ones and the ones who were late out of the pubs
probably did not have tickets.

     THE CORONER:    You do not know? - A. I do not
know that.

      THE CORONER:   That is a surmise.

     MR. KING:  It was what you saw about their
behaviour which is what the Jury would like to
know? - A. That is right, there was a difference.

I know it is difficult to convey in words but can you
describe it? What would the Jury have seen of the
difference if they had been there? - A. The later
ones were much more aggressive and also much more
apparently drunk.
             Cross-examined bv MR. MANNING:

 It was your impression of the ones who were buying
 the drink that they certainly did not seem to be
 hurrying down to the ground? - A. That is correct.

    Q. It was your view, knowing how long it would take to
       walk, that they would have a hard job to get there on
B      time if that is what they were intending to do? - A.
       That is correct, yes.

    Q. Their prime purpose at that time seemed to be to buy
       drink? - A. That is right.

                    Cross-examined bv MR. KING:

    Q. You are a Doctor of Biochemistry I understand? - A.
       That is correct.

    Q. You are a scientist? - A. Yes, I suppose so.

    Q. Science is the discipline which investigates facts
       and draws conclusions from facts? - A. That is
       correct.
    Q. Science is not a discipline which deals with
D      preconceived assumptions and then paints a picture
       from those assumptions.  That would be an art, would
       it not? An artist takes a canvas, takes a brush and
       paints from his paint without reference to any
       necessary facts outside and paints a picture.  Do you
       see what I mean? — A. Oh yes, but unfortunately there
       are a lot of scientists like that as well.

    Q. Of course, scientists who are like that would not be
       true scientists, would they? - A. I really do not
       want to get into this argument.

    Q. You could not rely upon their conclusions, could you?
       - A. You can't.

    Q. Somebody who has preconceived ideas and who then
       draws conclusions is not a person we can rely on for
       safe conclusions.  That is fair, is it not? — A. In a
       fair world, yes.

    Q. You gave evidence just before that those who came out
       of the pub later were the ones who did not have
       tickets? - A. That is what I said.  That is in my
       opinion.

    Q. You could not possibly as a scientist have any
       factual evidence for that whatsoever, could you? - A.
       No, I did not even know they were going to the match,
       did I?
                                           D- GUILLAND-CUMMING

Q. No.  So why were you prepared to say that they did
   not have tickets when you had no factual knowledge
   whatsoever? ~ A. As I say X did not even know they
   were going to the match.

Q. Why were you, as a scientist coming to help the
   Inquests, prepared to say they were people without
   tickets? - A. Because how were they going to get in?

Q. Perhaps they had tickets.  I am sure you want to be
   fair in the evidence you are giving, do you not? ~ A.
   Oh yes.

Q. You want to paint a truthful picture? - A. Yes.

Q. You do not want to exaggerate? - A. No.

Q. Can I just ask you one or two other matters? - A.
   Yes, certainly.

Q. The total number of young men you saw in the shops
   buying what you say were cans were how many? - A. To
   be honest, I did not stop to count them.

Q. No. - A. Probably altogether about thirty.

Q. You are telling the Inquest about purchases of cans
   by about thirty people? ~ A. That is correct.

q   .   if i tell you - and you can take it from me - that
        there were about 55,000 people attending the match,
        can you as a scientist tell me what the percentage is
        which thirty represents to 55,000? - A. Ah, but are
        we going to extrapolate and take the whole time as
        well because do not forget that is only one person
        seeing that many people in a particular span of time?

Q. In other words, what you are saying is that we should
   make assumptions by either side of your span of time?
   - A. I think this is futile.

     THE CORONER:   I think what she is saying is that she
saw thirty people or whatever it might be at a particular
point in time and that is all she is saying.

   MR. KING:   Indeed, sir, but the point I am making that
in a question how dangerous it is to make assumptions and
that is why I am asking the question.

      THE CORONER:   We must get this right.  She did make
 an assumption regarding the tickets and although I
 disallowed the answer I did permit you to deal with it
                                          D- GUILLAND-CUMMING
  ✓                                              -

because I thought that that was right but she made no
assumption and made no statement with regard to the — she
did not extrapolate, to use her word, from her thirty to
your 55,000. Whether you want to extrapolate is another
matter.
     MR. KING:   In order to help ourselves we have to put
the evidence in context and it is terribly important
because if we get a snapshot and build a whole from a
snapshot we could build a very false picture.

     THE CORONER:   Indeed, and that is one of the reasons
why I am not very keen on photographs if I can just
interject that as an aside but carry on.

      MR. KING:   I have no further questions.

                  Cross-examined bv MRS. McBRIEN:

Q. Dr. Guilland-Cumming, when you saw the fan trying to
   stop the traffic in the roadway, would you not have
   expected somebody in authority to have checked that
   fan? If you saw the fan doing that, would you not
   think there would be some sort of organisation that
   day to look out for any problems, even small ones?

     THE CORONER:    Mrs. McBrien, we have had two lots of
cross-examination about opinions.     I have just had a
conversation with Mr. King and you are now asking for
another opinion as to what this witness, who happened to
have been shopping, might think as to what would happen.
We could ask a hundred thousand people who have no expert
knowledge and they could all give us a hundred thousand
differing opinions    and none of them would be worth
anything.  So that is not a proper question.

        MRS. McBRIEN:     Can I put it in another way please?

        THE CORONER:     Please do,if you can.

Q.        MRS. McBRIEN:    Did you see anybody checking that
      fan? - A. No, but at that particular moment in time
      they were n't any Policemen on Hillsborough corner.

        MRS. McBRIEN:    Thank you, that is all.

     THE CORONER:   Do you want to ask another question
because it might just help? In fact, I will ask it for
you.

Q. You say at that point in time there were no Policemen
   at Hillsborough.  Did you notice any Policemen in
                                                            n   ftniLL&Nrc-CUMMING

     THE CORONER:   Mrs. McBrien, doyou want to add
something because that follows from your question?

McBrien.
         MRS. MCBRIEN:               Thank you.

q   . x think that initially in the early part of ^ m o r n i n g
      you were disappointed, if I can put it like that, with
      the volume of trade which was coming your way?           No,
      about lunchtime.  There was u s u a U y at matches many more.

       quarter-to-3 you were not very busy? - A. No«. as busy
       as the year before, no.
    Q. So when was the busiest time in your shop in this year?
       - A. 2 o'clock.
    Q. But that includes the time you just gave me you said
       from 1 o ’clock to quarter-to-3? - A. Yes. it :
       as busy as it was the year before.

    Q. Not at all? - A. No.

    0. In effect you anticipated taat there would be a bit of
B      congestion? - A. Yes, from British Steel where I work^
       you can see the motorway.   We are just off junction 34,
       and I can see the volume of    traffic c o m i n g off,and I
       thought they have got to come down Attercliffe, iftney
       come from one way they have got to come down
       Attercliffe Common, which I have got to go down as
       well, so there was no point in me hurrying, trying to
       ^6t • • • •

       Lane? - A. I actually left about two, out I thought,

       had of it? - A. ;.»o, it's raised, sir. You can see -
       the motorway is up in the air, if you lirte, and you can
       see the volume of traffic,    isow, Shepcote Lane is
       actually one of the exits £rom the motorway, so you can
       see them coming down that way.

    Q. I see, and at wnat point would    you say tne maximum
       volume of traffic was going? -    A. we had been watc-iin-g
       them all morning, sir. We nad     been watcning tnem since

       at 12 or 1? - A. Just as heavy.

    Q. Just as heavy? - A. Just as   heavy. That is why I
       decided - normally when I leave Shepcote Lane I would
       turn right to Attercliffe but I thought I would turn
       left and go away from town.

    0. And in fact,I think you decided that you would pop into
       a local pub? - A. Yes, sir.    .iell, there was no point

    u. At Darnall? - A. Darnall, yes.
B
       v.7hich is in the opposite direction I think? - A. Yes,
       but you can also double back down onto Atterclitfe.

    0. And you stayed there for a little while? - A. Yes, sir,
       for about half an nour.

    u, And tnan you sat off fro.a that pub at about wnat tine?
       - A. About half-past-2, 25-past^ half-past-2, about
       that.

       And you drove along various roads and eventually you
       finished up in Heapsend Lane? - A. Heepsend, yes.

    0, And in ileepsand Lane the traffic was bad? - A. Ihe
       traffic was bad compared to what it normally is, y s s.

       How close to Hillsborough is Neepsend Lane? - A. The
D      end of Neepsend Lane, where it crosses Penistone Road,
       I would say about a mile and a half, a aiile and a
       quarter.  I have never actually measured it.

       l.That was slowing tha traffic? - A. There was lots of
       people.    There is four pubs on Neepsend Lane, and taere
       was lots of people outside the pubs, and people walking
       as well, but the ones who ware walking weren t on the
        r ad, they ware on the pavement.   I think it was just,
       when you come to the traffic lights at the end of
        Neepsend Lane tnat crosses Penistone, I think the
       volume of people coining bota ways was actually slowing
        the traffic up.

    0. I s=e, but as far as you were concerned, there were
       lots of people about but they were eitnar on pub
       foregrou ds? - A. Yes.

    0. Or on pavements? They weren't wandering around? - A.
       Tney waren't, no.

    0. I have to ask you, were these all Sneffield people or
       were they supporters? - A. To ma thay were supporters.

    Q. They appeared to be supporters? - A. Yes, but again,
       before tne question is asked, tney were all rad ana
       wnite and I know both teams play in red and wnite so,
       geographically they should cosne frorn ilottingna.ri but


    0. 'fas, indeed what you ara saying is that in theory they
       ought to be ^ottingliaa supporters, in that area? - A.

       Iti tnaorv, but colours are colours and both Learns are
       very well s pported.

    0. You didn't near anybody snout? - A. i<o, sir, I was
B      driving.   I was too busy trying to get nome.- I aaa
       been u,; since quarter-past-o.            -

    Q. So you can't tell who they were? - A. No.

       Except tnat they were supporters? - A. Except tnere
       were lots of people. The volume of people really
       surprised me, that was the main taing.

    y, Can you give me a figure, now many? - A. I know I said
       in my statement a thousand, but again I was driving, I
       wasn't really counting, but it did seem to me an awful
       lot of people.

       And we have gone over this several times already, out
       were they carrying cans of ...? - A. Lots ot people
       were, sir.

D      was it alcohol they were carrying, as far as you could
       see? - A. Well, to me ....

       It looked like it? - A. Yes, but again I was driving.
       I wasn't actually looking at every individual person.

       You have mentions four public houses in Meepsend^Lane.
       Do you know their names? - A. I shall try.   I can t
       remember the one on tne right-hand side, but tnere is
       the Gardener's Fvest on the left-hand side, tnere is tne
       Victoria Hocel, but it is more commonly called the
       Monkey, and tne Owl is tne one further on.   I can t
       reiaeaber

       The other one is called the Crown, I think.        l .M
       Crown, that1s right.

       It is fait'" to say that although there were all tnesa
       youngsters about at tnese pubs, as far as you were
       conc m e    they were all perfectly well beaavad? - A.
       Yes, there'was nobody bothering tne.

       The onlv thing that you noticed was that it was a good
       walk from there? - A. Yes, and the crowd and tae tima
       barr er.  I remember thinking at the time, now are tasy
       going to snake it for the kick off, it's as gooc mile
       and a quarter.

       How long woul you have estimated a walk from taat
       area? - A. It takes .Tie 15 minutes to walk a mile, so I
       would say about 20 minutes, 20 minutes naif an nour.

             Aad we are talking about 2.45? - A. Yes, sir.

          0 . Did you do tnis journey, by chance, in 1933? - A. Yas,
              sir. Well, I don't know.   I can't remember, because I
      B       work alternate weekends.

             So you might not have been there? - A. I migat not nave
             done, but it doesn't stick in my memory in 19o3, let 5
             put it that way.

             Did anythi   else strike you? - A. So. The thing^ t a a t '
             struck me most was the volume of people at that time,
             si .
             Yes, and the distance from the ...? - A. And the
             distance from the ground, yes.

                          Cross-Examined by MR. PAYNE

             Hr. Eckford, you drove to Meepsend Lane, where your
             first impression was that the traffic was bad compared
             witn normal? - A. Yes, sir.
      D      Do you mean normal when' there is a football match? - A.
             Yes.

          Q« And what was it that was holding up the traffic? - A.
             Like I explained to the Coroner, my impression was tie
             amount, the volume of people going along .Jeepsend Lane
                                                                   1C
             and tne same amount coming along Penistone, tne tra£i.i
             just couldn’t --- I go directly across Penistone Aoaa
             and I think that was what was noIcing me up.   It toov
      £      me longer to get across.

             You had set off on your journey from tne Sportsman at
             about 2.25 to 2.30? - A. Approximately, sir, yes.

             Which makes you arrive at this trarfic hold up at w.iat?
             - A. Normally it is about a 15 minute arive from cnere,
             so I would say again between 20-to and quarter-to-3.

          Q., A map has been circulating, and tnere it is in front ot
              you.  If you look in the bottom right-hand corner of
              the map can you see iieepsend Lane just coming on? - A.
              I can, yes.

           0. Where it joins Penistone .-load? - A. Yes.

           0. That is tae junction you have been tailing aoout, is
              it? - A. Yes, sir.

           0. And it is tnare that the volume of football supporters
              was holding up the traffic? - A. .ell I can spaa< more
              of -iee^send Lana tnan I can on Penistone, because lice

     I ,say I only cross Penistone, but tae impression I was
     *atti    of way it was taking so long to get to tnat
     junction was because of the volume of people, so i can

                                             J. ECKFORD



    O. So the volume... -       A. I can really only speak about
       Neepsend Lane.
    0    The volume of people you are talking about, is it on
    Q ' 1 A. Sell? it is on Neepsend.    Where it says "Neepsend
B         itself.                             —
    Q. Where that word is, "Neepsend"? - A. Yes.

    o    That is the area vou are talking about? ~ A. On the
         corner where it says Hillfoot Road, that is where the pub
          is, if you can read it from there.

    Q. This is about 2.40 to 2.45? - A. About that, yes.

    Q. Another document which the jury has been asked to look at
       is a photograph.         I am going to ask you to look at it
       and I hope the jury can also have a look at it as well.
       I hand to you the photograph, 20.A.               r* £ r j S r y can 1
       voil Vis.vs 2 xvsn i t • sir« is C •2 8 2 • i- op         J^ X       ,
       have a look at     it.      If you look in the bottom f i g t harri
       corner of this photograph you can see a 1.5                   is
       the back of a chap’s jeans and then just to tne right
D      14:26.      Do you see that? - A. Yes, I can see 14._ .
       cannot see the 15.

    Q. Take the better copy, Mr. Eckford.                hJ tlme
       which is apparently by some process Pr^ t e d on ^
       picture when it is taken and we are told it is ^ m i n u t e
       wrong and it ought to be 14:25.    You see the pedestrians
       there who are making their way down tne pavement. - A.
       Yes.
    0. With the line of policemen sort of guarding them.      Now
       that is what we know was happening at twenty-tive past
       two, just outside the ground.   I expect _you_recognise,
       this, that the ground is just to the n g n t ? - A. I don t,
       sir.
        Q. How does this compare with what you are de®cr^b^ § 1^n
           Neepsend Lane at about twenty to three? - A. I would s y
F          roughly the same.   There was that like amount of peopl
           on the pavement.
        0. We can only see one side of the road in this photograph,
         ' but on Neepsend Lane were they just on one side as well.
           - A. There were some on our side, but mostly on the on
           side where the pubs were, basically again because if t> y
           stay on that pavement, the way I was                ‘ t
           ground, if you like, on the right hand side, if tney stay
           on that pavement they can go all tne way around witnout
           having to cross any roads or anything.

    O    If the iurv have got the picture then of this sort of
         " l i m e of people Sn Neepsend Lane at round about twenty
         minutes to three, that is what you are describing?      A. I
         would say yes to that.
                       Cross-Examined by MR. KING:
B
    Q. Mr. Eckford, I don't know whether you Y®re
       earlier on this afternoon when other witnesses were
       giving evidence.   You probably heard my asking questions
       of the lady and she may have thought I was giving          a
       hard time about drawing assumptions#from facts, but ir
       one starts with facts one can sometimes draw assumptions.
       As far as the facts come as far as direction g o e ,    .
       direction these people were coming from would ha -        ‘
       from a route from Nottingham? - A. Knowing the ™o t ° r ™ y 1
       would have said yas, sir, because if you come o.f 33 y
       come in Sheffield that way.

    Q. It may be right or it may be wrong, but if one was
       any sort of deduction that is the one you would probably
       make? - A. That is the one I would have made, y®s *
       Again, as I said, they were both wearing red and wnite.

D                    Cross-Examined by MRS. McBRIEN:

    0. Mr. Eckford, did you say that you saw about tne same
     ' number of people walking along the pavement at twenty to
       three as you saw at 2.30? - A. I didn't see any at 2.30 -
       just on this picture.
    Q. You didn't see anybody at 2.30? - A. No.    I left the pub
       I was in at 2.30.   I   didn't getdown toNeepsend Lane
       until about twenty to three.
               THE CORONER:   I   think if Ican help...   You go
          ahead, Mr. King.
               MR. KING:   I think Mrs. McBrien is slightly
          confused.   What the witness said was that looking at tne
          photograph which we have seen which we know is
          was a similar sort of scene as he saw at twenty to three.

               THE CORONER:   Thank you.     Susan Margaret Gunstone.

    0. You are a psychiatric nurse teacher, is that right?         A.
       Yes.

    0. You live at this address with your husband and your
B      children? - A. Yes.
               THE CORONER:   At about twenty-fiverpast one you
          left home with your husband and your children a n d Y° .
          were intending to go and collect a baby sitter from the
          Middlewood Hospital? - A. Yes.
          Then you were intending to go on to Wads ley Lane, is that
    Q.
          right? - A. Yes.
          You set off in your vehicle - a car? - A. Yes, in the
    Q.
          car.

    o. You left the village and you noticed in a road called Low
       Road a mini-bus? - A. Yes.
          How many yards, miles, what have you, is it from your
    Q.                                                          It
          home? - A. It is
D         is just into the village, yes.

    0. Just very briefly, because I don't think w e need to go
       into any great detail on this, there were some y o u n g men
       in the mini-bus? - A. Yes, there was a           P^ked
       the left hand side of the road.   They had been st°PP®°
       and people had got out of it and there were some police
       officers there.

    0. Did they look to you as if they were supporters? - A. I
       think in J,y statement I said they didn't have any scarves
       or anything like that, I can t remember.    I just
       remember some young men.

     0. At any rate there was a mini... - A. There was a mini-bus
        with some young men in it.

     0. And the police were doing something? - A. Yes.
           You couldn't actually see what the police were doing?
     Q.
           A. No.

     0 . Then you just continued because nobody stopped you? - A.
         We just continued down the road towards Hillsborougn.

         . You then hit Middlewood Road North, is that right? - A.
     Q
           Yes.

    0    Presumably that is a continuation of Middlewood Road but
B   Q ‘ f^theiTout? - A. Yes, it is a straight through road from
        Oughtibridge to Hillsborough.

    Q.   So you were actually coming in? - A. Yes.
    0.    In fact the hospital is before you get to Hillsborougn?
         A. That’s right, yes.
    Q. H O W Ear is the h o s p i t a l from Hillsborough? - A. Jbout a
       mile.      Probably less to...          If y o u went to Hillsbo rough
         corner it is probably a mile and a bit. ^It you are
         going to the beginnings of Hillsborough it is pro   y
         three-quarters of a mile.

    0. What I am really asking about is the stadium,
       A. It is .about a twenty minute walk.  It is probably
       about a mile, maybe just under.

    o . When you got into this road, what time was that about? -
        A. We left home at about twenty-five past one,
        would have been just after that, maybe 1.3U.

    0. There were supporters about? - A. We first ^ m e across
       people who were noticeably supporters when we got to
       Middlewood Tavern, which again is maybe a couple of
       hundred yards from the beginning of the hospital.

    q. It is a bit further out than the hospital? - A. It is
       between Oughtibridge and the hospital.

    0. But not that much further? - A. No, you are talking about
       quite a small distance, really.

    0. Did you see any supporters there, outside? - A. ^es,
       there were supporters there on both sides of tne road.

     Q. You say they were supporters presumably because they were
        wearing the... - A. The red and_white.   Well, tney nad
        got the scarves and hats and things like tnat.

     0. We have already heard that everybody was wearing red and
        white on that day. Were you able to see anytning else
        which might have guided you as to       group ot       ,
        supporters you were looking at? - A. They were Liverpool
        supporters.   I cannot actually picture_exactly as to
        whether they had got "Liverpool" on their scarves or
        whether it was emblems, but at the time I knew tney were
        Liverpool supporters.

     0. You were quite satisfied at the time? - A. Yes.

     Q. But you cannot tell me now precisely what it was that
        persuaded you? - A. No.
                                       S.   M. GUNSTONE


0. It is only right to say that as far as you were concerned
   they were perfectly well behaved? - A. Yes. They were on
   both sides of the road which I suppose was unusual, an
   they were in the car parks.   The road is quite narr
   there but they didn't get in the way or anytning
   tha t.
Q. Of course, as you probably heard,fthere were 24,000
   Liverpool people coming and I don t know how many   f
   others, so clearly they had to be somewhere? - A. Yes.

Q. You then went into Middlewood Hospital and picked up your
   baby sitter? - A. Yes.
Q. You set off again at about ten to two? - A. Yes, tnat
   sounds about right.
0. This time you were intending to go further into
   Hillsborough to Wads ley Lane? ~ A. Yes.

Q. As you drive along you come to another pub - this P ^ c e
   seems to be absolutely studded with tnem - and this
   is called The Sportsman, is that right? - A. Yes.

Q. That is on your right hand side as you drJ]f®      . h
   towards... - A. As you are going towards Hillsborough,
   down - I think i t ’s Worrall Road - The Sportsman is on
   the right.
Q. Again, there were... - A. There were s u p p o r t e r s tHeri in
   the same situation - they were Liverpool^ supporters b
   can't remember exactly what made me thin* tnat, but
   sure they were.
 Q.   Was there any difference between this lot and the ones
      you had seen at the earlier time? - A. Yes.     They had
      actually spilled on to the road at tnis place.      Th y
      were half way across the road, I think.     Tney were
      noisier.
 Q. How many were there, in round terms? - A . Twenty/thirty,
    something like that.   I couldn t really...

 0. Not huge numbers in other words? - A. No, but m a y b e more
    than that.   There was enough of them to...   I would
    think there was more than twenty, but it is difficult
    put a figure on.
 0. So you said they were different.   They had spilled into
    the road and apart from that they were exactly tne same.
    Well behaved? - A. They were more noisy.

 0. They weren't actively misbehaving in any sense of the
    word? - A. No, I don't think so.

          were people drinking in the car park hut tney wei

The time that you have been telling t         h  e    . -
was in the region of two o'clock to half past tw°.
A We set out from home at hal£ past one, w            y
^ a s f o n e , and we were waiting in the Middlewood
grounds for twenty minutes, twenty five minutes,
our friend.
I have given you a bad question.  At the time you
were talking about the atmosphere at the two
different sides of the ground? - A. Yes.

Which is round about when? - A. That is      round about
ten to two to ten past two maybe.

Of course, then you did not know what was going to
happen? - A. No, that is right.
 Are you telling the Court you felt at the time the
 atmosphere you have been describing? - A. Yes, we
 actually discussed it, my husband and I. It did not
 feel very good.
               (-.ross-examined bv MR.— KING:

 Have you ever been, to a
 nlt^have'been a big one.     It would have been a small
 local team.
 With how many people attending? - A :I J » v e n ' t » clue
 but maybe a couple of thousand at the most.

. A very small gate? ” A. Yes.
. Normally when you talk about match days in     Sheffield
  when Sheffield Wednesday are         ^         ?erms of
  different game from a semi final FA Cup in     terms or
  numbers attending? - A. I do not know.
  have to find out how many Sheffield have.      I do
  know what the difference in numbers is.

. You may not know that? - A. No.
  So that we can find that out and you n e e d n o t concern
  yourself with that. Dealing with your e v i d e n c e t h e
  picture I form is this; you set out you say at about
  twenty five past one? - A. Yes.
. The first incident with the minibus, let us be fair,
  you have not a clue where those people came from.
  A. No.
n                                                                      104

        O. They might not have had anything to do with football

    B           at all? ' A‘ That is true' yes*-
        Q. Then when we come to the next incident ^ i ^ h w e r e ^
           made a note of, which is where you say there
           supporters on both                                    S e ll ■
           white scarves, you indicated they were pe         *
           behaved.  That is the note I have got. A.          ,
           there was no problem there.

        q   . h o w many are you talking about on that °c<r*si°n?
              That is the first one, about? - A. Again it is
              difficult to put numbers on, maybe twenty, maybe
              thirty.
        Q. Twenty or thirty? - A. Yes, but I would like t o ---

        o       Then when you set out again at about ten to two and
                you come to the Sportsman pub again you are talking
                about twenty or thirty people? - A. Yes.
    D
        o        Although they    had spilt    out onto the road and you
        Q '      say     were noisy! again    there w a s nothing which
                happened to you which gave    you any alarm from their
                behaviour? - A. No, it was    just boisterous.

         Q. They were happy by the look of them? - A. I cannot
            remember.
            Q. You obviously know that football supporters support
               their team, do they not? - A. Yes.

            Q. They tend to be happy in their support? - A. Yes.

            0    Even the next incident we hear about which is round
                 the Horse and Jockey and you talk about them
                 on to the road, again how many people are we talking
                 about there? - A. More there-

            Q. About how many? - A. Fifty.

            Q. Fifty? - A. Forty/fifty.
            0. X am just adding up the number of people we have got
               so far and we have got, putting them on the highest
               figures, thirty on the first occasion, thirty on the
               second, that is sixty, and fifty.  So on the who ^
               journey so far you are talking about 110 people.
               Yes.

                                                     S. GUNSTONE


Q. That is at three different stages? - A. Yes, outside
   pubs.
o   The reason I put that to you, you may not know this,
    is to put it in the context of the m a n y thousands
    attending the match.  Your next piece of             :i,ou
    refer to at about five to two turning into Waasiey
    Lane and there were people moving slowly towards the
    g“ und it would appear? - A. Yes. there were people
    moving towards the ground.
o   Then when you came out of your friend s house I
    suppose we are talking two o ’clockish, something like
    that? - A. Yes.
n   There were a lot of people there walking to the
    rryniind'? - a Yes they were standing around as well.
    They were t t lli m o ^ n g to the ground, not everybody
    was moving down.
o   When you say you were feeling uncomfortable that must
                thev were not doing anything to you, the fact
    t h a t t h e r e were such a lalge . number of people around
    I suspect? - A. Yes, but it is difficult to put it
    into words and exactly why I felt that way            It did
    not feel comfortable.         It felt more “      i?ihorouah.
    different.         I do not go regularly into Hillsborough
    when there are matches but on the occasions when 1
    have been I did feel more uncomfortable this time.




                                     /Q.   Again were these.

          Again w e r e these people who were supporting their team,
    Q.
          whoever they were? ~ A. Yes.
          Were they calling out their team’s name, that sort of
    Q.
          thing? - A . I do n’t remember now.
B
          Well did you get the impression they were football
    Q.
          supporters? ~ A. Yes.
          What gave you the impression they were fo o t b ^ ^ P P orterS?
    Q.
          - A. They were wearing scarves and hats ana Mings.

              Did they seem quite happy with themselves? - A. Yes.
    Q.

    Q. And again there was nothing in          ^ ^ n e e d t o cSllS
       of behaviour which you would have said.        anvthing


              to walk round them, they did not make way for me.

         . Because of the number of people who were t h e r e ? - A. They
           could have moved out of the way but thy

D    Q.
              There was probably a bit of bad      manners? - A. May be.

              Bad manners sometimes does not make one
     Q.
              I agree with you. And a g a : £ “ stan<
              got where at Wadsley Road, this is        Y
              shopping and there were lots of Police you say
              A. No, I didn’t say "lots".
              I beg your pardon it may be my fault, there were Police
     Q.
              about? - A. Yes.
               Not lots of Police? - A. No, I don't remember saying
     Q.
               lots.
               NO, that is probably my mistake         I am asking you what
         Q.
               your                                        remember^ ?here was
               T c o S p t e oi S I S l n e i and there was more than that but
               I don ’t remember the actual numbers.

         Q. But the impression   you got and I h a ™ made             a note of
            this, "they were just standing around .

         Q. That was the impression you got? - A. They were standing
            there, yes.
         Q. And this is the same time when the football supporters
            were going past? - A. Yes.
                       MR. KING:   I   have no further questions. Thank

    changed a little bit so we will have to allow for that.

          The proposal is that you will be going in a
    or coach with Mr. Griffiths there as the C o r o n e r s
R   There will be another mim-bus for iegai_r*P*e®®n           Qet-in
    however many of you (a) want to come and ( )               9 space
    plus anybody else, particularly families, whom we ]tiave space
    for. Do we know how many seats this second one           ,
    know it yet?
          MR. JONES:  In the order of 40.        There are also
    writing facilities in it as well.
          THE CORONER:  So in the, if you like what I would call,
    the "legal coach" there are about 40 seats so perhaps Y°u
    can be thinking about whether or not you would wish^to come
    along and then I will follow in a car behind.  The
    for that is you will know, there is a case, I haveforgotten,
    R. -v- Divine, I think, deals with this business of Coroners
    going on site visits with juries.
          One of the reasons why I want to meet on that morning,
n   I think it is a Wednesday the 28th, is for me (a) to
    you where we are going and (b) to tell you then uhat
    an odd visit because (a) you must not tal* to any^°^£
    (b) under no circumstances must you start asking que
    of Mr. Griffiths.  He is there to make sure that you don
    do it and that is why we are all going in separate unit
    because otherwise you are picking up information may be
    from people who have not taken the oath and so on.

           Tt- is oerfectlv proper to do a site visit, there
     is no thing wrong with St.’it is a perfectly w p . r j r j c . t a *
     but it is fraught with these problems o^ how to organise
     it so within amongst yourselves of course you can chat,
     there is no problem, but you must remember chat all tne
     usual rules apply.
           Whilst I am on it, I know there are not very many
     Press here but perhaps you could make sure that colleagues
     know it, I take the view that when we go on a site
     it is the Court moving and that means there are no cameras
     or photographs of the visit because you are not allowed to
     take pictures in here and I don't see any g o o d reason why
     you should be allowed to take pictures of the jury wandering
     around wherever they happen to be.
           I know that may sound annoying because it is great
     to have photographs but that is how                   J      ^ Press
     who you are.  I am looking up because there is some pjess
     people there but I am making this a n n o u n c e m e n t now public y
     L d I don't want people on the 28th to say:              Oh,       dld
     not know and that is why I was there with my cameras
     everything else".

            That is all I need to say today.        Do you think it is
     ,a good idea as a matter of interest?

      MEMBERS OF THE JURY:         Yes.
      MR. KING:  Sir, it is only just there issomehouse

you tomorrow morning at 10.
                      (In the absence of         the jury)

       THE CORONER:        Yes, Mr. King.

      ME. KING: Sir, I am trying to pr        “ j£oblem WhiCh
may reoccur as happened today over the phouographs.

      Sir, certainly my submission to you is that it would
be very sensible and helpful if we^could see °"r "?yh“ e tj_n
having core bundles of documentsJ*hic we             ^
advance before we question the l e a d i n g , « |   v




       a\ ^ I v r a s ° L I2 S p L aS o l L r o p i r a t I o n a l orders, bundles
 of photographs; plans; the layout of the ground, the layout
 of the turnstiles; certain reports given in over the y e a r s
 over previous semi-finals and so J°rt <      whlch is never
 producing them in a rather mishmash fashio '        „ to
 h ^ p f u l to the witness or the jury, if “            “
 some sort of agreement as to a bu"d J®         ld be helpfui
 helpful I am sure to everybody.      I *now
 to myself.
         THE CORONER:       It is right to say that this

 r  -  ^   t  ^  r  S    f  e  t s  -i s r   n-no^oubr
 have told you, and then I decided against it.
        I will rethink    this p oint because I agree w i t h you
  it is jolly inconvenient w h e n you suddenly d i s cover uha
  you nee d a plan and w e are all ahuff:


  I will rethink this point.
         Wh a t I am con c e r n e d about is that we |°n't             l o r 's
  up quite h o n estly w i t h wha t happened m L or d Justice Tayl
  Inquiry w here the* was a stack of documents tn|s h igh^
  NO? o nly that but there were thrje o r four -             these s t r a n d
  if  you read the transcripts it was quite aiizi
  to find anything even in that Inquiry and I want, f a r i n g
  “ m i n d we have got a jury, to kee p d o c u m e n t a t i o n to a
minimum, not because I want to stifle the *jq   *
hinder you, but simply that if we lose control ox what we
have got we will be in a worse mess than we are now.

       MR. KING: Sir, I have a lot of sympathy with that
approach.   All I would urge on you sir from the
of being in the Taylor Inquiry is this is true, we did s
out with a large number of documents from <J      LeStifiSd
but sir bv the end of the Inquiry what had been   identified
was'a relatively small group of documents which in fact came
to be known as the "core bundles" and in fact it came t I
think two large files, no more than that, and it is t r u e
there T r e S e t a on iither side but the actual
weren’t as large as perhaps people tear and are unli      y
be as large in this Inquest.
      THE CORONER: Mr. King, would it be, I hesitate ^to
ask you to do extra work or anything of that sort, buu i ^
it possible do you think for you and y®" «           of the
mean to produce a document, but to produce the 1^st
documents or photographs that you think you are li*e y
want   included in this core bundle? I can look at them
if I   think it is a good idea I will do so. As I sa/ /
aim is to be helpful not the other way round.

       MR. KING:  Sir, I obviously c a n ’t speak for my l®a*ned
 friends at the moment but certainly from my point o* view
 that would be an opportunity I would welcome.

       THE CORONER:  Yes, okay.  I mean if we do have a core
 bundle, if we do, then I think it has 9 °t to be agreed in
 the sense, I am not saying that it means it is imP^si*>le to
 introduce another document because we can never anticipate
 everything, you know that is crazy, but hopefully i ’
 be S S « h 4 n s i v e and we could number it and that would be
 that.   Mr. Payne* .yes?




                            MR. PAYNE:   Sir, I only

      HR. KIHG:    We'will do oar best.   Sir, could I
mention another natter which- I have just              ^re
instructions on? It is as to witnesses before ta-/ -r<e
called to give evidence.     Sir, ooviously tne proueaur-
in your hands totally. The note I have received froa
behind - and they w o n ’t aind ay saying that 13 where it
has come from - is concern at witnesses o e m g in v.ourt
wnen other witnesses are giving evidence, oefore tn.y nav_
given tneir evidence, could be - without m any u y
deliberately so - be affected by what tney
therefore when they give their evidence later on in the
day they are giving it not from their own neaas out
perhaps, whether it be consciously or unconsciously, rr .
 what they nave already heard, and I non J *now, sii,
waetner you would consider a suo.uission taat *itnes*=
 should reaain out of tne Court oefore they
 give it.   I know, sir, at tne end oe tne Gay i~ is „otaily
 in your discretion.
      THE COROWER:   It is tne normal practice in Coroners'
Courts to allow witnesses to be in Court, though on
occasions if I thought it was right that a witness *noula
not near, I would say, "I don t want nia or ^ r     *
because of the possibility tnat you nave mentioned, am, it
may well be that - there are dozens or witnesses as you
know - there .may be some where it wouiu oe mappropriat-^
for tne witnesses to be in Court.   Wnat you are saying 1 *
you want all witnesses out.   It doesn t matter very ^
to ;ae whether they are in or whether tney are out, it 1 *
just that it is nornal coronal practice to alia* ultL— sses
 to be in Court;
      MR. ICIhG:  Sir, I accept it is normal out I know ^
 there is very strong feeling asoag _t.iose waoa l repret.-nu
 that the risk of witnesses being aftectac oy wnat tney
 near is such that it isn't a riss we ought v.o run.    ^aar-
 would oe no harm in keeping then out, ana in we w u l ^ th n
 obviate the risk it is far acre lively tnat tae^e .-/in­
 justice done, ratner tnan an injustice.

      THE CORONER:   Any observations on what Hr. King is
 saying?
      HR. j?AYw£:   The only observation that we laaRa is
 that, in fact, if one looks at your list, looking at your
 list there are a number of people w a o undoubted!/ «oui^
 want to reiaain in throughout the hearing.   In tact ....
                                                        114




      THE C0R03ER:   Yes.  I'think, ilr. King, that tnat is
true.   For example, somebody wnpse conduct is lively uo oe
caller in question, to use tne^woruin* or tae rale^ is
entitled to be in, even if .he is going to &e walJLec
witness, so obviou ly even I, were to accece to your
application, clearly those witnesses             sta-e if
Equally, waaa we get to waat I call tn- expert sta^ ,
we get to it, tnen the experts have got to oe in a» ^el ,
but I suopose you weren t actually arguing tnat.

      MR. KING:    Sir, not at all.  If I flight draw an
analogy, in tne civil courts, we soaetinies               in
trials in the context o£ actions against tae_?oli-e, in
damages, and tnere the convention certainly i=, tro*. tne
ones I have been in, that although normally in civil -~asea
all th witnesses are in. in those cases w i t n e ^ e . ar.
outside, save for that category waica you reter to.
v&rv easy as we go througa tae list to anticipate froa aay
to day         witness is likely to fall into tnat c t « o « y .
If there is any arjument you can rule on:it, »ir.       it is
tne principle, sir, wnich I an, seesing to estaolisn and
certainly, as I say, there is a lot or feelin.^ --
 that the risk I have indicated could be a very real one,
 if one follows the norvnal principles.
     L4R. PAYNE:  I have not had a chance to consider tne
implications of keeping all the witnesses out out :
                                                  tne aan^
who immediately caae to rama was ar. rfic^, wn   * * y
list, and w; c rtainly wouldn t want to do anytaing
keep nia out.
      THE CORONER:     That is right.
      MR. PAYNE:    He is certainly entitled to be nere
 throughout and if tnere are going to be exceptions one is
 coins' to run into difficulties, so our submission i, taat
 taenormal rule snould apply,   we understand an       .
 sympathise with the point that is being made but it
 going to run into complications.
      MR. KING:   Exceptions normally don* t prove very
 difficult for lawyers. We live on exceptions.

      MR. HALE:      I would support Mr. Payne,sir.

      THE CORONER:     Were you going to rise?

       MR. MANNING:  Yes, entirely the same point as Hr.
 Payne.   In fact, I have drawn my list out and snew tnat
 there were at least two, three or four people who I had
 saen in the course of the case as being people who were
 known, who clearly have a very great interest in wanting
 t , hear everything that has been happening before you, and
 to exclude them would seem to be awful and I would not     )
want you to take that course of action.    So taking into
account as well that these are not adversarial
proceedings, it seems to me that you are enquiring into
K e r s S d ' l don't on balance in any way seek to persuade
you again to the view which you ordinarily nave.

     THE CORONER:   I must say I can see the point tiiat
you are caking Mr. King, but I think that the ris* is less
than is feared. I think for the time being I wiil _
continue with my present position.     If I        g   x
impression from witnesses that I aramistaken then a
have said before, I don't know whether that is
wrong but I am prepared to over-rule myself, so_to speak,
on a matter of this nature, a n d certainly if, when I
assess the witnesses for a particular day, if              a
particular witness or witnesses who I              balance
ought to be out then I will arrange for that to be done in
thl interests of fairness, but I personally think that
the risk that is feared, it is a perceived risk but I
don't think in reality it is a real one.
     We are clear that on Friday morning at 9.30 we are ,
dealing with the legal submission which Mr. Isaacs put to
me? What I intend to do, just so that we all know where
we are, is I will ask Mr. Catchpole to repeat, so to
speak, for the benefit of Mr. Isaacs what ne said, and
indeed you too, Miss Hampton.
      MISS HAMPTON:   Sir, no it won't be me.        Mr. Maxwell
 will be taking over from me.
      THE CORONER:    I see. Perhaps you will tell Mr.
 Maxwell what you said and then he can deal witn it as
 well.— Any further points or comments tnat need to °e
 made, hopefully not at too great length, but sufficiently
 long for you to feel that you have had your fair say, and
 then I will let you know what I think about tne matter and
 give a ruling on it.
      MR. HALE:   Could I mention, sir, I have mentioned it
 previously, I will not attend the submissions because L
 don't intend to take advantage ....
      THE CORONER:      Whichever way it goes is what you are
 saying?

      MR. HALE:      Yes.
      THE CORONER:   That is perfectly all right, but
 remember that we won't be dealing just with submissions.
 We are smarting with evidence as well, h o p e f u l l y , on tnat
 day, so if you want to be here for that ....

       MR. HALE:     I will come for 10 o'clock.
                                                    115




     THE CORONER:   I think we will probably ask the Jury
to come in at 10.30 actually, because although I aor hoping
it won't take too long, an hour is probably about the
right time.
     Ladies and gentlemen, thank you very much indeed.

(The Inquests were adjourned until the following morning)

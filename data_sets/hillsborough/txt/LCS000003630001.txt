Dear Friend,

                      HILLSBOROUGH FAMILIES SUPPORT GROUP


     Following the successful launch meeting of the above, it has been decided
to arrange further meetings of the families directly involved in the Hillsborough
Disaster.

     For those not yet aware, this body is an informal "getting together"
of the families with the objectives of supporting each other, improving
communications, and agreeing how we the families think matters should be
handled. It consists of immediate family only and all other people are
excluded. We would ask you to respect the confidence of all the families
(especially regarding the media!) and NOT to discuss this outside your immediate
family.

     Our intention is to seek out a consensus and elect a "committee" to
co-ordinate on our behalf with others/outside bodies. Your opinion is most
welcome and we invite you to join us on:-

          Tuesday, 4th July at 20.00 hrs.,
          Vernon Sangster Sports Centre,
          Priory Road,
          Anfield,
          Liverpool 4
          (next to the football car park).

     Any problems please contact any of the following:-

          Barry or Jackie Devenside on (
          Trevor or Jenni Hicks
          Les or Doreen Jones or
          Colin or Terry Sefton
          Bill or Sheila Pemberlcon on
          Steve Kelly on

between        the      North          Stand       and       the     S p i o n Kop.             There       were        a very         large

number       of    other          officers             there,            X could          not    see       the     pitch and             for a

time     n o b d o y wa s         quite          sure    what        was       happening.                 1 would        be    stood        in

this     position            for       about       5    to 7 m i n u t e s .              We    were       then     instructed              to   go

onto     the      pitch.           The       reason was              not m a d e          c l ear     at     this       time,       and     I did

not    know       what       I wa s         going       to     be    doin g .         I just          followed           the       remainder

of m y      serial        and      our       sergeant.               As    we       walked       o nto       the    pitch          I sa w

large       numbers          of    fans          together           with       polcie          officers,           firemen,            first

aiders,        etc      tending             to    scores        of       injured          persons          who     were       l y ing     on     the

ground.           Dozens          of     others         were        rushing          around          giving        what       assistance

they     could.           I saw          some      persons           being          comforted             by o t h e r s      some       were

gasping        for      their          breath          and     others          had    a ghastly              look       on    their       faces

which       were     either            very       pale/white              or    purple          in    colour.            Many       were

holding        their         ch e s t s .         I still           was    not       sure       what       our     duty       on    the     field

was    so    I went          amongst             many    of     the       injured          fans       to     see    if       I c o u ld     be    of

any    assistance.                 13y      this       t ime    I was          in the          region        of    the L i v e r p o o l

that     the      worst       was        over      and       I did        not       encounter             s ome    of    the       terrifying

scenes       of    people          being          trapped           up a g a i n s t       the       fence        and    dying         that

have     been      described                to me       afterwardsy                  I did       not       witness           any    of    the

them     seemed         to    be       on    the       field        amd    t his      was       beginning           to       c a use     another

dying       were     being         carried.              It was           at    this       point          t hat    I realised             the

full     scale       of      the       disaster.               It was          hard       to    see       where     help       was       most

urgently           needed.             In my        opinion            all    was    being           done        that       could          be    done

satisfied.               There        were       constant              taunts       from       them         and many             were

screaming           abuse        at     the      Police           on    the    field.              They       appeared            to       blaming

us    for    what        had     happened.                  I felt       at    one       time        t ha t      a    rather          dangerous

situation           was        developing              in    the       crowd.        It       crossed my mind                     for       one

brief       moment           that     fans       f r o m all           points       of       the     ground were                 going          to

rush     the       pitch and            assault             and    cause        serious            harm       to m a n y         police

officers.               Tension         and      feelings              were     running            extremely               high.           Taunts

and    jeers        from        the     Nottingham                Forest        stand         ( S p i o n Kop)             caused a             r ush

of L i v e r p o o l         supporters             across         the       field and             at     this        point       I was

ordered        by a S u p e r i n t e d e n t               together          with       a    l a rge       number          of    other

                 saddened         to     see      that       many      were     so y o u n g .            The    a t m o s phere       i ns i de     the

                 gym was        very        tense       and    unnerving.              When          I left       I joined            PS Sherratt.

                 He    asked     me     what       I was       doing       I told          him       that       I had      become       detached

                 from my        detail         and      because          his    men    war       also       depleted            he    instructed           I

                 stay     with     him.

                 We    then      formed a          cordon across                the    entrance             to    the      gym       preventing

                 unlawful        access           to    the    building             which       was       being     u s e d as        a make       shift

                 mortuary.             Press       in    particular             were       kept       well       awa y .        It wa s      whilst        I

                 was     there     that        I saw m a n y           more     bodies          being       taken       from am bul an ce s            and

                 then     carried           into       the    gym.        Relatives             of    the       dead and         injured were              by

                 now     beginning           to    gather         in     numbers.           It was          a very         distressing             sight.

                 I assisted             in d i r e c t i o n      some     of       them    to a          nearby       d es k    in the       North

                 Eventually            at    about       6.30       pm    (1830),          we    were       stood       down         from    our

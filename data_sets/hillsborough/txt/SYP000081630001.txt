At a p p r o x      1.00pm          (1300),          due        to    the        lack     of a c t i v i t y       within       the       pol i c e

r o om at        this     time,          I made          a vis i t         to     the     North Stand/Kop                 area       of    the

at    this       tim e    that         there        were        far m o r e        Notts      fans w i t h i n           the    ground

and    the       lack     of L i v e r p o o l           support           in the         ground        compared          to    last

At appro;-:         1 „6opm         (1330)          I did a           prison          run to E c c I e s f i e 1 d Pol i c e

Ln    to    the     police          station«              I noti ced              throughout            tne    journey          wni cn

passed         a number           of     public          houses           that      there     were       large       numbers          of

supporters             who     did       not    appear           to       be    interested            in m a k i n g      any attempt

to    tra v e l    towards             the     ground and                 in fact         there       were     large       numbers

walking          in the        opposite             direction.                  I dropped          off       the    prisoners             at

E c c l e s f ield a n d m a d e              my way       back           to    the     football         ground          using       trie same

police         box.       Again          during          the     trip          I noticed          l a rge     numbers          of    f ans      who

did    not       appear        to      be m a k i n g      any attempt                  to m a k e      their way          towards             the

ground.           Near       to     the       gates       I saw           fans      who    were       having        to    be    forced          by

officers          outside           the       ground       to m o v e           towards        the      turnstiles             and    enter

the    ground.            I parked             the       va n    outside            the    police        room at          the       ground

and made          enquiries              as    to    the        position with                any      new     prisoners.              I was

Ec c 1 esf x e 1d .      I noticed, at this            time    that    the officers working                   in the

police      room were          under    great    pressure       due to the          number    of    prisoners

being     brought        in.     I a s s i s t e d with    collecting         paperwork       for       the

prisoners and at appro:-: 2 .15pm                     (1415)    I made a second             run to

E c c 1 e s f i e 1 d Police Station,           together with a number                of D D'iv officers.

I used the same             route to travel           to the station.              While     travelling

along Halifax Rd,               I noticed more          fans a g a i n not making any attempt                         to

gat to the g r o u n d .          I heard transmissions                on my       personal     radio         re the

crowd     in Lappings Ln and ar o u n d the g r o u n d .                    I dropped       the    prisoners

at the      stat ion and         returned to the g r o u n d , a g ai n us i ng the                 same          route.

0 n t h e r e t u r n I h e a r d a.n o f f i c e r o n t h e ra dio ask             that    the kick-off                be

put back          due to the      crowd at Leppings L n .               I travelled along Leppings

Ln very slowly due               to the    crowds.        As    I ciici this        there were          urgent

messages          on the    radio      to the    effect       that    people were dying.                As        I

reached       the qround at Lep pings Ln,                  I heard a voice            on the       radio which

1 r e cogni sed as that             of POL P C 1285 S M I T H «         He   r equestsd b o 11 c r oppe r s

in order          to   cut the    fence.        Due    to these       t r a n smissions all         the other

off i cers        in the van dropped out and m oved                    into tfte crowa at the

L e p pings       Ln turnstiles.          I continued          round to P e nistone Rd,                 using

P a r kside Rd.            As I did this       I heard        requests       for a m b u 1a n c e s .     I moved

onto Penistone Rd but                  could see       that    the    road was       becoming       blocked and

the a m bulance and             police    vehicles        could not move            due to this.              1

parked my van on the                central      reservation and             ran    into    the ground

through the            gym car    park    entrance.        I made my way to the               police          room to

be met      by a small          number    of    people     being      treated       by the St Johns

Amb u l a n c e    people.       I could see by the             reaction of          people     coming            from

the    playing area that more a s sistance was                         needed       in that area.                 i ran

onto    the       pitch.       I ran to a male who was                u nconscious         on the       ground and

asked                 around
          the friends •                   him to let me          in.      I could see         that tn
person was         not breathing and gave mouth to m o u th and heart massage .

After a short           time       I could see that there was                   little       point         in

eont i nui ng and a sked for assistance                       to    car ry the body to the                      r ear of

ever    growing       numjyer of people were                carrying        injured/bodies                 to this

are a with each body there was                      six    plus     helpers who were                then just

milling       in the area getting                in the way.           I a p p r o a c h e d a number                 of

the    playing area and m ove d around the                         track area asking                people            sat

against       the wall        if they needed any help.                    At    this     time       I saw that a

line of       police        officers      were     forming a cordon at                the L e p p i n g s Ln end

and also a loose              c a r don   i n f r o nt of t h e Hop.           After a sho rt 1 1me                        I

After what a p p e a r e d           to be hours        I m oved     into      the    police        room        in

a state       of s h o c k , 1 saw that            the officers          in the       room were            giving

verbal       cautions        to the       prisoners       that had been on the                 prison

bus.      I left- the         room to be met            by a drunken Liverpool                     fan who            said,

'"What’s the score             pal?"         I told him to go home.                   I then        remember               going

to an     injured male who was                  starting      to have       diff i c u l t y breathing.                        I

            find    if they knew of any urgent                case that was waiting            for an ambulance

            When    the scene        started to slow down            I saw a large      number       of   police

            officers        crying and     in a great       state     of distress.

                   On S a t u r d a y   15th April               1989      (-150489), I went              to the FA Cup semi                  final

                   at H i l l s b o r o u g h       football         ground,          S h e f f i e l d , to w a tc h the game

                   I am a Liv er po ol               supporter.               1 d i d n ’t go      in an o r ga ni se d         party       but

                   w it h two      friends            in a car.

                   I had       pur ch as ed my ticket                  from A n f ie ld F oo tball             g rounder * have a

                   ticket.         I tra ve ll ed            to the game with

                                 and

                   We drove        to S h e f f i e l d        in                        car via      the Jn6Z to Leeds a nd then

                   !i1 and an         !A ’ road         into Sheffield.                   We   did ryft stop •anywhere                   on the

                   way       to the game.              We were         subject         to t r a v g ^ d e l a y s ^ p ar ti c u l a r l y     on

                   the M&2 near             to the          j un c t i o n wit h the M63.               The    cars were mo vi ng               very

slowly because             of the volume          of traffic and because                   it was such a hot

day a lot of            cars were           overheating.

We were       delayed        for about         forty five mi ntues                      s point          but    after

here we had a clear                 journey.        Whe n ^we got Jro Sh e f f i e l d

bought a four             pack of       cheap    lager w h i c r we          drank   in the       car.         I had

one    can and                      had      1/2 a can.        I saw a number           of other          fans       doing

the    same,      but     I saw no one drinking                excessively.           All     the    pubs       that       I

saw were        closed.

We a rr i v e d      in S h e f f i e l d    itself at about          1 pm having          left L i v e r p o o l         at

about     10 am.

We    parked the          car on a road off Peni stone Road.                         I think        to    be eitner

Between       parking        the    car and a r r iving at            the     ground we       received          no

police      d irections         or escort        I have       been to S h e f f i e l d about            four    times

previously           including        the     1988 semi       f i n^irl so    I knew the way.

On the w a y to the             ground       I s a w aboVjjf tw o      policemen        every       corner,          but

they    seemed more            interested        in t r a f f i c    flow.

I w i t n e s se d no disorder              fighting     or drunk e n e s s      between       parking          the       car

a n d the     ground       I saw friends mess^jmg about                      and throwing         cans at        each

other     but     it was all         good h u m o u r e d .

We    e ve n t u a l l y a r ri ve d at yn<?. L e p pings Lane               entrance      betw e e n     1.30       pm

and    1.40     pm in order          target      in early to get a good p o s ition w i t h i n the

ground.         We         k e cU-^t ra i a h t up to the t u r n s t i l e s        for    the     terra c e s and

went    straight         in as at the           time we a r r i v e d there were             no q u e u e s .

T here were a lot of                people milling about               in L e p pings Lane           itself

          tu r nstile       some of who m were searching                          facis,    I was      not searched.             There

          were also about              seven or eight               pol i ce/iorse^            w ith moun t e d o f f i c e r s who

          were     telling         people      to either          entejf the ground or move away.                             It was a

              lot more     relaxed outside              the      grmind this year               than    in 19SS w h e n         there

          had been no drinking at all                          a ll o w e d    near the        ground.

          I saw no s t e w a r d s apart              from the turnstile                   operator and on the

          e n trances       to the West Stand.                    I had no d i f f i c u l t y         in finding        which

          t u r nstile      to use as they w e ^ T clearly m a r k e d on the top a n d                                  I

          d e li b e r a t e l y went      early im order              to get         in to the ground ea s i l y we had

          no d if fi cu lt y        in eriter/ng at all.

          I entere d        via a turryfti 1 e and handed my ticket                                 in to the operator.

          I d i d n ’t see tny o jt the               c o ncertina gates A B or C open at any time and

          no unauthor:i.se\^j/itry I had entered early and                                      therefore m i s s e d          the

          u n a u t h o r i s e d entry w hi ch         normally occurs                just     before       kick off.

          Once     inside        the ground         I did       not see a n y signs                 directing you to the

          terraces.             I m m e d iately    in front          of the        t u r nstile      there    is the         centre

          tunnel         and as     I ente r e d      I could see the                 goals     thro u g h    it and         it was

          obvious         that    this was         the way to get               onto     the    terracing.          We       had no

          difficulty            in finding w here we wanted                       W i stand.

          We had free            passage along            the     centre/tunnel             an d then went          to the       right

          .into Pen 3.            When we e n t e r e d tlVe rj/ar of the                      pen was       full   particularly

          middle/of         Pen 3 wit h a crush barrier                         i m m e d i a t e l y behind us.

          I cannot         remember        seeing any Police                   or S t e w a r d s    in the a r e a of the

Just behind us j/ \             Pen 3 I saw a couple                 of   lads drinking            from          large

plastic          bottles      of bitter w hich they had s n e a k e d                 into       the ground,.               I

         sh outed accr'oss          to them to              come and stand by us as they were                               only

little           lads but     they said they were alri g h t                and     stayed where                 they

were.            This was about        2.20        pm and     Idid   not see        James Aspinall                    and

before           this time.        I have      known James Aspinall                 all my       life    but          not

very well         as our       family       is so large.          Prior      to the      13th April               1989

(150489)         I had not seen him for about                     s even years.

I cannot         say at what        time       but whilst        s t a nding      on the terraces                 I

I had started standing                  on the terraces              between       1.40 pm to           1.45 pm.                At

this    time there was             no crowd           crush taking        place.       From this             time       on

the    crowd g ra du a l l y built             up by 2.3 0       pm it was         crowded but           still

comfortable.            By 2. 4 4      pm    it had become           u n c o m f o r t a b l e wit h the          number

         F r o m £ ,55    pm I was    being    crushed as oppo s e d          to the       pen being

         overcrowded.         There was a tremendous                pressure       on my body,          I was

         t w i s t e d and at one     time    I was    like a cork,          the    pressure       had    pushed me

         up and my feet were           lifted off         the ground and           I was       pushed forw a r d and

         to the side.

         Once    I breathed out        I found    it difficult          to breath          in again.           My arms

         were    pushed up above my head and                 I was    leaning       forward at an angle.

         It became        very hot an d the      sun was d i r e c t l y above            us.     I wear       glasses

         and    it became     that    hot wi t h i n the      crowd that       they steamed up and                   I

         could    not see.

         As    I was     pushed across       to the    side we       came upon a man who had

         o b v i o u sl y tried to    climb over       the    crush barr i e r       to avoid the             crush.

         The man had his back           to the    pitch and the          bottoms         of his        legs    had been

         t r a p p e d between the     crush of       people and the top of the                   crush barrier.

         His    legs were     twisted and o bv io u s l y broken.              His       body and head had

         then fallen down and his head was                    on the    floor as          in the diag r a m

         below:

         The mans        legs were    bent a nd his       body was at a p p r o x i m a t e l y 45 degrees

         there were a number           of    people   ob v i o u s l y his   friends           trying    to    push

         people a way but you were             carried by the          crowd and          pushed       in to him

         and    some     people were    s t a nding   on his head.           You     had no control             of

         where    you were moved        to by the         crowd and the        only bit of my body                   I

         could move        freely was my head.

The     crushing seemed to take                   place    for ages       from about 2.55           pin until

3.1 5    pm.     I was unable            to get out until           the    crushing        eventually

s t o p p e d and     I was able         to breath again.

We were        standing w ith a barrier                 irnrnediat ley behind us and so was

i n v olved     in no surge            from    behind but on my           left   there was         no barrier

and     I saw a surge           of     people     from behind move           slowly       but   continually

f o r w a r d shortly after             kick     off.

I was     not    injured at all               in the    crush,    but the following               day   I

ached, all       over.

I did not see a ny b o d y              near me apart        from the man           I    des c r i b e d above

who     I b e l ieved died.             However     when the        crush eased I saw a pile                  of

people at        the front           fence.       Then as    I left        Pen 3 through the                centre

tunnel,        the Police w ere              shouting amjr running           through,       carrying         people

who a p p e a r e d to be dead and t h e n / a d m i n i s t e r e d          first       aid   in the yard

behind the West Stand.

Once     the    crushing       had— stropped I just w a n t e d to get awa y and so we                             left

the     pen and did not              help anyone who was           dead or       injured.          I believe

that     the /nain factors              that     caused the deaUis and              injuries was that               the

Police     had been          very      lax outside        t h ^ gj^aiind b ecause         there had been            no

problems at          the     *66 semi final.              The Police were           very    relaxed and

a l l o w e d a large        crowd to build up outside                 the    ground and w h e n a lot               of

fans a r r i v e d     late they         lost     control    of the       crowd.

Also     this year         because       of the     intere/t        in the       game and the low

allocation          of t i c k e t s    to Li v e r p o o l /there were a large             number      of    people

who     turn ed up with o u t           tickets     d e t e r m i n e d to get   in.

There also a p p e ar ed             less     police/this year,           last year        there were         four
               n"~ '                               O'
police     per turnstile               but    this year     only one.        There were a lot                of

police awa y from the                  grou nd    checking    drinking        but       few at the      entrance.

 The a l l o c a t i o n of tickets              to Liverpool      I believe was            too

low,     considering         the a ve ra ge        gate   for L i veprool.

                                                                                                                S2S93

At H i l l s b o r o u g h    the    crush barriers were too thin,                         with    u n f i n i s h e d end

and very         low.        I am 6       foot    tail   and they hit me accr o s s rny hips                      so    if

I am     pushed against              one    I am bent        over     it.      This       d i d n ’t happen this

year     because        I was       in front       of the      barrier       but     it did happen to me                in

the    league game against                  S h e f f i e l d W e d n e s d a y w hen     I stood on the

terrace.

The    perimeter an d            inner      fences       prevented        people         from e s c a p i n g the

crush and            people were          killed against           them,     there w e r(e ^ijy s u . f f i c i e n t

e me rg e n c y exits.          The       overhang       on the     perimeter            fence made       it

e xt re m e l y difficult            to    climb over        it.

I d i d n ’t witness a n y t hi ng               I consider        to be a criminal               offence.        3'. saw

people       fighting         but    this was       purely thro u g h f r u s t r a t i o n and anger at

what     had h a p p e n e d .

A fter     the game           was    stop p e d    I remember          one    pol i c e m a n     in      particular

climb onto            the     front       fence and      shout, !lGo back,               people are      dying."

We shou t e d we            c a n ’t because       there were         th o u s a n d s    pushing      from behind.

One    of the fans who               had    come    from the N o r t h S t a n d tried to                pull     down

the    front         fence    but a p o l iceman          pulled him away.

The Poli ce a p p ea re d to think                   it was a       riot and did not               realise      it was

crushi n g .

Whe n we got           into the        rear y ard after            the    crushing          had stop p e d the

a mb u l a n c e s    were    coming       into    the    private        road at the          side     of the     club

and    police and             fans were          carrying     the      dead and injured out               to them

through Gate A                fans were          telling    other      fans     to get out via           the

interior         gate       in the     par t i t i o n wall     and gate B to a l l o w easier                  access

for the ambulances.

We e v e n t u a 11y left the              ground at afaout 3.4 0              pm o f our         own accord.

After      the       crush had eased we             had been        rejoined         by                 who    had bee

bruised accross               his    chest where          he had been trap p e d agai n s t a barrier

on his knees.

             I like standing at              football    grounds       but    for safety       reasons    football

             grounds        should       be made all    seating.

             In H il l s b o r o u g h    particular,    but at a lot of grounds               the access     to tht

             terraces        is   insufficient       for the        number    of fans   using     them.

             On the day I was w ea r i n g a dark                            long slee v e d    cotton top,    pale

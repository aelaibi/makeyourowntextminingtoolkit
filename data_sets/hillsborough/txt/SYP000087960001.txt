             On the 15th April             1989 <150489),      together with my father^

                      T    travelled by car from our home address to She

             the Liverpool v Notts Forest FA semi final at Hillsborough.                           I am a

             shareholder of Notts Forest and we had tickets which cost either

             £14.00 or £16.00 for the South Stand.                      I had obtained the ticket

             direct from Nottingham Forest.



             We travelled along the Ml and were directed by signs off the motorway,

             coming off at the junction before the one we normally turn off at.                              I

             knew the way to the ground having been the re many times

             before.         However,      there were    limited signs to the ground that we began

             to follow which took us along a circuitous and unfamiliar route.                           The

             signs    petered out and I began to think that we were on the wrong
                                                                            PAGE      2
                                                                            S3222

route.     The flow of football   traffic though suggested that we were

alright.     We parked about 3/4 mile from the ground near to a public

house,   called the Owls.    We walked from there.     We parked at about

2.15 pm (1415),    the walk to the ground took about      15 to 20 minutes.



I d i d n ’t see any Police escorting fans or directing them but a lot of

fans were walking along and we knew our way anyway.          I saw fans

drinking from cans and plastic bottles.    I remember passing one pub on
                                    ..  '   5"
the way with a few fans drinking outside^:    The fans seemed good

natured.  I saw some fans u r i n a p h o n e       boxes near to the

g r o u n d , I saw no signs of drunkenness d(r aj^trfTing of a cr iminal    n a t ur e.



I had no problem in finding the turnstile I had to go through.              There

was no queue,    I did though wait in a lengthy queue to obtain a

programme before going to the turnstile.        Having obtained my programme

I walked to join my father by the turnstile.         He was talking to a

Policewoman.    I took my ticket out as I approached the turnstile and I

was approached by one of a group of 4 or 5 fans wearing Liverpool

scarves.   He asked me if I had a ticket to sell and on replying that I

d i d n ’t he made as if to take my ticket and I turned my back on him and

walked straight through the turnstile handing my ticket          in as I went

through.     I d i d n ’t see any stewards outside the turnstiles.     Once

through the turnstile I d o n ’t recall seeing any Police but there were

definitely stewards.
                                                                   /

I recall we were directed by a steward into the SoUjfc^y^and ^ n d there

were no problems whatsoever       in finding our seats.    I did not see

anyone   consuming alcohol   inside the ground.    I did not witness any

unauthorised entry to the ground,       neither did I see any gates other

than the turnstiles either open or being opened.
                                                                                                                                     PAGE      3
                                                                                                                                     S3222



             I took up my match viewing position at about quarter to three                                                          (1445).

             I sat next to my father, we were just to the right of the half way-

             line and about half way back into the stand.



             I remarked to my fahter how full t|ie/)tyo middle                                                     pens behind the

            goalmouth at the Leppings Ln e n ^                                              coprpared to the s i d e s .            It was

             grossly different from the two previous semi finals                                                        I have watched at

            that ground.                  I d i d n ’t realise at that time that there was any danger

             to life by that degree of overcrowding but the crowd didn't seem

            evenly spaced along behind that goal                                          line.        I d o n ’t recall any unusual

             crowd surges and obviously where I was I w a s n ’t involved in any crowd

            surge or crush.



            The match started and the                               first unusual thing I noticed was a St.

            Johns man or someone like                               that.       He and two or three other people                        were

            trying to revive a youngster who was to the left of the halfway line

            by the touchline in front c m   e bouin
                                          the South siana.
                                                      stand, I then saw people

     IT Y f          man, about    14 to 13 stone.       He wore a T shirt which was dark blue or

 OT\/   ‘V l Z t f   maroori/ that type of colour and I believe blue denim jeans.                    He was a

                      hits man, about 33 years with brown hair,



                     The other doctor and I moved onto someone else.                     A white male,   perhaps

                     20 or early 2 0 ,s, who was in front of the goalmouth.                   I cannot

                     describe this person any more.                he was not breathing and there was no

                     heart beat.     He was blue.      After several jafiT>ute^of attempted

                     resuscitation we failed to revive hinv



                     I am sure that I subsequently gave mouth to mouth to another                    person,

                     again a white male, with a Policewoman.                     I cannot describe this man at

                     all.     Again, after a short time,                 it was apparent that he could not be

                     revived.



                     At that point I then moved to the other end of the ground.                     I did this

                     because I couldn't see anyone else I believed I could help any better

                     than anyone else was doing.           There seemed to be enough other           people

                     competently rendering first aid and attempting to resuscitate people.

                     I can *t recal1 anyo ne being left unattended.                   I did give adv ice to

                     some people who were giving help to some shocked fans.

At the other end of the ground,             in front of the Spion Hop,      the people

seemed either dead, with faces covered and laid out on makeshift

stretchers,        or alive and confused and bewildered by their

surroundings.         I gave advice^fo helpers with such people and attempted

•further mouth to mouth resuscit ati on on one or two who I cannot

dies c r i be .   They w ^ p / o b v ious ly dead but f r i ends and relatives were

pleading for help.           I eventually    left the pitch at about quarter to

four    (15.45)     thinking that there      was nothing more I could offer.          I

believed at that time that I had             seen all of the deceased.      I

thought maybe about 20 even then             I didn't realise the enormity of

the tragedy.



That day, as far as I can recall,             I was wearing pale brown trousers

                    top,                    I am 6 ’0 tall,   twelve and half stone,

I am clean shaven with light brownish hair,              collar   length.



I was aware obviously that people had died,              as was my father. X

believe that the fans themselves didn't              really know this and

consequently didn't          realise that the game would be abandoned.

Consequently we left the ground whilst we knew we could leave easily.



Because of the scale of the tragedy I don't              believe that with all        the

necessary medical          equipment being available     it would have made much

difference.         Basically it seemed to me that by the time they had got

people out of the pens and onto the pitch they were already dead.                     I

didn't see anyone successfully resuscitated.



I would say that I d i d n ’t see any i11 treatment of corpses or of people

attempting to help the dead and injured although I believe this has

been commented on by the press etc.

            Further to a previous statement I have made in connection with my

            attendance at the Hillsborough Football                 ground on 15th April      1989

            (150489).         I have today viewed a series of facial            photographs of the

            casualties and also photographs of items of clothing.

            It is now some 12 months since I attempted to resuscitate the persons

            attended on the football        pitch and I am afraid that I am unable to

            identify with any degree of certainty the persons I treated or

            attempted to treat.

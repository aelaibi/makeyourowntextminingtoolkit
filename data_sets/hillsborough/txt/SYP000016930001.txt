       Lord Justice Taylor

       Dear Sir,

                        HILLSBOROUGH DISASTER - MY EXPERIENCE & OPINION


          The coach I travelled on to Sheffield left Wavertree Clock
       Tower at between 11.20 and 11.30 a.m. on Saturday 15th April,
       1989.  I expected to arrive at the ground between 1.30 and 2.00
       p.m.       ,Ji

               After frequent   hold-ups both on the motorway and on the
       A 5 7 , which I found frustrating and inexplicable, I alighted from
       the coach at 2.20 p.m. (Halifax Road, I think).         Three young
       men, with whom I had been chatting on the journey, dashed off
       saying they hoped to get a place central behind the goal where
       they had stood for      the same match last year, and remarking to
       me, "You'll be O.K. with your stand ticket!"

            I have been to Anf ield and Goodison Park countless times
       over the years; Goodison when they had gates up to and over
       70,000, and Anf ield with gates between 50 and 60,000, but I have
       never seen such unbelievable disorganisation and chaos in the
       immediate vicinity of the entrances at Leppings Lane.

                I regret to say the policing was woeful.

            Having seen so many police officers standing in groups on '
       my 15 minute walk     from the coach to the ground, I could not                             ■VV- '
       believe the totally inadequate police presence necessary for
       organised orderly queueing at the entrance.

          : I am sure any Merseyside police officer      who has done duty
       at either Goodison Park or Anfield, could enlighten your enquiry
       as to their organisation and briefing for big football occasions;
       how they organise the supporters from way back, and start the
       orderly queueing from as far back as necessary.     This is obvious
       and necessary.    I am disgusted, particularly having seen so many
       police   officers   standing   idley at   street   corners on   the
       approaches.

                On reflection, I think the police           were deployed primarily
        for      possible     disorder and
                          le disorder    and hooliganism.
                                              hooliganism. What sort

     I consider myself to be an honest and proud citizen of
Liverpool with six sons and three daughters, and nine grand­
children.  I thank God myself and my kin, who went to Hillsborough
on Saturday, came home safely and my heart is breaking for those
so much less fortunate,     I know they came from families just
like my own.   I cannot forgive whoever was responsible for the
scandalous disorder and misjudgement.

                        Yours faithfully,

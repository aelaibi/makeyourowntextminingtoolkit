File note.

Spoke to Chris Domes about 30 minutes ago.

I said that I had written to the Judge to obtain Ms consent before contacting the
relatives (whilst I was considering the matter.) I had not had a reply as y e t. I had
noticed that the judge was meeting the relatives and it seemed to me that the need for
discussion had passed.

I suggested that he should write to the H. S. Group and explain that I had been away
and was also waiting for a reply but that I assumed that the need for contact had
passed. In any case I thought it might be better if there were no discussions even from
their point of view so that they were free to say whatever they wished untrammelled by
anything I might say.

I thought it important that we should contact them so that they did not feel that their
request had been ignored.

Obviously if they cam back and said they still wanted to talk than one would have to
reconsider the matter.

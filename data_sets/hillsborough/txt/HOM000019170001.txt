 INTRODUCTION


 Following the disaster at the above stadium on 15th April
 1989, the Home Secretary asked Lord Justice Taylor to
 inquire into the events which led to 95 people losing their
 lives and many more being injured.
 The terms of reference of the Inquiryare:
**To inquire into the events at Sheffield Wednesday Football
 Ground on 15 April 1989 and to make recommendations about
 the needs of crowd control and safetyat sportsgrounds".
 The National Association of Fire Officers as an
 organisation comprising inter alia, professional Fire
 Prevention Officers submit the following
 observations/recommendations on safety at sports grounds
 for consideration by the Inquiry.    In 1985 Lord Justice
 popplewell conducted a similar inquiry following the Valley
 Parade fire at Bradford and the Birmingham City Football
 Ground disturbance, the recommendations of that inquiry
 have been taken into account during our deliberations.      The
 Association does not seek to apportion blame to persons or
 organisations involved before, during or after this tragic
 event.   The views expressed are designed to assist the
 Inquiry in its deliberation on means of preventing a
 recurrence of such a disaster.

          HILLSBOROUGH STADIUM DISASTER INQUIRY


          OBSERVATIONS/RECOMMENDATIONS

          The following views of this Association take account of the
          "Guide to Safety at Sports Grounds 1986" and consider that
          they can be incorporated into existing premises,
         alterations to existing premises and the construction of
         new sports grounds.


         1)         perimeter fencing

                    If perimeter fencing is considered necessary for crowd
                    separation and control, it must also be considered
                    that, should evacuation from the seating/standing areas
                    be essential to save lives, total evacuation onto the
                    playing area could create more problems than it would
                    solve thus leading to difficulties in crowd control on
                    the pitch itself.
                    It -is recommended that alternative means of perimeter
                    fencing be considered, in order that a phased,
                    controlled evacuation could be achieved to relieve
                    crowd pressure in one or more areas of the ground
                    depending on the circumstances of the emergency.    The
                    design should incorporate sufficient sections of
                    openable fencing to allow an initial escape of 25% of
                    the potential maximum capacity of the enclosure within
                    the shortest practicable period of time.

      2)   TURNSTILES

            It would appear that, when entering the ground through
           turnstiles, confusion can arise when several enclosures
           are available to spectators.   This situation, can allow
           localised overcrowding, creating an imbalance in the
           safe number of spectators specified within an area,
           leading to possible crowd disturbances.
           It is recommended that turnstiles should be designated
           to particular segmented area of the ground. Each
           turnstile to be prominently numbered with the
           corresponding ticket numbers when fixtures are
           all-ticket.   To assist in the directing spectators to
           the relevant turnstile(s), properly designed channels
           and barriers, of a type easily erected on the day of
           the event, may assist in crowd control outside the
           sports ground.   Prominent entrance and exit signs of a
           minimum 600mm height should be clearly visible outside
           and inside the ground.


      3)   FIRST AID FACILITIES

           It is common practice for sports grounds' management to
           request the services of the St. John's Ambulance
           Brigade to provide first aid facilities during events.
           It is apparent that no figures are contained within the
           Guide specifying the numbers of first-aiders likely to
           be required or the minimum equipment necessary.

          3)    m S T   AID FACILITIES (contd)

                Xt» Is rsggmntmfltfl that specific guidelines on first-aid
                facilities and numbers of first-aiders should be made
               on a pro-rata basis for spectator attendances.          Their
               attendance at the sports ground to comply with the
               requirements contained within the Safety at Sports
               Grounds Act 1975, i.e. 2 hours before the event and one
               hour after.


         4)    STEWARDS

               The value of trained stewards at a sports event cannot
               be over estimated, it is appreciated that no steward
               can be considered capable of responding to emergency
               situations without proper training.

               Xfc Is recommended that arrangements for recruitment,
               training and deployment of stewards be reviewed, to
               ensure that suitable persons are recruited, trained and
               utilised in such a manner, in sufficient numbers to
               ensure the safety of spectators within their charge.


         SUMMARY

         The foregoing comments and recommendations are made to
         improve crowd safety at sports grounds, the overall
        responsibility for crowd safety must rest with the
        management of the sports ground,         with this in mind a
        non-executive director with special responsibility for
        safety should be appointed to the Board of Football Clubs.

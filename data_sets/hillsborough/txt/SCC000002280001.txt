Why did they have ear pieces? - A. Well, it helped them
being able to listen. The only equipment we have that
can help them listen to the radio messages inside the
ground. But the noise is so great with just a normal
radio it is virtually impossible.
So it was envisaged before the day, was it-, that those
inside the ground would be unlikely to hear messages
unless they had an ear piece with the handset?- A. Yes,
I would say that, yes.
Was that based on previous experience at similar big
matches? - A. Yes, and other events as well with a great
amount of noise, yes.
Now, in the past had your experience simply been that
because of the noise individuals simply could not hear
the messages or that because of the amount of noise
the messages were breaking up? - A. Usually with the
great amount of noise it is impossible to hear the
radios, yes.
       LORD JUSTICE TAYLOR:       Can you just help me about
 the ear piece? It is one ear only, is it?- A. That is
.right, sir.. It is a little hanger, hangs over your ear.
"it "is:"’a‘:1.rttTe inductor that just presse's"'against. cpe.: s    .:;
 eardrum there.
Is it the kind of thing which if anybody grabbed it can
do any harm to the wearer? - A. Oh, no. If it is pulled
it iust comes away from the ears. It is like clipped
together.
Are there other devices you could have? I mean, I suppose
you could have earphones, could you, for both ears, shut
out some more noise and get some more sound in?- A. Yes,
sir, there is the ear defender type receiver which actually
works like an ear defender, two cups over the ear with the
receiver noise inside.
Is there any disadvantage to that? - A. Well, it is rather
large. You would not be able to wear helmets or anything
with them.
 Yes. You would not probably be able to hear anything you
 wanted to hear other than the radio? - A. Well, that is
 right, sir. You would not be able to hear anything going
 on around you. You would only be able to hear the radio.
      MR. GOLDSACK:   Well now, a time came, Mr. Sanderson,
 when you heard that the radio was breaking up? - A. That
 is right, yes.
 What time was that? - A. It would be just after 2 o'clock.
                                             A.   SANDERSON


And where were you then? - A. I was in the gymnasium.at
the time.
And by breaking up what do you actually_mean? - A. It
sounded at first, it was intermittent, it started at -
first, it was just, sort of, being clipped, the voices
were being clipped off. My original thought was there
had been- some, interference coming in. Apparently, I
was not there last year, but they had some interference
from a radio station last year and about the same time.
Was the breaking up affecting both messages from control
and messages to control?- A. It was coming from the control.
Could not tell that at first but after listening to it for
about five or six minutes I deduced that it was coming from
the control room. That is when I started to make my way
towards the control room, thinking there was a fault.
Believing at first that it was interference from another
radio, did you do anything at that stage?- A. No, because
I was the other side any way so there was nothing I could
have done any way.
You say within a few minutes when it continued you made
y o u r , way. towards the Police control room? - A. That is
fight,             "      '   '       . ...... • .
What is your best estimate of the time you reached the
Police c.ontrol box?- A. It would be about half-past-2,'
just after half-past-2, because I remember walking round
the inside perimeter of the fence with Mr. Beal and the
players had just started coming out for a warm-up.
 By then was it possible to make sense of what was coming
 out ove-r the radio?- A. Well, the messages were still being
 passed around but I was not really taking a great deal of
 notice of what was being said. I was just listening to
‘the radio itself. I know it sounds a bit double Dutch but.
 I think I follow. - A. Yes.
At all events, once you got into the Police control room
what was the first thing that you did? If it helps to
identify it on the photographs, please do so? - A. Well,
the first thing I did was to change the desk microphone.
That is photograph No. 48, right in the centre. There is
a blue desk microphone, what we call a tulip microphone.
My first thoughts were that this could be breaking up, so
I changed that for a small'black telephone type handset.
 That iust plugs in, does it? - A. Yes, it just plugs into
 the front of the set.
 So you unplugged that and plugged a different one in?
 - A. Plugged a different one in.
                                               A.   SANDERSON


Any difference? - A. No. The fault continued. So I thought
then that there could be a problem with the fixed equipment,
so then I connected up the emergency set which was placed
underneath the bench.
Now, were you aware prior to doing that that the lead from
the stand-by equipment was not long enough to reach the
desk? - A. Well, no, not really thought about that, not if
they were going to use it as a handset, but in the situation
where they have it, switch to talk-through, it is irr­
elevant any way. They would not need it.
Having changed from the original to the reserve base
station was there any. improvement? - A. As far as I know,
yes. They seemed quite happy with it. They tried it out
and it was all working fine.
When you say it was working fine do you mean that the radio
messages were not breaking up then? - A. That is right.
What they were using, they did not use the handset on the
emergency set, they used a Motorola personal radio which
they sat on top of the desk acting in the same way as the
tulip'microphone so they would be able to pick it up, use
it on the desk. They started using that. It was working
fine. There were no problems then. They were quite happy
with i t .
For how long did you remain in the Police contr<?l room?
- A. After connecting it up, do you mean?
Yes. - A. Yes. Not long.    About five minutes, probably
not even that long.
Did you then make your way back to the gymnasium? - A. No.
I informed them that I would be staying available in case
the fault came again, so I just went down the bottom of
the stairs and stayed underneath the control room.
And were you continuing to listen in on your own radio?-
- A. That is right, yes.
This would be - what - about 20-to-3?~ A. About lQ-to-3.
Did you hear the messages coming over the radio?- A. Yes,
I could hear messages being passed, yes.
Was there any difficulty in hearing them from where you
were? ~ A. No.
 That is both messages .in and messages out? - A. Yes. I
 could not, like I said before, I am not really taking a
 great deal of notice of what was being said. I was just
 listening to make sure that that problem especially did
 not occur again, the breaking up, so I was just listening

up f a i r l y l o u d and hold th e p i e c e to your ear to be able
to hear it.

C o u l d you r e c o g n i z e    over t h e rad i o     Sergeant         Goddard's     voice?
A. I c o u l d h e a r h i s       voice, yes.

You were       conscious          that S e r g e a n t G o d d a r d was    relaying messages

I say, I was not r e a l l y t a k i n g ' m u c h notice. of<-.-who was;, s a y i n g               .

b a s e s t a t i o n the r a d i o w a s w o r k i n g and was no l o n g e r b r e a k i n g
up. A. T h a t        is right.

 And you      did      not h a v e any c a u s e    to   go   back and       carry out any
 further      o p e r a t i o n s ? A. No.

 After that day did you c a r r y out any i n s p e c t i o n y o u r s e l f of
 the o r i g i n a l b a s e s t a t i o n ? A. No, I did not r e t u r n to the
 e q u i p m e n t , that was d o n e by the       H o m e O f f i c e engineers.

 Do you h a v e any views, b a s e d on                 your e x p er i e n c e , as to why
 the r a d i o was b r e a k i n g up? A. L o o k i n g back on it now, yes,
 b e c a u s e the r a d i o s y s t e m s w i t c h e d to a talk t h r o u g h f a c i l i t y ,
 w h i c h is a g r o u n d to g r o u n d c o m m u n i c a t i o n , w h i c h means

 f e a t u r e for this p a r t i c u l a r b a s e station.

 P u t t i n g it in s h o r t h a n d is that too much use? A. That is
 how it is d e s i g n e d , this p a r t i c u l a r set is d e s i g n e d when
 it is s w i t c h e d to t a l k - t h r o u g h f a cility.       It is to give

they can get the m e s s a g e s p a s s e d q u i c k e r .            Th e only oth e r

Can you just help u s ' t o get to u n d e r s t a n d just what was

fair? A. A f t e r I c h a n g e d the sets, a b o u t twenty to, quarter
to three, yes, that is r i g h t .

In your s t a t e m e n t you s e e m to s u m m a r i z e      it as 2.30, after
2.30 all was well. A. No, b e c a u s e I was                   s till m a k i n g my

It was a” lit.tle l a t e r       than      2.30   when   the    radios ''began t o"” '

 off .

 T hat is a n o r m a l    problem     as    I understand        it.    A. That      is   it,
 yes .

 As for o u t - g o i n g m e s s a g e s in the p e r i o d when t h i n g s have
 b r o k e n up is t h i s the s i t u a t i o n : that some m e s s a g e s might
 a c t u a l l y h a v e b e e n h e a r d and u n d e r s t o o d but o t h e r s might
 not have b ee n u n d e r s t o o d b e c a u s e of the b r e a k i n g up of
 the s i g n a l ? A. T h a t is right.

 It was t o u c h and go as to w h e t h e r a m e s s a g e w o u l d at that
 s t ag e or d u r i n g that p e r i o d h a v e b ee n r e c e i v e d ? A. What
                                                                 A. S A N D E R S O N
the p r o b l e m t u r n e d out to be was the only m e s s a g e s that
got b r o k e n up from the c o n t r o l r o o m o u t w a r d s was if they
w e r e s p e a k i n g and s o m e o n e e l s e t r i e d to t a l k to pass a
m e s s a g e b a c k to cont r o l .

So that, as I say, it is a m a t t e r of t o u c h and                      go as to
w h e t h e r a m e s s a g e w o u l d a c t u a l l y have gone_. A.       Yes.

But some m e s s a g e s     would     and    some    messages       would     not.
A. T h a t is right.

      Cross-examined           by MR.     JACKSON

Mr. S a n d e r s o n , can you a s s i s t .             Am I r i g h t in a s s u m i n g that

W h a t e v e r the type of e m e r g e n c y it is l i k e l y to be that                   that

                               Q A r e you?    A.         No, not at all.    I mean, you can only use,

                                      your way to the          C o n t r o l Room. A.                That's right.

                               Q.     And at the time that you w e n t r o und you think that the
                                      team had a l r e a d y c o m e on to the p i t c h for the warm-up.

         t h ro u g h , yes.     The c a p a b i l i t y was t h ere for him to do it
         if he w i s h e d , yes.

 Q .. He c o u l d not get to it b e c a u s e he had to cr o u c h down, or
      whatever.           A.      Th a t ' s right.    The h a n d - s e t when e x t e n d e d
      only came to a b o u t a foot abo v e the h e i g h t of the bench.
      Not only that, the s p e a k e r is f i t t e d to the box in the unit
      w h i c h w o u l d h a v e been u n d e r the b e n c h so it w o u l d have been
      very d i f f i c u l t to hear.

    Q.    So it s o u n d s as t h o u g h        it was       a thoroughly incompetent
          bit of f i t t i n g in that            box?         A.   You mean the spare sets?

    Q.    Yes.        A.         Well,yes,       it was     only    there      as    an emergency.

    Q.    It was a p r e t t y u s e l e s s e m e r g e n c y if you c a n n o t use               it
          b e c a u s e it is i m p o s s i b l e to get at it, is it not?
          A.        I s u p p o s e , l o o k i n g at it like that, yes.

    Q.    What oth er way is t h er e of l o o k i n g at it?                  What is the
          p o i n t of h a v i n g s o m e t h i n g for an e m e r g e n c y when you cannot
          use it p r o p e r l y if t h e r e is the e m e r g e n c y ?        A.     Well,
          it was there, it c o u l d have been used.                      It was c a p a b l e of
          b ein g used, yes.             Had the s i t u a t i o n arose, I am sure we
          c o u l d have f o u n d a way r o u n d it.

                   MR. C O L L I N S :        That will o b v i o u s l y have          to    be   re-thought

0 .        LORD J U S T I C E TAYLOR: Do you know anything about the
      Tannoy system that was in o p e r a t i o n that day, or did you have
      anything to do w i t h that? - A . No, it was nothing to do with
      rae.

Q. Mr. San d e r s o n   would you wait a moment.  There             may be another
   question.       If    you would just wait a moment-

                    P O L I C E C O N S T A B L E PHILIP HOPSON Called

                             Examined by MR.       PHILLIPS:

Q.    You are Pol i c e C o n s t a b l e Philip Hoos o n ?   Is that right? - A.
      That is correct, sir.

0.    There are one or two matters out of your statement I want to
      ask you about, mr. Hooson.   You were on duty at the match, and
      part of your dut y was to go to the Midland Station, was it
      not? - A. That is correct, sir.

Q. W ith a serial of other Officers to meet supporters off the
   trains? - A. That is correct.

0.     These would be the o r d i n a r y service trains at the Midland
       Station, and they w e r e supporters from both Liverpool and
•     -N o t t i n g h a m ‘Forest ?-•-■ A ., That is, c o r r e c t , ves.,. .... %

q   . when the s u p p o r t e r s ' c a m e off the trains at the station aid you
      and the rest of your serial have some method of searching, and
      filt ering the fans? - A . We did, sir, yes.

G.    What did you do with regard to the football supporters? How
      did you filter them? - A. What do you mean?  How, physically
      or how did the a r r a n g e m e n t work?

 Q.    Yes. - A. How would you like me to explain it t-o you?          What I
       am trying to say is w hen they arrived at the exit it was like
       a matter of d e p e n d i n g on the identification with whatever
       scarf they wer e w e a r i n g or what ticket they had on them.   The
       Nott i n g h a m Forest went down to the bottom end of the train
       station and the Liverpool fans went to the top side.

 G.    So you se p a r a t e d them into two groups effectively at the
       ticket barrier? - A. M ore or less, yes, sir.

 G.    When you got them into the a p p r o priate group what did you
       do? Did you search each one? - A. No.       My serial did not
       search each one.

 Q.         LORD JUSTICE TAYLOR:            How did you get them into the same
       group?    I can see it if they are obviously wearing colours of
       the club, but o t h e r w i s e what do you do?   Liverpool on the
       left, N o t t i n g h a m on the right?  How did you separate them off?
       - A.   That is basically it. sir.          British Transport Police,
       they have all the inform a t i o n as regards what trains what fans
       were u sing and which p l a tform they were going to arrive at,
       and they b a sically did the s egregation prior to them arriving
                                           15

                                                                       P. HOOSON


          to us.       We just c o n t i n u e d it, ensuring that the Nottingham
          F o r e s t fans went d own to their coll e c t i o n point and the
          Liverpool fans went to theirs, basically speaking.

q   .              MR. PHILLIPS:       So the Liverpool trains and the
          No t t i n g h a m trains arrived at different times, did they? - A.
          As far as I am aware.

0. And you w ould get a batch of supporters all from the Liverpool
   train and another batch fro m the N o ttingham train? - A. That
   is right, sir.

0.        Were you con c e r n e d to know whether the people who came through
          the barriers had tickets for the match? - A. What we did, when
          they came thro u g h and if we had identified them as football
          supporters, we asked them w h e r e they were going.             Our
          instructions were not to a l l o w them into the city centre.         So
          we s e a r c h e d them for a ticket, and if they had a ticket,
          d e p e n d e n t whet h e r they cam e from Liverpool or Nottingham,
          d e t e r m i n e d w h i c h end of t h e platform we sent them to.

Q. You say you s e a rched them for a ticket.                Does that mean you
   s e a rched e v e r y o n e who a p p e a r e d to be a football supporter for
   a ticket? - A. Basically, yes, sir.

/<£;■' •• ‘— XORD" JUST I C E TAYLOR : . That really means ^that ^rhose .-who . .
      came without''tickets had the ’advantage of gBirrg,' l h t ^
      that those who came wit h tickets did not have? - A. That'Is
      it, basically, sir.                                     .             ..

q    .;        MR. PHILLIPS:    And it was only those with tickets you
          sent along to the buses that were   going to the ground? -A.
          That is   it, sir.  As far as I can remember, yes.

Q.        So if a   person had sai d to you he was going                    to the match but
          had not   got a tick et wit h him you would not                 let him get on the
          bus? - A. If a pers on what, sir?

Q. Said that he was going to the football match but did not have
   a ticket with him when yo u searched him, you would not let him
   go to the a p p r o p r i a t e bus to go to the ground? - A. I d o n ’t
   know, sir.    I did not p a r t i c u l a r l y come across that problem
   that I can remember.

    0.     All of those who came....            - A. As far     as I can recollect,        yes.

    Q.      Then I think you and your serial went off to the ground after
           you had finished d e a l i n g with the arrival of supporters at the
           station? - A. That is right, sir.

    0. And the bus you went on t r avelled along Middlewood Road, past
       H i l l s b o r o u g h Park and d o w n Leppings Lane from the Catch Bar
       Lane end? - A. That is right, sir.

    Q.     I think you had a jour n e y along Leppings Lane.                   What time
           would it be when you w e r e going down Leppings Lane? - A .
           Roughly s p e a k i n g it w o u l d be 20-to-3, q u a r t e r - t o - 3 , roughly.

Q. A bout q u a r t e r - t o - 3 ? - A. R o u g h l y speaking,     yes.

0. And how was you r journey dow n Leppings Lane? - A. it was very
   slow b e c a u s e there were q u i t e a lot of people down there.

Q.       What sort of bus was        it you were in? - A. A double decker.

Q. A South Y o r k s h i r e T r a nsport bus? - A.           That is right,        sir.

Q. Had that bus been held up at the C a t c h Bar Lane end for any
   time? - A. What do you m e a n by the Catch Bar Lane end?

Q. At the C a t c h Bar Lane end of Leppings Lane.                      We have heard
   som e e v i d e n c e that there was a line of three                 buses held up by
   a Police serial, and was e v e n t u a l l y let down                Leppings Lane? -
   A.   It did stop, sir, but the exact location I                      am not sure.
   It was in Leppings Lane.

G.       Had you p r e v i o u s l y a t t ended at football Semi-Finals at this
         ground? - A. Yes, one or two over the years.

Q. How did you consider the p e o p l e in Leppings Lane?

                  MR. WOODWARD:       Sir, I do a p o l o g i s e for rising ana
     '■ i^nterT.upti.ng... but ..it .is-, i n - r e l a t i o n tq Mr .^Sanderson . The .. .
        purpose "of c a l l i n g him’ first this m o r n i n g :iV- that-
        a t t e n d a n c e is required u r g e n t l y e l s e w h e r e in rela'ti~o7r to -some
        matters that are h a p p e n i n g in Barnsley.                  Might he be released.

                LORD JUST I C E TAYLOR:   I was about to take an opportunity
         of s a y i n g that, because I have found what I wanted, which was
         s o mething which confirmed what he had to say.       So I don't
         think I need to ask him a n y t h i n g further about it.

                   MR. WOODWARD:        He will be a v a ilable should later
         i n f o r m a t i o n be required from him,    but his attendance is
         requ ired u r g e n t l y elsewhere, sir.

               LORD JUSTICE TAYLOR:             Yes,    he is free to go.

 q   .        MR. PHILLIPS:    Did the si t u a t i o n in Leppings Lane seem
         to you to be unu sual? - A. It did inasmuch that there were
         quite a lot of people t h e r e which I thought for that time of
         day.

 G.      And your     bus had some t r o u b l e getting down Leppings Lane,                did
         it? - A.     We did, sir.   We had to travel very slowly.

 G.      Were the fans out on the road then as well as on the pavement?
         - A. From the Leppings Lan e they were both sides, but in the
         main at the Leppings Lane turnstiles, but they were walking
         down the road towards the turnstiles.

 Q.       I think you went to t h e ' g y m n a s i u m as you were expected to             do
          and got there at about 5 - m i n u t e s - t o - 3 ? - A. That would be
          approximately.

                                                                                             P . HOOSON



                      Q. And you w e r e to be kept in r e s e r v e in the gymnasium? - A. That
                         is right, sir.

                      Q.       For further duties if required.  You then got orders to go to
                               the Leppings Lane stand? - A. To the West Stand, yes, sir.

                      Q. And did y o u go in fact on the pitch side or at the back of the
                B        N o r t h Stand? - A . We went on the pitch side, sir, on the
                         track.

                      Q.       What did you see as you w e r e walk i n g towards the stand? - A.
                               As I was w a l k i n g up towards it I saw the ground was f u l l . and
                               we neared the West Stand I c o u l d see that the West Stand was
                               quite full, but the sect i o n to the right as you walk towards
                               it did not seem quite as full.

                      Q.       When talk i n g about the West Stand I think we should say the
                               terraces, the Leppings Lane terraces, rather than the Stand.
                               The s e c t i o n to the e x t r e m e right you say was not very full? -
                               A. It did not appear to be so.

                       G. W here did you see the b i g g e s t conce n t r a t i o n of people? - A.
                          The most of the stadium a p p e a r e d full, but to direct it
                 D        straight at the Lepp ings L a n e end, the full face of the
                      -   L e p pings -Lane end- seemed,, to .be. quite., full^^as^ far-.as.,.i -5 aw..-it-

                      Q.       Did you come to gate 4? - A . I did,               sir,   yes.

                      Q. Was that gat e open or clo s e d when you got there? -.A.                          It was
                        /closed, sir.

                      Q. What did you see.

                                    LORD JUST ICE TAYLOR:              Have you the time when this was
                               going on?

                       q                 m r . PHILLIPS:      What time was it when you got to or were
                               a p p r o a c h i n g gate 4? - A. I would not be q uite sure to give you
                               an exact time.            As far as i can remember it was before 3
                               o ’clock, bef o r e the kick-off, because the players were warming
                               up on the pitch as we w a l k e d into the stadium.

                       Q.      Did you see anything that h a p p e n e d on the pitch after you got
                               to the Leppings Lane t e r r a c e s ? - A . On the pitch, sir?

                       Q.      Yes? - A.      No,   not on the pitch.

                       Q.       You d o n ’t k n o w w h e t h e r t h e g a m e had s t a r t e d or h ow long it
                                went  o n ? - A. A b s o l u t e l y n o idea, sir.

                       u   ,
                                You say gate 4 was clos e d ?         - A.   That is right,        sir.

                       G. What did you see in pen 4? - A. I saw that there was quite a
                          number of people crushed up to the fencing.  They seemed to be
                  H       in quite a d e s p e r a t e situation.

                                    track.

                              Q.    What did you see as you were w a l k i n g towards the stand? - A.
                                    As I was w a l k i n g up towa rds it I saw the ground was full, and
                                    we neared the West Stand I could see that the West Stand was
                                    q u i t e full, but the section to the right as you walk towards
                                    it did not seem quite as full.

                              U.     When t a l k i n g about the West Stand I think we should say the
                                     terraces, the Lepp ings Lane terraces, rather than the Stand.
                                     The s e c t i o n to the extr e m e right you say was not very full? -
                                     A. It did not appe ar to be so.

                              Q.     W h e r e did you see the bigg e s t c o n c entration ofpeople? -                           A.
                      D              The most of the stadium a p p e a r e d full, but to direct it
                                     strai g h t at the Leppings L ane end, the full face of the

                              u . Did you come to gate 4? - A.                       I did,     sir,    yes.

                              Q,     Was that gate open or cl o s e d when you got there? - A.                                It was
                                     closed, s ir.

                              Q.     What did you see.

                                          LORD JUST I C E TAYLOR:                  Have you the time when this was
                                     going on?

                              Q.               MR. PHILLIPS:         What time was it when you got to or were
                                     a p p r o a c h i n g gate 4 ? - A. I w ould not be quite sure to give you
                                     an exact time.            As far as i can remember it was before 3
                                     o'clock, before the kick-off, because the players were warming
                                     up on the pitch as we w a l k e d into the stadium.

                              Q.     Did y o u s e e a n y t h i n g t h a t h a p p e n e d on the p i t c h af te r you got
                                     to the L e p p i n g s Lane t e r r a c e s ? - A. On t he pitch, sir?

                              Q.       Yes? - A. No,          not on the pitch.

                              Q.      You d on't know whether the game had started or                             how long        iz
                                     went on? - A. A b s o l u t e l y no idea, sir.

                               0.      You say gate ^ was closed? - A. That is right,                             sir.

                              Q.       What did you see in pen 4? - A. I saw that there was quite a
                                      number of people crushed up to the.fencing.    They seemed to be
                          H           in q uite a d e s p e r a t e situation.

Q.    Thar, of course, would be the first of the two centre pens you
      came to? - A. That is right, sir.

Q.    Were there other Officers on duty outside pen 4? - A. As I
      w alked on the track as I can remember there were three Police
      Officers s t a n d i n g on the track.

Q. Were they conscious or appear to be conscious of what was
   going on in pen 4? - A. I can't say, sir.  I really d o n ’t
   know.

Q.        Were they look ing towards pen 4 or out towards the pitch? - A.
         As far as I can remember they were not looking towards the
         pitch.

Q. When you got to pen 4 you found the gate closed, you saw
   people crushed up against the fence.                 Did you take the ■
   o p p o r t u n i t y of look ing a l o n g towards pen 3? -A. Not that I can
   remember, sir.

Q.       You can't say whet her No. 3 gate was open or not? - A. What I
         can say to you, when I wa l k e d on that track towards pen 4
         t here were no gates open.

G. None at all? - A. None at all,           sir.

G.       Were there s p ectators on the perimeter track'?--- A.   no.-sir.

G.       None at all? - A.   None at all.   sir.   .

Q . ;What did you do then when you saw what you did see in pen 4? -
     A. What I did. I realised there was something desperately
     wrong, and of course u n d e r s t a n d i n g that the orders are that
     nobody goes on to the track, I had to decide to open the gate.
     I told the Police Offi c e r there - I have no idea who he is -
     to inform the control room that we will need some assistance
     and we would open the gate, and then I went and opened the
     gate.

 Q.      I think you deba ted a bit w ith yourself,    did you,   before d o i n g
         so? - A. I think so, sir, yes.

 G. And we have the views or the thoughts you had in your
    s t atement? - A. That is right, sir.

 q   .        LORD JUST ICE TAYLOR:  What was the thought? - A. I
         think, "If I'm wrong I'm going to get a right bollocking for
         this".

 q   .       MR. PHILLIPS:          That tends to suggest that you had had it
         clearly drummed into you n o t .to open these gates.        Is that
         right? - A. It is, sir.          Ove r the years of attending football
         matches the practice is that nobody goes on to the track
         except in exceptional circumstances, i.e. they are under
         arrest or they are il l or in the wrong part of the football
         stadium and cons e q u e n t l y would be escorted to where they
         wanted to go or taken to the Police room or whatever.

      B a s ically they are not allo w e d freedom of movement on to the
      pitch.

Q. Was that s o m e t h i n g that had been told to you that very day or
   s o mething you had heard p r e v i o u s l y ? - A. "It is something that
   you know w h i c h is d r u m m e d into you, as you suggested, over the
   years.    It is not s o m e t h i n g I was aware of-being told on that
   day.    It is just s o m e t h i n g I know as a Police Officer.

Q.    The person you spoke to you say he had a radio - did he have a
      radio? - A. He did, sir, yes.

Q.    Did he appear to give the m e s s a g e you wanted him to give? - A.
      I d o n ’t know, sir. I did not n ecessarily wait for him.

Q.    We   heard e v i d e n c e from a C o n s t a b l e Illingworth who said that
      he   was the one who opened gat e 4.                Could you comment on that.
      Do   you know him? - A. I have no idea, sir.                 I don't know who
      he   is.

 Q. He would have been in p o s i t i o n already before you arrived? -
    A. I have no idea. sir.     I d o n ' t know who he is.

 Q.   You did ope n the gate,        did you? - A.       I did,    sir,   yes.

                                           /Q.   When you opened the gate
                                                                        P.   HOOSON


When you opened the gate did you have any difficulty
opening it? - A. No, I had no difficulty.
It did not spring open?- A. I mean, not that I can
remember. I just grabbed the gate, opened the gate,
pulled it open and that is it. Whether there was any
pressure behind it or not I did not recogrtise it as
such.
Were you able to get any of the people out of the pen?
- A. Yes.
And did that seem to do any good? - A. Well, as soon as you
pulled one out there was another one to take their place.
It did not matter - it seemed at the time, initially, no
matter how many you pulled out, and each one took a great
deal of effort, there was another one to take their place.
The people you pulled out, did they appear to be to you
either injured or in physical distress? - A. Oh, yes, sir,
they were very distressed.
Did they appear to be injured? - A. There were some app­
eared to be injured.
.The corves-:,y ourJsoo.k-----o.u.t.-.were- ,a.ble t o ;.waIk:^)uxi-onC'e-'-'-yoij-’
extracted<•'them from, the g a teway,- were •they?- - -A.- Yes                         —
Some ran off.
Some ran off.   You of course had other Officers with you,
did not you? - A. That is right, sir.
How many of you altogether do. you think there were trying
to get people out? - A. Well, initially there would be
myself, P.C. Akred and Sergeant Swift, as far as I can
remember. I was not taking particular notice at the time
who was there. Of course, as time went by ....
     LORD JUSTICE TAYLOR:   Sorry. There was yourself,
P.C. Akred and .... - A ...... Sergeant Swift, sir.
Swift. - A. And consequently we were joined by other
 Officers as time went by.
      MR. PHILLIPS:  And you three, I suppose, would be all
busily engaged at the gateway itself?- A. Initially, sir,
yes .
 There would not really be much room for other Officers to
 help there, would there? - A. No, sir.
      LORD JUSTICE TAYLOR:     Were you all part of the same
 serial? - A. "fftat is correct.
        MR. PHILLIPS:            Were other efforts being made to get
                                                       P . 'HOOSON


people out of that pen that you were aware of? - A. As
time went by, from what I can recollect, Police Officers
were trying to pull the fencing down with their hands and
drag people out as best they could.
You were not one of those? - A. No, sir.
You stayed at the gateway, did you, for some time? - A.               I
s tayed there..
Can I iust go back to one matter that I should have asked
you about? When you got to the pen in the first place did
you hear anything" from the crowd itself? - A. Well,
initially, it was just a lot of noise, a real lot- of
noise, that is not unusual for a match this size, you do
not particularly take notice of, not knowing anything was
wrong at this time. But as I neared pen 4 it became
apparent these people were shouting and screaming and
they were screaming for help.
For help? - A. That is right, sir.
Can you remember anything that was said or is it impossible?
- A. It is difficult, sir. It is difficult.

And then I think you have given us in your statement some
examples of particular people that you helped to get out
of the pen. I think there was one person with a broken
arm, was there? - A. That is right, sir.
This was a young boy? - A. About 16 I think he was.
How did you manage to get him out? - A. He seemed to have
managed to pull himself up above other people and he was
shouting to us. We leaned over, just grabbed over and
dragged him out.
 When you say leaned over do you mean over the top of the
 fence^or through the gateway? - A. No, through the gateway.
 Had to hold on to the side of the gate to grab hold of
 him ....
 Were the people then in the gateway standing up or were
 they on the ground? - A. They were standing up, sir, well,
 in a fashion. They were not erect, as such, but standing,
 sir.
 From your position which was perhaps the closest into the
 pen that we have seen did you see any people on the ground?
 - A. There were some on the ground in front of the gate,

                              Q. In front of the gate?- A. Yes.
                              Q. They would of course be difficult to see when you were at
                                 first taking people out, would not they? - A. They would,
                                 sir, yes.
                              Q. Did you get to them eventually? - A.        We did, sir.

                          B   Q. Can you give us any idea how many people there were like
                                 that? - A. On the ground?
                              Q. Yes. - A. From what I can remember, probably four or five.
                              Q. Four or five. - A. Yes.        They were, kind of, stuck at the
                                 gate.
                              Q. Stuck at the gate. - A. On the floor, yes.
                              Q. All in the close proximity of the gate? - A. At that tine,
                                 yes, sir.
                               Q. Did you see any way in which the pressure on these people
                                  at the front could be relieved? -A. The only way I could
                                  see it at that time was to perhaps get a serial into the
                          D       back of this stand to start pulling people out from the
                                  back ,tA ciake. .the^ fjeople^ at the front or near the front

                              Q.Did you do anything about that? - A. From what I can
                                   remember, there was an Inspector present but at the
                                ;■ time everything was very confused  and I cannot remember
                               ' who it was. No idea who it was.      And I asked him to ge
                                                                                         o-t
                                   a serial in the back and do this.
                               Q.   Yes. Were you able to observe from where you were any
                                    Officers getting into the back of the terrace? - A. Yes,
                                    sir.
                               Q. Did they go into the back of the terrace? - A. From        what
                                  I can remember, they did go in the back end of the
                                  terrace eventually.
                               0. And did that relieve some of the pressure that there was
                                  at the front? - A. Eventually it did, when they had to work
                                  their way through these people.
                               Q. How long do you say it was really before the pressure was
                                  relieved sufficiently for people to get out under their own
                                  steam?- A. It is hard to say. Could be 20 minutes.
                               0. As long as 20 minutes? - A. It is hard to say, sir.          Could
                                  be totally incorrect on my estimation.
                               0. And that is starting from just before the match kicked off?
                                  - A. That is right, sir.

Yes. And then I think you went away from the gate and did
a lot to help those who had been taken outon tothe pitch?
- A. That   is right, sir.
To-see if     you could assist, along with many other people?
- A. That     is right, sir.
      MR. PHILLIPS:         Yes.   Thank you very much.
                 Cross-examined by MR. HYTNER:
In view of the thoughts you had to yourself on the day I
can keep my questions very short. The reason that you
thought you.might get a bollocking if you made a mistake
is that the whole of your training was to the effect that
those gates were meant for Police use, to get^somebody out
who was under arrest or to allow a Policeman into the
terrace to make an arrest or do something of that sort.
- A. That is right, is it? - A. That is the basic under­
standing, sir.
 Yes. The one thing you were never trained in relation
 to the gates was that they might be for use to get fans
 out who were under pressure through crowd trouble, through
 crowd pressure?- A. Well, it is not a matter of training.

 Common sense.      That is what you did. - A. Yes.-
 It was not due to anything that you had been taught? -A.
 No, sir, it is common sense.
 The next thing is this. Going back in time, if I may.
 Coming up Leppings Lane from Catch Bar Lane you were in
 a prime position to see the back of the crowd that was
 pressing into the turnstile area? - A. That is right, sir.
 You skirted the       back of that crowd?- A. That is right, sir.
 And there were still people coming down and up Leppings Lane
 to join that throng?   - A. That is right, sir.
 And all you saw, the   impression that you had,    having your
 bus skirting just the edge of that mob or press, was of a
 press of people, a mass of people, simply trying to get
 into a football ground?- A. That is basically it, sir.
 Nothing more.       Nothing less? - A. That is it, sir.
 And coming forward in time again, can you tell us because
 it may be important when you made your statement that we
 are now ^oing from?   Do you remember how soon     after the
 incident?- A. It would be - the disaster happened on the

   Saturday, returned to work on the Monday, returned on nights
   - it would be some time during that week.
Q. You see, the importance is this, that many things that are said
    now about what the Police should have done it may be said,
    well, this is all with the benefit of hindsight. It was
    at the very time of this tragedy that you appreciated that
    it was no good asking people at the front of the terrace
    to push back, you needed a serial at the back to pull
    people backwards at the back? - A. That is how I saw it.
0. You actually made that suggestion to              a Superior Officer at
   the time? - A. That is correct, sir.
          MR. K Y TN E R :     Thank you.
                     Cross-examined by MR. JACKSON:
0. Two matters, Mr. Hooson.             Would you look at this photo­
   graph, please?
          MR. JACKSON:         My Lord, it is not one that is before
   you:

   and the observation        that you have as to therelative
   densities of pens 6 and 7 and pens 3 and 4.
        MR. JACKSON:   This is the first witness, My Lord,
   who has come from that side of the ground. All the
   others have come .... Each of my friends has seen the
   photograph.
        LORD JUSTICE TAYLOR:              Sorry.   This is the first
   witness who has come from?
          MR.       JACKSON: Has approached it that        way    round.
          MR.       COLLINS:    That is not correct.
          LORD JUSTICE TAYLOR:            I do not think that is right.
         MR. COLLINS:   We have had about half-a-dozen who
    came from that ....
          MR. JACKSON:          Since I had the photograph.
          LORD JUSTICE TAYLOR:              Since you had the photograph.
          MR. COLLINS:          Oh, since you had the photograph.
          MR. JACKSON:          I understand each of ray friends has

seen the photograph.
     MR. CPLLINS:      I have not.
     MR. WOPDWARD:      That is not right.       I have not seen it.
     LPRD JUSTICE TAYLPR:     I will pass it to you in a
moment, Mr. Woodward. Is this, by any chan-ce, one of a
series that appeared in the Liverpool evening paper?
     MR. JACKSON:      Yes.
     LPRD JUSTICE TAYLOR:   I remember seeing.             Taken by a
fan in the stand, is that right?
     MR. JACKSPN:   I understand it to be from the paper
itself. There are a number of other amateur photographers.
I understand this is the Liverpool evening paper.
     LORD JUSTICE TAYLOR:        Yes, Isee.
     MR. JACKSON:      I am told it is The Echo.
     LORD JUSTICE TAYLPR:       That is an evening paper, is it?
     MR. JACKSPN: _ I understand so.
    'LORD JUSTICE TAYLOR:       Was that on the Friday- after’?''" -
     MR. JACKSON:   I am receiving, as it were, information
from ny side. I have the sequence. This is the earliest.
I apologise to those of my learned friends who have not
seen it. I did think the ....
     LPRD JUSTICE      TAYLPR: There is only one copy, is there?
     MR.   JACKSPN: At this stage there are negatives and
smaller copies available.
     MR. CPLLINS:      Does not appear to be timed.
     LPRD JUSTICE TAYLPR:       It is.   2.59.
     MR.   CPLLINS: I did     not see that./
     MR.  JACKSPN: Yes.    As far as we can gather the match
kicked off some 25 seconds before 3 o'clock.
      LPRD JUSTICE TAYLPR:      Just see the goalkeeper on the
 left edge.
      MR. JACKSON:   Mr. Hooson, I want to ask you three
 questions about that. You told us when you arrived that
 there weie no people on the track.
                                                        P.   HOOSON


         LORD JUSTICE TAYLOR: Sorry. Just forgive me a moment.
    Has everybody not seen it? I think it should go along the
    line lust before you go any further. Then hope to get
    another copy.   (Photograph shown)   I do not think either
    of the Assessors have had a chance to see it yet either.
         MR. WOODWARD:     There is a timing on it, sir.
         LORD JUSTICE TAYLOR: Yes.        If I remember there is      a
    whole series with the time on.
         MR. JACKSON:   Mr. Hooson, clearly, looking at things
    from different angles can give different impressions, but
    there we see a photograph that rather strikingly reveals
    the difference in density between the pens on the extreme
    right and the pens in the centre. Having seen what you
    saw. does that photograph reflect thedifference that you
    perceived? ~ A. Basically ....
    In fairness to all other witnesses, does that exaggerate
    that which you saw or does it reflect pretty accurately
    the difference between the two? - A. Well, when you are
    stood on the ground you are looking at it from different
    angles. You obviously.get a different impression.
  That is why I asked the question. - A. What I perceived
''wheri-'I^apprba'che'd the'West 'Stand'wa;s simply- that.„th.es.a-
‘‘side pens did not sreem as full as the centre pens'. '
    May I then move on to the next point?
/

             LORD JUSTICE TAYLOR:      I just wonder whether, because
    we have seen something of the same on these photographs,
    looking at these photographs one wondered whether part
    of the visual effect may be due to shadow and sun on the
    front part and shadow further back but I am not sure. I
    m e r e l y ' raise that point for consideration.

S e r g e a n t S w i f t was in f r o n t of me as w e ll at that time.

You   think?     A.   That     is    right.

W h e r e w e r e you going,           w h a t was your d e s t i n a t i o n ? A.    To

It was     not u n t i l you  got up to the W e s f S t a n d that a n ythi ng
struck     you? A. T h a t is right.

In the c o u r s e of the e v e n t s of that a f t e r n o o n is it right
that the re was a t i me wh en m i n u t e s hung and seemed like hours
and ot h e r times w he n you l o o k e d at your w atch and time had

 we had b e en r e l i e v e d and s a t down that we a p p r e c i a t e d
 that time had p assed.

 T h e r e were a l r e a d y o f f i c e r s in the area of the gate that you

 You are      q u i t e clear,       are you, that         you opened the gate?
 A. Sir,      with r espect          that gate was         shut and I opened that
 gate.

 Someone must         h a v e c a u s e d it to be opned              but in the ev i d e n c e

But your r e c o l l e c t i o n         is    clear       of    opening       the gate?
A. A b s o l u t e l y .

That      is b e f o r e    the    kick-off?          A.    Before       the kic k-off,         Sir..

From      the m o m e n t that you o p e n e d it wo u l d it be right                          to say
that      you w ere m or e or less by it? A. That is right.

Until      you had got out of that                     pen        as many      people     as   you
could      help? A. T h a t is right.

As you had been w a l k i n g a l o n g in fro n t of the N o rt h Stand to

or w e re any s p e c t a t o r s w a l k i n g a l o n g the front of the West

You are not s a y i n g that                  was not h a p p e n i n g ?        A. I am not s a y i n g
that was not the case.-                       I am s i m p l y sa y i n g        I do not r e m e m b e r

And if your e v i d e n c e is c o r r e c t and you have done your lest
to r e c a l l it f r o m the m o m e n t that you p e r c e i v e d any p r o b l e m
you gave h e l p by o p e n i n g the gate and did all that you
cou l d u n t i l the p r o b l e m in the pen had been r e s o l v e d ? A. Tha t
is r i g h t , S i r .

When         you o p e n e d the gate f i r st of all it is right,                             is it,
that       p e o p l e did not c om e f l o o d i n g out of it? A. No,                        Sir,
they       could n o t .

 They      were    just         jammed    the r e ?    A.       T hat   is right.

 W h at    you    had      to    do was       to   get?     A.    Physically        pull   them out.

 To    drag      them      out?    A.    Yes.

 And       that     is wh at      you then o c c u p i e d yo u r s e l f          in doing      for

 If what you say is r i g h t as you a p p r o a c h e d the West Stand
 you  did not see any gate open u n t i l you a c t u a l l y opened

                         But by the time you            got to the track in front of the West

                          in r e l a t i o n to this.   Can I just say there has, of course,
                          also been e v i d e n c e from Mr. G r o b b e l a a r ---

                                  LORD J U S T I C E TAYLOR: I have                 it in mind.               In   fact,
                          I was    abo ut to ask a question.

                                    MR. HYT NER:         Mr. C o l l i n s at some stag e i n d i c a t e d that

                          as Mr. W o o d w a r d is c o n c e r n e d that I shall be m a k i n g s u b m i s s i o n s
                          based on the p r o p o s i t i o n that the evi d e n c e seems to suggest
                          that Gate 4 at any rate was o p e n e d and shut, open ed and shut,
                          and that is c o n s i s t e n t w i t h all w i t n e s s e s and it is also
                          c o n s i s t e n t w i t h the e v i d e n c e that we have heard very little
                          of, for o b v i o u s r e a s o n s , that some fans w e r e a c t u a l l y pushed
                          back into the t e r r a c e s once they had got out of the gate
                          on to the pitch.

                               LORD       JUSTICE          TAYLO R:        Well,    Mr.    Hytner,         this    is   an
                          address.

                                MR. HY TNER:   No, it is not                       an address.           I am simply

        L O RD J U S T I C E     T AYL OR:         The     question   I was     g o i ng     to put
to    this w i t n e s s :

You say, as I u n d e r s t a n d it, from the time that you                               opened
Gate 4, it r e m a i n e d open for at any rate 20 m i n u t e s                           or so
w h i l s t you w e r e g e t t i n g p e o p l e out, is that rig h t ?
A.        That is c o r r e c t .

Not    shut      at   al.l in     that     t i me?         A.    Not shut     at      all.

So if it was o p e n e d at all o t h e r than by you it must have
been o p e n e d b e f o r e you got to the front of the track, is
that rig h t ?       A.      That is c o r r e c t .

Was ther e ever a sta g e                 w h e n fans w e r e coming out             as if
the top had been t a k e n                off a C o c a - C o l a bot t l e ?         A.    No,
sir, no.

 You w e r e h a v i n g    to    peel     them      out?       A.     We were        having      to
 pr ize them out.

Did that c o n t i n u e r i g h t t h r o u g h or did there come a stage
at w h i c h the p r e s s u r e b e i n g r e l i e v e d , people were wa l k i n g

out.

 C o n s t a b l e G ary   Cammock,          is   t hat    right?      A.      That      is
 correct, yes.

 You, I think, w e r e on the s e r i a l w h i c h went to the

 A.        Th a t ' s c o r r e c t , yes.     One of the two serials.

 You were t h e r e for            some      considerable        time w a i t i n g      for    the

 W h en    it f i n a l l y did c o m e in, just bef o r e 2 o'clock, you

 Once you had a r r i v e d at L e p p i n g s Lane with the people                             from

Did you move from your position?   Did you move forward
during the course of... - A. Yes, I was constantly being
pushed forward from my position where I was.
How far from the front fence did you finish up? - A. I
would say it was about may be 10 - about 15 to 20 fee!
back from the actual gate in the fencing.   I think /ne
of the barriers was a couple of feet in front, the/final
barrier, before the fencing.
Did you see anybody on the wall on the other side of the
fence? - A. I saw Policemen there.   They were/on the
fence, like standing on the concrete and they/were above
the fence?
How many?   A. I th ink there were three, possibly   four
there.
What were they   doing? - A. Me were screatfiing at them to
open the gates   because people were getting crushed down
at the front.    They were just telling us to go back out
of the exits.    We could not even t u / n round at this
time.
      LORD JUSTICE TAYLOR:     Coujra you hear what they
were saying? - A. You were sort/of reading their lips,
saying, "Go to the exit" and tney were pointing over
towards that way.   There w a / j u s t no way. There must
have been thousands of people.
       HR. PHILIPS:   At that time was there anybody on
the floor? - A. I never/actually saw it myself.    I was
conscious of it because as I looked down towards the
front there was not exactly people standing up against
the fence, if you kaow what I mean.    They were being
crushed and somebody shouted out that there were people
dying and getting/crushed on the floors.    It was as if
there was a voicr between just where I was and the actual
fence.    There/were no actual heads to be seen.   It was
if they were/possibly on the floor.
Lying down?' - A. Possibly.    I could not see.   It was
just the tfact there seemed to be a gap between where I
was stood' and the front of the fence.   Normally you just
see heads going straight down and there did not seem to
be any /there.
Was this the situation when the Police were on the wall
ushering you to go backwards? - A. Yes.   They were
telling us to stop the pushing.   I do not think they
knew that the gates outside had been opened because they
were telling us to back off and go out of the exit.
There were times when I could not even breathe, the
pressure was that severe.

                                   The feelings that have been aroused in c onsequence of
                         thos'e events ought not to detr a c t from the careful analysis

                         simplistic v iew should be avoided.

                                LOR D JUSTICE TAYLOR:      T h a n k you,   Mr. Woodward.

                                MR.   TOULSON:    Sir, may I give you the page reference?

                                LORD JUSTICE TAYLOR:       Yes.     T h a n k you very much.

                                  MR. TOULSON:      It is in relation to Dr. Eastwood's evidence
                          that the cer t i f i e d figure r e m ained in his view a safe figure,
                          al t hough he had drawn attention to the Green Guide c a l c u lation
                          approach, is found in b rief at Day 28, page 22G to 23B, that
                          is in brief.      It is gone into at grea t e r length at pag e 67
                    J)    onwards the same day.        Sir, w o u l d you be kind enough to read
                          the p o i n t also wit h the final p a r agraph in our skeleton
                          submissions w h i c h deals wit h the question.

                                 LORD JUSTICE TAYLOR:      Yes,     thank y o u . ..........

                                   MR. COLLINS:     Sir, like those w h o have gone before, I
                          do^n't propose to repeat w h a t is already set out in w r i t i n g in
                    E     w h a t we have called our "Final Observations on be h a l f of the
                         /'Tribunal" but I think it w o u l d perhaps be helpful if I coimaented
                          on one or two matters that perhaps I have not cove r e d and w h i c h
                          have b e e n dealt w i t h by others.

                                 Sir, before I do that m a y I put on a white sheet and
                          r efer to a couple of errors in the observations.    T here are
                          of course some obvious typing errors but there are two v/hich
                          I think I ought to draw specific attention to.

                                The first occurs on page 15 in the p a r agraph n u m bered 2
                          on that page, the third line from the bottom.               As it reads
                          it is "But we do not think w e can be criticised".              Tha t should
                          be "he could be criticised".             It m a y be a fairly obvious error
                          but it o b v i o u s l y is an i m p ortant d i fference in the meaning.

                                   Sir, the other factual error v/hich has been d rawn to
                          m y a t tention occurs on page 34 at p a r a g r a p h 12 in the middle
                          of that page where the first sentence reads:             "Much ill feeling
                          was g e n erated by the a llegation mad e that afternoon that fans
                          had taken down a fence".      I h o n e s t l y cannot say how that got
                          there.     That should of course read "forced a gate".          Again
                          I think it is a fairly obvious e rror but one for w h i c h I
                          apologise.

          A t the risk of b e i n g told  that I am being simplistic, it
w o u l d app e a r f rom the evidence we have heard that the immediate
cause of this d i s a s t e r was the opening of Gate C at 3.52 w i t h o u t
the ta k i n g of adequa te steps, or indeed any steps, to prevent
those coming in through that gate from going into the pens.

       The pens w e r e already if not at capacity, cer t a i n l y ver y
 near capacity, and the additional numbers coming in quite
 clearly, w e w o u l d suggest, on the evidence that we have heard,
 caused the injuries and the deaths.

        N o w to say that that is and was the immediate cause is
 of course by no means the w h o l e    answer to the problems that
 face you sir in d e c i d i n g on the events of the 15th of April
 of this year, beca u s e there w e r e of course, or there are the
 questions to be asked as to w h a t necessitated the o p e n i n g of
 the gates, wha t caused the pens to be in a situation where
 they w e r e alre a d y at capacity and yet nothing had been done to
 ensure, quite apart from any question of opening of the gates,
 that further fans should not be able to go into those pen s and
 of course the issues as to the speed of reaction of the Police
 to the events that were g oing on in the pens.

             All those matt e r s have been fully dealt wit h in the su b ­
 m i s s i o n s that we have mad e and indeed that others have made
 and as I say I do not go into them in detail again.

       Ma y I just though m e n t i o n one matter and it arises out
 of the observations made by Mr. Woodward a few moments ago in
 relation to the time at w hich the barrier collapsed in Pen 3.
   /
  .         Now there can of course be no doubt but that the collapse
r of that b a r r i e r did cause injuries and deaths.           One only has
  to look at the horri f y i n g video that we saw of the pile of
  bodies in the v i c i n i t y of the gate to Pen 3 w h i c h w o u l d have
  been v i r t u a l l y in front of that barrier which collapsed, but
  if that h a p p e n e d as Mr. W o o d w a r d would have the Inqu i r y accept
  at 2.47 as oppo s e d to somewhat later than that, again it is
  not p o s s i b l e to be prec i s e   and        there is conflicting evidence
  about it, but cer t a i n l y on       the        preponderance of the evidence it
  w o u l d appear to have o c c urred certainly after the teams came
  out on to the p itch and p r o bably after kick-off at 3 o'clock
  but beyond that it is not p o s s i b l e / safely to go.

             As I say, if it happened at 2.47, that means that there
 was no t only c o n s i derable overcrowding in Pen 3 bu t evidence
 w h i c h should have bee n apparent to any Police Offi c e r on the
 p e r i m e t e r that som e t h i n g had gone very badly w r o n g in that
 pen at 2.47.

        Now if that be right then the delay in doing anything
  about it is a delay of at least ten minutes on the evidence
  that we have had.   I don*t think anyone has s u g g e s t e d in the
  course of this Inquiry that the Police delayed that long, bu t
 ‘if Mr. VJoodward is correct in his submissions, it m a y be that
  he has not thought through    the     consequences for his clients
                                                                       41


                         and.in p a r t i c u l a r for those w h o should have been observing
                         w h a t w a s h a p p e n i n g in those pens if, as I say, that collapse
                         really d i d o c c u r at 2.47.

                                 The t ruth is, as I have said, that in our submission it
                         is alm o s t inevitable to find that it happened later and that
                         there is the r e f o r e a conne c t i o n and a real connection between
                    B    the o p e n i n g of that gate a n d the coming of the fans into the
                         pens, the over c r o w d i n g and the disaster.

                                 Nov/ we h ave said in our submissions that the d i s aster
                         was w h o l l y avoidable, echoing without knowing it the language
                         of Mr. J a c k s o n in the forefront of his submissions.

                                     W e hav e said that it arose, and we repeat that it arose
                             not thro u g h callousness, not through any deliberate action on
                             the p a r t of the Police or indeed anyone else because it is not
                             o nly the Police.

                                     W e sugg e s t that it a rose because of ignorance, because
                             of c o m p l a c e n c y and because of   lack of foresight by those
                             responsible             for the safety of the spectators in that ground.

                             fans wh o m u s t bear some responsibility for the continuation

                             Oficers w i t h a different de g r e e of emphasis, that certainly
                             they c o n t r i b u t e d to the c o n t i nuation of that crushing.

                                         H a v i n g said that there can be no doubt that they bear

                             or for the deaths and injuries that resulted from that dangerous
                             o v e r c r o w d i n g and indeed that is a matter w h i c h was explicitly
                             put by Mr. Hyt n e r to Chief Superintendent D uckenfield whe n
                             he e l i c i t e d from Chief S u p erintendent Duckenfield the apology
                             for the inference that had bee n drawn as a result of
                             Mr. D u c k e n f i e l d 1s observations that the fans were in any w a y
                             r esponsible for the deaths and injuries in the pens.

                                    I have said "complacency, ignorance and lack of foresight."
                             Complacency, we say that was effectively the belief by the Police
                             and to a degree by the Club that there were no problems.     I
                             have i s o lated the Police and the Club, that may not be fair to
                             either of them because it was the Working Party as well, e v e r y ­
                             one con c e r n e d w i t h the safety of that ground.

                                   Previous semi-finals had apparently gone well.  The Police
                             plan had seemed to work; no problems were therefore foreseen.

                                   In truth we know that those turnstiles at Leppings Lane,
                             having regard to the b o t t l e - n e c k and having regard to the
                    jj       numbers w i t h w h i c h they had to cope were insufficient.




J. L. Harpham Ltd
      We k n o w that there was no proper system for monit o r i n g
the pens and that such system or non-system as there was was
clearly dangerous.

      Ignorance, lack'of appreciation that there always had
been overcrowding in these pens and inability to recognise
when too many people were gathered together on a terrace.
          T h e photog r a p h s w h i c h w e r e produced as par t of the
Fire B r igade's evidence wer e you m a y think sir m o s t instructive
in this regard and I suspect that man y people m a y have been
sur p r i s e d at the gaps there w ere when the pens wer e filled to
a volume        of 54 people per 10 square metres.

            It is not a picture of the sort of dense p a c k i n g that one
is u s e d to seeing in pens and indeed if one looks at the p h o t o ­
graphs of last year one sees a picture which suggests a density
m u c h grea t e r than the 5.4, 54 per 10 square metres, but it is
that sort of d e n s i t y w h i c h football fans have been a c c u s t o m e d
to p u t up w i t h and people o b s erving who are in a p o s i t i o n to
m o n i t o r safety and who are c o n cerned w ith safety are equally
co n d i t i o n e d to look at, and that we feel has been one of the
problems and one of the m a j o r problems in this instance.

       It is quite plain that education is needed and needed
mick-ly- so that a-11- those- concerned, S t e ^ r d s , Police and i n d e e d ^
others' Ocnow w h a t "sort -of ^packing or. what' sort of numbers rathe-— ■
of 5.4 look like w h e n packed on a terrace............

         Of course I add to the ignorance ignorance of the fact
that people w e r e in distress and perhaps a failure to look
6 ut for that suf f i c i e n t l y beca u s e of a conditioning to the
v i e w that fans m u s t not come out of the pens because to do so
is a p i t c h invasion.

      Third, lack of foresight.      The Police did not appreciate
the possibility, so it w o u l d seem, of late arrivals or of
troublesome arrivals all at once and so no proper prep a r a t i o n s
were made for it.

            We suggest that g r e a t e r thought should have been given
to w h a t I have d e s cribed as "long distance policing" b y which
I m e a n p o l i c i n g of people arriving away from the immediate
v i c i n i t y of the turnstiles a n d the ground, something w h i c h as
I said in open i n g was raised not I think in 1926, a n o t h e r
m i s t a k e in the submissions, but in 1924 following the first
Cup Final at Wemb l e y in 1923.

      There was a failure to foresee the consequences of
opening the gate and there was a failure to foresee that there
was a lack of proper arrangements to monitor and control the
filling of the pens.

         Sir, that is a summ a r y and a short summary of the way
in w h i c h we put this. As I say I am not going to go into
further detail because it is all contained in our writ t e n
    submissions w h i c h should be read;       of course, w i t h w h a t I have
    said to y o u here and now.

      T here is a m a t t e r w i t h w h i c h I ought to deal and one or
two comments w h i c h I ought to m a k e in answer to some of the
matters that have bee n raised inwritten submissions and today.

               This tragedy happened a l m o s t exactly three months ago
    and that means of course that this Inquiry has p r o g r e s s e d
    e x c e e dingly quickly.

          It is of course very m u c h in the public inter e s t that yo u
    sir should be able to have the factual basis, that is the k n o w ­
    ledge of w h a t h a p p e n e d on the 15th of April and w h y it happened,
    to make your interim r e c o m m e n d a t i o n s before the com m e n c e m e n t
    of the nex t season.           The s a f e t y of spectators requires that
    that should be done.

            It is of course equa l l y i m p ortant that the true c i r c u m ­
    stances should be d i s c o v e r e d so that any r e commendations are
    not b a s e d on misconc e p t i o n s as to the true factual p o s i t i o n
    and no person or bod y is u n f a i r l y criticised in any r e p o r t that
    is m a d e .

       We have, and I am s p e a k i n g here for m y Juniors a n d for
 those instructing, me and I think, I don't think I know, for
•the investigator^/- the W est M i d l a n d s Police.."    1" >    :,

          We have at all times b e e n conscious of the n eed to b a l a n c e
    thoroughness and speed and m o r e p a r t i cularly of the n eed not
    to sacrifice accuracy to speed.
    /
r         We believe that we h a v e struck the right balance and that
    no witness has been omit t e d w h o could have shed a d i f ferent
    light on any p a r t of the s t o r y of the events of the 15th of
    April.

           There have of course, as I said at the outset this
    morning, been additional s t a t e m e n t s and additional wi t n e s s e s
    have come to light, but we s u g g e s t that those are glosses on
    the evidence already given a n d do not s i g n ificantly change
    any important aspect of that e v i d e n c e and we are comforted
    that e i g h t at least out of n i n e of the parties appearing before
    you sir seem to have no c o m p l a i n t on this p a r t i c u l a r score.
    There is one exception, the Police.

           I think I m u s t say f r a n k l y that we are s u r prised and
    d isappointed by the attit u d e shown in those final submi ssions
    which do reflect to an e x t e n t their conduct of the case
    at this Inquiry.

        It m u s t have been a b u n d a n t l y clear to every o n e in this
  room and to anyone who had s a t through the evidence in this
  Inquiry, that mistakes had b e e n made by the Police, yet o n l y
' two I think have e f f e c t i v e l y b e e n admitted. One very grud g i n g l y
by .Chief Superintendent Duckenfield that he had not taken steps
to.cater for the opening of Gate C and the other by Chief
Superintendent Mole and Inspector Sewell that the agreed
emergency arrangements struck in August 1988 between the Police
and SYMAS had not been incorporated in the Operational Order
of 1989.
      Desp i t e the evidence f r o m all the senior Officers that
it was reco g n i s e d and a c c e p t e d that no Sheffield Wed n e s d a y
Football Club Stewards w o u l d be in or m o nitoring numbers in
the terrace and in the pens and that therefore the Police w o u l d
be doing this, again and again wit n e s s e s were c r o ss-examined
on the basis that the Green G uide says:              "Stewards are
responsible and the Police are not."

      In paranthesis we cannot see how the evidence that has
been adduced this morning before the Inquiry of what other
Forces do in other football grounds, can conceivably assist
you in your fact finding task as to what happened at this
ground on the 15th April 1989 because it is that, of course,
with which you are concerned.
         No r e s p o n s i b i l i t y for an y par t of the factors con t r i b u t i n g
to the disaster, that is to say the crush at                    the turnstiles,
the o v e r f i l l i n g of the pens, the slowness to react, has been
a c c epted by-the -Pol ice -and since m i s takes a ^ not accep^fd..
I think''people' as Mr.— Hytner said, w o u l d be ^for.giveji '|gr ..• ....
believing that it is thought that no lessons are needed to
be learnt.

 /    We now find in the final submissions as I understood
Mr. Woodw a r d ' s oral submissions, he does not resile from this
that the suggestion that the w hole Tribunal process is
"inherently u n s a t i s f a c t o r y an d incapable of enabling reliable
conclusions to be reached."

       He said that he did no t impune the endeavour but that
is not to remove the c r i t i c i s m that the results would not be
achievable.

      Whe n I started - it sounds a ba d way, doesn't it - when
I started in the law I was told that if you had a b a d case
attack your opponent.      This sir t^kes things perhaps a stage
further, at t a c k the Tribunal as an alternative appro a c h and
then perhaps it will be thought that any adverse findings can
be brushed aside.

      C om p l a i n t has been m a d e of the lack of rules of evidence.
This is, as you sir have p o i n t e d out a moment ago, an Inquiry.
It is not a lawsuit betw e e n parties.         It is d e s igned to get at
the truth and the absence of the rules of evidence does not
make that impossible or m o r e difficult.         Indeed quite the
contrary we would suggest.

      May I take an unusual course and remind you, sir, and
my learned friend of w hat an e m i n e n t Judge, Lord Justice Diplock
as he then was, s a i d in respect of inquiries and inquisitorial
approaches.       F o r the reference this is from a case called
R. -v- D e p u t y Industrial Injuries Commissioner ex parte Moore
w h i c h I nave in 1965 1 AE R page 81 at page 9 4 .

      W h a t the learned.Lord Justice said was p o i nting ou t that
findings m u s t be b a s e d on evidence following a fair h e a r i n g was
this.   He said:

        "Evidence is no t restricted to evidence w h i c h w o u l d
        be a d m i s s i b l e in a Court of Law.

        For historical reasons b a s e d perhaps on the fear that
        juries w h o m i g h t be illiterate were incapable of
        d i f f e r e n t i a t i n g between the probitive values of
        d i f f e r e n t m e t h o d s of proof, the practice of the
        C o m m o n La w Courts has b e e n to admit only w h a t the
        Judges then regarded as the best evidence of any
        d i s p u t e d fact and thereby to exclude m u c h material
        w h i c h as a m a t t e r of coxnmonsense w o u l d assist a fact
        finding Tribunal to r each a correct conclusion."

A n d he goes on to say that the decision reached m u s t be based:

        "On m a t e r i a l w h i c h tends logically to show the
        existence or non-e x i s t e n c e of facts relevant to the
        issue to be determined. "             . .r       '  .,■   . - v.

 We w o u l d r e s p e c t f u l l y suggest to you, sir, that you are not to
 be e q u a t e d to an illiterate juryman and that the evidence that
 w<= have h eard in this Inquiry and the w a y that that evidence
 h&s b e e n e l i c i t e d is adequate and proper and sufficient to e n a b l e
^you not onl y to m a k e findings bu t to make findings w h i c h are
 accurate and reliable findings and to suggest to the contrary
 is quite wrong.

           Indeed so far as the procedure is c o ncerned by w h i c h this
 Inquiry a p p r o a c h e d its task it was one w h i c h was specifically
 put to and agreed b y all Counsel appearing for all parties as
 b e i n g fair in all the circumstances, and that being so, sir,
 it is in our s ubmission quite wrong that the suggested criticisms
 of the r e l i a b i l i t y of any findings that you m a y make are thou g h t
 to have any v a l i d i t y whatever.

            Nov/ it is clear, and it m u s t have bee n clear beyond a
 p e r a d venture and p a r t i c u l a r l y having regard to the submissions
 m a d e by all parties o ther than the Police, that criticisms
 w o u l d be m a d e of the Police ope r a t i o n on the 15th of April,
 not individual Officers, c e rtainly other than those responsible
 at the top, m o s t of w h o m a c t e d w i t h presence of m i n d a n d in
 some cases w i t h great h e r o i s m and devotion b e y o n d the call of
 duty.

       It is all the mor e unfortunate, we v/ould suggest, that
 those criticisms have not bee n accepted and that attempts have
 been made to shift the blame.
      I        say this because there is inevitably and properly very
real sympathy for the Police and the difficult task that they
have to perforin and the role they have to play in controlling
and policing crowds at football matches.

      Thdt sympathy is in danger of being dissipated by the
manner in which they have presented their case to this Inquiry.

      It is   a sad indictment of football and its fans that
segregation   is necessary and that a Police presence of some
800 or more   Officers is thought to be needed. While the majority
of the fans   are well behaved, a minority and a minority which
is sizeable   in terms of pure numbers is not.

      Their conduct was deplorable. There is a common theme
in the Police evidence, I say "common theme" there are exceptions
because the Police evidence ranged from those who were very
critical of the fans to those who were not really so critical
and said it was not a very great deal different from what one
would expect of fans at any particular match, but there is a
theme which suggests that the behaviour was worse than anything
which had been experienced by South Yorkshire Police before.

      So be it. That sort of behaviour, we would suggest, is
not peculiar to Liverpool Football Club and is known at sadly
many Football Clubs and their supporters throughout the land,
but to have* %0 O' or-;more Police, on duty, to .deal withy^nticijaated ,
trouble f rom fans and to control the crowds and -then t_o..say that
activities such as have been described namely taking of drink,
irresponsibility, attempts to enter without tickets and so on
are not foreseeable, is frankly, we would suggest, nonsensical.
 /
/"     I have dealt with the question of the barrier.       I shall
 not go over that again.

      Let me now come to one or two specific comments in relation
to submissions made by others.

      The City Council. Can I ask you sir to look to page 6 of
their submissions. They say there at the end of the first
paragraph on that page:

        "The Certificating Authority regarded the Club as
        likely to be in a position to prevent more than
        7,200 spectators being admitted to the West Terrace."

Sir,   I simply append to that the question how on earth could
they   regard the Club as likely to be in that position and it
does   not appear that they made sufficient enquiry to ensure that
that   was the position.

        On the next page   just before iii the last sentence.   They
say:

        "The fact that no appeal was ever made or indeed ever
        threatened is some indication that these Authorities
       did not find fault with the terms of the Safety
       Certificate. This is in relation to the Police and
       Fire Services .... "

 Now if that is intended to be a comment in relation to South
 Yorkshire County Council then fair1enough. If it is intended
 to relate to the City Council then with respect it perhaps is
 not so valid because of course all the interested parties
 believed that there was an active reappraisal of the terms of
 the Safety Certificate going on over the three years or so
 since 1986.

         Sir on page 10, towards the bottom, there is a suggestion
 made after a criticism of the flexibility approach. Sir, I
 \i?ould adopt that as being, I would suggest, a sensible suggestion
 It is at the bottom of the       page.

       Sir on page 19 there is reference to ambiguities in the
 Green Guide in relation to     what is   meant by "separate sections
 of the ground."

       The comment I would make on that is that with respect
 commonsense would surely dictate that where there are ae facto
 segregated areas or areas self-contained in effect, then the
 principle would apply, but one does accept the Green Guide is
 not perhaps as clear as it might be in that context and having
.said-"that therd1,-“are -other respects in rwhich..y.au may rfe^l_> ,,sir,,
 that there ha^:'been-brought to light some ambiguities .'in~ the
 Green Guide, the most obvious one Annex C, but clearly .—

       LORD JUSTICE TAYLOR:       Testing the barrier?
  /
 /
/'      MR. COLLINS: That is the barrier, the manner of testing
  the barrier, but clearly consideration will have to be given
  and no doubt this is a matter which can be pursued at Stage 2
  to respects in which the Green Guide can be made clearer or
  firmed up where necessary.

        Sir, we would respectfully suggest that the underlying
 theme of the submissions made on behalf of the City Council
 reflects the error of complacency to which I have referred as
 one of the three matters in the earlier part of these remarks.

       Sir, so far as the Fire Service are concerned there is
 no criticism that I have sought to level against them in the
 course of my final submissions. They were concerned with the
 adequacy of the means of egress from the pens and not with the
 layout as such and the effect upon capacity as such.

       The only issue perhaps there is whether it really was
 so clear that the Police would man those gates at the back,
 by which I mean the Police would have an Officer there at
 all times, or whether the Police understanding of manning,
 namely that if the gates were shut and needed to be opened
 there would be an Officer there, was not more what was
 expected, but that is a matter which has been gone through at
 considerable length in the course of the Inquiry.
      Sir, so far as SYMAS is concerned you may think sir that,
the■interim suggestions that are set out in their report are
all helpful and valid save perhaps for the last one on page 11
where they refer to a "possible amendment of the 1975 Act."

      That there should be some tightening up is no doubt correct
but whether they have got it right by suggesting that "if an
application is not dealt with within six months there shall have
been deemed to have been a refusal" is another m a t t e r because
that on the face of it might seem to be possibly unfair to the
Club which was of course not responsible for the dilatoriness
of the Licensing Authority.
      LORD JUSTICE TAYLOR: Certainly I would have thought it
would not be a matter for an interim recommendation, in any event.

      MR. COLLINS: Certainly not for an interim recommendation
in any event, I accept that.
      Sir, I don't want to go into the details of the reasoning
of Mr. Kallipetis, the close reasoning in relation to what was
overheard and led to the request or the question about ambulances.
You will obviously form your own conclusion. The only observation
I make is that Mr. Kallipetis in his argument relies very
strongly upon the accuracy of one part of Mr. Waugh's evidence
and Mr. Waugh's evidence you may feel was not entirely satis-
factory1in crelatibjft-to wha£- at— the end-.-of-,cthe _day ^ t wa.^-, fce• .
was saying a b o u t •the circumstances,-or what .he beard..and..the....
circumstances in which he made the request.

        Sir the Club at page 5 make a point, an important point
 ay(d one which you will clearly have to consider. It is at the
✓end of the first paragraph on that page where they say that
 they do not believe they are alone in expressing the view that
 it would be regrettable if this tragedy led to the abolition
 of the terrace as a viewing area.
       LORD JUSTICE TAYLOR:      Again that is a matter of long-term
 consideration.
       MR. COLLINS: Of course that is a matter for long-term
 but if we are right in our submission that the key to safety
 is control of numbers, then although again we accept that perhaps
 there can never be any such thing as an absolutely guaranteed
 safe terrace, because however much you keep to capacity there
 is always the danger of swaying and that sort of thing which
 can cause trouble and of course people bunching up together
 if they are in one particular part, but having said that clearly
 one must bear in mind that it would be a drastic step, and I
 have no doubt sir you will bear in mind and certainly as you
 say it is not a matter perhaps for an interim recommendation,
 that it would be a drastic step to recommend the complete
 abolition, in effect, of viewing from terraces.

       Sir the point is made at page 7 that this was a rirst
 class ground" and that the Club had adopted a "thoroughly

                          responsible attitude towards their obligations and safety.”

                                Sir one accepts that, but it underlines you may think
                          the problem, because the evidence may satisfy you that this
                          tragedy was inevitable at some time .given the layout of Leppings
                          Lane and given the system or lack of it in relation to the
                          monitoring of the numbers in the pens and perhaps that only
                      g   goes to show how much needs to be learnt to avoid anything
                          such as this ever happening again.

                                Sir at the bottom of page 10 and on to page 11 it is
                          suggested that "even a perfect system would not have had any
                          material effect on the consequences of the additional rush
                          of some 2,000 fans."

                                 That on the face of it is a plausible point, but in our
                          submission what it ignores is this: had there been a proper
                          system to monitor capacity in those pens to stop them over­
                          filling, as a matter of fact it is plain that they had become
                          full before Gate C was opened and therefore there would have
                          been by then a system which would have meant that that tunnel
                          would have been blocked off and no one would have come through
                          Gate C down into the pens. Therefore we suggest there is in
                      D   that respect a direct connection or a contributory factor in
                           the lack of system of monitoring the pens and the tragedy that
                          occurred.

                                Sir, at page 12 there is reference to the cross-examination
                          or examination by me of Mr. Mackrell in relation to the tickets.

                             (    Sir I accept that it may well be that an unfair point
                      E    m4y have been put to Mr. Mackrell in relation to the 'B' on
                          '"the ticket because it was plain that in fact that 'B' was on the
                           stub which was retained by the turnstile operator and to the
                           extent that I suggested the ticket in that way encouraged people
                           to go down the tunnel, I think it may be that that went too far
                           and I would like that to be made clear here and now.

                                That does not mean that one accepts that the tickets were
                          all they should be. Clearly ....

                                LORD JUSTICE TAYLOR:   Well Mr. Mackrell very frankly
                          conceded that.

                                MR. COLLINS:    As you say, sir, Mr. Mackrell quite clearly
                          accepted that.

                                Finally on the Club at page 16 there is a reference to
                          the paragraph of the Safety Certificate and the construction
                          I put upon it.

                                 I don't want to argue the point. Suffice it to say that
                           it is my submission that the construction there put by Ilr. Glasgow
                           is one with which I would quarrel and I would suggest that when
                           the Certificate refers to the "appropriate and relevant standards
                      H    in the Guide" it means what on the face of it says and anything
                           less than that should not do.

  J. L, Harpham Ltd
       Of course if the Council is satisfied with something less
 then the Club could not possibly be committing a criminal
 offence in reaching those standards. What we say is the Club ,
 ought never to be satisfied with anything less than that if
 that is what the Safety Certificate says, but of course as I
 repeat, that would not mean that the Club was doing anything
 wrong if the Council in fact was satisfied with something less.
 It may be that that is a criticism more properly aimed at the
 Council than at the Club.

       Sir, as far as Dr. Eastwood is concerned all I say,
 because I have dealt with the matters in my written submissions,
 that I would accept that Mr. Toulson makes a fair point when
 he says that the Working Party included a Structural Engineer,
 and that of course is something which you will no doubt take
 into account.

       Sir, finally may I suggest a few of the more important
 conclusions in a very shorthand form, not necessarily in any
 order of importance and not necessarily exhaustive.

       First of all it was overcrowding rather than the perimeter
 fences that caused the danger.

         It is     easy to understand why there has been areaction
  and why some of those fences have been removed by other Clubs.
  One'only-Ifsfe- to have- seen those -dreadful photographs in the*, - •> ■
  Press of people pressed up against the perimeter fence to -..... -
  realise why that reaction has occurred, but as I say fences
  in themselves we suggest are not necessarily the trouble, it
  i^ overcrowding.
   /
/        Secondly the need for education in relation to the
  crowding.

       Thirdly strict controls on numbers and grounds will have
 to accept lower capacities if they cannot     count mechanically
 the numbers   in any particular part of the   terraces.

       Of course there are means, I think there are manual
 clickers.  I accept not entirely accurate but at least perhaps
 can give a guide if there is no other means of doing it, but
 as I say there must be lower capacities if mechanical counts
 are not possible.

       There must be a clear understanding in writing preferably
 of the duties of the Stewards and the Police respectively at
 every match and every individual match as to crowd capacity
 on any terraces.

       Five, we suggest that the Police and indeed others,
 Stewards too if they are concerned, must be much more ready
 to recognise and trained to recognise the need of people to
 escape from pens where they are in distress and where there
 have been problems of overcrowding.
                                                                , / " « ':v;\

                                       51


       Sixthly, we think greater consideration must be given
 at ail football grounds, but at Sheffield Wednesday in particular
 to what I have called earlier on "long-distance policing" a n d -
 I don't go into that again.

       Seventhly there must be a consistent policy known to all
 fans as to what is going to be done to ticketless fans if they
 turn up at all ticket matches without tickets.

       This is a matter I think which has been dealt with
 recently by the ACPO report but that and touting must clearly
 be the subject of a consistent policy at all grounds and
 adequate steps must be taken to prevent it and to discourage it.
 When I say "it" I mean touting and people turning up without
 tickets as much as possible.

       Eighthly, it is plain that Safety Certificates must be
 reviewed at shorter intervals. As to what precisely the correct
 interval is will no doubt be a matter of argument, but that they
 must be reviewed regularly must, I think, be clear to all.

        Finally there must always be sufficient turnstiles so that
  all who have to come through the relevant turnstiles can be
  in within a specified period of time, by which I mean that there
  should never be less provision than say, and I am simply plucking
  a figure out of the air and I don't suggest this is necessarily
' the right'Cfigure^ 750, s o .that. all coul.cL.be got. irn^wjjthin:.;the? z>.
  hour. "TThatever is the right figure again may -wel-1- be a question
  for argument.

    ;   If insufficient turnstiles exist at a ground then the
  ground must accept that their capacity will be reduced for that
/'match to such as is able to be coped with by the turnstiles
  that exist.

       Sir, as I say those are hot meant to be exhaustive but
 are points that occurred to me that may I hope assist you in
 your consideration of any interim recommendations.

       May I finally ally myself with Mr. Glasgow in thanking
 theCity Council for the   facilities which they have provided
 to us and to the Inquiry Team in this building.   It has made
 our task a very great deal easier than it might otherwise
 have been.

         Sir, that is all I wish to say.        Thank you.

        LORD JUSTICE TAYLOR: Yes, well I again would like to
  thank the Authorities for letting us use this extremely
  convenient commodious chamber which has made it all a great
  deal less trying than it might otherwise have been. I shall
  acknowledge that in the report.

       Again, at the risk of repetition, I would like to thank
 all Counsel for their contribution and for all behind them
 who put in so much hard work. I now must do some hard work

 t h a t there was danger.              The m a j o r openings w here the
 d i a g o n a l b r a c i n g is s i t u a t e d at th e bac k of the Kop had
 b e e n cove r e d by m e t a l plates b e f o r e the first game.
 No other d a n g e r o u s o p e n i n g s had b e e n left uncovered.
        Your sta t e m e n t "it is also u n d e r s t o o d that the p.a.
 s y s t e m on the Kop wa s not in o p e r a t i o n d u r i n g the m a t c h
 on 25 August"         is quite e r r o n e o u s and the s y s t e m was w o r k i n g
 and was te s t e d b e f o r e the first m a t c h of the season.                    In
 a d d i t i o n John Strange was on the Kop during tha t game as
 w e l l as du r i n g the C h e l s e a g a m e , a n d he reports that on

 Kop w a s heav i l y p o p u l a t e d du r i n g the m a t c h on 25 August.
 I sho u l d be p l e a s e d to kno w w h o i n f o r m e d y o u that the
 pu b l i c address sys t e m was n ot working.
        The general tone of the second page of you r letter is
 m o s t unfortunate.           We do not c o n s i d e r it appropriate that
 y o u r ow n p e r s o n a l views on these te c h n i c a l m a t t e r s should
 be e x p r e s s e d so d o g m a t i c a l l y as in the last sentence of
 t h a t paragraph.         It is imp o r t a n t tha t the l i c ensing authority
 s h o u l d use its powers r e a s o n a b l y and this i n v olves taking
 i n t o account t e c h n i c a l i n f o r m a t i o n w h i c h is exp r e s s e d on

                               Q.             MR- P H I L L I P S :   Can you say what m e s s a g e it was
                                    that you g a v e ?             A.   Well, I a c t u a l l y asked       I
                                    p a s s e d my n umber, I said "2910 to G ro u n d C o n t r o l " and I

                                    Superintendent Marshall.

                               Q.   W h e r e was he?          A.    Do you w a n t m e t o show you?   It
                                    is p r o b a b l y b e t t e r if I show you on there. ' (D e m o n s t r a t e d )
                           B        The r e is a w a l l j ust there.         He was stood on the wall.

                               Q.        LORD J U S T I C E TAYLOR:                    He was stood on the parapet,
                                    was he?   A.       Just on the                   top of the wall.    I could see
                                    him.

                                            MR       PHILLIPS:            The      parapet     of the br id g e       over   the

                               Q.   At that time i n c i d e n t a l l y was the Polic e L a n d r o v e r parked
                                    o u t s i d e the gates, did you n o t i c e ?    A.  No, I have no
                                    idea.         I c o u l d n ’t tell you.  There were Police horses
                                    t h ere but I d i d n ' t see any Landr o v e r .

                               Q.   Were you able to get to Mr. M a r s h a l l ?                   A.    Not easily.
                                    I had to use a bit of b r u t e force and pig i g n o r a n c e to
                           D        get a c r o s s the c r o w d but I got there.                  I i n f o r m e d Mr.
                                    M a r s h a l l that the s i t u a t i o n was bad and I asked him for

                                    "Y-es, go on, Gary".                 I t u r n e d round, made my way back

                               is right, sir.

                          Q. And did in fact help.      On the question of the people who were
                             g oing to the gro u n d and your experience, you have been to many
                             football matches before, h ave you, as a Police Officer? - A.
                             Oh, yes, sir.

                          Q.    On the q u e stion of tickets I think you said in your statement
                               t here were q u i t e a number of people who were looking for
                               ti c kets? - A. That    is right, sir, yes.
                     D
                          Q.   And your words were, "It was apparent that lots of people,                     and
                               I m ean lots, w e r e . l o o k i n g for t i c k e t s ” ? - A. Yes. -

                          Q.   That was som e t h i n g that i m p ressed you, was it? - A. I was
                               asked at least t hree times p e rsonally if I had any tickets or
                               if I knew w here any tickets were.

                          Q.   It has been put to you by Mr. Hytner that the base of the
                               problem at the turnstiles was first of all the number of
                               people that w ere there? - A. That is right, sir.

                          Q.   In your e x p e r i e n c e have you ever observed that sort of number
                               at that sort of time down at the turnstiles? - A. I have never
                               in all my life been in a c rush like that, sir.

                          Q.   It was s o mething quite o u t s i d e your experience?            A.
                               Frightening.

                          Q. You were asked that there ma y have been one or two people at
                             the back causing difficulty.   It was put to ;you that there
                             w er e a few people there. You d e s c r i b e I think the attitude of
                             a number of s upporters in your statement? - A. yes, sir.

                          0. And whilst there was the crowd at the turnstile were there
                             other people coming into and pushing into the back of that
                             crowd? - A. Yes, sir.

                          Q.   Was what you saw d e l i b e r a t e activity and determined? - A. The
                               youngsters, some would be on the younger end as well, they
                               w ere just pushing in the back of the supporters waiting, and
                               they seemed to think it was a huge joke..
                      H

                                pushing into the backs and being bloody daft? - A. That is
                                right, sir.

                         -Q. Were these pepple pushing into the back causing surges in t h e '
                             crowd? - A. The were i n c r e a s i n g the pressure on the rest of
                             the crowd all the time, caus i n g problems further down the
                             line.

                    B    Q.     You saw you saw individuals w i t h d r a w from the crowd?      - A.That
                                is right, and I had to w i t h d r a w them myself.

                         Q.     In your statement you made a r e f e r e n c e to one man in
                                p articular who came out o b s e r v i n g upon the sanity of those who
                                w ere there? - A. Yes. very explicit.

                         0.     Do you remember what he said? - A, He said something to the
                                effect of "Fucking mad.  Fucking m a d ” .

                         Q.     From what you obse rved was he descr i b i n g just the behaviour of
                                one or two people? - A. I think he was commenting on the
                                s ituation as a whole, because he was halfway down the queue.

                         G.     Did you o b s e r v e a swelling in the crowd that occurred? - A.
                                It was incre a s i n g all the tim e I was there.
                    D
                         0 , -.With individuals coming to it,.not simply joining the back but_
                              forcing their way in? - A. Yes, sir.

                         0.     And again was that just one or two people doing that or
                                substantial number s? - A. L a r g e numbers all the time.

                          Q. You did what you could? - A.          I did what I thought was right.

                          Q.           LORD JUSTICE TAYLOR:          I would like to understand ■what
                                this pushing amounted to.          O b v i o u s l y people come to the back
                                and pressing forward, that is one thing.                  You are not
                                s ugg e s t i n g they came rushing into the back like forwards
                                a rriving at a loose scrum in a rugby game, are.you, and
                                put their heads down and w ent? - A. Literally some peopie, the
                                younger end, w e r e just j u m p i n g into the backs of peopie
                                q u e ueing in front of them.       It was that bad they were singing
                                and literally jumping into p e o p l e with their arms up.              I
                                l iterally lost my temper w i t h two or three and tola them in no
                                u n certain c i r c umstances to get themselves back.

                          0 .       MR. WOODWARD:    You see the point that i.s being made that
                                those who were joining w e r e .... - A. Not gentle pressure.

                          Q. Not just gentle pressure or ge n t l e m e n joining the crowd, but
                             individuals who were as it w e r e attacking the back of the
                             crowd? - A. Or being stupid.

                          Q.    For whatever reason.      - A. Yes.

                          0; And adding totally u n n e c e s s a r y p r e ssure with considerable
                     H       force, causing those ahead to be embarrassed or further
                             embarr a s s e d by the situ a t i o n ? - A. Yes, that is right.

Q.    And this was d e l i b e r a t e behaviour, may be out of foolishness
     or stupidity, but it was d e l i b e r a t e ? - A.I don't know if   it
     was d e l i b e r a t e on their part or if they just did not care, but
     that is what happened.

Q.   They were heedless of the conse q u e n c e s ? - A.   I think that
     is the best way to put it, yes.

0. Later on in your statement you talk of people pushing and
  • chanting, and individuals being just wild to get in? - A. That
    is right.  That is the impr e s s i o n I gained.

0. Are you i n t e n d i n g to d e s c r i b e determined behaviour by a number
   of people? - A. Very determined.

                        Re-Examined bv MR.     COLLINS:

0 . Do I gather your   i m pression was that the bulk of these people
     behaving as Mr. Woodward has put to you were behaving like
     that because they were being stupid? - A. The majority of
     supporters t here were reasonable, but there were the..,

0.   I am c o ncerned with the m i n o r i t y you have been talking about.
     - A. The m i n o r i t y did not seem to have any reason.

0. Were y o u ' a b l e to tell w h e t h e r d rink appeared to have played a
   part in that? - A, You could smell drink from the crowd, but
   basically you could not get near enough to the individuals
   c oncerned beca u s e of the numb e r s to get the fumes, type of
   thing.

Q. Was it your i mpression that these people were trying to get
   their own way into the crowd to get nearer the front in order
   to queue barge, if there w e r e a queue, if you see what I
   mean, or was it just they saw this crowd and thought it was
   funny to jump on the back? - A. It was both.

0. A c o m b i nation? - A. Yes. T here were some just barging through
   and being i g n orant and others seemed to think it was a huge
   joke and push i n g at the back.

Q. The ones with whom you lost you r temper, those were some who
   appeared to t h i n k it was a joke, were they? - A. Both, again.

G. What was their reaction when you told them in no uncertain
   terms to stop? - A. I got the standard reply, basically.

G. Which is "Fuck o f f ” , s o m e t h i n g like that? - A. Yes,    sir,
   because they k new I could not get to them.

           LORD J U S T I C E TAYLOR: Ca n I just say, Mr. Collins, and

                      D            Not that the licensing s e c t i o n took over.    There were some
                                   others in r e l a t i o n to poisons and what have you that went to
                                   other D e p a r t m e n t s .           ,                             ■

                           Q.      But your Department, this was the only extra matter that you
                                   took over as a result of local g overnment reorganisation? - A.
                                   Yes .

                           Q   .   You no doubt got from S o u t h Y o r k s h i r e the relevant files? - A.
                                   yes.

                           Q.      And you fam i l i a r i s e d y o u r s e l f wit h those?   - A. Yes.

                           Q   .   Did you go to S h effield W e d n e s d a y ground?          - A. Not in April
                                   1986, n o .

                                   When did you first go to the ground? - A. I believe that was
                                   later on that year.  The i n s p e c t i o n was in August 1986. I
                                   think there may have been a visit before that to deal with the
                                   Kop.

                           Q.      The other ground the Cit y Coun c i l           became concerned with was
                                   Sheffield Unit e d ? - A. Yes.

                           Q.      Were there any other grounds wi t h i n the jurisdiction of the
                                   city? - A. Yes, sir, O w l e r t o n turned up in August 1986
                                   desig n a t e d as a new stadium.

                           Q.      That had not then been d e s i g n a t e d when you took over,            but it
                                   was thought it was about to be? - A. Yes*

                           Q.      But the two most important ones at the time you took over w ere
                       H           Sheffield W e d n e s d a y and S h e f f i e l d United? -"A. Yes.

Q.    We know She f f i e l d W e d nesday had a safety certificate which had
      been issued in 1979 and w h i c h had never been changed? - A .
      Yes.

G. So far as S h e f f i e l d United was concerned did that have a
   sa f e t y c e r t i f i c a t e ? - A. It did not.

Q.     Is there a s a f e t y c e r t i f i c a t e in being for Sheffield United
       now? - A. No, t h e r e is not.

G.     When was it d e s i g n a t e d ?

Q-.         LORD JUST I C E TAYLOR:      Has it been? - A.           It has been
       designated, sir, yes.    I d o n ’t know, sir.

G.     Is that a s e p a r a t e i n s t r ument?  There was one especially for
       Hillsborough, I gather? - A. Yes, it was a separate one, a
       muc h later one, I think, o w i n g to this question of moving up
       and down the Divisions.              I am not too sure when it was.  I can
       find it out, though, sir.

G.               MR. COLLINS:           The result is Sheffield United has been
        ope r a t i n g w i t h o u t a safety certif i c a t e when it should have had
        one? - A. That is not q u i t e right, sir.               Any designated ground
        can conti n u e to operate as a sports ground provided an
      ' ap p l i c a t i o n has been submitted.      It is my understandi-ng a n       .
        applic a t i o n has been s u b m i t t e d for Sheffield United.

G.          LORD J U S T I C E TAYLOR:      Can you let us know when that was
       done? - A. That can c e r t a i n l y be found out.

Q.          MR. COLLINS:      Anyway, had you ever been to Sheffield
       Wednesday, e v e n as a pa y i n g customer or not? - A. No, sir.

Q.     So the s i g n i f i c a n c e of w h a t e v e r might have appeared in the
       safety c e r t i f i c a t e of itself would have meant nothing to you?
       Obv i o u s l y w hen you read the files you could follow some of the
       history,, but the details thems e l v e s meant very little? - A.
       The details of the saf e t y            ce r t i f i c a t e are reasonably clear,
       sir.       It does not require k n o w l e d g e of the ground as such.

Q.     I am sorry, I        am talk i n g     about things like capacity and the
       layout of the        g r o u n d and   so on? - A. Obviously the layout of
       the ground is        a bit of a        closed book without the advantage of
       seeing it and        looking at        the plan.

 Q. Did you, for example, a p p r e c i a t e on reading through the files
    that ‘there had         been the c r e a t i o n of these pens on the West
    terraces? - A.          No, sir, it was not immediately apparent; to me.
    That is a very          d e t a i l e d m a t t e r which would require a great
    deal of r e s e a r c h at the          time.

 Q.     So you wer e not a ware of the sig n i f i c a n c e when you took over
        of those pens and their ef f e c t or potential effect on the
        capacities? - A. No, sir, not at all, that would be true..

 Q. We know that the system under S outh Yorkshire had been via a
                                                                  47


                                                                                         D. BOWNES


                                 w o r k i n g party? - A. Yes.

                        Q.       Which had in s p e c t e d b i - a nnually? - A. Yes,   for part of its
                                 history.

                        Q. And had r e p o r t e d back to the relevant subcommittee of "cne
                           Co u n t y Counc i l ?   It is not e n t i r e l y clear precisely what its
                           status was? - A. That is e n t i r e l y right, sir.         I am not sure
                  B        what its status was, actually.

                        Q. And did you c o n sid er in any event that was something that was
                           rather u n s a t i s f a c t o r y ? - A. I regarded it as a matter that
                           perhaps needed cla r i f y i n g somewhat, yes.

                        Q.       When you came into the picture you came in effectively with
                                 the m e m o r a n d u m at page 313 of the core bundle attached xo a
                                 letter dated 5th June, w ith the report annexed to it. an
                                 e a r l i e r report.     Hav e you got page 133? - A. Yes, I nave.

                        Q.       If we look at the first sente n c e we see that there is £
                                 r ef e r e n c e to a report sub m i t t e d to the March 1986 meeting,
                                 w hich of course was the m e e t i n g which was held prior to take
                                 over.

                   D                   LORD JUSTICE TAYLOR:         As I have it in front of me I
                                 gather that She f f i e l d United was designated on 3rd July. 1984.


                        q    .           MR. COLLINS:           Which means, speaking from memory, it had
                                 then to put in an a p p l i c a t i o n for a certificate once it had
                                 been de s i g n a t e d ? - A. No, sir, I believe would have to put in
                                 an ap p l i c a t i o n i mmediately before it was designated.

                        Q. That is right.        It was then up to the relevant licensing
                           a u t hority to d e c i d e on what were the particular terms required
                           in any safety c e r t i f i c a t e ? - A. Strictly, sir, to determine
                           whether or not the applicant was a qualified person.

                         G.       It has taken e f f e c t i v e l y t h erefore 5 years? - A. Yes,   sir.

                         Q. And there is still no safety certificate? - A. Thar is right,
                            sir.        I should e x p l a i n that the County Council on irs
                            d i s s o l u t i o n was about to issue a safety certificate for it
                            pending the c o m p l e t i o n of certain works that the Fire Service
                            required.            I under s t a n d those works were not completed by the
                            time of the d i s s o l u t i o n of the County Council.

                         Q.       We are not s t r i c t l y concerned with Sheffield United.  Let us
                                  come back to S h eff ield Wednesday.      Can I just ask you as a
                                  m atter of introduction, and I am sorry this is not in our core
                                  bundle, but it is page 122 of your bundle, Mr. Bownes, because
                                  this is the M arch 1986 report, just in order to put the whole
                                  matter in context.         I say "your report", it is under Mr.
                                  Pensam's name but drafted by you? - A. Yes, sir. that is rhe
                                  normal practice.
                    H    G.       I am not s u g g e s t i n g otherwise.   It is so we know it was you

     speaking, a l t h o u g h Mr. Pensam adopted what you had said. - A.
     Yes, but I w ould not seek to transfer responsibility by that,
     sir.

G. No. I fully u n ders tand that, as I am sure anyone who has any
   k n o w l e d g e of local gove r n m e n t also understands. Really, what
   you are d oing there is re c o r d i n g that the City Council will
   have to take over as a result of the legislation, and you
   refer to the Bradford d i s a s t e r and the Popplewell Report, and
   indicate that a more d e t ailed report will be submitted as soo n
   as p o ssible? - A. Yes, sir.

0.   And really you recommend the delegations, that the General
     Purposes Panel should have the powers under the 1975 Act? - A.
     Yes .

Q. And a further d e l e g a t i o n of the Emergency Procedures and
   a u t h o r i s a t i o n of officers under the relevant section? - A.
   Yes, sir.




                              /Q.    So can we come on
                                              D.   BOWNES


So can we come on, please, to the report at our page 313
or your page 124, whichever you prefer? Now, you refer
to the current situation which was inherited. You say two
sports grounds currently subject. First, Sheffield
Wednesday. Yes, if I bother to look I .... Sheffield
Wednesday designated in August, 1978, certificate issued
December, 1979, undergoing major works to The Kop. And
then you refer to Sheffield United and indicate that it
was hoped that the Council would be in a position to
issue a certificate before the start of the 86/87 season.
Then you refer to Owlerton which is expected to be des­
ignated. Can I ask you to look over the page, please,
at the paragraph safety certificate, standard conditions?
You indicate the desirability of standardisation for'
obvious reasons. Then you say this, "The conditions do,
however, give some cause for concern as they appear to be
inadequate or inappropriate in some areas." Now, the only
conditions or the only safety certificate that existed
was of course Sheffield Wednesday's. Is that right? - A.
That is correct, sir, yes.
And therefore the inadequacy and inappropriateness of the
conditions in some areas must have referred, must it not,
to Sheffield Wednesday, on the face of it? - A. It did,
sir, yes.
Can you help us, please, as to what conditions you consider
to be either inadequate or inappropriate?- A. Yes. I
should explain, sir, first of all, that that phrase is
what, if I may use one of Dr. Eastwood's comments, is a
daft phrase, to be honest. It was not carefully thought
out by the look of it. In fact it is my view that there
were no fatal errors in the conditions themselves.
There were certain areas that needed tightening up.
For example, it refers to the County Council throughout
whereas it should of course now refer to the City Council.
Well, yes, that is a fairly obvious one but that does not
make much difference, does it? I think in the legislation
there was a provision, was not there, an interim provision,
which effectively provided that in any document where
County Council appeared read relevant .... - A. Yes, sir.
The point I was making was that is the sort of order of
defect that there was in the certificate.
     LORD JUSTICE TAYLOR:    Really one would not get that
impression from this, not talking about .... - A. Yes, I
agree with you entirely, sir. On--looking at it again in
the light of this Inquiry I would entirely agree the words
are wrong ....
So there was nothing that gave cause for concern? f8- A.
The conditions gave some cause for concern in that there
were were drafting corrections that needed to be made.

                                                   D.   BOWNES


Q.        MR. COLLINS:   Was there anything of substance that
     you had identified that needed to be addressed? - A. There
     was nothing, if you like, fatal in the conditions that I
     could see that needed to be addressed immediately.
Q. If I had been asking you in May of 1986, Mr. Bownes, which
   conditions do you regard as inadequate and_ which do you
   regard as inappropriate what would you have told me? - A.
   Exactly what I have told you already, sir. As I have
   explained, the wording is inappropriate. There is no
   question about that.
Q.Did anyone on the committee ask, as far as you are aware,
   which were the inadequacies and which were the .... - A.
   I cannot honestly recall, sir. It is an awful long time.
Q.        LORD JUSTICE TAYLOR:   If it is just a question of
     changing South Yorkshire to Sheffield City it would hardly
     merit, if you look further down, a redraft of conditions
     would of course be submitted to the Fire Service, the
     Police and building surveyor for .... - A. I think in
     anticipating the redrafting, sir, I anticipated there.may
     be changes that would be needed as well,simply to update
     things. Changes may have occurred at the ground that
     needed reflecting.
Q.       MR. COLLINS:    Why? Were you aware on looking through
     the file that there were changes that had occurred which
     would need reconsideration of the certificate or was this
     just an assumption? - A. It was an assumption, sir. I
     believe conditions that had been in operation for that long
     could well require review and people might well have
     changed their views as to the sort of things that needed
     addressing.
0. But if South Yorkshire had been doing its job properly
   surely you would have expected it to pass on a note, or
   your opposite number in South Yorkshire to pass on a
   note, saying look, this needs to be dealt with or that
   needs to be dealt with?- A. Yes, sir. I find with
   certificate conditions and what have you that people
   tend to take them as read for years without constructively
   looking at them to decide whether or not they ought to be
   changed. That is my experience with other conditions the
   Council has been involved in in licensing areas.
Q. So what you are saying is your experience told you that
   it would be sensible to have a fresh look at these? - A.
   Yes, sir.
0. And you intended to mean no more than that when you used
   these words inadequate or inappropriate? - A. Yes, sir.
Q. Well, if that is right, Mr. Bownes,I think one is inclined

                          to agree it was a daft expression to use. - A. It was, sir.
                          I would fully support that. That is right.
                       0. On the face of it, it goes a lot further'than that, does not
                          it? - A. Yes, sir, without question.
                       Q. Yes, I see. Did you have available a draft certificate
                          for Sheffield United? - A. Yes, sir, I believe there was
                   B      one copy on the Sheffield United file.
                       Q. Because you also refer to the redraft where appropriate
                           and to submit to the panel for approval and then go on,
                          ,"The Sheffield United certificate could then be issued
                          ’with the new conditions before the start of the 85/87
                           season." That rather suggests that you had spotted
                           something other than mere drafting matters in the
                           Sheffield United certificate which you thought ought
                           to be brought up-to-date or changed?- A. No, I would
                           not accept that necessarily, sir. I must admit I have
                           not read the Sheffield United certificate recently
                           so I cannot really say what that comment referred to.
                       Q. I see. Now, over the page you refer to an attempt to
                          get the Health and Safety Executive in the picture. - A.
                   D      Yes.
                       0. Was that in the hope that it would take the burden off
                          the City Council and your shoulders?- A. Mot at all, sir.
                          It came from a recommendation in the Popplewell Report.
                       0. I know it did but was your hope that if the Health and
                        ; Safety could be persuaded to involve themselves this would
                          mean that your department would not have to shoulder the
                          responsibility? - A. I cannot see how that could happen, sir
                          The Council is the certificating authority ....
                       Q. Well, I know. - A .... and therefore carrys the can any way'
                       Q. I see.  So there was no hope of getting someone else^to
                          carry out some work that otherwise you might have to do?
                          - A. I do not agree with the way you phrase that, sir, to
                          be honest. I would have hoped the Health and Safety
                          Executive could have put a useful input into the Council's
                          advisory system, if you like, for certificating.
                       Q. I follow. Now, one of the matters that I think you spotted
                          when you received the safety certificate from the County
                          Council was that the plans had not been signed, is that
                          right, the plans .... - A. No, sir.
                       Q., .When you say "No, sir" you mean they had not been signed?
                          h - A. No, sir. I had not spotted anything about the plans,
                            to be quite honest.
                       Q. Can I ask you to V..ok at    paragraph 130 of your proof?       Do

  you see you refer in that paragraph first of all to
  sections of the Act and then you say under Schedule
  1 of the certificate the definition of plans is - we
  can see this at our page 107, I think - document or
  documents attached to and forming part of the general
  safety certificate and signed by the person signing
  the certificate. When the files were hand-ed over to
  the Sheffield City Council in April, 1936, a copy of
  the general safety certificate was in an envelope
  together with a number of plans none of which were
  signed by Mr. Mallett,the original signatory of the
  certificate. This, do I understand from your answer
  you gave a moment ago, this is something you_have
  spotted since? - A. Yes, sir, that is entirely correct.
Q. But you did not spot that at the time? - A. I did not,
   sir, no.
Q. One thing that has not come out and I am looking at your
   paragraph 134 in the history so far is that it would
   appear that there were one or two amendments to the
   safety certificate which had not been incorporated in
   the certificate itself? - A. Yes, sir, those are a
   mystery to me.
Q. A^ain, is that a. matter which you have discovered since
   this tragedy and you have been investigating for the     ...
   purpose of giving evidence? - A. Yes, sir. As you will
   appreciate, for the benefit of the Inquiry, considerable
   work has gone into the files to extract all relevant
   information as far as possible.
Q. Maybe slightly surprising, Mr. Bownes, that that had not
   been done in the last three or four years, three years,
   rather, since the City Council was considering what ought
   to be in the safety certificate? - A. Yes. The impression
   I had on taking over the administrative system was that
   everything was O.K., everybody was happy with what was
   going off essentially.
Q. Well, one thing that must have become perfectly - well, no,
   I will come to that later. Any way, there were apparently
   amendments to the conditions, details of which we have not
   seen, but they are somewhere on the file, are they, indic­
   ating wording amendments to conditions 10 and 26, wording
   amendments to 10 and a time limit variation on 26? - A..
   Y e s, s i r . They are not actually on this file, though
   they can be produced if required.
Q. You mean they were not even on the right file, they were
   on a different file? - A. No, sir. They are not in this
   file here.
Q. I follow.   I am not asking you to produce them. - A. Ho.

                               Q.    You refer to them there, and I imagine they are not
                                     enormously material or are they? - A. No, I do not
                                     think they are, sir, no.

                               Q.    Just indicates a slight, if one may be forgiven to use
                                     the word, sloppiness in approach to what goes into the
                                     safety certificate? - A. That is a matter of speculation
                                     as to what the County Council actually did ....
                        B
                               Q.         LORD JUSTICE TAYLOR:   Sorry. Would you speak up?
                                     - A. Sorry. It is a question of speculation there as to
                                     what the County Council actually did and what they
                                     intended by these alterations. I-t is not possible to
                                     pick that up from the file.

                               Q.         MR. COLLINS:   Any way we know that there was a
                                     meeting at the ground in August of 1986. Is that right?
                                     - A. The inspection, sir?

                               Q.    Inspection, yes. - A. Yes, sir.

                               Q.    And you attended that, did you? - A. I did, sir, yes.

                         D     Q.    And I think you told us you had been to the ground before
                                     that? - A. Yes, sir.
                                     Was that correct? The purpose of that inspection was
                                     what, as you understood it?- A. It was one of the inspections
                                     of the ground, the usual ones the County Council used to
                                     organise, sir.
                               0 , Yes. And also was it, as you understood it, to view the new
                                   works that had been completed at the Kop? - A. No,sir.
                                     That was wholly separate, was it? - A. That was an entirely
                                     separate issue. If I could just mention, I had previously
                                     been to Sheffield Wednesday on the 10th of July, 1986, to
                                     discuss questions of the Kop.

                                Q.        LORD JUSTICE TAYLOR:       20th of July? - A. No, sir.
                                     The 10th of July.

                                Q.   Was that the first lvisit you ever made? - A. To the best
                                     of my recollection, sir, yes.

                                Q.   10th of July, 1986. - A. Yes.

                                Q.   And the inspection you are now referring to was when?
                                          MR. COLLINS:    7th    of August.
                                           THE WITNESS:   Yes, sir, I believe     it was.

                                Q.         MR. COLLINS:   Nov;, can I just    see if I fully understand

                                      party still.
                                 0. Still the working party? - A. Yes, sir.
                                 0 And what was vour intention about its composition and how
                                  '* it should work and its responsibilities? -A. I had formed
                          B          no intention at that stage, sir. Formed a number of views,
                                     but the intention was at that stage it should operate as
                                     theold working party did.

                                 Q.
                                      Mow it would apoear that the old working party had no
                                      chairman? - A. To be quite honest, sir, I have not really
                                      been able to establish how the old working party worked
                                      as such.

                                 Q.
                                      It does not matter how the old one worked, How did yours

                                       within a few minutes of getting into the meeting, that
                                       there were potentially serious problems w i t h _the Kop,
                                       particularly from the point of view of the-Fire Service.
                                            LORD JUSTICE TAYLOR: It is very difficult to hear
                                       you. I am sorry. Would you bring the microphone closer

                                                                      D. B O W N E S

Q.    You see, one t hing that it a f f e c t e d and c o n s i d e r a b l y
      a f f e c t e d was the c a p a c i t y of the pens. A.     I have                       heard
      that s u g g e s t e d , sir, yes.

Q.    Well, it has not only been                   suggested;        it is a fact if one
      lo oks at the G r e en Guide.                A.   Yes.          I think that is also
      a d i f f i c u l t q u e s t i o n , sir.

Q.    Had you read the G reen              G u i d e be f o r e you took over your
      responsibilities?            A.        I had l o o k e d at the Green Guide
      that was a v a i l a b l e at the time, sir, but the new one didn't
      come out u n t i l N o v e m b e r , 1986, which was a f te r this time.

Q.    The 1976       G u i d e is not r e a l l y m a t e r i a l l y any d i f f e r e n t        in
      relation       to this aspect, the c a l c u l a t i o n of capacity.
      A.   No,       sir, I b e l i e v e it isn't.

Q.    And you had o b v i o u s l y f a m i l i a r i s e d y o u r s e l f with the
      p r o v i s i o n s of the Gre en Guide.                A.    In b r o ad terms, sir,
      yes, as far as I c o u l d             u n d e r s t a n d them. O b v i o u s l y there
      were t e c h n i c a l a s p e c t s there.

Q.     You sought help,        no doubt,         from   those     who     did    understand             them
       if you had any          doubts.           A.     Yes.

Q.     One thing that m us t have struck, you when you went to th-e
       g r o u n d for the' first t i m e ,a n d ’l oo k e d at L e p p i n g s Lane end
       for the first time was the e x i s t e n c e of these- pens.
       A.        I must admit, sir, not h a v i n g been to a football gro un d
       b e f o r e or r e a l i s i n g how the o p e r a t i o n a c t u a l l y worked,
      .it didn't, sir, to be honest.

Q.      Did it not o c c u r to you that it m ig h t not be a bad idea                       to
       get y o u r s e l f b r i e f e d on the s i g n i f i c a n c e   of these pens?
       A.        Sir, you m i g h t as w el l say that I s h o u l d have got
       m y s e l f b r i e f e d on all a s p e c t s of e m e r g e n c y p l a nn in g, fire
       s a f e t y and so on, if you get my drift, sir.

Q.     Well, Mr. B ow n e s , you w ere the p e r s o n who was the dele ga te
       of the City C o u n c i l who w e r e r e s p o n s i b l e for iss ui ng the
       C e r t i f i c a t e and u l t i m a t e l y r e s p o n s i b l e for e n s u r i n g that
       the s p e c t a t o r s of S h e f f i e l d W e d n e s d a y F o o t b a l l Gr ou n d were
       safe.           A.     Yes, sir, that is correct.

Q.     And that wa s a g r ave r e s p o n s i b i l i t y ,       was      it    not? A.          And
       it s till is, sir, yes.

Q.     We know and w he n y o u - r e a d the C e r t i f i c a t e you w o u l d have seen
       that the c a p a c i t y on the t e r r a c e s was global in the sense
       that it did not take a c c o u n t of the pens.                A.      That is q u i te
       right, sir, yes.

Q.     You a p p a r e n t l y did    not   a p p r e c i a t e the s i g n i f i c a n c e   of
       that at the time.               A.       I did not, sir, no.

 Q.    Did a n y o n e at any time as far as you can recall be f o r e this
       t r a g e d y o c c u r r e d i n d i c a t e to you that there was any s i g n i f i c a n c e
       in the pens in r e l a t i o n to c a p a c i t y ?        A.   I b e l i e v e it
                                                                      63


                                                                                          D. B O W N E S

                                would    be   true   to   say   no,    sir.

                           Q.   Did a n y o n e at any time i n d i c a t e to you that it was i m p o r t a n t
                                that there s h o u l d be some form of c ontrol to en su re that fans
                                s p r e a d e v e n l y over the t e r r a c e rather than pa c k i n g into the
                                central pens?             A.   N o - o n e i n d i c a t e d that to me at any
                                stage, sir.
                      B
                           Q.   So you w e r e w h o l l y u n a w a r e of the need for any s ys t e m               of
                                m o n i t o r i n g to e n s u r e that t h er e was even d i s t r i b u t i o n     on
                                th ose t e r r a c e s ?       A.    Yes, sir, that is true.

                           Q.   Were you a w a r e at all of the i m p o r t a n c e of e ns u r i n g that
                                the re were s u f i c i e n t t u r n s t i l e s to enable p e o p l e to get
                                t h r o u g h in a r e a s o n a b l e t i m e ?   A.    Sir, I think I ought
                                to say at this stag e that the C oun ci l can not act i n d e p e n d e n t l y
                                in e x e r c i s i n g its role here.            It acts on the basis of a d v i c e
                                from s p e c i a l s - from Fire S er vi ce, Police, Bu i l d i n g Surveyor.
                                It c a n n o t s u b r o g a t e the Club.        it can no t sta n d in its
                                shoes, e f f e c t i v e l y .

                           Q.   What it b o i ls down to, or s e e ms to boil down to, is this,
                                that the C o u n c i l went on e f f e c t i v e l y in c o m p l e t e i g n or an ce
                      D         as to the s i g n i f i c a n c e of any of the l ay - o u t of the ground
                                at the L e p p i n g s Lane end.                 A.     Sir, in so far as the
                                So uth Y o r k s h i r e C o u n t y C o u n c i l had r e ce ntl y cea sed being

                                take the v ie w that the g r o u n d was r e a s o n a b l y safe at that s t ag e

                           Q.   Did you ask your o p p o s i t e nu mbe r, your p r e d e c e s s o r at South
                                Y o r k s h i r e w h e t h e r t here w e r e any m at t e r s which you ought
                                to know a b o u t ?            A.    I b e l i e v e I did, sir, yes.

                           Q.   And he t o l d     you n o t h i n g ?     A.     He didn't      highlight         any
                                po i n t s that    needed looking          at,   sir.

                           Q.   When we get to the m e e t i n g of 7th August,                  can I ask you to
                                look at page 341 of our bun d l e .         This is              the only note
                                that e x i s t s as far as we are awar e of the                  m e e t i n g of 7th
                                August, 1986.        I e x p e c t you have seen it              before, have you
                                not?     A.      I have had a b r i e f look at it               before, sir, yes.

                           Q.   And this is the n ot e that d e a l s with the re mo val of the
                                barr ie r.          As I e x p e c t you w o u l d agree, unless you know
                                that it is d e a l i n g w ith that, it is not e n t i r e l y clear
                                from the face of it that it is.                        A.   No, sir.   It

                                time, sir.

                           Q.   It was m a de by Mr. S t r a n g e ,          I think, and there is also a
                                note of the v a r i o u s m a t t e r s       that r equire to be dealt with,

                                onwar ds.       Do you see t h a t ?            A.    Yes, sir.

                           Q.   Obviously matters which                the W o r k i n g Party had         s p o t t e d that
                                n e e d e d to be done. A.               It loo ks like that,              sir, yes.

                         Q. Now, after the meeting in August, 1986, and the approval of
                            t he ex t e n s i o n of the Kop, w hat was the next matter that the
                            Cit y Council did in r e l ation to the safety certificate, the
                            r eview of the safety cert i f i c a t e ?  Can you help us about: that.
                            Mr. Bownes? - A. I am not s u r e to what you are referring.

                         Q. You had indicate in that m i n u t e we looked at in May 1986 you
                            were intending to redraft th e safety certificate, and you were
                   n        g o i n g to seek comments from the interested parties, that: is
                   B        the Fire Service, the Po l i c e and the Building Surveyor? - A.
                            Yes, sir.

                         G. And you started that process,           did you? - A.   If I can refer to
                            some notes I have made, sir?

                         0. Yes, of course.  I just wa n t e d to find out when that process
                            started.  It would seem to h ave been in the late autumn of
                            1986, but I will be corrected if I am wrong. - A. Perhaps it
                            might be useful for me to go through a chronology of this?

                         0.    If you have got a c h r o n o l o g y that would be very helpful.

                         Q.         LORD JUSTICE TAYLOR:   We have not got it in this bundle,
                               have we? - A. I think it can be made available, sir.

                         Q.     Is there a copy?

                                about?

                                     MR. MAXWELL:   Yes, sir, and I think it is the schedule
                                of safety conditions at the end, its chronology set out with
                                letters-  I have not got 20 copies but I can get them.

                                     THE WITNESS:       I believe it is the last two pages        of the
                                document you have,     sir.

                          q.         MR. COLLINS:    Yes.    You had asked other Councils for
                                copies of their safety c e r t i f i c a t e s and their conditioris , and
                                you had don e that in April and May 1986? - A. That is correct.

                          Q. And in June 1986 you sent a memorandum....

                                     LORD JUSTICE TAYLOR:   If this is tabulated in some form
                                I would very much like to hav e it rather than have to write it
                                all down again.

                                      MR.   MAXWELL:    Yes,    I am sending someone off now     t:o   do
                                it.

                     H                LORD- JUSTICE TaYLOR:        I will listen and get a copy

                                     MR. COLLINS:        I was handed this by Mr.       Maxwell this
                                morning:

                           Q. Let me tak e it fairly q u i c k l y because copies will be made
                              available, and we can see them later.         18th April, 1986, you
                              refer to a r e s ponse from Liverpool enclosing copies of their
                              safety c e r t i f i c a t e conditions.

                                     MR. MAXWELL:   I hesit a t e to interrupt, but in the mean
                                time could I offer you mine, marked somewhat as it is, but it
                                may assist you.

                                      LOR D JUSTICE TAYLOR:        I will be patient.

                           Q.         MR. COLLINS:               6 th Ma y 1986, meeting of General Purposes
                                Panel, the resolution we have^seen.                 That is in our bundle,-
                                313.   29th May your Chief E x e cutive writes to his opposite
                                numbers in Birmingham, Manc h e s t e r and Leeds asking for their
                                s afety c e r t i f i c a t e s ? - A. Yes, sir.

                           Q . 5th June memo to building surveyor, and letters containing the
                               s ame comments to the Chief C o n stable and Chief Fire Officer,
                      D        informing them that the ce r t i f i c a t e conditions were shortly to
                               be redrafted when they w ould be asked for comments.           That was
                               p utting them on notice t h e y •were going to be asked for
                               comments but not actually asking them? - A. That is right.

                           Q. You get a reply from Birm i n g h a m on 10th June.      You      wri~a to
                               your opposite numbers in B a r nsley and Doncaster on            4 th July
                             ." inviting consultation, because they had taken over              some of the
                                old South Y o r k s h i r e grounds in their jurisdiction?      - A. Yes,
                                and Rotherham Council as well.

                           Q. And Rotherham.  29th August you get some response from the
                              Home Office? - A. Yes, sir.  I don't think that should be in
                              there.  It is not really relevant.

                           Q. We will forget about that.           - A. The next entry is 24tn
                              September.

                           Q. You get a copy from Manchester.              I can see you were doing
                              that, but you did not start the process of asking for nhe
                              specific comments of the F i r e Service, the Building Department
                              and the Police, it would seem until November 1936 or
                              thereabouts, because if you look at our page 374.... -              A. I
                              think I can speed this up a bit.              The drafting of the safety
                              ce r t i f i c a t e conditions a c t ually took place during the 6 months
                              J a n u a r y - J u n e 1987,.

                           Q.   Yes, I follow that.   All I am asking you about at the moment
                                is when you reque sted the input to help you with the drafting
                                from the Fire, Police and Building Department? - A. That was
                                on 7th July, 1987.
                       H   0. 7th July?       No,   you told them you were going t o 'ask them on 7tn

                                                                                        D. BOWNES


                                   July? - A.   I think you have mistaken 1986 and 1987.

                             0. You say you did not ask them until July 1987? - A. Yes.

                             Q.         LORD JUST I C E TAYLOR:      About a year later? - A. Yes.

                             Q.         MR-. COLLINS:   I think you are doing yourself an
                                   .injustice there, Mr. Bownes, because unless' I have misread the
                     g             purpose of the letter at page 374 you had asked in November
                                   1986.

                                         MR. MAXWELL:        I h e s i t a t e to say the purpose has been
                                   misunderstood, but I think it has, because it is a response to
                                   another letter asking whet h e r the Fire Service has any
                                   comments about the ground rather than in the context of saf e t y
                                   c ertif i c a t e conditions.

                                        MR. COLLINS:    I follow.       I got myself into the same mess
                                   before as I remember, in r e l a t i o n to the Fire documents:

                             Q.    It was not until July 1987 that you asked for the input that
                                   had been referred to in the meeting of May 1986.  Is that
                                   right? - A. Yes, sir.

                      D      Q.    It seems to have taken, w i t h respect, an awful long time to
                                   get round to asking for t heir comments? - A. Yes, sir.              The
                                   problem es s e n t i a l l y was that the exerc i s e which I 'originally"''
                                   anticipated would be r e l a t i v e l y straightforward was not.       By
                                   looking at the other Council certificates I noticed very much
                                   in the way that Mr. J u s t i c e Popplewell noticed that matters
                                   d i f fered considerably between authorities.           It took me a great
                                  ■deal of time to wrestle w ith that and to try and get it down
                                   and take the best bits of eac h c ertificate and put them
                                   together.

                             Q.    That was the problem,      was    it? - A.   It was a very great
                                   problem, yes, sir.

                             Q. Having requested that y o u ,-I think, had a draft report for a
                                meeting in September 1987 w h i c h appears on our page 417? Is
                                that correct, or your pag e 128, whichever you prefer. - A.
                                Yes, a report to the General Purposes Panel in September 1987.

                             Q. What you say there, I think so far as relevant is that you
                                refer back under the heading, "Current situation" to the
                                panel's meeting in May 1986, and identified several main areas
                                for further investi g a t i o n ? - A. Yes, sir.

                              Q.    Then you deal with the review of the administrative system and
                                    say it is going to be changed.        In the meantime presumably
                                    there had been an insp e c t i o n meeting in August 1987, or the
                                    summer of 1987, or not? - A. yes, there had ,been one in 1987.

                              Q.    That was under the old sys t e m again, was it? - A. No, sir,
                                    that was under the new s y s t e m slightly anticipating this
                                    report, where individual officers were asked to submit
                         H          comments in writing, w h i c h indeed happened.

                              Q.   That we can see,     for example,     at - no we can't.     - A. It is in
                                   my bundle.

                              G.   I am not p a r t i c u l a r l y concerned with that because no doubt it
                                   was s e n s i b l e to anti c i p a t e what was clearly a sensible
                                   reorganisation.              I d o n ’t d oubt that at all.  Can I get .
                                   absol u t e l y clear what was the new system as you understood it
                          B        that was g oing to operate? - A.                 The inspection system or the
                                   ad m i n i s t r a t i v e system, sir?

                              Q.   First of all the inspe c t i o n system? - A. Yes, sir.           My
                                   impression was that the best way of operating an inspection
                                   system like this was to persuade officers to submit the
                                   comment s u b s e q u e n t l y in writ i n g and then those comments would
                                   be s u b m i t t e d to the club, which would make it reasonably clear
                                   what exac t l y was being raised and who was raising it in order
                                   that the matter could be dealt with more efficiently than I
                                   thought had been d one in the past.               So it occurred to me that
                                   some of the work i n g party minutes did not make it clear who
                                   was sa y i n g what in relat i o n to matters.

                              Q . I follow that,      but you would have an annual inspection? - A.
                                    Yes .
                      D
                              Q.    That would take how long, was it anticipated?    One day, two
                                   -d a y s ? A. In terms of officer time or in terms of .time .on the.'
                                    ground?

                              Q.    In terms of time actually on the ground? - A. That would take
                                    perhaps a full day, I would have thought.

                              Q. Who would de c i d e which parts were to be inspected? - A. That
                                 would be for the individual officers to form their own views.
                                 They would go to the areas they were most concerned with.

                              Q. Was there a c h a i r m a n of that group? - A. No, sir, it can't
                                 work like that effectively.             This is a very similar system to
                                 that used for public enter t a i n m e n t inspections in those sort
                                 of premises, w here officers simply go to the areas they are
                                 p a r t i c u l a r l y interested in in order to obtain their comments
                                 or mak e c o m m e n t s .

                              Q.    Did you attend? - A. Yes,         I did.

                              G. What parts did you look at? - A.              I can't recall offhand,      sir.

                              G. What_ did you consider to be the area with which you were
                                 c on c e r n e d when you went on these inspections? - A. Any area
                                 which s o m e b o d y pointed out to me was a matter for concern, for
                                 example, sir.

                               0. S u c h-as? - A. I c a n ’t a c t ually recall what happened on the
                                  inspection, sir.       .

                               Q. Did you have any k n o w l e d g e of what you were going to look for?
                          H       - A. No, sir.  As far as I am concerned I am not an expert.

Q.    I follow that.           - A . I rely on the advice of experts, and they
      have f r e q u e n t l y given advice on various matters relating to
      safety.        My job as I saw it was to ensure that the inspectors
      c ould go w here they wanted to, were not obstructed in any way
      - t here was no s uggestion they were ever obstructed - and to
      e n s u r e t h e y had all the information they needed to carry out
      their job.

Q. Did you have an advance meet i n g before you went on this
   inspe c t i o n to discuss among yourselves what you should look
   for an so on? - A. Not as I recall in those terms.       All the
   services involved are very familiar with doing inspections in
   this way.

0. Did you have a meeting afterwards to de c i d e what each of you
   requi r e d to be done or was it simply left to the individual to
   w r i t e a letter to you? - A. Individuals wrote a letter, sir.

Q.    To you? - A.    To me.

Q. And you would send on to the club?              You would write to the
   club i n c o r p o r a t i n g such of the points as you thought the club
   ought to know about? - A. No, sir.              What happened on this
   o c c asion is that the newly set up advisory group, which is
   referred to in this report in September 1987, considered the
   v a r i o u s comments made by the Building Surveyor and the .
   E n v i r o n m e n t a l Health Department, and from their input I -was
   able to extr a c t a list of comments to send to the ciub.

Q. The a d v i s o r y g roup was going to consist of who? - A. The Fire
   Service, the Police, the Building Surveyor, the Health &
   C o n s u m e r Services and ourselves, sir.

 Q.        LORD JUSTICE TAYLOR:   You have got a working party which
       consists of these.  They conduct an inspection? - A. Yes.

 Q. With you there.       They then write to you with their comments on
    the inspe c t i o n for consideration by an advisory group? - A.
    Yes.

 Q.    Which is the same outfit? - A. Yes,         sir, effectively.

 Q.    Then I don't understand.                It is probably my fault, but I don't
       u n d e r s t a n d the diffe r e n c e between the working party and the
       advisory group at the moment. - A. There is none effectively.
       It is simply a change of name.

 Q.    Why do you call it s o mething different? - A. Because that more
       a c c u r a t e l y reflected what it did, sir.

 q.        MR. COLLINS:   Are t here two different bodies? One goes
       and does the inspection and then reports back to another
       group? - A.-Wo, sir.

 Q. It is the same group? - A. It is the same individuals.                  The
    individuals do not inspect as a group.

Q.   They inspect i n d i vidually? - A. Yes.

Q.       L ORD JUST I C E TAYLOR:   What we have got then is a change
     of nomenclature.      What was the officer working party is now
     going to be the advisory group? - A. Yes, sir.

Q.   And the officer working p arty can            be buried.       Is that it? - A.
     Yes.

Q. As a name? - A.        Yes,   sir.

Q.       MR. COLLINS:    I am sorry, but this meeting you attend at
     the ground, is that all the advisory group going along on the
     same day? - A . It is not a meeting as such.  It is an
     inspection.

Q.   I am sorry.               This insp e c t i o n of the ground, is this all the
     advisory g roup going along on the same day? - A. Yes. ix is
     r e p r e s e n t a t i v e s from all the authorities going there and
     inspecting.

Q.   And then you have a m e e t i n g after that to decide what should
     be d one? - A. When the comments are in, if it is appropriate
     to do so.

Q...Each after that.''-inspection ••writes you a letter indicating what''"
   •he has seen that he c o n siders ought to be put to the club? - '
    A. Yes, sir.

Q. You r e c e i v e all those lette r s ? - A. Yes.

Q. You then put them together and decide what should go to the
   club.  Is that right? - A. No, as I have just explained,...

Q. You have another meet i n g of the advisory group? - A. No,                    a
   meeting, not another meeting.

0.       LORD JUST I C E TAYLOR:   'You have an inspection.    Now you
     are having a meeting.      The sam e personnel? - A. Sometimes the
     same personnel, sir.     It depe n d s who is available at the time.

Q. That meet i n g is not on site.           That is round a table somewhere?
   - A. yes, sir.

Q. And if s o m e t h i n g like removal of a barrier is proposed at a
   meeting of that kind you c o n s i d e r it is down to you to decide
   whether it happens or it does not? - A. No, sir, that is not
   right at all.

Q. Well, I have m i s u n d e r s t o o d what you said before about
   delegation. - A. When the comments are collated and brought
   toget h e r then they are s u b m i t t e d to the club acting under the
   a p p r o p r i a t e del e g a t e d power, sir, after they have been
   di s c u s s e d if necessary.

Q.   They are s u b m i t t e d to the club,    you say? - A.       Yes,   sir.
                                                                  73


                                                                                                D.   B0MNE5



                      A
                               G. And then? - A. And then the club takes action and the
                                  i ndiv i d u a l members check the work has been done.

                               Q.   Forg i v e me, but can I just get this clear in my mind. At what
                                    p oint is the city's approval given and by whom? - A. At the
                                    point the letter goes out to the club with the consolidated
                                    comments, sir.
                       B
                               0.   But b e t w e e n the meeting of the advisory group and your sending
                                    that letter out, has anyone other than you from the city
                                    c o n s i d e r e d it? - A. No, sir, e f f e c tively not.

                               Q.   So it is your d e c i s i o n as far as the city is concerned as to
                                    whether it goes to the clu b with approval? - A. Yes, sir,
                                    effectively, after all the comments have been fully discussed
                       C            by the p e o p l e who are ma k i n g t h e m .

                                        LORD JUST I C E TAYLOR:        I think we will break off at that
                                    point.  2 o'clock.

               TUESDAY, 27th JUNE, 1989
                    (AFTERNOON    SESSION)

     MR, MAXWELL:    Sir, I hope you have received now
the memoranda from Mr. Bownes in the form of, I think
it is j five sheets.
     LORD JUSTICE TAYLOR:        I think it is coming up now.
     MR. MAXWELL:      Sir, can I just explain what it is tha
you are receiving?
     LORD JUSTICE TAYLOR:        Yes.   Thank you.
     MR. MAXWELL:    Three of the sheets are headed by a pa
narked delay and the other two are headed safety certifica
conditions schedule.
     MR, COLLINS:   Those behind me have only received
three sheets. I do not know whether that is general or
whether we are being discriminated against.
     MR. MAXWELL:      There should.be a total of five,
     MR. COLLINS:   Being discriminated against. I have
got five but I just wondered whether anyone else had
three sheets only. I am told the five may have been
divided into three and 2 but I am not sure.
     MR. MAXWELL:   Sound engineering principle.       Sir,
do you have the five sheets?
     LORD JUSTICE TAYLOR:    I have got three and two
which takes one back a very long time.
     MR. MAXWELL:   Sir, yes. What they consist of,
on the sheet marked delay, is a commentary on the
matter of delay and that is attached to a chronology
of what are called and explained in the body of the
first sheet exceptional events arising in Mr. Bownes'
workload and running parallel with that chronology
is a chronology set out under the heading safety
certificate condition schedule and the chronology
is divided up into six month blocks each and it is
hoped one can look across from the blocks in the
chronology of exceptional events to the corresponding
block in the safety certificate conditions schedule.

                                                      D.   BOWNES


                    DAVID BOWNES    Recalled
               Examined by MR. COLLINS (Cont'd) :
Q. Yes, Mr. Bownes, perhaps the convenient thing to do would
   be to incorporate this into your statement, would it, as
   really part and parcel of it? - A. Yes, sir.
Q. Mr. Bownes, we were dealing just before lunch with the
   change of the working party to the advisory group,
   advisory - I have forgotten the name now. - A. Group, sir.
Q. Group.   I was right, yes. And you explained about that.
   How, you were then going on to explain about the future
   administration. That, I think, appears, does it not,
   at page 418 of our bundle and 129 of yours or does that
   deal with both, both the change of status of the advisory
   group and the future administration? - A. Yes, sir, it
   deals with both.
Q.We have dealt with the advisory group.           Can we go on to
    the future administration and can you tell us of the
    salient details of your understanding of the system
   after this was agreed? - A. Yes, sir. Basically it was
    similar to the old system in that there were some
  - -ouidel ines'-i-ssued- to'the '-various 'officers indicating ..
    the areas in which they would have a particular
    responsibility, if you like. I think that is dealt
   with in full detail m the report.
Q. The areas of responsibilities are those set out at
   the bottom of the first page or, rather, the .... - A.
   That is correct, sir, and over the page on 3.
Q. Yes. What I still want to know is the question of the
   decision making and that you set out on page 419. You
   say there is also, under delegations, also a further
   question to be dealt with at this stage and that relates
   to the day to day decisison making required for the
   running of the certification system? - A. Yes, sir.
 Q. "At the moment decision making powers rest with the panel
    but this is a highly impractical arrangement which needs
    to be reviewed urgently." Can I just pause there?
    That sentence suggests that you did not in fact have
    any decision making powers before this proposal was
    put into effect? - A. I do not think that^is right, sir.
    The previous report that I mentioned earlier on dealt
    with the continuation really of the working party system
    as it was effectively and I believe that gave delegated
    powers to deal with it.                          *
         LORD JUSTICE TAYLOR:   Which report was that? - A.
    It was the May, 1985 report, sir.
                                 76


                                                          D.   BOWNES


           MR. COLLINS:   313, I think. Effectively he is
      referring, as I understood it, to 316A, the panel being
      asked to note the broad outlines of the adiuinistrative
      svstem organised by the County Council and authorise
      its continuation for the"time being:
0. Is that correct, Mr. Bownes? - A. That is correct, yes.
0. You went into that but all I am noting is that sentence
   on page 419 which reads, "At the moment decision making
   powers rest with the panel but this is a highly im­
   practical arrangement which needs to be reviewed urgently,"
   if that sentence is taken at face value and if the
   reader believed what he was reading it would indicate
   that you had no powers to make decisions at that stage
   because the powers had only been delegated to the panel?
   - A. No, sir', I think that is really referring to the new
   administrative system in that sense.
0.            LORD JUSTICE TAYLOR:    Would you look at page 122
         in your bundle? - A. I have it, sir.
Q. well, (a), (b) and (c) there sum it up, do not they?      In
   the meantime following delegations be approved. Ail
   oowe.rs delegated to. the. General Purposes Panel. Right?

0. Then emergency procedure powers under Section 10 go to
    head of Administration and Legal Department. Well,
    that is issuing prohibitions, is not it?- A. It is making
  ' application to the Court for a Prohibition Notice.
Q. That is right. And (c) Power to authorise officers under
   Section 11 is inspections, is not it?- A. Yes, sir.
0. So so far as any decision making about what is to be
   approved by way of a change in layout is concerned,
   (a) is what applies, is not it, General Purposes Panel?
   - A. I would point out that report is in March of 1985
   before the Council actually became the certificating
   authority.
0. Yes. Where is something different now? - A. In the
   second report, sir, at point ....
Q.            MR.    COLLINS: Your page 127, our page 317, I
         think? -    A. Yes, “sir.
 0.           LORD JUSTICE TAYLOR:   Well, you derive it from (a)
         there, do you? - A. Yes, sir.      v;
 0   ,        MP..   COLLINS: Mr. Bownes, forgive me, I do not thin::
         that can    possibly be right, can     it, because     come onto
         our page    419, your p a g e •130 and that sentence which reads
                                                     D.   BOWNES


quite clearly at the moment, i.e., as of now before these
provisions are put into effect, decision making powers
rest with the panel but that is highly impractical? - A.
Yes, sir, I think-that was a reference to the, if you
like, decisions that involve the change of capacity,
for example, at the Kop.
It does not say that and, indeed, it is wholly consistent
with the history, as Lord Justice Taylor has pointed out to
you, that you should have believed that at that time, i.e.,
September / 1 9S7, decision making powers in general rested
with the panel? -A. I do not share that interpretation,
sir, I am afraid.
Well, with respect then, you do not write what you mean,
do you? - A. I think it is important to appreciate that
I knew perhaps what I was talking about at the time but
perhaps*did not translate it entirely accurately into
words.
      LORD JUSTICE TAYLOR:       Well, I am sorry to intervene
again but I do not see how a rather bland and vague
expression in (a) on your page 127 can be said to change
what can be read at page 122. How does it change it? - A.
Well, sir, it authorises the continuation for the time
be.ing ,df. the .old County.. Council administrative system.
It is not drafted in the same terms as the previous
delegation, sir.
Well, what was the County Council’s system, that an
officer in your position should have the decision
making power? Where do you get that from? - A. E f f e c t i v e l y
the working party operate in the way it did.
     MR. COLLINS: You told us earlier you did not know
how it v/orked. That was half the trouble? - A. Yes, it
was half the trouble, sir, yes.
If you did not know how it worked how could you know
that it worked to give you delegated powers? - A. I
took the view that the County Council in writing to clubs
or whatever making comments had the power then, if you
like, to make the decisions. Effectively the working
party could be said to have made recommendations which
were then firmed up in the form of letters to the clubs

Can we iust see what your thinking may have been at the
time? Could you be good enough to look at page 331 of
our bundle, please? This is a note of a meeting held in
March of 1987. How, about half-way down - this is a
Fire Service Department note of a meeting apparently
held at the Town Hail. Is that right? - A. No. It

                                                                                               D.   BOWNES


                                    says meeting held at Division Street conference rooms.
                              Q. Where is that? Is that the Fire Service? - A. It would
                                 have been at the time, sir, I think; yes.
                              0. And it records your presence and various other of the
                                 City Council and a number of Fire Service, Right?     A.
                                  :es sir
                      B
                              Q. You remember this meeting, do you,                   Bownes? - A. Yes,
                                 sir, I think so.
                              0 . About half-way down, discussion on areas of responsibility
                                  and ground inspections, which presumably is relevant to
                                  what developed into the memorandum that we have been
                                  looking at in September? - A. Yes, sir. What followed
                                  after this meeting was in fact an exchange of corres­
                                  pondence about this situation.

                              Q-       It says, "On areas of respons ibilities Hr. Bownes did not
                                      want to be tied down to indiv idual references and even
                                       indicated that his department could not act independently
                                      but must refer all matters to the Council Committee
                      D                responsible for the Safety at Sports Grounds Act."
                                      Now, it looks as if you were then saying that you yourself
                                   ' t c oil                     .;ya'u -±ra.d:;;ter::r efe r ■■■every-thing -
                                   ■ back ,•-does-not it? ~ A-. Sir, I think the discussion
                                       really was there about the fu ture administration of
                                       the system rather than the pr esent one and it was an
                                       attempt to discuss what role the General Purposes Panel
                                       should have and what role off icers should have.
                                    Well, for the future you did not want to have to refer
                                    everything back. What that appears to be relating to
                                    is the present, i.e.. you cannot now act independently,
                                    you have got to refer everything back? - A. I would say
                                    not, sir. I think that is referring to broad discussion
                                    about the future.
                              0       see   It goes on, "Whilst all others present would
                                    prefer definitive areas of responsibility, allowing
                                    there must be some overlap, Mr. Bownes preferred to
                                    refer back to the future meeting following further
                                    consideration of the matter." That is to say that you
                                    were not then accepting definitive areas of responsibility
                                    You thought further discussion was needed? - A. Certainly*
                                    further thought, sir. That, indeed, did take place.
                              0. You then refer or it is recorded you referred to the recent
                                 Lords decision on ground inspections. Did that refer to
                                 the Bill that was then presumably going through which
                                 became the 87 Act? - A. To be perfectly honest, sir, I
                                 do not know. I do not know what that refers to at all
                              0. You cannot help on that? - A. No.

Q. This would mean a much more thorough examination tha n
   the present system of bi-annual inspections. Did you
   believe that, that your future system would be more
   thorough, annual inspections? - A. I must admit the
   wording is a little difficult. I do not really know
   what i t is getting at there.
0. Well the difficulty is you did not apparently take a
   record of this meeting? - A. Sir, what happened_following
   this was that detailed letters were sent to individual
   authorities dealing with the future administrative system.




                                                                      0-3 r-r
Q. But. you see, this is the only record we have and since i
   refers to your thoughts I thought in fairness to you I ou
   to ask you" to deal with the matters in case any false
   impression may have been given?- A. Yes. I think the
   matters were dealt with fully in correspondence sub­
   sequently .
  0. I see. Did you think it would mean a more thorough
     examination than the present system because that was
     not'said in terms, I think, in the correspondence? - A.
     I* do not know, sir, to be quite honest. I think in _
     principle an annual inspection is preferable to a bi-
     annual* inspection in that it can be more detailed,_no
.                                                      m’ig’ht'::
     not be as detailed.
 Q. I totally fail to follow that, Mr. Bownes. It depends
   .how detailed you choose to make the inspection, whether
    it be bi-annual or annual, does not it? - A. Yes, sir.
    I think an annual inspection tends to focus minds a
    little better than a bi-annual one does and an annual_
    inspection is a common occurrence in all other licensing
    areas rather than bi-annual.

                           Q.    At what s t a g e ? A. It was r e c e i v e d          I thnk       I said        in November,

                           Q.    You saw in the 1986 G u i d e a r e c o m m e n d a t i o n that that ought
                                 to be n ow four years. A. I h a v e to admit I was i n n o c e n t

                           Q.    W h e n did he p o int it out to you? A. Some weeks ago now

                           Q.   You did      not a p p r e c i a t e that t h ere was         something            w r ong

                                    as we can see, on the 30th M a r c h , 1989, w h i c h refers to

                                    I ha v e not said in t h e r e that no sa fe t y at sports grounds
                                    w o r k was done.          Taht w o u l d be i n c o r r e c t .

                             Q.    T h e r e a s o n you give for that               is that you had an e x c e s s i v e

     what, if a n y t h i n g , needs to be done.                       It w o uld be true
     to say that I was not a w a r e of any c hanges that w o uld
     need to be made at that s t a g e as such - any major changes.

■g. And yo'u w e r e not a w are of any p r o b l e m s that were arising
    in r e l a t i o n to the c a p a c i t y of the pens at Lepp i ng s Lane?
    A.     Not at all, sir, no.

              LORD    JUSTICE       TAYLOR:          Is    that    this?

              MR.    MAXWELL:          No,     tho s e    are   photographs,        sir.

              LORD     JUSTICE      TAYLOR;          well?      there   is other         s t uff
      with    it.

              MR. M A X W E L L :     It is       the     "other    stuff",     sir.         It    is
      part    of the o t h e r      stuff.

               MR. C O L L I N S :      I must c o n f e s s it would have helped
     if I had b e e n g i v e n         this, but t h ere we are.       I am not
     b l a m i n g Mr. M a x w e l l    in the least.         It does help in
     examining witnesses                if one has the mater i a l to enable
     o-ne to do so.

               LORD J U S T I C E TAYLOR:               W ha t is this bun d l e e x a c tl y ?
      It just a p p e a r e d here this m o r n i n g .             It has got some
     r e p r o d u c t i o n s of p h o t o g r a p h s .     I am told they re l at e
     to B r a d f o r d , is that r ig h t ?

               MR. M A X W E L L :       No, they do not, sir.                    I am sorry,
     I c a n n o t see what you are l o o k i n g at, sir.                          Those are
     p h o t o g r a p h s of H i l l s b o r o u g h i m m e d i a t e l y be fo r e it was
     r e f u r b i s h e d for the 1966 W o r l d Cup Marches.                       They show
     the L e p p i n g s Lane end and we t h o u g h t they might be of
     h i s t o r i c a l i n t e r e s t at l e a s t in s h o w i n g how far that Kop went
     up at that end, and you canalso see the tunnel as it used
     to be and the l a y - o u t of the c r u s h barriers as they were
     a f ter that r e f u r b i s h m e n t , as they would have been before
     Dr. E a s t w o o d did his work.

              LORD    JUSTICE          TAYLOR:      I see.        Thank you        very   much.

g.              MR. C O L L I N S : Can I j u s t flick through this very
      q u i c k l y w i t h you, Mr. B o w n e s .    The first letter, October,
      1986, d e a l s w i t h the Kop- d e v e l o p m e n t and is w r i t t e n to
      E a s t w o o d s , is that rig h t ?       A.    Yes, sir, that is correct.

g.    And   deals     with     the      question    of    plans    largely,        I think.
     /A.     Yes,     sir.

g.    And then we have the 3rd N o v e m b e r , 1986 letter w h ich we
      have a l r e a d y r e f e r r e d to a s k i n g for the Fire S e rvice
      c o m m e n t s as to the c o n d i t i o n of United and W e d n e s da y .
      A.        Y e s , sir.

g.    Then the l e t t e r of 18th F e b r u a r y , 1987, w h ich is in our
      b u n d l e at 374 w h i c h d e a l s wi t h the Fire S e rvice c o m m en t s
      and then we have a l e t t e r of the 19th March to the Club,
      19th March, 1987.            A.       Sir, c o ul d I just p o int out that
      is, in fact, a dr a f t l e t te r .          The actual letter to the
      Club w e n t out on 22nd Ap r i l .            It is included there to note
      the c o m m e n t s of the Fire S e r v ic e .

Q.    And the        letter     that     in   the   end   went    out    is   in our      bu n d l e   and
      is page        383.

                 L O R D J U S T I C E TAYLOR:           I am sorry, I must say I find
       this e x t r e m e l y u n s a t i s f a c t o r y .   We have had b u n d l e s of
       d o c u m e n t s and we have been t h r o u g h them and now, in the
       m i d d l e of the h e a r i n g we h a ve got to faff about trying to
       fit some l e t t e r s in w h i c h h a v e j j s t surf ac e d today and I,
       for the m o m e n t , am not f i n d i n g it at all c o n v e n i e n t to
       dot a b o u t to t hose that are in the bundles, those that
       are not.            It is very u n f o r t u n a t e that this was not
       p r o d u c e d e a r l i e r , I am a f r a i d , Mr. Maxwell, is it not?

        MR. M A X W E L L :  Yes,      I think      it   is,    sir.        I think    what
has   h a p p e n e d is that ---

        LORD J U S T I C E   TAYLOR:         We   have   been       going   for some
weeks    now.

        MR. M A X W E L L :      I think Mr. B o w n e s found that there
was a f u r t h e r file in his o f f i c e w h i c h the Police had not
t ake n   p o s s e s s i o n of and in this b u n d l e are d o c u m e n t s that
arise     from that.            I thi n k that is the e x p l a n a t i o n as to
why they w e r e not a v a i l a b l e at the outset.

        MR.   COLLINS:         Sir,    it    is   thoroughly         unsatisfactory.

Can I go back         to 374, the l e t t e r of 18th February, 1987.
Unfortunately         our b u n d l e has an i n c o m p l e t e copy of that
le t t e r .

          MR. C O L L I N S :     Sir, you will note that we have s
l e t t e r w h i c h runs to 4 pages, that is t hrough to 377.
If you would be good e n o u g h to look at the bundle that has
just been h a n d e d in, you w i l l see there is an extra
page, and a r a t h e r i m p o r t a n t extra page, b e c a u s e it deals
w i t h s p e c i f i c a l l y the q u e s t i o n of the s l i ding gates,
w h e r e the Fire S e r v i c e are s a y i n g that they a c c e p t e d the

 t h a t ’"doors' r e q u i r e d for "escape s h o u l d open 'dt'wards , ......
 it is r e c o m m e n d e d that n o t i c e be giv e n to the Club to
 the e f f e c t that w he n any s u c h s l i d i n g gates are to be r e p l a c e d
 then the r e p l a c e m e n t s m u s t open ou twards, even if this
' i n v o l v e s s t r u c t u r a l w o r k to r e c e s s the o p e n i n g to avoid
 i m p i n g i n g over f o o t p a t h s which, of course, is wh ol l y
  c o n s i s t e n t w i t h P a r a g r a p h 64, I think it was, of the
  1986 Green Guide, and they then deal with the method.
  So clearly the Fire S e r v i c e did s p e c i f i c a l l y c o n s i d e r and
  deal with that m a t t e r a l t h o u g h , u n f o r t u n a t e l y , I was not
  a w a r e that that had been the case when I was p u t t i n g the
  m a t t e r s to Dr. E a s t w o o d w h e n e v e r I was doing so.

           Sir, this o b v i o u s l y is a page -- I do not know how
 it has come a b o u t that the page is m i s s i n g from the
 d o c u m e n t we have in the b u n dl e .       It must have got itself
 d e t a c h e d in the b u n d l e from w h i c h we got the letter.   I
 am not q u ite sure w h e r e that came from.

      MR.      M U L LER:      The    full    letter     is    in    the Fire    Service
 bundle .

           MR. C O L L I N S :  It is my fault b e c a u s e I have been
 w o r k i n g from the core b u n d l e .  F o r t u n a t e l y , it is not
 a m a t t e r w h i c h is c e n t r a l .

 Then we were goin g on to the le t t er of 22nd April.              You
 have got the dra f t of the 19th M a r c h w h i c h b ec a m e the
 l e t t e r of the 22 nd and the l e t t e r of the 22 nd is indeed
 the next in this l i t t l e b u ndle, or a copy of it, our page                             383;
 right?        A.   Yes.

Q.     Then we h a v e a l e t t e r to      the P o l i c e - we are back now to
      N o v e m b e r , 1986 - in w h i c h   you ask the Po l i c e for their
      comments;          right?     A.      Yes, sir, it is very s i m i l a r
      to the Fire S e r v i c e letter.

Q.    You get the r e p l y from the P o l i c e of 6 th January, 1987,
      in w h i c h they say both st a d i a , so far as the Pol i c e are
      c o n c e r n e d , c o n f o r m or meet t h e i r r eq u i r e m e n t s . A. Yes,
      sir.

Q.     Then a l e t t e r of 3rd Ma r c h, 1987 next.                A.   To the
      C o u n c i l ' s B u i l d i n g S u r v e y o r , sir, asking the same question.

Q.    Yes.     M e m o r a n d u m from him in his turn of 24th June,
      1987, e f f e c t i v e l y saying, "Well, if you want me to do
      this, it is g o i n g to take s o m e time."       A.    Yes, sir,
      I thi n k he was r e f e r r i n g   to a full survey of both stadia.

Q.    Yes, and that m e m o r a n d u m  is in our bundle at page 386.

                MR. C O L L I N S :         I am      not    sure   we are g e t t in g       anything
      very      m u c h , sir .

Q . T h e n we have s e m i n a r n o tes w h i c h I do not think we need
     go t h r o u g h , save that you w e r e there.       A.   Sir, if I
     may, I th ink the p o i n t was that I was asking them, the
     Fire S e r v i c e and the P o l i c e , if they had any c o m m e n t s
     at all b a s i c a l l y .

 Q.    Indeed, that           is r e a l l y what this all                  boils down to.               You
       were s e e k i n g     i n f o r m a t i o n from them.               A.   Yes, sir.

 Q.    We then c om e to the first d r a f t C e r t i f i c a t e w h ic h you sent
       out, page 387 of our b un d l e , in July 1987, is that right?
       I know we have got a bit out of date order but that is the
       first -- new d r a f t c o n d i t i o n s w h i c h you had pr epared.
       A.   Yes, sir, that is c o r r e c t .

 Q.    And e f f e c t i v e l y that foll o w s , I think, as you saw it, the
       best of the c o n d i t i o n s in the Safety C e r t i f i c a t e s s that
       you had s e e n c o p i e s of?         A.   Yes, sir, I tried to draw
       all the b e s t bits, as I saw them, together and then
       o b v i o u s l y put them to the O f f i c e r s who were e x p e r t s in
       these a r e a s for a p p r o p r i a t e comment.

 Q.    To cut a long s t o r y short, we go on now to 483 and we
       see your --         481 is the c o v e r i n g letter.                In April,

Q.        So far as you w er e c o n c e r n e d , it was your belief, was it,
          that this          d r aft in ear l y A p r i l of this year - the end of
          March, b e g i n n i n g of A p r i l of this year - took on board

g.        And it i n c l u d e d in   it - in fact it was to cover S h e f f i e l d
          U n i t e d aswell - but it i n c l u d e d in it a number of
          appendices;           is that r i g h t ? A.   Schedules, sir, yes.

g.        S c h e d u l e s , I am sorry, one of which, of course, was                         the
          s c h e d u l e w h i c h d e a l t w i t h the capacity. A. Yes,                    sir.
          S c h e d u l e 3, page 506.

          as we can see, of course, i n c r e a s e s the Kop to 21 , 0 0 0

          fi g u r e s that were in the old C er t i f i c a t e .          A.  Yes, sir.
          I am sure you w i ll have n o t e d that the p r e v i ou s draft
          Qei'tificate c o n d i t i o n s did not i n clude d e t a i l e d schedules.
          This was the first time they had been p r e p a r e d for the
          p a r t i c u l a r g r o u n d and t h e r e f o r e I am sure that c o m m e n t s
          w o u l d have been w e l c o m e on t h o s e areas.

           what?      A.       I am sure that c o m m e n t s would have been

 g            MR. C O L L I N S :       Are you s a y i n g that the old C e r t i f i c a t e
     ' d i d not i n c l u d e a s c h e d u l e like this?         A.    No, sir, the
        first d r a f t C e r t i f i c a t e did not i n clude these s c h e d u l e s as
        such b e c a u s e they w e r e not g r o u n d s p e c i f i c at that time.
        This was the first a t t e m p t to make them gr o u n d specific.


 Q.        But as I u n d e r s t a n d it you had taken on board by then and
           you had a s k e d for i n - p u t on e v e r y t h i n g that ought to be

      this role is proper.ly r e c o g n i s e d .              A.      Sir, I think
        you h a ve got the l e t t e r s in the w r o n g order.-              496 is
      dat e d 30th M a r c h , 493 is d a t e d 13th April, _sir.

Q.     Yes,    I know.           A.       I am    sorry.

Q.     But you w e r e r i g h t l y s a y i n g that 496 was the letter w h i c h
       s o u g h t to deal w i th the P o l i c e c o ncern about the o m i s s i o n
       of the old P a r a g r a p h s 4, 5 and 6 .       A.   No, sir.

Q.     To p r e - e m p t   the P ol i c e c o n c e r n , if I put it that way.
       A.     It was        a first a t t e m p t to explain, sir, if I can
       put it that          way.

Q.     B e c a u s e you say in your s e c o n d p a r a g r a p h , "You will noti c e
       t here are no r e f e r e n c e s as such to the Police wit hi n the

 Q.    Yes, and thus the s i t u a t i o n e x i s t e d at the time                        of the

G. Mr. Bownes, may I ask you th is generally.               This was. of
   course, thrust upon you as a re sult of the abolition of the
   M e t r o p o l i t a n C o u ncil? - A. The function was transferred to the
   Council., yes, sir.                         -
                                                                             .   '•

Q. You, the Council,       and I am not refe rr in g to you personally at
   the m o m e n t ....

           MR. TOULSON:    I have the page your Lordship wanted.  I
     think you hav e in mind the letter at page 8 6 . 169 in the core
     b undle'and the se ntence at the top of page 170.

             LORD JUST I C E TAYLOR:    Thank you.    That is what i was
     l oo ki ng for.

             MR. COLLINS:           Mr. Bownes, you the city, haa no expertise
     at all in c o n n e c t i o n with s a f e t y at sports grounds betore this
     was thrust upo n you? - A. Tha t is wrong, in fact.              The
     Building S u r veyor of the C o u n c i l had been involved in the
     safety of sp orts grounds s i n c e its inception in 1979 as far as
     S h e ffield W e d n e s d a y went.

Q. What did that exten d to, th e Buil di ng Surveyor's
   r e s p o n s i b i l i t y ? - A. I t hink you have seen the schedule of
   r e s p o n s i b i l i t i e s that was put forward in the bundle somewhere.

G.   Let me put it this wav.     Y our Department had had no overall
     co ncern for safe ty ? - A. It had none at all. sir.

Q. And e f f e c t i v e l y you and you r De partment had to learn all about
  . it? - A. Yes, sir.

 Q. You were already c o n s i d e r a b l y stretched. You had a great deal
    to do in l i c ensing other m a t t e r s ? - A. It is certainly a busy
    Department, sir, but the re was, at least I perceived at the
    time, room to a ccommodate this function.

 Q. With ou t the need for any e x t r a staff or any extra assistance?
    - A. That was my feeling, yes.

 u. And you d e p e n d e d real ly u p o n the advice of others, namely, the
    Fire* the Pol ic e and your ow n Building Department, together
    with some input from the C o n s u m e r Health side? - A. Yes, sir.
    A li censing a u thority g e n e r a l l y speaking does not have
    e x p e r t i s e itself wit hi n its own or ga nisation to deal with all
    matters.          For example, public en tertainments licensing., it
    relies on ad vice from others, the professionals, the Fire
    Service.

 ij_ D i d ir occ ur to you at any sta ge that it might be desirable to
     instruct som eo ne like Dr. Eastwood, that is to say an
     in de pendent engineer, to hav e a look and advise the Council
     spe c i f i c a l l y on the saf et y of sports grounds? - A. I think it
     is right to say the Co uncil has its own engineers.

 Q. All right.  Did you put your own engineers on to the problem?
    - A. I~think that is r e f erred to in the Building Surveyor's
                                             92

                                                                 D. BOWNES


        m e m o r a n d u m and my m e m o r a n d u m to him.

Q. Did you s p e c i f i c a l l y think of brief in g your in-house engineers
   or any on e to go and take an inde pe nd en t appraisal of the
   sports gro un ds w hich you w e r e then being put in charge of? -
   A. It could not really be an inde pe nd en t appraisal if it was
   don e by in -house surveyors, sir, who had probably been
   involved before.

G.       All right.        Did it oc cur to you to put anyone....

0.LORD JUS TI CE TAYLOR:            It would be independent of zhe
    club, who se fi nancial in terest was to manage it? - A. Yes, but
    the same e n gineers who had been d oing it were independent of
    the club, the Co un cil's own engineers, and they had been doing
    it sin ce 1979.

q   .          m r . COLLINS:        So       you took  the view that if.there was
        an y thing w hich needed to be dea lt with it should have been
        spo tt ed by the C o u n c i l ’s e n gineers in any event who had been
        dealing wit h it since 1979? - A. If it was a matter within
        their p a rticular skill, yes, sir.

Q.   But did it not occur to you that it might be desir ab le to have
     som eo ne take an i ndependent look, and by independent, I mean
 - independent of those who had been dea li ng with it hitherto? -
 . - A. No ,-~sir-it did .not.. '         .. -■ ....... - -- - — .......

Q.       It did not occur to you that that might be desirable? - A. The
         thoug ht had not occur re d to me, sir, to be perfectly honest
        •with you.

Q. May I fina l l y go to the point I hope I anticipate may have
   been in my Lord's mind whe n refe rr in g to the letter of Dr.
   Ea stwood at page 169-170 of our bundle.      The reason I have not
   referre d to it is it was be f o r e you time, but nonetheless it
   would have been on the files and you would have read it.       You
   would have been able to read it had you wished? - A. Yes, sir.
   I think that is a fair comment.

G. How much did you act ua ll y read these old files? - A. I was
   handed some S files altogether, relat in g to Sheffield United
   and Shef fi el d Wednesday.        I think we have to remember it is
   not only Sheff ie ld W e d n e s d a y we are de aling with here. What        I
   did was try to get a flavo ur from those in as much de-call as                I
   r e asonably could in the time allowed.

 G.      I think one could make the point if you had read these files
         and come across, for example, this letter, you wcuid have
         appre ciated that there wou ld be or was a possible effect upon
         sp ectator capacity when you removed barriers or put up fences?
         - A. Two points I would like to make there, sir.      One is on
         taking over the li ce nsing func ti on I think the City Council
         had reason to ac cept that the grounds were reasonably safe and
         all relev a n t factors had been dealt with by that stage.   The
         other point is I am not sur e that for somebody like myself who
         did not know an awful lot about sports grounds, which I think
                                           93


                                                                           D- BOMNES


         is the tru th and not hi ng less than the truth, that I would
         have pick ed up on re ading tha t what it actua ll y meant, to be
         honest.

Q.                -LORD JU STICE TAYLOR:                I am not blaming you for not
         k no wi ng about sports g r o u n d s , but it does seem a very
         u n s a t i s f a c t o r y situation,       d oes not it, that- responsibility for
         licen si ng            a spo rt s gr ound is giv en to a local authority whose
         office r in c h a r g e of it re a l l y knows nothing about the subject
         at all? -              A. No, sir.       If you like in respect of other
         l i censing            matt e r s I d o n ’t k now in detail what the professional
         aspects of the m are.                My job is to ad minister and co-ordinate
         really, es se ntially, and to enable the ap propriate
         p r o f essionals to have their input at the ap pr opriate stage.

Q. So mebody has to make the d e c i s i o n ? - A.                 Yes,    based on advice.

Q. You thought yo u were d e l e g a t e d that power? - A. Yes. the
   d e c i s i o n is mad e based on the advic e of the appropriate
   specialist, sir.

q             MR. COLLINS:      If you d o n ' t know what to ask them to look
         for you are not ne c e s s a r i l y g oing to get the right advice, are
         you? - A. W ith this le tter I imagine it would have been
         circulated to all the i n t e r e s t e d parties, and i am sure if
^        f     s   ^   -   E   -   f   c        c   e   y   .   a     .      PPmiu,en;t   -                  srr-

G.       Is what you are rea ll y s a y i n g this, the work in g* pa rt y which
         became the ad visory gro up pas se d all these things and seemed
         to think all was well, and the r e f o r e there was not any need
         for an y o n e to worry, so far as the city was concerned? - A.
         No, sir, that is not right.             In relatio n to - I think what you
         are saying e f f e c t i v e l y is t hat the Council did not take any
         action at all when it got th e safe ty cert if ic at e function.

    Q.    It left it to the .working p arty and to the advisory group, did
          not it? - A. To some extent it should leave matters which deal
          with professional judgment to the professionals and to obtain
          advice on it.      The Counc il did not, however - there are
          examples on the file in r e l a t i o n to another sports ground in
          the city, w h e r e things w e r e not all right and which were dealt
          with ver y promptly, sir.

    Q.       Becaus e you w ere told that by the relevant advisory group or
             working party p r o f e s s i o n a l s ? - A. The appropriate
             profes s i o n a l s at the time, sir, yes.

    Q.       There was no in de pendent a p p raisal by the-Council as such.   It
             simp ly assumed, rig ht ly or wrongly, the working party had got
             it right hitherto, and t h e r e was no cause for concern? - A.
             That the C o u n t y Counc il had got it right, yes.  I think i\ had
             to assum e that.

    Q. Alth ou gh it was appa re nt or o b v iously able to be made apparent
       from a curs o r y e x a m i n a t i o n of the file that certain things had
       nor been p r o perly do ne in u p d a t i n g the safety certificate, in
       certa in res p e c t s ? - A. I d o n ’t think that would have corr.e \

                                                                  D. BOWNES


     from a curs o r y ex a m i n a t i o n of the file.   sir.

Q. And you kne w you did not do it right in relat io n to the
   incr ea se in the Kop? - A . 1 c e r t a i n l y know now, sir.

Q. You did not ap pr eciate the n? - A.           I did nor appre ci at e that,
   sir.

Q.   Very well,    Mr.    Bownes,   that is all I would wis h to ask.

                         Cross-Examined    by MR.   HYTNER:

Q.   I wou ld like to see how far you regar de d the Council's duties
     in these matters, Mr. Bownes.         If in January 1939. at a time
     when S h effield United did no t have a sa fety certi fi ca te you
     had known they had been invi t e d by the Football Association to
     co nsider having a S emi-Final pla ye d at their ground, j-jouid you
     have ta ken any action?    W o u l d it have conce rn ed you? - A. I
     would imag in e what wou ld hav e happe ne d in those circumstances
     is that the Police, who are cl osely involved in these matters,
     would hav e raise d the iss ue then and appr op ri at e action would
     no doub t ha ve followed.

Q. Would the Pol ic e have kno wn that Sheff ie ld United did not have
   a c e r t i ficate? - A. Yes, the y know perf ec tl y well, sir. 1


Q. Say for example, not being we u nderstand a great devot ee of
   football, you had not watc h e d the fixture list and you had
   been on leave in April, you would have depe nd ed on the Police
   to have st opped a Semi - F i n a l be ing played at Bramall Lane in
   A pr il ? - A. Sir, I canno t c o n c e i v e of a Se mi-Final being
   playe d at Br amall Lane w i t h o u t there being a great deal of
   p u blicity and invo lv em en t of the advis or y group, sir.

Q. Would it surpr i s e you in fact that the FA had asked Sheffield
   United to cons id er ha ving a S e mi-Final at Bramall Lane in
   April 1989? - A. I have no views on it, sir.

Q.    None at all?       - A. None at all, sir.

0.    Can I now go back to your tak e over.            We are all, I hope,
     suitably cons ci ou s of the fact that this is orig in al ly the
     re s p o n s i b i l i t y of another authority, and the matte r had
     been in their hands for v ery m any years until you took
     over, but you did, of course, ap pr eciate that you were
     taking on a resp o n s i b i l i t y ? - A. Yes, sir.

Q.   You understood, did not you, that whereas there was an
     advisory gui de from the Go vernment, there was no compulsion on
     a club to follow the advice giv en in the Gre en Gu ide? - a . Or
     on the authority, sir, that is q uite right.

Q. Or on the authority.             This was ad vice only.         Is that right? -
   A. Yes, sir.

Q.   But you knew that once the re was a cond it io n in a ce rt ificate

                                    the c o n d i t i o n ? - A. Yes, sir, if a club had breached a .
                                    con d i t i o n then there wer e c r i minal penalties.

                          Q. When you read the Gre en G u i d e did not it become obvious that
                             some of the reco m m e n d a t i o n s we re som ew ha t more strict than
                             othe r s ?        In other words, som e wer e no open-to interpretation

                   B         plain, strong a d v i c e , w h i l s t others mi ght have been open to
                             i n t e r p r e t a t i o n ? - A. Per ha ps you can give me an example, sir.

                          Q. Yes, I wi ll come to the on e I am going to give you.
                             S t e w a r d i n s : have you got a cop y of the Green Gui de ? Cnapter

                                    judgment comes in in how m a n y stewards you provide.         .

                                     Certainly.  That is int er pr et at io n,        application,      common sense.
                                     - A. Yes, sir.

                                            LORD JUSTICE TAYLOR:             And what you call overcrowding.

                                            MR.   HYTNER:     Yes:

                           Q.        But the need to take some ac t i o n is clearly imperative,                  is not
                                     it? - A. In what sense?   I am afr ai d I have lost you.

                           Q. The G r e e n G uide makes it c lear that there must be some action
                              taken by stewards to do t hose thin gs ? - A. Yes, sir. indeed.

                           Q.        When you read the G reen G u i d e and then you read the conditions
                                     in the 1979 certificate, di d not you find it rather odd that
                                     the duties of the stewards did not appear to include these
                                     things at all? - A. As I re c a l l from the cert if ic at e they
                                     include control and d i r e c t i o n of spectators.

                           Q.        In and out of the ground.              W ould you like to look?         It is in

     Did you thi nk that that was cl early laying a duty on the club
     to di r e c t stew ar ds to assist in pre ve nt in g overcrowding in the
     sections'? - A . I would hav e said the word "u s i n g ” implied
     that, sir.

0.   I don 't s u p p o s e you can say what was clear to the club.      it
     was your view, was it, r e a d i n g that certificate, that it would
     have been a breac h of the c o nditions of the certificate for
     the clu b not to have s t e w a r d s di recting the dispe rs al of

     A. I think that is a q u e s t i o n of cases, if I might say so.

      what the club says.

                          Cross-Examined         by MR.   JACKSON:

Q.    Mr. Collins has taken you t h r o u g h and you quite frankly admit
      that by 1989 you wer e not a ware of the importance of the
      changes in the pen ni ng sy s t e m on the Leppings Lane end;     you
      were not aware of any d i s c u s s i o n about the need for the
      alter a t i o n to the safety certificate.      Can we take the
      position as you say it was, that you thought everything
      depended on the figures g i v e n in 1979?       Would you turn to page
      105 of your bundle.       Ther e we see Sched ul e 2, paragraph 3:

             "The number of spec t a t o r s admitted to the stadium and to
             the severa l areas of spe c t a t o r ac co mm odation within the
             stad i u m shall not e x c e e d the figures specified in Part 1
             of S c h e d u l e 3".

      Clear, no quest i o n of opinion,            professional advice or the
      like? - A. Yes. sir.

 Q. Turn to page          ....    - A.    Page   112,   sir?

        Now we turn as you s u g g e s t e d we might to the safety
        c e r t i f i c a t e as it ac tually was. - A. And still is, sir.

Q.      Regrettably, yes.  W here do we find the figure of 10,100'? - A.
        That will be the total of w e s t terra ce and north-west terrace,
        I believe, sir.

Q.      In other words,        we d o n ’t? - A.      It is not stated th ere as
        1 0 ,1 0 0 .

Q.      In fact, q u i t e the reverse. It is spe ci fi ca ll y stated and
        always has been as two separate, completely separ at e areas,
        7,200 and 2,9 00 ? - A. That is q uite right, sir, yes.

Q.      Would you tell me whet h e r it became apparent to you, never
        mind w h e t h e r the pens m e a n t fur th er alterations, whether
        anyone had eve r ap plied t heir minds to the fact that the 1983

        c omp ly wit h the saf et y c e r t i f i c a t e ? - A.   I am sorry, would you
        re peat the question, plea se ?

Q.       Forget all about pens 3 and 4.             Did it ever occur to you that
        ■the 1988 S emi-Final had bee n run in conditions that meant the
         club could not co mply with the conditions of the safety
         c e r t i f i c a t e ? - A. No, sir, it did not.

Q.       If we w ere to look at the 1989 Semi-Final we would again see
         that the way in which the tu rn stiles were used meant that the
         safety c e r t i f i c a t e as it was co uld not be complied with? - A.
         I am sorry, wha t was the q u e s t i o n ?

Q. Would you look at the plan produ c e d yeste rd ay by my learned
   friend, Mr. Glasgow.     My cop y is the pe nu ltimate document in
   Dr. Ea st wood's bundle.   208 in Dr. Eastwood's bundle. - A.
   Sir, what you are saying is that the al location of the
   tur nstiles was such that t h e s e capacities could not have been
   split?

Q.   Yes,   indeed. - A. I was not aware of that, sir, no.
Q. You now know that the layout of the turnstiles meant that
   the areas . of 7,200 and 2,900 were just lumped together?
 - -A.Yes, sir, it appears that way.
Q. But it would have been apparent to you if you checked the
   figures for 1988? - A. I am sorry. What would have been
   apparent?
Q. They were lumped together. - A. Yes, sir.
0. What action did you take? - A. None, sir, on that.
Q.W’ny not? - A. As far as the allocation of turnstiles is
    concerned, sir, that is a natter of operation ....
0.. Forgive me, I do not want to interrupt you, but I am
    not concerned with the allocation of turnstiles. Clearly
    that is a matter for others. But the effect of the
    allocation if it contravenes the safety certificate
    would be a matter for you? - A. Yes, sir.
Q.   What action   did you take? - A. None, sir.

     certificate   I would have "expected to have been advised’ ~
     about it.
0 . D o you mean the club would ring up and say by the way,
     we intend to breach the safety certificate. What are
     you going to do about it? - A. Not at all, sir.
Q.    What do you mean? - A. I would have expected advice either
     from the .Police or, indeed, from the club to say that we
     have this problem, can we deal with it, please, which is
     the view the club has taken in the past.
0. You are saying you are surprised to find the club did not
   ring up to say we are going to breach the requirements
   of our safety certificate on two .... - A. Ho, sir. I
   think what you have done there is twisted my words, if I
   may say so.
Q. Forgive me. I apologise. Are you really saying you
   expect the club to ring? - A. The club may have felt
   it an appropriate thing to do, sir, if they thought
   there was a difficulty with the safety certificate.
O.Did you check whether or not they were complying with the
   safety certificate? - A. In respect of this capacity, sir?

     you did not know about. I am merely res trie tin® mvself
     to things you did know about, 7,200 and 2,900. °What did
     you do about the attempts of the club to circumvent the
     restriction upon them? - A. I did not check that, sir.
           LORD JUSTICE TAYLOR:   Hr. Jackson, I do not quite
     knov; what you mean by attempts of the club to circumvent.
          MR. JACKSON: _It would appear, sir, from my under­
     standing of the position once the turnstiles A to G
     were to be used for the entire West terrace and North
     West terrace the requirements of the existing safety
     certificate could not be complied with.
          LORD JUSTICE TAYLOR:    Because vou could not 1 ini't
     2,900?
          MR. JACKSON:   I have forgotten all about the extra
     pens and whether or not they can be considered separate.
     I am merely suggesting when the plan to use A to G for
     the West terrace and the North West terrace the existing
     safety certificate could not be complied with and must
     have also not been complied with in 1988.


Q.        MR. JACKSON:   Did you in fact check at any time
     the attendance figures submitted by Sheffield Wednesday
     in respect of the 1988 .... - A. I have not, sir, no.
          LORD JUSTICE TAYLOR:   Well, it may have been complied
     with but if it was it was by chance is what you are saying?
          MR. TAYLOR:   You recall I asked the question of
     Mr. Evans, it could not be complied with because we
     know the turnstiles A to G were again used.
          THE WITNESS:   Sir, might I make the point that in
     fact if the Council was 'wanting - well, if" the Council
     decided positively to establish how many people were
     in a particular area, perhaps with the intention of
     proceeding against a club, it would have a very
     difficult task in doing so. I have been involved in
     prosecutions of places of public entertainment involving
     capacity and the only way of accurately establishing
     capacity is in fact to count people in and out. It is
     virtually impossible, I would have said, to do that in
     respect of football stadia especially where you are
     talking about these sort of figures.
0.        MR. JACKSON: I do not want to in any way seem to be
     rude to you, but do you really understand the layout of
     the turnstiles at the Leppings Lane end? - A. I believe I
     understand the layout, sir.

And the use of them in 1988 and 1989? - A. I confess I do
not quite understand that, no, sir.
      MR. JACKSON:      I have no further questions, thank vou
               Cross-examined by MR. MULLER :
Mr. Bownes, whatever your personal position may be or
what you regarded it to be in relation to the safety
certificate and the advisory group this much is
absolutely clear, is not it, that the licensing
authority.was of course the local authority, Sheffield
Metropolitan District Council. Right? - A. Yes, sir.
 And precisely how they carried out that function was a
matter for them? - A. Yes, sir.
And as far as the various members of the advisory group
were concerned, namely, the building surveyors, the
South Yorkshire County Fire-Service and the South
Yorkshire Police, their position is also absolutely
clear, is not it? They were there to advise? - A.
Yes, sir.
 And you took the view that they were, there purely as..
"Tdviso'rs’',-~not'" to^make''"cfecisions? '-"A. 'Yes^ sir, that
 i s r igh t .
  And the position is therefore this, is not it, that
. whatever advice they may or may not have given ultimately
  it was your function to make sure that a decision was
  made and whatever decision was made was made known to
  the club? - A. What sort of decisions are we talking
  about, sir?
 About anything that the advisory group were concerned
 with. - A. Yes, sir, if it was appropriate to do so.
 If advice is given there is no point in advice being
 given to you unless you do something about it? - A. Y e s .
 sir.
 And it was therefore your job, and surely you understood
 it to be so, to make sure that when you got the advice
 if it was unanimous advice no doubt you could recommend
 to whoever was going to make the ultimate decision to do
 precisely what had been advised. Right? - A. Yes, sir.
 I think it is useful to bring in the building surveyor's
 memoranda at this point of 2nd February where the matter
 was put to the advisory group and the Police representati-
 dealt with it there and then.
 The position ultimately at the end of the day is that
 it is your job, nobody else's job, to make sure that

                                 the decision of the local authority is passed on? - A.
                                 If it is appropriate to do so, sir, yes.
                                 And it is your job also to make sure there is a decision
                                 if necessary? - A. If it is necessary, yes, sir.

                            o.   I an obliged. And it was your job to co-ordinate the
                                 work of the advisory group?- A. Insofar as it needed
                    B            co-ordinating, yes, sir.

                            0 . If a meeting was wanted you were the one who had to
                                organise it? - A. Yes, sir.
                            Q.    If people wanted to know for their records or you wanted
                                 to know for your records what had happened at a particular
                                 meeting it was for you to make minutes? - A. Yes, sir.
                            Q. But as we know, and I do not want to dwell on it, there
                               were many occasions when you did not make any minutes for
                               publication, you did not circulate any minutes on many
                               occasions? -A. All the advisory group minutes have been
                               written     and circulated, sir.
                                            u d




                     D      Q.     I think there were many occasions when you - either you
                                  had private minutes which you did not circulate. I think
                                 '-you ~rra\f& il'rea'dy---';tolc---'Lor:d Jus tice-:-!aylor ? A. Yes, I •
                                  have said, sir, that I have made various notes of various
                                  meetings that took place, for example, in July of 1986.
                            0. And obviously it was desirable if you were going to have
                               minutes or to have any record of what happened at the
                               meeting to make that record as quickly as possible
                               so that action could be taken to save people getting
                               into difficulties? - A. That is right, sir. I can
                               bring forward three meetings that took place in July,
                               1986, which took place in a period of something under
                               14 days which did not permit, if you like, proper
                               writing up of those minutes in accordance with the
                               previous system ....
                            Q. Can I -iust ask you again, please, would you look at the core
                               bundle at page 418? It starts at page 417.That was a
                               document you put before the Local Authority. Is that
                               right? - A. It was a report to the General Purposes Panel,
                               si: ves .
                      ^     0. And you were making various - your concluded recommendations,
                      'Jr      is that right? - A. Well, sir, it was setting out a number
                               or items
                            Q. If you look on page 418 where you set out the areas of
                               responsibility. - A. Yes, si«r.
                             0. ilow, before that document actually went off there had bee;

some discussions with the advisory group, had there not?
You told us about one on the 10th of March, 1987, which
appears in the core bundle at 381 and there was another
one on the 16th of July, 1987, of which we have also seen
some minutes made by the Fire Service. Right? - A. In
relation to this report, sir?
In relation to the question of areas of responsibility.
There was discussion about that, was not there? - A.
Yes, sir, and I have explained subsequent correspondence
dealt fully with the matters raised.
L e t ’s not deal with subsequent correspondence. Let's
just deal with correspondence and the meetings prior to
that. - A. Yes.
What you put down there was the building surveyor was
to be responsible for all matters relating to the structure
of the stadium, including crush barriers, walls, etc? - A.
Yes, sir.
Of course the building surveyors were part of the Local
Authority? - A. Yes, sir.
So you realised they were the competent authority to
advise- on that natter? - A. .Yes, sir.                      -
Do.you recall that when these matters were being discussed
Mr. Grinshaw of the South Yorkshire County Fire Service,
told you that what you had written under the responsibilitie
for the Fire Service, namely, fire precautions, fire alarms,
means of escape, emergency lighting and stadium capacity,
placed the Fire Service in difficulties? - A. Sir, I think
I can perhaps answer this question fairly briefly. On the
17th of August, 1987, there was a letter to the Fire.
Service asking for their comments on this draft report, I
believe. I have got a note on my copy of that, sir, that
at 2 p.m. - I think I may have got the date of the letter
wrong, sir - I think it was 2 p.m. on the 17th of August
that Mr. Grimshaw rang up and said that O.K., they are
happy with the report but if there were problems in the
operation of the new system then they would come back and
tell me, sir.
Does not deal with the situation because there was a
 meeting on the 16th of July, 1987. Do you happen to
 have -any minutes of your own of that meeting? - A. I
 do have some handwritten notes on the file, sir, yes.
 Are they available? - A. They are, sir, I think, yes.
 12 ft possible to see them? - A. I think it is, sir, yes.
 While that is being sought can I perhaps put the situation
 to you? Did you appreciate that the Fire Service could not

                                                       D.   BOWNES


  deal with the question of capacities in their entirety?
  Did you appreciate that? - A. They saw the report, the
  draft report, and they approved it, sir. I mean I cannot
  be any clearer, I do not think.
Q. I am putting to you, you see, that what you have got set
   down there on page 41*8 .... - A      is what the Fire
   Service approved, sir.
Q. Yes. 3ut they approved it subject to pointing out to
   vou that the Fire Service could not deal with holding
   capacity because holding capacity was a matter for the
   structural people who would consider, as you have quite
   rightly indicated, for example2 the crush barrier? - A.
   Sir, I*have already said the'Fire Service approved that
   report and I have a note on the letter saying exactly
   that,.s i r .
        MR. MULLER.:  At an earlier stage when the Fire
   Service was giving evidence about this matter reference
   was made by Mr. Seaman to notes that he made on the
   original document which was sent by the local Council,
   indeed, by Mr. Bownes. I have now recovered that from
   the West Midlands Police and the annotations in relation
   to the very matter I am talking about will clearly be
   seen on that document. Sir, perhaps I could put that ...
          LORD JUSTICE TAYLOR:    Which document is it that ...
        MR. MULLER:  It is Exhibit 11 in the Fire Service
   bundle. It reproduces effectively what appears at page
   418.

        LORD JUSTICE TAYLOR:   Right. Well, you had better_
   put it to the witness as to whether that was what was sai
          MR. MULLER:   Sir, that is what I was proposing to
   do.

                                                               D.   BOWNES

W h a t was said in r e l a t i o n to the fire service, that they
c o u l d do s t a d i u m c a p a c i t y b a s e d on exit s ys t e m and that
as far as the b u i l d i n g s u r v e y o r s are c o n c e r n e d they should
all be c o n c e r n e d in c a p a c i t y b a s e d on area and c r ash
b a r r i e r s ? A. Sir, can I a s k you w h a t d o c u m e n t you are
r e a d i n g from?

I am r e a d i n g f r o m a d o c u m e n t w h i c h the fire s e r v i c e —      it
wa s sent by you and I can s h o w you the d o cument.                         It was
s e n t to the fire s e r v i c e and the fire service, when they
r e c e i v e d i t , m a d e n o t e s u p o n t h a t do c u m e n t . It was as a
r e s u l t of that the i n f o r m a t i o n c o n t a i n e d on that d o c u m e n t
was p a s s e d on to you. A. I h a v e no c o m m e n t on it.                 That
was the d o c u m e n t that I s e n t to the fire service.

W h a t I s u g g e s t h a p p e n e d is that m a y b e you, b e c a u s e you do
not k e e p a c c u r a t e r e c or d s , h a v e n o w no r e c o l l e c t i o n of
this h a p p e n i n g .     It may a l s o be —           and I do not n e c e s s a r i l y
c r i t i c i z e you for this —            t ha t b e c a u s e of your l a c k of
k n o w l e d g e in t h e s e m a t t e r s you did not u n d e r s t a n d what
they w e r e t a l k i n g about. A. No, Sir, I once a g a i n put to
you -- and I can p r o d u c e the l e t t e r now if it is of any
a s s i s t a n c e to you      —     that t h i s d r a f t re p o r t was s u b m i t t e d
in full, i n c l u d i n g the l i s t of r e s p o n s i b i l i t i e s , to the
fire service, the police, the b u i l d i n g surveyor, and H ea l t h
and C o n s u m e r S e r v i c e s ,    I h a v e a hand w r i t t e n note and I
a p o l o g i z e that it is not v e r y clear.                 It says on it:'
 "Ron G. 2 p.m. 1 7 t h A u g u s t , okay.                If p r o b l e m s w i t h op.
w i l l come back".           I take it t h a t m e a n s the o p e r a t i o n of
the s y s t e m , S i r .

•I fully u n d e r s t a n d that b u t w h a t h a p p e n e d , so that I can
 m a k e m y s e l f as c l ea r as I p o s s i b l y may, that b e f o r e that
 t h e r e had      been a s p e c i f i c m e e t i n g on the 16th July in
 w h i c h that m a t t e r w h i c h I h a v e just put to you had been
 discussed.           W h a t you w e r e s a y i n g at that m e e t i n g was that
 it is all a very b r o a d i n d i c a t i o n . You were tak i n g on board
 and i n d i c a t i n g that you u n d e r s t o o d what was b e ing said when
 the fire s e r v i c e i n d i c a t e d that they did not have the
 e x p e r t i s e to deal w i t h c r a s h b a r r i e r s . A. Sir, if the fire
 s e r v i c e had felt that in any way this re p o r t was m i s l e a d i n g
 or did not give a true r e f l e c t i o n of what they were saying
 I am q u ite sure they w o u l d h a v e said so in w r i t i n g .               The
 l e t t e r s p e c i f i c a l l y says: "As p r o m i s e d I now e n c l o s e for
 your a t t e n t i o n a c o py of the d r a f t re po r t w h i c h I have
 p r e p a r e d for the panel".

 Can I- a s k you this, s i nc e you w e re d e v i s i n g the s y s t e m and
 changing       the s y s t e m f ro m w h a t it o r i g i n a l l y had been, did

 Did you, as a r e s u l t of w h a t you had d i s c o v e r e d so far, think

                                A. T h i s I b e l i e v e is a s u m m a r y of m a t t e r s that were raised
                                by the i n d i v i d u a l e x p e r t s at this p a r t i c u l a r seminar.   I
                                do not t h i n k that it is a v e r b a t i m note by any means.

                                a report.

                           Q.   Of s o m e t h i n g     that     actually         was   said?       A.    It looks       like a
                      D         report.

                           Q.   When     was    that?      A.    I have       no   idea.

                           Q    Was    that     after      the B r a d f o r d     fir e ?    A.   I do not        know,    Sir.

                              1988.           I think it is also fair to p o int out that the

     was on 390.            This, of c o u r s e , was in the summer of 1987.
     You p r o v i d e d u n d e r P a r a g r a p h 10, as we see on 390, that

                           Q. No.   Mr. Bownes. what you ma y be able to help on is when that
                              was c o m m e n t e d on s p e c i f i c a l l y and fairly promptly by the Fire
                              Service they raised with yo u the query of how this was going
                              to be done.          Do you r e m ember that? - A. Yes, I think it is
                              fairly well stated in their letter.

                           Q.    It is noted in 390 as we ca n see, and if you want it more
                                 legibly you find it on 409.   On 409 they were replying on i3tn
                     B           August to that letter of 7th July, and they say in respect of
                                 section 1 0 (a) :

                                        "Whilst specified in the G reen G u i d e ” (which is right)
                                        "it is d i fficult to imag i n e how this task can be
                                        contr o l l e d by stewards. This matter should be considered
                                        further".

                                 - A.   Yes.   sir.

                           Q.    Does that refr e s h your m e m o r y ? - A.   Yes,   that is what was
                                 said.

                           Q.    Was it consi d e r e d further? - A. In the revised draft,          which
                                 perhaps we could have a look at ....
                      D    Q.    By all means.  You have to go well forward for the revised
                                 draft. - A. It is 500 or so.

                           Q.    499 is the relevant page.      We find it on 499 that your
                                 suggested solution to the p r o b l e m there raised is simply             to

                                        ’’Under the direction of the safety officer or chief
                                        steward or authorised officer, prevent o v e r c r o w d i n g " .

                                 - A. That was my understanding, sir, but I think the Fire
                                 Service have made a d ditional comments on that, but I can't
                                 recall what they are at the moment.

                           Q. Can you remember any d i s c u s s i o n about it after       it   had been
                              raised by the Fire Depart m e n t ? - A. No, sir.

                           Q.    S p e c i f i c a l l y as to how this was physically to be achieved at
                                 this ground? - A. No, sir, I c a n ’t recall any discussion.

                           Q.    Again, I wonder if it helps, w h e n you went to this wonderful
                                 seminar with everybody, i n c l u d i n g the West Yorkshire Police,
                                 did you notice the fact that it was a matter specifically
                                 raise'd by the Police at that seminar that the control of these
                                 pens was part of the policing p r o cedure at the ground?       Do you
                                 recall that or did that pass you by? - A. I am afraid that
                                 must have passed me by, sir.        I c a n ’t recall that.

                            Q.   If we look at page 4, and this is I appreciate a digest of
                                 what was said and not a report, you see the role of the Police
                                 is d i s c u s s e d in much the s a m e wa y as the role of the Fire
                       H         Brigade has been discussed w h i c h Mr.Muller was helping          us
                                 with? - A. Yes,          sir.

                          Q.   D o .you remem b e r the man from West Yorkshire telling everybody
                               about the wa y the Police ought to do it? - A. Vaguely, sir.       I
                               think my notes were the bits that I took real note of.

                          Q.   A s u m m a r y may help us.   We get it on page 4.   Perhaps it is
                               the q u i ckest way of doing it to save everybody time.       The role
                               is defi n e d under the three general headings, (b) being to
                     B         m a i ntain safe and orderly c r o w d upon arrival at the stadia and
                               to p r e s e r v e that condition t hroughout the game. - A. Yes, sir.

                          Q.   Then the point I wondered might have concerned you is under
                               the Safety of Sports Ground Act underneath.  If you go over
                               the page you see on page 5, "Normal policing m e t h o d s ” . - A.
                               Yes, sir.

                          0.   I take it no further if your recollection does not go this
                               far, Mr. B o w n e s , but do you remember that as part of normal
                               p o l icing meth ods the West Yor k s h i r e senior Officers were
                               talk i n g about the use of pens?       It is the second matter after
                                 Segregation :

                                    "The u s e of pens: as part of the normal policing we have
                                    the use of pens, i.e. small segregated enclosures for
                     D              supporters on the terraces greatly improves crowd
                                    control, etc".

                               I   w o n ’t w a s t e time by read i n g it through. We can read it for
                               ourselves. - A. Yes, I accept what is written there.

                          Q .,My q u e s t i o n is this.      You had raised the problem in the summer
                              of this year.         The Fire S e r v i c e had very sensibly come back
                              and said to you, "Yes, but how on earth are we going to do
                              it?".      You then go off to a semi n a r in all modesty to be
                              better informed about these problems, and lo and behold the
                              P olice Officer from the next County gets up and talks about
                              this specific problem.               I w o n dered if at least at that stage
                              did it ring a bell to you to say, "My goodness me, this is the
                              very problem we are talking about at Sheffield"? - A. Forgive
                              me, sir, I thought you wer e talk i n g about stewards to start
                              with.      I have mi s i n t e r p r e t e d what you say.

                          Q.   I am not trying to score points on that all, Mr. Bownes.                It
                               does not matter whose r e s p o n s i b i l i t y it was.  It so happens it
                               was d i s cussed as part of normal policing.            That is not the
                               point.     What I wanted you to remember was whether or not this
                               rang a bell with you as to whether or not we had got a problem
                               of pre c i s e l y this kind at Sheffield? - A. No, the question of
                               pens I must say passed me by.

                          Q.   Finally, Mr. Bownes, in fairness to you is it right to say
                               when you did circulate your draft to the members of the
                               work i n g party you were told by all of them - taklag them in
                               turn - by the Poli ce Force first, both in January and in
                               October, that they were ver y satisfied with the co-operation
                               of the club and the way in w hich it was dealing with its
                               problems? - A. Yes, sir, the Police have certainly said that,

                                 sir.

                           Q. And' that your own lead authority, the Environmental Health
                              Officer, had said p r e c i s e l y the same thing at 413. actually
                              sa y i n g he was impressed by the m anagement?      Would you like to
                              remind yourself of that?          I think it is 413 of the big bundle.
                              The last line that is relevant:          ”1 was noticeably impressed
                              with the level of ground m a n a g e m e n t being maintained"? - A.
                     B
                              Yes, sir.

                           Q. The q u e s t i o n simpl y for you, Mr. Bownes, having had your ideas
                              c irc u l a t e d and received the input from the members of the
                              w o r k i n g party,- did you think that there was anybody on that
                              work i n g party who was at all u n h a p p y at the way in which the
                              club had been behaving in r e l a t i o n to its safety functions? -
                              A. No. sir.

                           Q.       I am sorry, one very last matter.           the question of alterations
                                    being made.   I think you h a v e said you regarded alterations
                                    w hich would have required a var i a t i o n to the certificate to be
                                    put before the fully a u t h o r i s e d committee, the panel? - A.
                                    Yes, sir.

                      D    Q.        Matters of r e a r rangement w h i c h did not go to the root of the
                                    certif i c a t e you regarded as being fit for the working party? -
                                    A . Yes, sir.                                 >               ''

                           Q. Would it be fair to say from your own attendance at those
                               working party meet ings you w o u l d not have been surprised if
                               the c l u b ’s officers had acted on the request of working party
                             / o f f i c e r s to carry out minor works around the ground? - A. It
                               is a q u e s t i o n of what you mean by minor, sir.

                           Q.       Of course. - A. Painting, that sort of thing, I would not have
                                    thou ght there was any difficulty. Have you got a particular
                                    point in mind, sir?

                           Q.       I w o n d e r e d whether the r e a r r a n g e m e n t of the barrier was one
                                    that concerned you as being s o m e t h i n g that ought to have been
                                    taken furt her or whether your r e a ction as the time was that if
                                    that is raised by the w o r k i n g party it is not surprising it is
                                    acted upon? - A. This is 14'4, sir?

                           Q. Yes.        - A. Yes,    in respect of that barrier at that time.            Yes.

                            Q.           LORD JUSTICE TAYLOR:          What are you saying "Ye s ” to? - A.
                                    That it was a matt er that       I w ould expect the club to act o n .

                            Q. On what was said at the w o r k i n g party? - A. What was said at
                               that p a rticular insp ection in relation to that particular
                               barrier, sir-v;

     should think there were q u i t e a few of a routine maintenance
     nature, sir, yes.

Q . I won't press    it further.

Q.         LORD JUSTICE TAYLOR:            When the question of removing that
     barrier was d i s c u s s e d was t h e r e specific mention of the fact
     it would ne c e s s a r i l y reduce the number that could be
     accommodated in t h a t .pen? - A. I would honestly say I can't
     reca ll if any m e n t i o n was m a d e of that.

Q.   I think Dr.   Eastwo od has told us it did.

          MR. TOULSON:   He was saying it on the strength of the
     report he got from Strange,  of course. Sir, I will touch on
     that if I may in a moment.

                     Cross-Examined    by MR.   TOULSON:

Q. Mr. Bownes, I am sorry to com e back to the working party, but
   would you turn in your sta t e m e n t to page 5 paragraph 18. where
   you set out the back ground under the South Yorkshire regime:

           "The C o u n t y Coun cil set up an 'Officer Working Party
           (Sheffield District)' which consisted of
           r e p r e s e ntatives of the Fire Service, the .Police, the
           B uilding Authority (Sheffield City Council) and the
           South Yorkshire County Council Administration
           Department".

     /Rightly, you don't include t here the club or its engineers as
      members of the working party because they were not, were they?
      - A. No, sir.

Q.    They would be present by i n v i t a t i o n at the twice yearly
      inspection of the grou nd by members of the Officer Working
      Party when obv i o u s l y matters would be discussed? - A. Any
      comment on matters really before 1986 would be speculation on
      my p a r t ....

Q.    So be it. - A ........but it. is my u n d e rstanding that club
      representatives were present on i n s p e c t i o n s ,

0.    That is right, but not at other meetings of the officer
      work i n g party? - A. No, sir, some meetings were conducted
      without club r e p r e s e ntatives being present.

Q. Com i n g on to the change under your regime, your statement,
   page 14, p a ragraph 46, records or leads on to the description
   of how in the next par a g r a p h the advisory group came to be set
   up.       I don't want to go over what has been gone over before.
   E f f e c tively that was going to be the same group but under
   another name? - A. Yes, wit h some slight changes.

Q.    You were going to have on it, p a r agraph 49 page 15. the
      B u i l d i n g Survey. He had been on already? Correct? - A. Yes,
      sir.
                                                    D. BOMNES



Cou n t y Fire Service.   They had been on already.      - A. Yes,     sir.

Police:’   they had been on already? - A. Yes.

The Co u n t y Council could not be on any longer because they had
ceased to exist, and you w e r e in their place? -     A. Yes.

But before that change of      name - it was no more than that -
took place, w h i c h we see from your statement was September
1987, you had been in the      s a d d l e for 18 months? - A. Yes, sir.

And it was during that 18   months period that the inspection
had taken place in August whe n the removal of 144- was
a uthorised? - A. August, 1986, sir.

Exactly.   Do I under s t a n d it right that during that 18
m onths period you had been c o n t i n u i n g with the old
system, the officer work i n g party, but with yourself in
place of the now defunct C o u n t y Council? - A.
Effectively, yes, sir.

You told the Inquiry that you had your own engineer - when I
say "you", the City Council? - A. Yes, sir.

As indeed, had the.C o u n t y C o u n c i l .beforehand? - A. No, sir-.
The County Council used the C ity C o u n c i l ’s Building Surveyor.

I am so sorry.  At any rate, the hat may have changed but what
was beneath the hat remained the same? - A. Yes, sir.

He was in fact, Mr. Don Sheriff of the Building Department? -
A. I think Mr. Sheriff a t t e n d e d meetings, sir, yes.

And he is a q u a lified cha r t e r e d engineer? - A. I don't know
his qualifications, sir, but I am quite confident he is.

If he was not there there was someb o d y else standing in his
shoes? - A. Yes, I imagine so.

Under the old system, w ould you look in the core bundle page
27.    I expect you have seen it before.          To avoid people not
knowing what their r e s p e c t i v e responsibilities were there was
an a llocation of responsibilities, and if we look at
’’Terraces" on the left-hand side, "Structural" was a matter
p r imarily for the building a u t h o r i t y but with the Fire and
Polic_e to be consulted. - A. Is that the third one down, sir?
It is a poor copy.

It depends how you count, but do you see the word ’’T e r r a c e s ’’?
- A. "Egress from the ground", and it is below that?

Yes.  Over the page:  "Spacing of crush barriers;         strength of
crush barriers", both b u i l d i n g authority? - A. Yes. sir.

 "Estimation of safe ground c a p a c i t y ” , Council? - A.   Yes,   sir.

Q. After the new aut h o r i t y comes into power, page 413, "Building
   Surveyor;    all matters relat i n g to s t ructure of stadium
   i n cluding crush barriers, walls, etc".       - A. Yes, sir.

Q. So throughout, the l i censing aut h o r i t y had the benefit of its
   own i ndependent advice from the engineers in relation to
   matters of crush barriers and struct u r e s ? -=• A. Yes, sir, quite
   right.

Q. When we come to the 1981 radial fences we know as a matter of
  ' history that the impetus c a m e from the Police, the club
    agreed, the c l u b ’s engineers prepared drawings ana the matter
    went before the wor-k-ing party.             Turn please to page 153. Her e
    was the d e c i s i o n to int r o d u c e the radial barriers after
    discussion, and we see under (2);

          "Whilst there were dra w b a c k s ....     the working      parry felt
          increased control should result".

   May we look to see who were the people            who were taking that
   decision.       When we look dow n at the people present          there is
   nobody there from the club or its advisors, but you have got
   there re p r e s e n t e d each of the parties on the working party,
   in cluding the engineer, Mr. Sheriff, from the Building
   Depart m e n t ? - A. Yes, sir.

                            Q. And I an not going to duplicate the exercise for 1985.
                               Le t 1s come on n we nay, to the.1986 neeting, inspection
                               neeting, which was the first annual inspection'you
                               attended although you had been to the ground previously?
                                  A. Yes, sir,
                            Q. T u r n , please, to page 341 in the bundle. — A. Yes, I have
                               it, sir.
                      B
                            Q. I think you accept, Hr. Bownes, whether you had power
                               to do so or not you in fact authorised on behalf of the
                               Council the removal of that barrier? - A. Yes, sir.
                            Q. And, indeed, it was more than an authorisation, it was a
                               request, because it was not something the club were
                               asking to do, was it? -A. The Police raised the issue
                               and it was a matter of agreement really at the end of
                               the day.
                            o.   How, this document we have is a job list, is it not,
                                 prepared by Mr. Strange from Eastwoods noting the various
                                 things which the club was going
                                                              ' t o have to do after the
                                 raised inspection? - A. It looks like that, sir, yes
                       D
                            Q. Perhaps we can just glance d o w n . Do we get an indication
                               of the detail with which the group.had gone round the
                               ground by, for example, item 4, seat 3, row 8., in the
                               West Stand needs repairing? - A. Yes, sir.
                            0. This was no mere perfunctory glance. This was a detailed
                               inspection? - A. Well, sir, there are a number of points
                               raised.
                                 And so far as the radial removal - there were two radial -
                                 two fences, I am sorry, barriers, to be altered. We are
                                 not directly concerned with Mo. 1. That was in the
                                 corner of the ground. It was a question, you agreed, one
                                 piece of barrier should be taken out and replaced by
                                 another? - A. Yes, sir.
                            0. We are concerned directly with No 2 . You have told the
                               Inquiry that there was discussion - but you, do I under-
                               stand, do not recall any of the details of the reasons
                               why the Police wanted it out? - A. Regrettably, no, sir.
                            0     Do you recall this, that it was being put forward as
                                 natter of some urgency because it was now the 7th of
                                 August and the season was wgoing to start-with a home
                                 game against Ever ton who were, I thinl champions, and
                                                                                       /,
                                  that was going to coincide with the opening of Spion Kop?
                                                                                         7


                                  Does any of that ring a chord with you? - A. That would
                                  beyond my recollection, sir. I am sorry, sir
                            Q. Capacity, Dr. Eastwood has given evidence that Mr. Strange

                             reported back to him after this meeting when the Police
                             raised this he-had pointed out that this would result in
                             some calculated loss of capacity which obviously the club
                             were not-keen' to lose and that the view had been expressed
                             and that the view had been expressed, however, there was no
                             reason why that should be because the ground was going to
                             be made safer by this. Do you have any re'collection or
                             just no recollection? - A. I am sorry, sir, no.
               B
                        o.   H a y I just ask you a question ^or two about capacity?
                             When you had taken over this job and been presented with
                             your eight files one would no t have expected you to have
                             read every document with grea t care but obviously there
                             would have been certain docum ents you would have wanted
                             to look at, would not there?    A. Yes . sir, I tried to
                             O
                             o P t flavour of the files.
                        Q. Had you, for example, read Dr Eastwood's original report
                           back in 1979, survey report, page 36 in the bundle?
                           Would you care to look at it? - A. I-have it. sir.
                        0. Had you read that? - A. I really cannot recall at this
                           dis tance ...
                D
                        0. If you were trying to see your way into the matter that
                           might-have been-one of-the basic documents you looked at.
                           You have no recollection? - A. Quite possibly, sir, but
                           I do not recall reading that particular document.
                        0. You would no doubt have read the 1976 Guide and how
                           capacity was calculated? - A. I certainly read the 1976
                           G u id e , s i r , y e s .
                        Q. And how capacity was calculated because that was something
                           which you were going to be responsible for? - A. Yes. I
                           noted how the capacity was calculated but it is not - it
                           is a technical matter which I would have to take advice on.
                        Q. And no doubt did take advice from the engineers? - A. Where
                           it was appropriate to do so, sir, yes.
                        Q. It was appropriate to know how capacity wascalculated,  was
                           not it? - A. If a question had been raised on capacity.
                           yes, sir.

                        Q.        LORD JUSTICE TAYLOR:   I suppose one short cut
                             to all this would be when you took over from the
                             County to have a meeting of everybody that was involved,
                             including the club and its engineer, and say, " L o o k , we
                             have taken this over. We are responsible for the
                             certificate. Tell us if the situation at the moment is
                             satisactory. Have there been any changes or anything to
                             be done?"- A. Yes. Well, in fact, there was a meeting
                             involving the working party, if you like, in the middle

     of March where those points were in fact raised.
Q. And the club? - -A. Not including the club, sir, no.
Q. Almost inevitable, is not it. Dr. Eastwood would have
   said well, there have been considerable changes and
   it has altered capacity? - A. Yes, I think.in hindsight
   it would have been useful to have that discussion.
Q.        MR. TOULSON:   Just look, if you would, please,
     two pages here, page 56? -A. I have it, sir.
Q. Keep your finger in there if you w o ul d ,_please, and
   also go to page 117. I am just wondering about your
   comparison - between the figure' Dr. Eastwood originally
   suggested for standing on Spion Kop and the figure that
   had been certified. Dr. Eastwood had suggested that
   once the works had been done which were in fact then
   done they could certify for 16,000. In fact the
   Licensing Authority was more generous from the point
   of view of the club's revenues by certifying for 16,850?
   - A. That is evidently true from the file, sir, yes.
Q. So clearly that authority had exercised its independent
   mind when looking at the question of capacity? - A. Yes,
   sir.
0. At any rate, when you - you have said, I think, in your
   statement that on the occasion when the removal of 144
   was authorised the building authority were there and
  .represented and able to advise you? - A. Yes, sir.
Q. And they were the people who you understood you were
   going to be looking to for advice on calculations on
   capacity? - A. Yes, sir, as-far as the old revision of
   responsibilities was concerned, yes.
0. So either the question ofcapacity was discussed and the
   view concluded there was no need to alter the figure
   or the building authority did not raise it at all but
   you do not remember? - A. I am afraid I do not remember,
   sir.
Q. Now, finally, you produced today a bundle of correspondence
   starting with a letter of the 23rd October, 1986. I am not
   quite sure why the first letter was being introduced but
   it refers to previous correspondence and in case it has
   any materiality the position was this, was not it, you
   are there acknowledging a letter from Eastwoods of the
   15t’n of October in reply to a letter of the 9th October.
   I have copies of the letters there-but unfortunately we
   have just produced them. The position was this, was not
   it, on the 9th October you had written to_ the club saying
   that you did not seem to have any plans for the Spion Kop
                        126

  end although the building work was well underway and
  Eastwoods had replied saying that the plans had"in fact
  been deposited with the Council ten months earlier and
  also copies had been supplied to the^Fire Brigade and
  the building authority? - A. Yes, sir.    As I recall,
  what happened was the advisor - I forget which - had
  said they had not had copies of these plans and would
  I raise it with Eastwoods.
0. And in fact had then all along? - A. Yes. What had
   happened is that the normal system for submitting plans
   had not been followed. Sir, I wonder if I may make -
   I an sorry - a comment about the Spion Kop?
        LORD JUSTICE TAYLOR:    Yes, by all means.
        THE WITNESS:    Dr. Eastwood actually applied for a
   capacity of 22,000 or so, I think, nearly 23,000 I think
   it was, and the General Purposes Panel when it considered
   the application for the increase in capacity on the advice
   of the Council's various advisors reduced that to 21,000.
        MR. TOULSON:   Yes.
               Cross-examined by MR. WOODWARD:
0. Mr. Bownes, when you took over you made a point, I think
   you said, of looking at the Green Guide, the 1976 Green
   Guide? - A. Yes, sir.
0. And looking at the safety certificate? - A. Yes, sir.
0. Because you wanted to know what you were responsible for,
   what you would have to enforce and had to have a firm view
   about the meanings? - A. I certainly needed to familiarise
   myself with it.
Q. You could not do your job unless you knew what you meant
   or what you were taking - to be responsible for? - A. Yes,
   s ir.
0. Did there come a time when you looked at the 1986 Green
   Guide? - A. Y e s , sir.
Q. Did you notice the significant difference between the two
   concerning the emphasis and importance attached to the
   holder's responsibility and stewarding? - A. Yes, sir, I
   think the accompanying circular drew attention to part­
   icularly the section in relation to management respons­
   ibility, sir.
Q. Yes. If one compares the two, and we do not need to do
   it now, but it can be said, can it not, that there is
   barely any reference to stewarding and the organisation

                                of people at the ground but in the Green Guide of 1986
                                that is almost the primary emphasis? - A. Yes, sir.
                           Q. Yes. The 1976 one effectively concentrates on phvsical
                              methods, barriers and that sort of means of controlling
                              people's positions? - A. I believe so, sir, yes.

                           Q. Yes. Well, when you read -the 1986 Guide did you give your
                       B      mind at all to. whether or not the safety certificate was
                              appropriate and sufficient in the light of the new
                              guidance? - A. It did occur to me that amendments may be
                              reauired and it was an ongoing process, if you like
                              redrafting the safety certificate conditions.
                           0. Of course you will have looked at the safety certificate
                              and you will have seen what was said, perhaps with some
                              prescience, under paragraph 9, under condition 9, con­
                              cerning the responsibility of stewards.

                                       TRE WITNESS:   I have, it, sir.   Sorry. What was
                                the   Question?
                       D             MR. WOODWARD: You will have perhaps noted when you
                           Q-
                                looked at the position of stewards to see there that in
                                1979 the drafters of the certificate had had some thought
                                about it? - A. Yes, sir, I noticed that the condition was
                                there, sir, yes .
                           Q..And the only reference in the certificate to the ensuring
                              of safety by control and direction of the fans rests
                              insofar as it is dealt with in the certificate upon the
                              club and upon ihe stewards? There is the lacuna that
                              Mr. Glasgow pointed out in relation to the terrace.
                                     LORD JUSTICE TAYLOR: . Mi Woodward, we have been
                                over this umpteen times and I have reminded you three

                                read what the certificate says and the Green Guide.

                                W o u l d you h a v e a look, please, at d o c u m e n t 381 in the

                       g   Q.   P a g e 381.       It is a note of a m e e t i n g that had been insp i r e d
                                by the l e t t e r of the 18th F e b r u a r y , 1987, w h i c h we see begins
                                at page 374.          Th e note for the file, page 381, ref e r s to the

                                M r . B o w n e s , in so far as you r ec a l l it, a c c u r a t e l y what

                                S i r , to be h o n e s t .

                                Not a l i m i t a t i o n of that p a r t i c u l a r gate but so far as we
                                see it it says all gates.                 Are you able to c o m m e n t on w h e ther
                                the d i s c u s s i o n was w i d e r e a c h i n g or r e s t r i c t e d ? A. I really
                                c a n n o t say.

                       D   Q.   The l e t t e r    that     you w r o t e to the club we see at page 383,

                           Q.   At 'c' the r e " S ome points in the                l e t t e r have     now been f u rther

                                You can look t h r o u g h the d o c u m e n t s and e n d e a v o u r to see what
                                that means.  Do you have any r e c o l l e c t i o n of that m a t t e r at
                                all? A. No, I do not r e c a l l w h e r e that c o m m e n t came from.

                                W h e n you d r e w up the ar eas of r e s p o n s i b i l i t y         --   I am moving
                                on to a n o t h e r m a t t e r -- i d e n t i f y i n g the role        of   the police
                                in the a d v i s o r y area. A. Yes.

                                And the fire serv i c e, w o u l d it be rig h t to say that the
                                p r i m a r y c o n c e n t r a t i o n for c a p a c i t y was u p o n the fire s e r v i c e ' s

                                as one of t h eir r oles c a p a c i t y .

                                All oth e r m a t t e r s of s a f e t y w e r e s w ept up in the role of the
                                H e a l t h and C o n s u m e r ? A. No, I do not think that is quite ri g h t
                                The re p o r t does a c t u a l l y say that it is not an e x h a u s t i v e
                                list a n d it c a n n o t p o s s i b l y be.

                                T h a t is a c c e p t e d and it is not s u g g e s t e d that only one pe r s on
                                w o u l d h a ve a p a r t i c u l a r role and only his v o i c e w o u l d be
                                regarded.           W h e r e a s p e c t s of g e n e r a l s a f e t y and g e n e r a l
                                s a f e t y m a n a g e m e n t of the s t a d i u m are c o n t e m p l a t e d as being
                                a n y b o d y s r e s p o n s i b i l i t y , it is the role of the H e a l t h and

I am p a r a p h r a s i n g and not p e r h a p s p u t t i n g it as well, but

is the best way of going f o r w a r d ? Are there ‘any ma t t e r s

                                                      734018 - Mr. Webster
                                  SCHEDULE


Specific Comments


Para 4    - it should be stressed that each ground is different.

Para 5    - should the reference in the first line to Hillsborough in fact
             be a reference to Bradford?

            although the pitch can constitute a designated place of safety,
            for the purposes of the West Terrace this was not the escape
            route envisaged by the Fire Service. The exit route in an
            .emergency for this particular terrace {pens 3 and 4) was
            through the tunnel and the gates at.the back of the radial
            fencing. Alternative means of escape must be shown to a crowd
            by effective policing/stewarding on the spot. Any sign posting
            would by its very existence turn a temporary or alternative
            escape route into one which would be used by seme if not all
            the people in the crorai as a primary means of escape.

Para 5(b) - ’’each exit should wherever   possible have direct access to open
              air

             To suggest otherwise would be totally impractical in existing
             sports grounds.

Para 5(e) - The Inquiry has heard very detailed evidence with regard to the
            siting of emergency gates and the use of radios within grounds.
            Caution should be exercised in making specific reccmmendations
            without reference to the expert evidence available on each of
            these points. However, it should be noted:-

             (1)    There are other quick release devices to be considered
                    other than panic bolts or electronic switches.

             (2)    Provision of canmunication systems must be sensible and
                    supported by adequate training.

             (3)    The risk to stewards in "foreign” territory has been
                    brought to the attention of the Inquiry*

Para 6(a) - The issue of ticket games needs careful consideration. Where
            are the outlets to be for the sale of tickets? What happens to
            segregation? Is it really necessary for ordinary league
            matches?

             For "big" games which are expected to be a sell-out,, all
             tickets might be a good idea. Should there then be Police
             checking tickets a distance from the ground and turning those
             away without tickets? (This Police role may be a politically
             sensitive issue). There may then be the need for a
             "sterilisation" area for fans.
                                   2.



Para 6(b)     Responsibility for spectator safety should remain with the
              Club. The Local Authority would have grave reservations about
            > a Council Official being present on the day to enforce safety
              provisions. This seems to encourage the occupier to leave to
              the Council, responsibility for something which really should
              be done by the occupier.

             cf theatre licences and liquor licences etc.

Para 7(b)    Obviously, several authorities have additional expenses
             including Knowsley and the Police.

Para 7(d)    (1)   Same officers, in sate building control sections may, by
                   virtue of their particular experiences, be able to assist
                   in assessing crowd movement and dynamics, but it is
                   primarily the Pdlice and the Fire Brigade who have
                   expertise in these areas.

             (2)   Match day "spot checks" by all members of the advisory
                   group are a good idea. Anything more comprehensive than
                   this would be difficult to achieve in practice.

             (3)   A vital issue is the need to drastically review the
                   recommendations of the method of calculating the safe
                   ground capacities for terraced areas and viewing slopes
                   as outlined in the Heme Office Guide to Safety of Sports
                   Grounds. The term "peak viewing" area should be further
                   defined and given a maximum size and arrangements made
                   for a maximum number of persons based on 54 per lOm^ to
                   occupy that part of the facilities. All other areas
                   should be classified as requiring a substantially lower
                   density factor (possibly 40 per- lQm^) yet maintaining the
                   need for 6kn/m tests to be achieved on all crush
                   barriers. (This maximum calculation should be reduced,
                   as in the current guide, depending on the state of the
                   terrace or viewing slope.)

                   The figure of 54 per lOm^ is used throughout the terrace
                   and therefore must be an average figure. This average is
                   exceeded in peak viewing areas and therefore any safety
                   factors are reduced proportionately.

                   It is also important in the light of Hillsborough, not
                   just to calculate terrace capacities but also to ensure
                   that there is on the spot monitoring that the capacities
                   are not exceeded or at least to keep a close eye on the
                   crowd to ensure that they are not too tightly packed.

                   In self-contained terraces it might be possible to
                   monitor capacities by means of a turnstile. Where the
                   terrace is not self-contained and there is the
                   possibility of movement by fans in and out of the terrace
                   or to other parts of the terrace the only control
                   possible would seem to be effective supervision by Police
                   or stewards whose task is to ensure proper "packing" of
                   terraces.


                                                                                iJ
               (4)   The playing area is not always designated as a place of
                     safety. Adequate provision of exits and exit routes
                     should ensure that evacuation is achieved without
                     crushing.

General points which the AMA may wish to consider

1.    Annual certificates.

2.    Recovery of reasonable fees.

3.    Improvement/prohibition notice system.

4.    Clarification as to the status of the Guide - whether parts should be
       regulatory or in an Approved Code of Practice.

5.    Model conditions - N.B. Popplewell suggested at para 3.81 that the AMA
      draw up model conditions.

6.    Simplification and codification of legislation.

7.    National first aid guidelines.

8.    Pooling of information nationally - available to relevant authorities -
      for discussion etc.

9.    Role of the Health and Safety Executive.

10.   Safety management as a central aspect to the occupiers business.

11.   Safety planning by the occupier.

12.   More clarity regarding the relationship between the occupier and the
      relevant authorities and their respective roles and responsibilities.

13.   The Nimes fences need to be looked at very carefully. They can create
      different problems, e.g. all the fans on the pitch, fans falling
       forward, fence to act as a crush barrier, strength of gate catches,
      problems of using electronic catches.

14.   I.D. cards - patterns of attendance
                  - tsro turnstile systen - not rocm at most grounds
                  - additional policing required.

15.   There is a danger of the very specific problems at Hillsborough being
      used as a format for the future - the wider issues must be considered.

 Dear




 HILLSBOROUGH STADIUM DISASTER INQUIRY




 In response to your letter dated 23 May, inviting the Association to

 submit evidence to Lord Justice Taylor' Inquiry into the Hillsborough

. disaster, I attach a Memorandum of Evidence on the Association's

 behalf with an appendix, "Football Violence:      The Metropolitan

 Viewpoint".




 I have been asked to add that the Association has been giving

 consideration to the wider issues of peacetime emergency planning for

 some time now;       and to let the Inquiry have a copy of AMA document

  "Local Authorities and peacetime Emergency Planning:     A Review of

 Current Arrangements and Proposals for Improvement".      This document

 was adapted.by the Association following wide consultation within the

 AMA and with concerned outside bodies.       It sets out the results of a

  review which detected serious gaps in the present arrangements, and

  contains proposals which are designed to place peacetime emergency

  planning by local authorities on an aceptable footing. Unfortunately,

  its relevance has been highlighted by a number of peacetime disasters,

  and most recently by Hillsborough.
The Association would also like to submit a paper prepared by the Emergency

Planning Unit of Merseyside Fire and Civil Defence Authority which builds

on the document referred to above.   The Paper emphasises the need for

legislation t; establish a statutory general peacetime plan which would

require local authorities to draw up comprehensive emergency response

procedures. Tnese would involve co-ordination of local authority service -

including liaison with police and fire services - adequate 24 hour call-out

and stand-by systems for minor emergencies, and hazard appraisals which

would list all major risks in the area.   The AMA believes that

metropolitan districts and London boroughs - normally in the frontline when

it comes to coping with emergencies - should each have at least one

full-time peacetime emergency planning officer to complement those at

county level.   Their work would be backed up by the creation of an

Emergency Planning Inspectorate and an Advisory Committee on Emergency

Planning, whose role would be to investigate disasters, publish their

findings and provide training packages and models.




The Association is very willing to provide Lord Justice Taylor with

any further information that might be required during the course of

the Inquiry.
                      DRAFT MEMORANDUM. TO THE T.AYLOR INQUIRY




1.   The Association ;? Metropolitan Authorities represents the 36

Metropolitan District Councils, 31 London Boroughs, the City of London,

the Inner London Education Authority and the Joint Authorities responsible

for Police, the Fire Service and Public Transport in the Metropolitan

Areas. The Association's role is to promote and protect the interests of

its member authorities and the community they serve, to provide a forum

for member authorities to discuss and act collectively on matters of

common concern and to provide a service to member authorities, including

the dissemination of good practice.        The County of Merseyside includes the

districts of Knowsley, Liverpool, St. Helens, Sefton and Wirral where the

majority of the dead, the injured, their families, friends and neighbours

lived   The County of South Yorkshire includes the districts of Barnsley,

Doncaster, Rotherham and Sheffield.        The district councils appoint the

elected members to the Fire & Civil Defence Authorities and Police

Authorities.




2.   Since March 1983, the Association has maintained a Working Party on

Football, which is now called the Football Development Working Party.             In

1934, t'ne Association published "Football Violence : The Metropolitan

Viewpoint"   (copy appended) and the Association also gave evidence

before Mr Justice Popplewell in 1985.        The Association provides joint

secretariat services for Football's Family Forum which will also submit

evidence to the inquiry.




3.   The Association recognises that it would be possible for the Inquiry

‘to interpret narrowly-i-fes second term -of- -reference "to m a k e ....... - • , . .

 recommendations about the needs of crowd control and safety at sports
grounds".    The Association urges the Inquiry to adopt the broadest

approach because




(a)    "the needs of crowd control and (crowd) safety" go beyond issues of

       movement, density, policing and building materials into areas of

       public policy such as responsibility for organisational procedures,

       co-ordination ar.d liaison in the aftermath of disaster and medium to

       long-term commitments to victim support; and




(b)    "at sports grounds" interpreted narrowly would preclude the Inquiry

       from making recommendations on crowd control and safety at other large

       scale events such as pop concerts held elsewhere than in sports

       grounds.




A.    The Association recognises the necessity to balance the maintenance of

public order at large scale events with preserving the personal safety of

individual spectators.    While recognising the difficulties, faced by the

police and against the background of the police's commitment to maintain

public order and control during the causes celebres of the 1970s and 1980s

from Saltley Coke Depot through the "Winter of Discontent" and the inner

city disturbances to the miners' strike, the Association believes these

experiences may have bred an atmosphere in which order and control

considerations have predominantly flourished at the expense of

consciousness towards the safety of people as spectators.    The emphasis on

control and order detracts from a full awareness of public safety issues.




The Association also accepts that the operational considerations relating

to any sporting event are unique.    Not only is each football ground

different in terms of construction and environment, but crowd size and

demeanour are affected by many different factors such as the weather, the
*




importance of the natch, and the relationship between the clubs involved.

In these circumstances local knowledge is as crucial as any set of

centrally agreed guidelines.   Nevertheless, principles relating to the

growth of ccnmunity involvement in football set out in "Football Violence:

The Metropolitan Viewpoint" remain as valid today as they were in 1984

and the document was publicly endorsed by the then Minister for Sport,

Neil MacFarlane MP within weeks of publication.   The Association would ask

the Inquiry to give due weight to these principles in any recommendations

which it makes about the general context of the Hillsborough tragedy.




Furthermore the Association has long held, and will continue to take, the

view that any member of the public should have the same expectation of

safety at a public event whether this be an enclosed premises (such as a

theatre) in the-open air, (a pop concert for example) or a sporting

stadiun (football, cricket or rugby eg.).




5.    With specific regard to the circumstances at Hillsborough, the

Association's position is quite clear and was stated to Mr Justice

Popplewell.    At any football match, the playing surface constitutes a

major place of safety for spectators in the event of an emergency.     Whilst

recognising the need to maintain public order, the Association said that:




(a)    there should be a choice of alternative means of escape from a stand

       which would provide so far as is reasonably practicable, for spectators

       to turn their back on the source of the fire or other problem and

       travel to a place of safety;




(b)    each exit should have direct access to open air and should be

       separated from other exits to avoid funnelling people into a congested

       area;
(c)   many seated stands are constructed so that people have to nove

      forwards and downwards in order to get out.       This means th2 t they may

      have to go towards the source of danger before reaching safety.           This

      is contrary to the interests of public safety, and the guidance

      document,   (Guide to Safety at Sports Grounds) should      be updated to

      limit the   forward travel distance where there is no alternative means

      of escape   at the rear of the stand;




(d)   the training and number of stewards at public events       requires

      scrutiny.   Most are casually employed.      Measures are necessary to

      ensure that their knowledge of the ground, its safety systems and the

      correct procedures are of the highest order because of the public

      responsibility which they carry;




(e) specific measures which should be taken in respect of enclosure fences

      include : the siting of emergency gates in fences at least at the           same

      frequency as gangways; such gates to be secured by panic bolts or

      electronic switches; such gates to be manned by sufficient stewards;

      stewards to be trained (see above); stewards to have independent

      communication with a central control point (this is now much easier

      with the development of radios and portable telephones or possibly a

      number of on-line call points fixed at strategic points).




      These points, which arose from     the Bradford fire disaster areequally

       applicable to the   Hillsborough tragecy.




6.    Since Hillsborough, the Association's secretariat has inspected the

anti-panic barrier now     installed at the municipal stadium in            Mines,in

-operation. at.a_match*.   .Although the. .sys.tem Jna£ only, recently      -been-.

introduced, it does appear to provide a means of maintaining public order
and safety at the same time. The Association would hope that the system

could be given ar. early trial in England to see if it is appropriate to

conditions at an appropriate ground.        The cost of installing a complete

system at an English ground would te shout £100,000.           Partial installation

on existing fencing is estimated at srour.d £40,000.          In addition, the

system at Nimes includes other features vrhich are worthy of consideration:




(a)     there is far less casual, pay on entry, admission for matches.

        Tickets are a constant feature even for the standing enclosures,

        this means that for major events the police can turn away spectators

        in vehicles who do not have tickets at some distance from the ground.




(b)'    public responsibility for the event rests on the promoter.          Stadium

        proprietors are under an obligation to act swiftly in the event of

        problems.   In addition, a designated official of the municipality is

        also present who has the power to direct the proprietor to act in

        the interests of public safety.




7.     At this stage in the acquisition and evolution of experience from the

recent spate of major disasters including Hillsborough, the Association

urges the Inquiry to build into its report and recommendations positive

and forward-looking views on a number of issues:




(a)    The powers, practices and systems of local authorities’ planning for

       major disasters and responses to them.       These are addressed in detail

       in two documents accompanying the covering letter^"Local Authorities

       and Peacetime Emergency Planning:       a Review of Current Arrangements

       and Proposals for Improvement"      (lioveober 1988) and an amended

       Version of the' AssociatiOrt’"s' final “submission "(June ■1989*) 'to'the* Home

       Office in an endeavour to influence the latter’s Review of Peacetime
      Disasters.




(b)   Counselling anc support for victims and carers/rescuers:       the

      Association f i m l y believes governmental initiative and commitment

      are necessary in two major areas.    First, there is a need for

      guidance and training packages to be promulgated to local authorities

      and District Health Authorities (the Association is represented on

      the Department of Health/CRUSE Working Party.      Secondly, long term

      victim and rescuer/carer support is expensive. The Association

      understands Liverpool City .Councl's additional commitment is around

      £2 million; and therefore urges the Inquiry to recommend prompt and

      full reimbursement by government to local authorities faced with the

      consequences of disaster among their people, families and

      communities.   The Association is aware that the Local Government and

      Housing Bill, clause 133 at Report stage, enables the Minister to

      codify the so called "Bellwin Rules" but is unconvinced that

      government has any commitment to meeting in full the financial costs

      of disaster.




(c)   Major disasters generate public appeals.       The law's complexities and

      inequities are well known from the experiences of recent disaster

      funds. The Assocition does not consider it necessary for every local

      authority to have a Disaster Appeal discretionary trust on the shelf,

      updated as experience and case law develop.      However, the danger of

      buying in the state of the art after the next disaster is that

      irrevocable decisions can be made early on.      The Association

      accordingly believes it would be sensible and prudent for government

      to issue guidelines on the establishment, administration and

• ' -termirtation~'Of*disaster-appeiaIs\; ....   '          "... —   .......      ■■
The Associaticn is aware that post -Popplewell, building control

departments ir. local authorities are moving by virtu e of their

responsibilities fcr safe structures and buildings into the area of

training stewards and assisting the police on crowd movement and

dynamics. Because these departments know hov; crowds behave in tight

spaces, before during anc after a major event (like a semi-final or a

Michael Jackscn concert), the Association considers this emerging

trend should oe encouraged by government and standard approaches

promulgated.   Equally, on site natch cay inspections by appropriate

officials frco building control and fire prevention should also be

encouraged.    A vital issue is the need drastically to review the

recommendations of the method of calculation of safe ground

capacities for terraced areas and viewing slopes as outlined in

Chapter 16 of the Home Office Guide to Safety of Sports Grounds.     The

"higher" figure of 54 persons per 10m2 for good terraced areas

(paragraph 222(a) leaves no safety margin.    High priority should be

given to researching and reassessing this guidance.    The figure of 54

persons per 10m2 can produce crowds with a very high packing density

which provides no factor of safety whatsoever.    It is suggested that

a factor of safety of at least 25% should be built into this figure

thus producing a new "higher" figure of 40 persons per 10m2.




Where the playing area is considered to be a safe place for

evacuation from stands, and there is a standing paddock or terrace

area between the stands and the playing area, the packing density for

this terraced area should not exceed the lower figure of 26 persons

per 10m2 to reduce the risk of crushing in the event of forward

evacuation fron the stands towards the playing area.




The incoming calls at Casualty Bureaux and hospital switcboards
     always cause the system to collapse.




     This is because the public telephone network does not have the

     capacity to absorb a huge and unanticipated increase in calls.     The

      Association recognises that the perfect answer is unobtainable but

      recommends the Inquiry to take evidence on forthcoming proposed

      improvements and assess their likely effectiveness.




8.   In conclusion, the Association believes that public safety and public

order can be exercised to a high degree of compatibility in football

stadiums provided that the principles set out above are applied to the

particular circumstances of each individual ground and each event.

Improved standards of construction and training should assist the control

of each match, but this will need funding.   The funding required could be

provided by using a small percentage of the duty currently collected by

the Treasury from football pools.   This is a small sum to pay for ensuring

public safety.




The Association will be pleased to present more detailed technical or other

arguments to the Inquiry as appropriate.

FINAL SUBMISSIONS SUBMITTED ON BEHALF OF

         SHEFFIELD CITY CDUNCIL




                     1
              FINAL SUBMISSIONS ON BEHALF OF SHEFFIELD CITY COUNCIL



What happened?



Why?



What went wrong?




          The viewpoint   of the City as certificating authority provides a

special perspective on these questions.        At best the factual investigation

appropriate to this Inquiry allows only a broad brash technique in the

assessment and interpretation of the facts.        So far as the City is

concerned the factual investigation involved produces a special difficulty

in that whilst the City, through the officers in the relevant departments,

has knowledge of matters concerning the certificating function since 1st

April 1986 the City has only imperfect knowledge of the relevant matters

prior thereto.     No canplaint is made on that account, but the cautionary

note has to be that there are areas of potential knowledge and information

which, as far as the City knows, have not been explored.        The purpose of

making this point is not to suggest that any conclusion Iwhich this Inquiry

may bone to is inevitably jeopardised by any lack of total information.

Sensible conclusions can be reached on the information available.          The

point that is made, though, is that, the City at this stage prefers to deal

with the "questions posed above in a broad manner.

        . The questions can be answered with what, it is hoped, is not
    /                            /'   •*
deceptive simplicity in the proposition that the essential problem here was

one where too many people were in a confined area so that there was

crushing of sane of them who did not escape in time to avoid death or

injury.    It is possible to add refinement to that proposition and to

                                           2
produce an increasingly complex version of it by overlays of detail.        The

City, though, proposes to make final submissions here by reference to the

essential problem as so described.     In essence the City seeks to deal with

the question whether any conduct cn the part ofthe certificating authority-

helped to create that problem.     The formulation of the problem    as set out

above gives rise to a series of issues:



(i)      Too many people
          Did the certificating authority contribute to any risk that there

might be too many people on the terrace?        This involves a consideration of

the certificating authority's conduct in respect of, inter alia,

(a)      crowd management outside and at theturnstiles;

(b)      limiting numbers of spectators within the grounds;

(c)      crowd management within the ground.



(ii)     Confined area

          Did the certificating authority, by permitting the development of

the pens, create sane dangerous area?                   ;



(iii) Crushing

         -Did the certificating authority create sane unnecessary risk of

crushing or take insufficient steps to guard against crushing?



(iv)      Inability to escape or avoid injury

         Did the certificating authority create or fail sufficiently to

minimise a risk that spectators might be unable, in the event of 'local

overcrowding or crushing occurring, to escape the injurious effects of it.

         There is a considerable measure of overlap between the issues which

arise.    That overlap reflects the reality that on the facts this tragedy

was the product of a canbination of various circumstances.
        The essential submission on behalf of the City in respect of the

conduct of the certificating authority is that this tragedy was not caused

by any wrongful act or emission on the part of the certificating authority.

It is conceded that there were shortcomings in the execution of the

administrative system but it is, nevertheless, contended that the system as

practised was sufficient to achieve reasonable safety.



PRELIMINARY MATTERS

        It is necessary to consider as a preliminary matter the scope and

nature of the statutory function and duty of the certificating authority.

The City is the local authority presently charged with the duty of

enforcing the provisions of the Safety of Sports Grounds Act 1975 as

amended and is of course the successor in title to the County, which was

the local authority that granted the general safety certificate for

Hillsborough Stadium.    The questions "what happened?      Why? What went

wrong?" so far as the certificating authority is-concerned need to be

considered in the context of the relevant legislation - the 1975 Act and

Regulations made under it.    The investigation involves the consideration of

whether or not any act or amission on the part' of the certificating

authority, either in granting the certificate in the terms in which it was

made or in enforcing the provisions of the Act' or relevant Regulations, was

a cause (and, if appropriate, a culpable cause) of this disaster.        A

material question for the later part of this Inquiry is of course whether

or not the machinery'of the certificate, or. of .enforcement.,of. the......

legislation (in particular by inspection) could be used so as to prevent or

help /to prevent any further such incident.     There is, though, an obvious

danger that the considerable wisdan which has been amassed by virtue of the

painstaking nature of this Inquiry may cause views to be formed of past

conduct which are'the product of hindsight.      Whilst clearly, or at least

hopefully, all parties have already learnt fran these disastrous events,
 and whilst the City can identify acts or emissions which will not be

 repeated, it is still a proper conclusion that at the relevant time when

 sane action was taken the decision was reasonable and proper having regard

 to what was then known.

             There are certain features of the relevant legislation that need to

be taken into account as relevant and important background circumstances so

 that the role of the certificating authority may be put into context,

namely:-

 (i)         "Qualified person"

            Before granting a general safety certificate to an applicant the

certifying authority's first duty arising under Section 3(1) of the 1975

Act is to determine whether the applicant is a person likely to be in a

position to prevent contravention of the terms and conditions of a

certificate, i.e. a "qualified person".       Clearly the certificating

authority must have in mind the terms and conditions referred to when

considering the question of whether the applicant is likely to be in a

position to prevent contravention.       When answering that question the

certificating authority would have to reply on reasonable grounds and they

would include, for example, in appropriate circumstances whether the

applicant has the personnel and means as well as the ability to organise

sane efficient system in order to prevent contravention.! In concluding

that-''-.the Clubs was such a qualified person the County did not abrogate its

statutory function and duty and, of course, did not create an insurer.         It

would be impracticable for any applicant to guarantee that contravention

would not;occur.

           .Hcwever, the conclusion in favour of an applicant that he is a
       /
qualified person helps to establish a perspective of the certificating

authority's duty in the following way.      In. issuing a certificate to the

Club, and in enforcing the Act subsequently, the certificating authority

are to be taken as having concluded that the Club was and remained likely
r
    to prevent contravention of the terms seen in the certificate.           The

    certificate is tailor-made to suit authority's requirements for that

    ground.        The Club was reasonably regarded as likely to he in a position to

    prevent contravention of its terms.        In deciding in favour of the Club that

    it was likely to be in a position to prevent contravention of the terms and

    conditions such a vote of confidence in the Club is a factor of sane

    significance.        Condescending to particulars, by way of example, the City

    refers to Paragraph 3 of Schedule 2:           "the number of spectators admitted to

    the Stadium and to the several areas of spectator acconmodation within the

    Stadium shall not exceed the figures specified in Part 1 of Schedule 3".

    Thus the certificating authority regarded the Club as likely to be in a

    position to prevent more than 7,200 spectators being admitted to the West

    Terrace.        If the Club (or any interested party) had felt at any stage that

    the Club could not prevent contravention of the term the Club (or any

    interested party) had-a statutory right of appeal in respect thereof.



    (ii)        -The Police and Fire Service

                Under. Section 3(3) of the Act the certificating authority has to

    consult other bodies about the terms and conditions to be included in the

    certificate.       The Police and the Fire Service were in fact consulted by the

    County.       The significance of this is that these were authorities with

    obvious expertise and knowledge of matters relevant to their respective

    disciplines . The Police would know about crowd control and matters of

    public order.       The Fire Service would make a material contribution about

    fire hazards and emergency evacuation procedures and so on.          Both

    organisations are entitled to enter.-the sports ground and make inspections
           */
    of the ground.

                Consulting such organisations is clearly sensible since the

    certificating authority is unlikely to have as much knowledge and expertise

    as the Police and Fire Service in relation to those matters mentioned

                                               6
f

    cujove.    The fact that the relevant terms and conditions have been subject

    matter of consultation and have been expressly or tacitly approved by the

    Police and Fire Service again does not involve any abrogation of the local

    authority's duty.     It is thought again a potent factor in leading to the

    conclusion that these terms and conditions were reasonably regarded by the

    County as sufficient to secure reasonable safety at this sports ground.

              Similarly, the regular involvement of the Police and the Fire

    Service in the Officer Working Parties/Advisory Group and the annual

    inspections and the consultation of appropriate officers on relevant

    matters is an important factor in deciding whether the certificating

    authority acted reasonably in the way in which it sought to enforce the

    provisions of the Act.

              In this context is is to be noted that both the Police and the Fire

    Service are each of them "an interested party" to whcm is granted by

    Section 5(3) of the 1975 Act the right of appeal to the Court against the

    inclusion of anything in or the onission of anything frcm a Safety

    Certificate or the refusal of the local authority\to amend or replace a

    Safety Certificate.     The fact that no appeal was ever made, or indeed ever

    threatened, is some indication that these authorities did not find fault

    with the terms of the Safety Certificate and that in turn would support the

    certificating authority in concluding reasonably that the Safety

    Certificate was and remained sufficient and appropriate to secure

    reasonably safety.



    (iii)     The encouragement towards a flexible approach
                •#

              Certificating authorities are given the following advice: ^

        / "Procedure regarding applications for general Safety Certificates

              ... in framing such conditions local authorities will no doubt wish

              to keep in mind the principles or guidelines set out in the Guide to

              Safety Sports Grounds.   In this connection local authorities are

                                            7
r-

            reminded that, as was pointed out in Paragraph 6 of the Annexed Hone

            Office Circular No. 150/1975, this non-statutory document is not a

            set of requirements to be rigidly applied regardless of individual

            circumstances.    The maximum flexibility should be maintained to take

            account of the different circumstances at individual grounds

            deriving frati differences in such matters as age, size and mode of

            construction.    In this regard, it should also be noted that the Act

            provides that the terms and conditions should be such as "necessary

            or expedient to secure reasonable safety" and it would be

            unreasonable, even if it were practicable, to seek the absolute

            safety of everyone attending the sports stadium."



            The words quoted cane fran Bane Office Circular No. 130/76 (page 6

     of Core). Their relevance, even today, is preserved by virtue of their

     repetition in Annex C to Hone Office Circular No. 7/1986 (Core at 307).

            This emphasis on "maximum flexibility" and the undesirability to

     slavish application of the Green Guide is important because it clearly has

     influenced a number of persons who had dealings with this football ground,

     for example-Doctor Eastwood and Mr. Lock.

            There are of course further references to flexibility.   On the 26th

     August 1976 the Fire Department of the Hone Office issued advice on

     amendments to the Green Guide and (page 14 of Core):

            "It is again emphasised that the recormendations made in the Guide

            to safety at sports grounds are essentially guidelines and should be

            applied to existing football grounds with the necessary degree of

            flexibility to take account of the particular circumstances at

        y   individual grounds. The aim of securing a reasonable degree of

            safety should be kept uppermost in mind; it would be unreasonable,

            even if it were practicable, to seek the absolute safety of everyone

            attending a ground".
           Such advice echoes of course what is found in the Green Guide
 itself:-

           (a)    In the 1976 Edition at Paragraph 1.4.:

                   "Deviations fran individual guidelines are possible without

                   necessarily detracting fran the overall safety of the

                   ground.    A flexible approach should be maintained to take

                   account of the particular circumstances at individual

                  grounds".

           (b)    1986 Edition Paragraph 6:

                   "Deviations fran individual guidelines are possible without

                  necessarily detracting fran the overall safety of the

                  ground. The variety of type, function and layout of sports

                  grounds means that .a flexible approach should be maintained

                  to take account of the particular circumstances at

                  individual grounds",

                  and Paragraph 8:

                  "It should be borne in mind that when using the Guide to

                  assess whether existing circumstances provide adequately for

                  the safety of spectators the criterion to be aimed for is

                  that of a reasonable degree of safety. 'It would be

                  unreasonable, even if it were practical, to seek the
                                                            1
                  absolute safety of everyone attending a ground"

    5l-           and again Paragraph 11:

                  "The principles referred to in Paragraphs 4-10 above should

                  be kept in mind by both ground management and, where

                  applicable, by the local authority when applying the Guide

                  to an individual ground.    The Guide is an aid to, not a
   /                              y.
                  substitute for, professional, judgment and carroon sense".

          This emphasis on flexibility is still part of current orthodoxy as

can be seen by reference to Mr. Bownes' experience when he attended a

                                         9
r


    Seminar in October 1987 (Transcript 29: 129G and following) and was told by

    the Herne Office speakers (as evidenced inter alia by his note) that "the

    whole concept of the legislation was related to "reasonable safety" bearing

    in mind that existing grounds could not realistically be re-built to modem

    standards; it is necessary to work with the existing structures and obtain

    the best result possible".   In the literature made available at that

    seminar is the following description of the Green Guide:

    "It must be emphasised that the document is a voluntary code which although

    intended to demonstrate standards of safety to be achieved is expected to

    be applied reasonably and with a degree of flexibility"

           There is a problem in according the Green Guide this kind of status.

    What is "flexibility" to one mind may be slapdash permissiveness to

    another.   Clearly emphasis on flexibility was and is well-intentioned but

    the effect is to produce a code that is not applied tightly and where

    non-canpliance can be justified as falling within the scope of scrne

    flexible discretion allowed to the relevant authority.    There is no

    suggestion that at any stage the certificating authority has sought to

    excuse itself fran taking action by sane contrived reference to the

    flexibility allowed under the Green Guide.   For the future perhaps the

    Inquiry would wish to consider recanmending that the approach of the Green

    Guide should move away frun that of "flexibility" to, for example, an

    approach of the following kind:-

           That the certificating authority, and where appropriate the Club

    itself, should always seek to establish whether there is sane reasonable

    cause why a relevant guideline is not canplied with,- and that in the
            •*'
    absence'of sane such reasonable cause emerging then compliance with the

    guideline should be achieved at insisted upon.   That, of course, was not

    the orthodox approach when this disaster occurred.

           The suggestion of flexibility is, after all, a curious approach to

    take with regard to the Green Guide whose very purpose is to provide

                                         10
..^asures for improving spectator safety. Admittedly the Green Guide does

not have the force of statutory regulations but whilst the references to

flexibility do not go so far as to emasculate the Green Guide they

certainly reduce the impact that the Guide makes.

       As a final reference to this aspect of flexibility it is noted that

the County's Officer Working Party considered the point.     On the 30th March

1979 (Core at page 65) the County's Officer Working Party was told that the

County Council had contacted the Heme Office but little information

additional to that contained in the various circulars was obtained.

Basically the Hone Office had said that any new work or reconstruction had

to be a standard not lower than set out in the Green Guide but "the maximum,

flexibility had to be maintained in the case of existing structures and

differences in such matters as age‘, size and mode of construction had to be

taken into account".     The advice was in accordance with what has always

been the approach taken but such an approach, whilst being far fran a

recipe for disaster, is likely to achieve less by way of reasonable safety

than is possible                                    c

(iv)   The practical implementation of the statutory function and duty

       What-a certificating authority in practice is able to achieve in

carrying out its certificating function and enforcement of the statutory

provisions must necessarily be influenced by the nature and quality of any

advice available to the authority and, indeed, the time and money available

for action.

       As to the former it is inevitable that the certificating authority

will rely on advice fran various quarters-as there are unlikely, to be .... ..

in-house-experts who can advise the certificating authority on all relevant

matters.     It is quite clear that the County relied on experts fran the

beginning.    Although the Fire Service was "in-house" the Police and the

Building Authority were not.


                                       11
       It is equally cls-.ar that the City relies on the experts who adv I-,e
and such was a ru-pea':.ed therre of Mr. Bcwnes' evidence. For ex.-tuple, with
regard to the removal of Earrier 144 in August 1986 Mr. Bownes said
(Transcript 29: 6IF) that he was relying there on the experts who were
present.     Again in connection with inspections Mr. Bcwnes said (Transcript
29: 70H and 71A) that as far as he was concerned he was not an expert but
he relied on the advice of experts who frequently gave advice on the
various matters relating to safety.
       Mr. Bcwnes' lack of expert knowledge on matters of safety is not, of
course, in any serise a disqualifying factor.    What qualified him to act as
co-ordinator of the experts available to him is his expertise in
administering a wide variety of licensing systems.
       The Act contemplates consultation with Police, Fire Service and

Building Authority. The Statutory Guidance, in accordance with which the
certificating authority has to act when carrying out its inspection,
contemplates the involvement of persons qualified for the purpose of
carrying out an inspection.    The reliance by thesCity on experts is,
therefore, the product of the legislation.
       On behalf of the City a general point is made here that there is no
reason to suppose other than that the persons available to give advice were
at all material times reasonably competent.     The abiding impression created
by the documentary evidence is that the certificating authority's work was
carried out conscientiously and, it is submitted, with reasonable care.
Specific examples of the conscientious approach can be given and in
particular reference may be made to the way in which the City made
endeavours to keep the Club abreast of safety requirements:
       (i)       In May 1985 (post Bradford) the County sent a press release
                 to the Club (documents attached to Statement of Mr. Bcwnes

                 at page 135-6).   This was followed up on 9th August 1985
                 (ibid - page 137 and Core at page 274) by specific advice as

                                       12
                    to evacuation procedures, stewarding, first aid and other

                    matters

            (ii)    On the 15th October 1987 the City drew attention to the

                    revised Green Guide and certain aspects of management

                    responsibility (Core at page 421).

           As to the question of time and money available for action by the

certificating authority, there have to be limits and this is recognised,

for example, by the Hctne Office in for example, Circular No. 72/987 (Core

at page 423) where it is suggested that the statutory inspections should

not result in significant resource implications but that in general

inspections are not expected to take more than about 2 man days per ground.

This point is made in the context of emphasising that the scope of

inspections together with associated report work are not intended to be as

detailed or extensive as that often required of the holder of the

Certificate.       (Even allowing for such limits the City always paid due

regard to the achievement of reasonable safety and accorded safety at

Hillsborough a high priority.) In fact it is town fran Mr. Bawnes'

evidence (Transcript 29: 70D) that an inspection took a day but since it

involved several experts clearly far more than 2 man days were taken up on

this matter .

           The availability of time is relevant of course to the suggestion of

delay in producing a replacement Safety Certificate and the City's answer
    •Viv

is given in detail at a later.stage of these Submissions.      The point can be

made though at this stage that it is hardly appropriate to expect a

certificating authority to take on additional staff to deal with its

statutory'-function and duty when the Hone Office view is that there should

not pe significant resource implication.

           Although the certificating authority is allowed to charge fees in

respect of dealing with applications for the issue or amendment of a

certificate (by virtue of the Safety at Sports Grounds Regulations 1976) no
ixpress provision was made in respect of fees for the on-going work of
enforcing the provisions of the Act and dealing with the inspections that
have to be carried out at least once a year.     This Inquiry may wish to
consider whether express provision should be made to allow a certificating
authority to make sane reasonable charge.
         Mr. Bcwnes was asked to consider a suggestion that on taking over as
certificating authority the City ought to have had a meeting of everybody
‘involved, including the Club and its engineer, in order to say in effect
"Look, we have taken this over. We are responsible for the certificate.
Tell us if the situation at the moment is satisfactory,     Have there been
any changes or anything to be done?"     (Transcript 29:124G).   Hex'/ever, in
considering hew far the City needed to go consideration has to be given to
the following matters :
(i)      The substitution of Mr. Bownes for Mr. Vaughan of the County was
         effectively the only immediate change that came about in the
         certificating function,   It was not a case of the City taking over
         scrne function which had not previously been administered (when a
         fresh start fran zero base would have been appropriate). It was not
         unreasonable for the City to proceed on the assumption that the
         existing system was one which had been operated in a reasonable

         manner.
(ii) _The letters sent out by Mr. Bcwnes to Dr. Eastwood of 23rd October
      iy 1986 (Core at 373A and B as copied to the Club), to the Chief Fire

         Officer on the 3rd November 1986 (Core at 373C) to the Chief
         Constable on the 13th November 1986 (Core 373D), and to the Building

        •Surveyor of the City on 3rd March 1987 (Core 380A) and finally to .
         the Club (Core at 383). certainly gave other parties the opportunity
         to indicate their views about what was to be done and of course, in
         the case of the Police, produce the encouraging reply that the
         ground met Police requirements under the 1975 Act (Core at 373E).
'I

            The approach taken by Mr. Bcwnes in this context is, it is
submitted, an appropriate and reasonable one.       There was no point in him
muscling in as the new certificating authority and making change for
change1s sake.. His approach was more gradual. He proceeded upon the
assumption that all parties were reasonably content with the system that he
was taking over (T29:52E) and he sensible supposed that the ground was
reasonably safe (T29:63D) and was not given cause to believe otherwise


RELEVANT ISSUES ARISING
First issue : Too Many People
(i)         Outside the turnstiles
            The fact that too many people were in Pens 3 and 4 was to a material
extent a consequence of there having been a very large crowd especially at
a late stage prior to kick-off outside the Leppings Lane turnstiles.
Paragraph 44 of the Green Guide indicates that turnstiles should be of such
numbers as to admit spectators at a rate whereby no unduly large crowds are
kept waiting for admission and yet at no faster rate than the arrangements
for distributing spectators within the ground permit-       This ground had a
total of 93 turnstiles. A capacity crowd could arithmetically be admitted
in a little over 45 minutes.
            Leppings Lane end terraces and the West Stand were capable of being
served by a total of 23 turnstiles which at an ingress rate of 750 per hour
      Vs.

would require a little over 50 minutes to bring about full capacity.
            The kind of event which involves a capacity crowd e.g. semi-final is
one where most members of the public would have an expectation of sane
        .*
delay in;gaining admission and where most people would make sane effort,
even/if not told do so, to arrive well before kick-off.      Frcm the
certificating authority’s point of view it is not unreasonable to have
concluded that the number of turnstiles was such as to provide a reasonable

rate of admission.       It is not the sort of matter that would spring to the
mind of the administrator.     Any such consideration would need to be
initiated by for example the Police or even the Club.     No doubt was ever
expressed to the certificating authority that the turnstiles were
inadequate or that there were any crowd problems outside the turnstiles.
        If there had been a problem brought to the attention of the
certificating authority then seme reaction might have been expected, either
by way of suggesting an alteration to the layout or by way of asking what
contingency plans Club management had made to deal with such a situation.
Unless the certificating authority was made aware of such a problem it is
not reasonable to expect any action to be commenced independently.       This is
not a case where to the certificating authority's knowledge the available
entrances at the ground had "proved insufficient to stop unduly large
crowds from gathering outside" which is the kind of circumstance envisaged
in Paragraph 46 of the Green Guide as necessitating the provision of a
contingency plan.
       The Certificate impinges upon this topic to sane modest extent.
                                                    \
Under condition 6(1) the holder has to agree with;the Chief Constable the
methods of admission to be employed;    under Condition 9 there have to be
stewards provided for the control and direction of spectators entering the
stadium;     under Condition 11(4) all means of ingress have to be maintained
free frcm obstruction;    under Condition 29 that the stadium shall be
maintained with the entrances and means of access to the entrances in the
number, size and position existing at the date of the Certificate and

indicated on the plans.
       It/would be wrong to ascribe the presence of any large or excessive
crowd _outside the turnstiles to any wrongful acrt or emission on the part of
the "City.




                                       16
 (ii)     Safety Certificate provision In respect of Crcfod Capacity

          The Safety Certificate provides under Condition 2 of Schedule 2 that

 "the number of spectators admitted to the stadium and to the several areas

of spectator accarmodation within the stadium shall not exceed the figures

specified in part 1 of Schedule 3".      Part 1 of Schedule 3, headed "Crowd

Capacity", indicates that the number of spectators admitted to the stadium

and to the various areas of spectator accomodation within the stadium

shall not exceed in the case of the West Stand 4,465, the West Terrace

7,200 and the North-West Terrace 2,900.

         These provisions have to be considered in the light of Section 2(2)

of the Safety of Sports Grounds Act 1975 in its then unamended form and

which provided that:-                ,

         "(2) Without prejudice to sub-secticn (1) above, a Safety

         Certificate -

         (a)     shall specify the maximum number of spectators to be

                 admitted to the stadium;
                                                    ‘V       ■ ■

        , (b)    may specify the maximum number to be admitted to different
                                                         »
                 parts of it ...;"

         It is clear that it was not obligatory to specify the maximum number

to be admitted to different parts of the stadium.

         Although Section 2(2) has been repealed the Hane Office advice: is

nevertheless that such terms should still be included in a Certificate~

         The capacities specified in the Safety Certificate are plainly

derived froti Dr. Eastwood's- report,, which was accepted by the County's, .

officer working party (page 60 of Core). Dr. Eastwood discounted the total

area on the West Terrace b y 10% to allcw for the absence of gangways.    He
    /     "                     y  '
then, applied the rate of 54 persons per 10 square metres as suggested in

Paragraph 15.4 of the 1976 Green Guide.     That 10% discount was presumably

in accordance with the suggestion that an appropriate reduction should be

made in the area available for standing when the positioning and width of
( {gangways did not meet the recaimendations at Paragraph 7.5.1 (every
  spectator to be within 12 metres of a gangway or an exit ). It was based
  upon professional judgment.
          The approach taken by Dr. Eastwood found favour with the officers of
  the officer working party.    It came from a man who was highly experienced
  in sports ground safety and for whan the question of safety was paramount
  (transcript 26:79F), who did not feel that he was acting solely for the
  Club and was conscious of the public interest (transcript 26-.79B) and who
 would have felt it his duty to report had he any reservations with regard
  to matters of safety (Transcript 26:86E).
          The approach has been challenged on the basis that Dr. Eastwood
 ought to have applied the more restrictive provisions of Paragraph 15.4.3
 of the 1976 Green Guide which applies "when the spacing of crush barriers
 does not conform to the guidelines...".      However, the reference to spacing
 is that set out in Paragraph 12, which deals with the maximum horizontal
 distance between barriers.     Dr. Nicholson's report at 2.5 indicates that in
 Pen 3 only one spacing does not conform and in Pen 4 only 2 spacings do not
 conform. On the other hand it may be said that the. spacings are much
 closer than they need to be which adds to the safety.     It is felt,
 therefore, that Dr. Eastwood was in no way unreasonably in adopting the
 method he did or in putting forward the figure which he did of 7,200.

      ■
  (iii) The Green Guide and Capacity
          It would be wrong to suppose that the Green Guide provides any hard
 and fast rule for dealing with the assessment of safe ground capacity.     At
 Paragraph'15.1 of the 1976 Green Guide what is described as "a method of
 calculating the number of people that can be safely acccmmodated" is set
 out. The 1986 Green Guide at Paragraph 217 adds that the paragraphs which

 formulate the suggested method of assessment "contain as of necessity


                                        18
' generalised guidelines in view of the wide variety of types, sizes,
 configurations of sports grounds, their use and general condition".
          Moreover, with regard to the packing density rates it is to be noted
 that these are put forward as being in the nature of "allowances" for the
 purposes of the calculation and whilst achievement of those allowances in
 practice ought to produce safety it does not follow that non-compliance
 produces danger,    In localised areas, where fans may well prefer to gather,
 higher rates of density are often achieved but without danger.
 Furthermore, reference m y be made here to the Fire Service photographs and

 the experiments carried out.
          It is to be noted, moreover, that in putting forward "a method" of
 calculating safe ground capacity Paragraph 220 (formerly (25.3) of the 1976
 Green Guide) deals with the number of people that can be safely
 accommodated "on a terrace".    There is no unequivocal suggestion in the
 Green Guide that a capacity needs to be estimated, for an area such as a
 pen.    If reference is made to Paragraph 101 of the 1986 Green Guide it is

 seen that a recommendation is made that a ground should be divided, into
 "sections" to prevent potentially hazardous migrations by spectators and
 "each section of the ground has its own limit of safety capacity".     There
 is at least a hint that Paragraph 101 contemplates a larger unit than a pen
 in its term "section" because it does provide "each section of the ground

 for example each end or side should be self-contained.. .."
        ■v Moreover, Paragraph 102 describes how each of the "major sections"

 should be sub-divided, by gangways and crush barriers.   Again in Paragraph
 103 railings, fences etc. "dividing sections of the ground" should be of

 the strength of crush barriers.    One might be forgiven for thinking then
 that'the Green Guide is not contemplating a pen when proposing that each
 section of the ground should have its own limit of safety capacity.

 Alternatively there is either a lacuna or an ambiguity here.


                                        19
(iv)    Revision of Capacity

        There is no evidence to show that the        County, through its Officer

Working Party, ever considered the question of holding capacity in 1981

when the radial fences were installed or 1985 when the layout of radial

fences was modified.    On the other hand it is not surprising that this is

so since no provision either in the Act or in the Green Guide or elsewhere

 (for example in any safety regulations which might have been issued)

expressly dealt with the need to calculate capacity for an area such as a

pen.

        There is, though, a further and practical reason why such a capacity

was unlikely ever to have been calculated asa holding capacity and that is

that the areas created in 1981 and 1985 were        not self-contained         areas with

the means of monitoring numbers at the point of entry.      The assessment of a

holding capacity would sensibly be understood to require assessment of the

number of spectators who would be held i.e. remain in an area during the

football game.   Since the spectators were free to move about frcm one pen

to another, and since no pen had the mechanical means for checking the

numbers entering it, provision of a holding capacity was quite meaningless.

        It might be said that a revised holding capacity should have been

calculated if only to reflect the access channel created between the two

runs of radial fences between pens 4 and 5 or, later, to reflect the
                                                            \
removal of barrier 144.    It is unlikely though that specific capacities for

pens 3 and 4 would have been produced for the^very''reason that any such

capacity, even if it could have been monitored, could not have been,

-enforced as -long as spectators-were-free-to~move-between-the.:.pens>-_— .—



(v) / Not a cause of what went wrong

        Even if Doctor Eastwood’s original^calculation was higher than it

should have been or even if the certified capacity for the West Terrace

should have been reduced or sub-divided into the canponent areas it is
submitted that the evidence does not establish that any revision of the
certificate to reflect these matters as for example by providing that the
maximum number to be admitted to pen 3 should not exceed say 800 was a
cause of what went wrong.   A sensible interpretation of these events is
that death and injury resulted fran the sudden influx of large numbers of
spectators once the gates were opened, and which were numbers so great that
overcrowding and crushing was ever likely to occur.


(vi)   Overcrowding
       Realistically the tragedy occurred because of localised areas of
overcrowding giving rise to intolerable crushing pressures. The
certificating authority's position here is that crcwd management within the
ground is essentially a management responsibility, and this is envisaged in
the Green Guide.   That is not to say thatthe certificate dees not touch

upon this aspect at all.    The emphasis atthe moment though is on"the
managerial responsibility which is envisaged for example in Chapter 13 of
the Green Guide:   "Effective stewarding should prevent overcrowding in
sections.of the ground, reduce the likelihood and incidence of disorder,
help disperse spectators in such a way as to reduce crowd pressure ...".
Again1at paragraph 195a a "basic" duty which a steward iscalled upon to
carry out includes that the duty ’to help achieve an even flew of people to
the viewing areas and safe dispersal of spectators on the Terraces or
viewin’
      g slopes' . By paragraph 197 stewards have to be fully capable of
carrying out the duties allocated to than. Again at paragraph 204 the
Green Guide specifies "As in other areas of safety,-management-is _ ....... .

responsible for the crowd control arrangements..

    / This responsibility is developed in chapters 5 (Ingress) and   8

(Tetraces and Viewing Slopes).   In particular chapter 8 describes hew

"arrangements should be made to encourage the even distribution of the

crowd on the terraces to provide ease of access and egress; to control and

                                      21
 facilitate movement, particularly if a local emergency should arise during
 the event; and to contain pressures before they reach dangerous
 proportions ...".


 (vii)   Provision in the Safety Certificate relating to crowd management
         The safety certificate provides quite apart from the limit of
 spectator capacity on the West Terrace some further specific terms that
 impinge upon this issue.    Under Condition 6(ii) the holder has to refuse
 admission to or evacuate spectators frcm any part of the stadium before or
 during a specified activity upon receiving instructions so to do frcm the
 Chief Constable (as defined). Under Condition 7 the holder has to arrange
 for the attendance of Police Officers "to secure the orderly and lawful
 behaviour of the spectators". Overcrowding in a particular area may well
 cause disorderly behaviour.   The Club and the Police would therefore have
 an interest in ensuring that there was no local overcrowding and that might
 if necessary be achieved by refusing admission to spectators to parts of

 the stadium.                                      <
         Again Condition 9 provides for the holder'to arrange for the
                                                       5
 attendance of safety stewards who are to carry out amongst other duties
 that of control and direction of spectators entering using or leaving the
 stadium.    It is true that the certificate provides expressly for the

 minimum number of safety stewards required and this minimum number does not
 include stewards specifically assigned to that duty on the West Terrace.

 On the other hand the safety certificate makes no provision for such
- stewards to be on the Spion Kop but the Club do provide stewards there.     It

 would be'.wrong to interpret the safety certificate as meaning that the

 minimum
    s    number of stewards was the- correct number for each and every
    /



 occasion.   The minimum number has to be provided for every specified
 activity and that presumably includes religious conventions, reserve
 matches and so on.   In practice sane football matches would plainly require

                                       22
more than the minimum number and this was recognised by the Club who
provided more than the minimum number on the occasion of this semi-final.
It is to be remembered that this is a general safety certificate and not a
special one for each game.   It makes general provision.
       The submission made on behalf of the City is that the general safety
certificate provided a sufficient framework within its conditions that
would have enabled the Club to fulfil its' responsibility of securing safe
crowd management.


(viii) Practical avoidance of overcrowding and crushing
       In practice in the past this was achieved by visual monitoring.      The
description of the methods used varies in the Police evidence but the
carman feature is that of reacting to any detection that the density of the
crowd unless further restricted would become excessive.    This has been
described variously as packing or filling the terraces.    It appears to be a
traditional methdd.   It was one used by Mr. Evans (transcript 26), new F.A.
                                                  'V
Official but who previously as a Police officer used to walk the terraces
observing and detecting and restricting further entry to any area if he
felt that the level of canfort was at risk.   It would be wrong to
categorise this method as that of reacting only to discomfort or danger. An

informed and competent observer alive to the risks of overcrowding and
crushing ought to be able to detect that the density is within tolerable
limits.

       All the more so should that be possible where the area under

scrutiny is relatively small as was the case with pens 3 and 4 which

measured ±n round terms 13m x 14m and where there were advantageous viewing

positions for the person carrying out the monitoring task (either frcra the

West Stand or frcm the perimeter track or at the rear of the terrace).

       Such visual monitoring would be a necessary part of any systan

because even with numbers in a particular area less than any reccrnmended

                                     23
capacity there still is the risk of local overcrowding and crushing.          It
would be folly for anyone to assume that a totaliser was a sufficient
precaution and of course reliance on it might be dangerously misleading.
Spectators go to popular areas and may prefer to be a close-knit group.
The vital requirement is to knew what conditions are like on the terraces
and there cannot be any substitution for careful visual monitoring.          That
is not an inefficient system if carried out by persons aware of the
potential risks.


(ix)           Lack of Knowledge by the City
               The City was never told that there was any risk of local
overcrowding or crushing.          Had there been any such risk that was known of
then it is likely that a member of the Advisory Group would have been aware
of it and that its existence would have been made known to the City . Had
the City become aware of any such problem then on Mr. Bowne’s evidence the

means was available for achieving safety and this could have included, if
necessary, a prohibition notice.
               It is therefore submitted that the City believed reasonably that the
Club with the assistance of the Police would be able to achieve the safe
dispersal of spectators on the terraces in a manner that would avoid local
overcrowding and crushing.          The City can reasonably be forgiven for not
having included any more specific provision as to the manner in which
          :v
terraces should be filled or as to the need to look out for and guard
against local overcrowding.          These are matters which are of a basic nature,

which do.not need spelling out and which could safely be left to those

involved in the match-day operations to achieve.
      /
      /

      /


(x)            Ingress
               Two aspects relating to ingress to the ground need to be considered:

Directional Signs and the Tunnel.
                                               24
(a)    Directional signs
       There is no provision in the Certificate with regard to signs.     The
1976 Green Guide made sane provision under Paragraph 6.6 in .recaxmending a
comprehensive system of signposting being such as would clearly indicate
routes to various parts of the ground.     Unfortunately this is in a part of
the Guide dealing with egress and it does not obviously relate to
directional signs forthe purposes of ingress.
       The same point can be made with regard to the 1986GreenGuide which
also deals with signposting under Paragraph 57 but is again in the chapter
headed "Egress". Management have to provide directional flow signs under

Paragraph 29(xv).
       The absence of any detailed recommendation in respect of signposting
for the purposes of ingress in the Green Guide is unfortunate. It is
thought, though, that the matter of signposting is better left to
management to deal with.   The information to be put upon a sign would
probably depend upon the operational requirements affecting a particular
match and for example if a small group of spectators attended there would
be no point in putting upsigns which if reliedupon'might     allow them use
of the full width and length of the terraces.
       The Police in those circumstances would wish to contain the fans
within a particular area and the signs ought to reflect that.
      wit is in any event submitted that any suggestion that spectators
were likely to create danger for themselves through being confused by the
lack of appropriate signs would have been treated as a remote possibility

prior to this tragedy.   The likely response of the Club and the Police to

such a suggestion would have been that if spectators found through lack of
signs that they had in fact gone into an area which was already crowded
then for reasons of their cwn canfort they would have left that area and/or

looked out for sonewhere else to go to.

                                      25
          Fran the City's point of view it is another of those matters where
they would have expected to be told if there was a problem (transcript:
29:90A) and in the absence of specific comment arising fran probably the
Police or possibly the Club it is unlikely that this was an issue which
would ever have seen the light of day at any advisory group meeting.
(b)       Tunnel
          So far as the tunnel is concerned it is with respect submitted that
whilst its gradient dees not accord with the Green Guide recaemendation it
was not unreasonable for the Certificate to be provided in spite of that.
It would probably have been unreasonable to require extensive work to be
done (see Dr. Eastwood's evidence).
          It is unlikely that the tunnel had any effect on the events of this
day and there is a wealth of evidence to show that spectators proceeded
through the tunnel without mishap.     Mr. Foster (transcript 1:63) described
a solid mass in the tunnel walking steadily;     he was not buffeted and was
not even aware it was a slope (1:80). Mr. Hennessey had no apparent
problem in the tunnel (transcript 2:48) and suffered no pushing. Mr.
Cruice.had no problem in the tunnel (transcript 2:94:
                                                    ). Mr. Cunningham
described the catapulting effect at the end of the tunnel as a result of a
surge in it (transcript 2:104) but that was the result of the numbers

involved rather than the gradient.
          In any event the "landing" effect of the level area at the bottom of
the tunnel needs to be stressed since this would have had a compensatory
effect after the gradient.
          Generally it is subnitted that the tunnel had no effect at all on
the events'.of the day and whilst it may be Dr. Eastwood's view that the
tunnel would need to be looked at again that is a view dependent very much
      /

upon hindsight.
          Dr. Eastwood evidently had what appeared to him to be good reasons
for leaving the tunnel as it was. It is suggested that the City could not
                                       26
reasonably have required extensive works on the tunnel since there was no
evidence of any history of complaint or accident affecting the tunnel
although its presence was well known and it was presumably used regularly
and probably by the majority of spectators attending those Terraces.


SECOND ISSUE:      CONFINED AREA (the pens)
(i)        History and Purpose
           The history of the pens is fairly straightforward.   The perimeter
fence was there before Certificate and was there as a security fence to
keep spectators off the pitch.
           The radial fences were provided in 1981 and 1985, as appears frcm

the documentation.      The purpose of having radial fences appears to have
altered.      Initially they were provided as a means of controlling lateral .
movement of spectators. In 19.§5 the scheme approved was for the purpose of

effecting segregation of heme supporters frcm away supporters on the

terraces and to that end a sterile area between pens 4 and 5 was created by

the addition of a radial fence there with the added option of creating a

larger sterile area if necessary by shutting off pen 4.
           The purpose of the radial fences changed again after the 1986 season
when it ceased to be the practice to have any mixture of supporters at that

end of the ground.      The radial fences then became available as a means of

containing smaller groups of away supporters in specific areas. On the
       >
occasion of any big match where the whole of the Terraces might be needed

the policy became one of letting the fans find their own level subject to

visual monitoring.      Thus latterly in the case of sell out matches the

radial fences have been restored to the purpose of controlling lateral

movement.                        -
(ii)       The Reasonableness of the Certificating Authority's Approval

           It is quite clear that the certificating authority approved the

introduction of the radial fences in 1981 and the creation of the pens in

                                        27
1985.     It dees not seem that after 1985 the certificating authority ever
had its attention drawn specifically to the abandonment of the policy of
segregating rival supporters at that end of the ground.      It is submitted
that the certificating authority at all material times acted reasonably in
approving the installation and continued presence of the radial for the

following reasons:-
(a)       The 1976 Green Guide provides at paragraph 18.1:
          "Crowd movement on terracesshould be severely limited in order to
          give the Police the fullestopportunity for crowd control. Less
          problems occur where the terraces are divided as far as possible
          into sections by the use of railings or barriers, both radial and

          lateral...".
The radial fences were introduced in 1981largely as a result of Police
recommendations and in the absenceof any contrary view.      Again in 1985 the
Police favoured the introduction of the central radial fence between pens 3
and 4 and the provision of the sterile channel for their access purposes
                                                    \
between pens 4 and 5. The certificating authority would have needed
weighty reasons to challenge the Police view but it is in any event
submitted that the Police purpose was a sensible and proper one.
          (b)            The proposals both in 1981 and 1985 were supported by Dr.
Eastwood. He had sane vacillation (transcript 27: 23 A).’
                                                        .but never felt in
the event that there was any problem in controlling spectators (transcript

27:75A). He appreciated the manner in Which in 1985 the pens were to be

filled by for example using the gates leading into the central pens so that

once, either pen 3 or 4 was full it could be closed off and people
channelled.' into the remaining pen of the two central pens. It is important
to remember, frcm the certificating authority's point of view, that Dr.
      J


Eastwocd felt himself able in the exercise of his professional judgment to

issue annual certificates of safety as for example that dated 2nd August
1988 (Core at page 475).    Dr. Eastwood intended such a certificate to
                                       28
 relate to those structures with which he as engineer was concerned and this
.included the radial fences, gates, perimeter fence, crush barriers and so
on. He meant the certificate to be read as meaning that as far as those
 structures which were within his remit were concerned the ground was sate

to use.        Such a certificate carries therefore great weight, coming as it
dees frcm an apparently reputable source such as Dr. Eastwood who would not
put his professional reputation in jeopardy.         It is to be noted that Dr.
Eastwood was certifying that the various structures in the ground were in a
satisfactory condition and appropriate for the stadium to be used to the
full capacity as laid down in the Certificate of Ground Safety.
          (c)       It was reasonable for the certificating authority to suppose
that the Club with the assistance of the Police had the ability to control
spectators entering and using the pens.         Properly organised the pens were

capable of being used safely.       There is no evidence that the certificating
authority was ever made aware of any disquiet on the part of anybody about
any risk attaching to the pens.         The certificating authority was never put
on enquiry, and that probably reflects the belief of the Club and the
Police that the pens could be used safely.

         (d)        It was not necessary to enshrine any particular method of
filling the pens in the terras of the General Safety Certificate. The

method was best left as an operational decision to be made by the Club with

the assistance of the Police. The methods described in evidence vary f ran
    ■v
the certificating authority's point of .view it was reasonable to suppose

that those responsible for fixing a method would be able to do so without
difficulty.
          r'
                                    /

(iii) Effect on Capacity

         At least to the extent that the sterile channel took away a part of

the area available for standing the provisions of the pens in their final

form could have had an effect on the holding capacity of what is left. It

                                           29
is to be noted though that the central pens created were relatively small.

Originally 10% of the area of the terrace had been discounted to allow for

the absence of gangways.     That discount might well be regarded as generous

and perhaps even unnecessary in the case of the central pens where the

majority of spectators would be within 12. metres of the tunnel exit.

       The fact is that it does not seem that the certificating authority

ever reconsidered capacity for the pens but the reason for that is probably

that it was meaningless to do so in terms of any holding capacity for any

area which was not self-contained and in respect of which a number of

spectators could fluctuate.     The Fire Brigade were evidently satisfied

about the pen capacity in terms of evacuation times.



(iv)   Administrative Shortcomings

       The presence of the radial fences should have been noted up on the

plans and that would have involved an amendment of the certificate of which

the plans are part.   The same may be said of the additional perimeter fence
                                                   \
gate provided in 1985.     However, though the paperwork was not dealt with as

well'as it should have been it is submitted that this did not contribute in

any respect to the tragedy.

       If it were said that appropriate advertising with regard to

necessary amendments might have allowed scrne interested party to query what

was being proposed or done the answer must surely be that any such argument

is sonewhat remote and unlikely but in any event if any interested party as

defined under Section 5(5) of the Act wished to challenge the introduction

of the radial fences then since the radial fences were obvious to see on

the terraces an appeal could have been brought to Court under Section 5(3)

if necessary.

       The perimeter gates which are part of the structure comprising the

pens are dealt with under the 4th Issue below.



                                        30
THIRD ISSUE:      CRUSHING

         It is proposed to consider here the matter of the crush barriers

and, specifically, the removal of crush barrier 144.       The City's position

is that even allowing for differences between the crush barriers as they

were in pens 3 and 4 on the day of this tragedy compared with

recommendations in the Green Guide, nevertheless as far as the crush

barriers were concerned they were reasonably safe and sufficiently strong

for the kind of situation which could reasonably be envisaged.        Barrier

124a failed because of gross overloading arising in exceptional

circumstances. The following points are m ade:

(i)      The adequacy of the crush terriers at the time of issue of

         certificate.

         Deficiencies in the barriers as they were before the issue of

         certificate were noted by Dr. Eastwood and the Officer Working

         Party.   A Schedule of Required Improvements was drawn up.    Barriers

         were tested and where necessary replaced.   Additional barriers were
                                                     s
         provided.   The County took into account the'professional judgment of

         Dr. Eastwood.   In the event what was provided was, It is submitted,

         a reasonable system of crush harriers. Although there were

         deviations from the Green Guide this was an area where it was

         appropriate to apply maximum flexibility since the [system was so

      . .-^greatly influenced by the presence of terriers which had been there

         for upwards of nearly half a century.

        Moreover, it is to be noted that the terrace in front of the West

         Stand is quite a narrow one frcm front to back.    Effectively there

         are only 3 rows of barriers and. the situation is quite different

       •f frcm, for example, that which obtains at the Kop end where there is

        a much larger area of terracing on a much more significant' incline.

        There seems little doubt that the barriers were strong enough to

        meet the recommendations in the Green Guide.     The heights of the

                                       31
         barriers are somewhat variable bat it is submitted that the heights

         involved are not dangerous.

         So far as the layout is concerned Dr. Eastwood advised the Officer

         Working Party that the gaps should be larger than recommended in the
                                                        i
         Green Guide (transcript 28:16A) and he took account of the fact that

         the barriers were materially closer together row to row than

         required in the Green Guide.

         It was very much a situation where approval of the system was

         influenced by professional judgment and common sense.



(ii)     Sufficiency of the Terms of the Certificate.

         The certificate makes specific provision in respect of the barriers

         by way of:

         (a)     Condition 15(i)    The holder shall at all times maintain all

                 structural parts of the stadium in sound order and to the

                 appropriate and relevant standards in the Guide and in all

                 cases to the satisfaction of the Council.

         (b)     Condition 25 in relation to the systematic testing of

                 barriers by a suitably qualified Chartered Engineer.

         (c)     Condition 29 in respect of the maintenance of the crush

                 barriers as indicated o n ;the plan.   .

       ' Clearly the certificate has not. kept up-to-date with the changes in

        the Green Guide in that testing under condition 25 was contemplated

        as involving a cycle of not less than 4.1/2 years and to be by way

        .of a representative sample of not less than 20% of the total number

        of barriers.     Properly the certificate ought to reflect the fact

/       that now testing should take place every 4 years (Green Guide 1986

        paragraph 38).    This made no difference on the day because the

        relevant barriers had been tested in July 1988.



                                        32
(iii)    Maintenance of a reasonable system of crush barriers after issue of

         certificate.

         It is submitted that the system of crush barriers present on 15th

         April 1989 was reasonably regarded by the City as a safe and proper

         system.    There have been seme alterations over the years since the

         certificate was issued both when radial fences were put in and,

         particularly, in July 1986 when barrier 144 was partly removed.         The

         significance of barrier 144 is dealt with further be lew.     At this

         stage though the City advance the submission that they reasonably

         concluded that the barriers were sufficient and proper having regard

         in particular to the following matters

         (a)       The barriers were subjected;to regular and appropriate

                   testing in respect of their,: strength and where necessary

                   remedial or repair work was carried out.

         (b)       Dr. Eastwood provided his annual Certificates of Safety

                   Testing and anybody reading such a certificate would     ,

                   properly conclude that his professional view was that the

                   crush barriers were in good order, and sufficient strength,

                   and made, the terrace fit and safe for:use.'

        ■.(c)      There were regular inspections by the Officer working Party

                   or: members of the Advisory Group which included inspection

                   of: the crush barriers

        (d)        There, were no canplaints of any danger arising fran the



                ' below)'.4''There were no accidents''arising fran the presence

                   o f ;crush, barriers-.

  /     (e)        The crush barriers appear to have done their job effectively

                   in that they had been in.,regular use and on occasions

                   subjected to capacity crowds as for example in 1988.     It


                                            33
                 would not be surprising if the certificating authority

                 regarded the crush barriers as a tried and tested system.

         (f)     The City on taking over the certificating function in

                 respect of the ground would reasonably have concluded that

                ■the crush barriers as provided had been approved and that

                 they could only be changed if there was reasonable cause to

                 do so.   Given that the system had indeed been approved and

                 subjected to regular testing and inspection the City would

                 have found it difficult to assert any reasonable cause for

                 changing what was there and any attempt to change would have

                 been contrary to the recommendation in favour of maximum

                 flexibility in the application of the Green Guide.



 (iv)   Barrier 144

        This was removed after the inspection of August 1986.      It is

 relevant because of the thesis advanced that the absence of barrier .144 was

 causative on the day in. allowing a channel through which crowd pressure

■flowed.with the’ result that barrier 124A was broken dcwn.

        The circumstances under which barrier 144 came to be removed, are .

 unfortunate. No prior notice was given of the proposal "to remove 144 and         .

 the matter'seems, to have been dealt with on an ad hoc basis on site. . Sane

 time vas taken up in probing whether Mr. Bownes was acting ultra:vires but

 he refuted any such suggestion (transcript 29:77E). '        :       '-5.;r

 ’■v-   What' can be said .is. that .'even if barrier 144 had been dealt with in

 a procedurally impeccable manner the'same result was going to occur namely

■that barrier. 144 would be removed..   The reason for removal was that

advanced by the Police (see Calvert and 318A of Core).

        There plainly were safety considerations in mind (see especially

318A of Core) when the Police advocated the removal of 144.       Those safety

considerations were assessed by Dr. Eastwood and Mr. Strange and in
particular were assessed against the competing considerations including the

possibility of providing a replacement barrier.         The considered and

balanced view taken was that removal was in the circumstances a reasonable

course to take.         That was a matter of judgment based on reasonable grounds

and probably would have been the decision no matter in what circumstances

the discussion tcok place.

            Whether or not removal of barrier 144 was in the event causally

relevant is a matter of speculation because

(i)         even if present barrier 144 only partially intruded into the gap

            between the central radial fence and barrier 149.     If crcwd pressure

            flawed through that channel then the presence of 144 would have had

            little if any effect in reducing such crcwd pressure.

(ii)        it is by no means certain that crowd pressure did flew through the

            channel so as to have any effect upon barrier 124A.     The evidence as

            to the circumstances in which 124A came to be damaged is in sane

            conflict.   Gary Gains (transcript 2:150) described barrier 124A

           breaking down after a steady build up of pfessure and he put that

           very clearly as occurring before kick-off.     Statements were received

           frcm other witnesses for example Lewis Johnson who put the collapse

           of barrier 124A at the time when a surge coincided with M r .

           Beardsley's shot hitting the crossbar.    As a matter of speculation

          v "it is possible to envisage how a large group came through gate C,

           down the tunnel and then through the channel so as to cause

           increased pressure on barrier 124A but it; is. equally possible that

           the pressure which affected barrier 124A was generated on the pitch

           side of where barrier 144 would have been.

      J    It is unfortunate that the video recordings do not resolve the

           doubt.   There is a suspicious movement to be seen on .tape at about

           2.47 but no certain evidence as to what was happening within Pen 3

           at that time.

                                           35
 (iii)    Moreover the continued presence of barrier 144 might well itself

          have been highly dangerous in the circumstances of the 15th April

          1989 since it could well have lead to a different accident where

          excessive pressure was thrown onto terrier 144 itself or obstruction

          occurred with great risk of injury to persons in, say, the tunnel.

 (iv)     The channel as envisaged is probably illusory.     In fact the removal

          of 144 opens up an area where any crowd pressure is likely to be

          dissipated and certainly it involves opening up another channel down

          the length of the radial fence.     Whilst that might not be desirable

          in itself it would have had the effect of reducing any pressure

          caused by people flowing in from the tunnel.

          At all events after terrier 144 was removed its absence did not lead

to accident or injury at any match before the 15th April 1989 in spite of ■

the attendance of capacity crowds.       No report or complaint was made about

its absence.     It was never suggested to the City that action needed to be

taken with regard to the absence of barrier 144.        D r . Eastwood provided his

ground safety Certificate for 1988.       It is respectfully submitted that the

City would reasonably have concluded that the removal of barrier 144 had

achieved the desired objective put forward by Mr. Calvert and that its

absence,had not given rise to any other risk.



(v)      -The Strength of Barrier 124A

          This barrier failed.   It did so because it was grossly overloaded.

Dr. Eastwood.' s evidence about this as •set. out. at the' end of. his statement

has not been challenged.     It is therefore submitted' that barrier 124A was

sufficiently strong and probably' complied with the requirements of the

Green Guide as much in April 1989 as it had done in July 1988 when last

tested.     No one could reasonably have foreseen that such excessive

overloading would be applied to barrier 124A.



                                         36
 FOURTH ISSUE - Unable to escape or avoid injury or death

 (i)         Perimeter Fence Gates

             As a matter of history the majority of these gates were present

before certification although 2 gates were added later namely gate 4 in

 1985 and gate 7 in 1987.       Because of the ample width of the exit points at

the Leppings Lane end of the Terrace the perimeter fence gates were never

regarded as part of the primary exit system but were simply a secondary

facility available.

             The gates are in round figures about 30 cms., or say one foot,

narrower than the recommended width for such gates according to Paragraph ■

209 of the 1986 Green Guide.         There was of course no recommendation of a

specific width in the 1976 Green Guide.

             The width of the gate was evidently a matter of deliberate choice

when consideration was given to the point in 1985.         The competing interests

were on the one hand those associated with matters of security and public

order when for example the Police might need access within the Pan and

preferred a narrower gate as against those associated with emergencies and

evacuations when for example the Fire Service would prefer a wider gate.

             It is submitted that the certificating authority acted reasonably in

concluding that the gates as provided were of a width which satisfied the

relevant interests.

           * One instinctive reaction in the face of this awful tragedy may be

that the gates were so narrow as to hamper rescue and evacuation attempts.

It is submitted that such a conclusion is a tenuous one..       The evidence

suggests .that spectators were crushed together inside the Pens but that

when they reached the gate they passed through without being further
       /
obstructed at that point.       Certainly if a comparison is made against gates

of the width recommended in Paragraph 209 of the Green Guide it is

suggested that an extra foot or so would have made little if any difference

to the ability to escape or effect any rescue.

                                           37
           The attitude of the certificating authority was ever likely to be
affected by the way in which the Green Guide is couched.      Paragraph 209 of
the Green Guide (which is in similar terms to Paragraph 18.3 of the 1976
Green Guide) advises that "access to the pitch must be made as difficult as
possible in normal circumstances while at the same time ensuring that the
Police have effective access to the Terraces for the purposes of crowd

control and enabling the pitch to be used (where appropriate) in the event
of serious emergency.        . The priority consideration in the case of these
gates was ever likely to be Police access as the determining factor since
the gates were only intended as a secondary means of exit.      Conditions were
different at the Kop end (see Core page 82) where gates of the minimum

width were necessary.
          It is therefore submitted that the certificating authority acted

sensibly and properly in all w i n g these gates to be present, that there was

no sufficient reason to require alteration prior to the 15th April 1989 but

that in any event the particular reduction in width in the order of a foot

compared with the recommended width in Paragraph 215 of the 1986 Green

Guide made little if any difference.



(ii)      "Evacuation and Emergency Procedures

          It is submitted that these are not matters that can be dealt with by

way of specific detail in the Certificate which ought to provide generally.

The relevant Certificate does make provision as follows

(a)       By Condition 6(2) the Club have to evacuate spectators from the

          stadium or any part thereof upon receiving Instructions so to do

          from the Police.
      j
(b)       By Condition 9 the Club have to arrange, for stewards to man the

          exits, to patrol the stadium and deal with any emergency and have to

          arrange for training exercises relating to the: action to be taken by

          such stewards in the event of an emergency.

                                        38
(c)    By   Condition 10 the Club have to ensure that egress routes are as so

       secured as to open immediately and easily frcm the inside and to be

       manned at all tiroes.

(d)    By   Condition 11 the Club have to sign, illuminate and maintain exit

       routes.

(e)    By   Condition 14(3) a public address system audible in all parts of

       the stadium and available for priority use by the Police has to be

       provided.                          '

(f)    By   Condition 17 emergency procedure notices have to be posted as

       required by the Chief Fire Officer.

       There are of course other and specific provisions relating to

emergencies involving fire.

       It is the City's case that the provision made within the Certificate

is sufficient to ensure that appropriate means for dealing with an

emergency were available.and that it would not be reasonable to require the

certificating authority to have done more.     The specific training of those ,

who might have to be engaged in dealing with an femergency and bringing

about an evacuation is not a matter that would need to be dealt with by the

certificating authority and ought to be left to those services with the

expertise and where appropriate authority to deal with the relevant events.

Moreover, since the kind of emergency likely to arise is,one which would

probably require a Police presence it would have to be a Police decision as

to how many Officers to have available and what kind of expertise might be

required.   This is not, a matter that can be. dealt with, in -the. Certificate

and of course -under Section 2(2)A of the Act the provision o f Police

services is reserved for the determination of .the Chief Police Officer.
  j

(iii) First Aid

       The Certificate makes provision under Condition 8 in requiring the

Club to provide and maintain a suitably equipped First Aid rocm (adequately
signed and lit), a physician to be available at the First Aid roan if

required and the provision of First Aid assistance.

        Mr. Bownes told the Inquiry that there was no nationally available

index of appropriate equipment for these purposes. He had made specific

enquiry of the G.L.C. , a bcdy which had experience of major pop concerts,

but was unable to discover any specific detail.

        Originally the County's Officer Working Party had made enquiry of

Dr. Bailey, Ccrnmunity Physician, and he had provided a list of equipment

which the Officer Working Party had in turn put to the Club.

        Hcwever, that list had it is submitted ceased to be relevant by

April 1989.    After the City became involved their Health and Consumer

Services Department had been introduced as a member of the Advisory Group

and had made specific enquiry of the Club with regard to First Aid

facilities (see the evidence of Mr. Graham Mackrell) and the position which

resulted was that the Club undertook to find out frcm St. John's Ambulance

Brigade what equipment they reccmmended and to ccmply with their

suggestions.   The evidence of Mr. Wells of the St. John's Ambulance

suggests that this arrangement was put into effect.    Certainly the Club

relied upon S t . John's Ambulance to provide First Aid assistance and to

suggest"what equipment was needed.

        Having regard to the obvious expertise of the St. John's Ambulance

Brigade it is submitted that it was entirely proper and reasonable to rely

on them as the source of advice. It is though further submitted that the

Certificate by Condition 8 makes sufficient and appropriate provision in

respect of the subject when by virtue of the 1986 Green Guide Paragraph 29

the provision of First Aid facilities and First Aid staff is stipulated to
    j
be a management responsibility.    It would be unfair to require the

certificating authority to do more than was in fact done here.

        One consequence of relying on St. John's Ambulance Brigade was that

in so far as they relied on their own equipment that equipment was not

                                  ■ 4   0
likely to be available at the Club on the occasion of any annual

inspection.      However, it was reasonable to believe that St. John's

Ambulance Brigade would attend any specified activity with appropriate

equipment because they invariably do attend and provide First Aid at the

events of mass entertainment.

       Two specific points call for further carcnent.       Firstly Dr. Bailey's

list did provide for a Minute-man Resuscitator and it seems that such an

item'of equipment was not provided by the Club or St. John's Ambulance

Brigade.       It is thought that the absence of such an item of equipment was

not culpable because had such an item been required then St. John's

Ambulance would have advised accordingly.        Its absence, moreover, was not

causative.      In the event various resuscitators were made available by the

Fire Service and Ambulance Service.       It is unlikely that any resuscitator'

in the First Aid rcan would have been got into use earlier than the

resuscitators which were in fact used.        It is unlikely that a Club

resuscitator would have made any difference to these events.         Mr. Wells

felt that mouth-to-mouth resuscitation was at least as good.         It was his

view and that of other witnesses including Mr. Higgins of the Fire Service

that no equipnient would have made any difference to what' occurred.

       Secondly there is sane confusion as to whether or not a Club

Physician to attend at the First Aid Roan'was provided." The Club believed

that .this was so, in the form of Dr. Purcell.. Dr-. Purcell was regarded as

the Club Doctor.      Doubtless he would have attended if required so to do,

even though he felt himself to be more specifically the Team Doctor.        It is

though: submitted that the absence of a Club Doctor to be available-at the
           s                                                     -   -


First Aid roan (if such was the-position) made no difference to these

events and that was essentially the evidence of Dr. Purcell.




                                         41
                                DRAFTING NEW CONDITIONS

           Attention was drawn to the lapse of time between 6th May 1986 when

Mr. Bownes first referred to re-drafting the conditions (Core at 314) and

the absence of any perfected revised version by April 1989.            Mr. Bcwnes'

personal answer is as set out in the memorandum supplied to the Inquiry in

the course of his evidence and which was incorporated as part of the

written evidence on which the City rely.         So far as his position is

concerned it is with respect submitted that Mr. Bownes has not acted

unreasonably or in a dilatory way.

           So far as the City is concerned it must be remembered that:-

(i)       Analysis of the conduct of the Administrative and Legal Department

           in respect of the alleged delay in'a manner appropriate to dismissal

           of an action at law for want of Prosecution (of 'the suggestions that

           the delay was inordinate and inexcusable) is inappropriate.            This

          was not a matter of. litigation nor even a matter of any kind of

          dispute or confrontation between the parties.        The task which Mr.

          Bcwnes had set himself, and commenced by way of. the re-drafting was

          exactly that kind of work which, could be put. to one side when work

          of a higher priority demanded attention.

(ii.)     Mr. Bownes did not feel that there was any risk which arose frcm the ■ •

   .'.•.....'conditions as they were in the original Certificate. -As mentioned

   ./ V earlier he believed -that the system was working reasonably- well and

          assumed that the ground was reasonably safe.        His letters to the

        •. -various parties\>involved in.the Off i   c    e    r   h   a      v    e,

          been referred to above and the answers he got would have confirmed a ,

          view that .the i^draf ting" was not a matter of any great urgency.

(iii)     Whatever time was taken up in re-drafting the new conditions it

          should not be supposed that work in respect of administering the

          system or enforcing the provisions of the Act stopped.        The

          inspections carried on.    Work continued.
(iv)        It was suggested that additional staff should have been taken on.

            That ought not to be required where the work involved in dealing

            with the certificating function ought not to have any significant

            resource implications.   In any event one member of staff was taken

            on as an extra namely a clerical assistant in 1986.

            It is though submitted that the absence of a re-drafted Certificate
was not a cause of this tragedy.
            The system as it was was such as to enable reasonable safety to be

achieved for spectators at a.football match.       The system under the existing

Certificate dealt with issues which were raised and responded to those

issues.       There was clearly a general belief amongst those involved in

organising such an event as this semi-final that it could be organised

safely at this ground, with its fixtures and fittings as they were, and

with the manpower which would by arrangement be available.        That belief was

ever likely to affect the City in dealing with its certificating function.

          Dear Siry,

                            Resumed Hillsborough inquests on 19th Nov. 1990
         With reference to my earlier correspondence I am circulating to all
         the firms that were represented at the meeting on 30th October 1990
         summaries of what are believed to be facts relating to the
         Hillsborough disaster,

          I would be most grateful if you could pleyse study the documents as
          soon as possible and let oe knowi
          1. Whether you agree that they correctly summarize the position in
          respect of those matters      which are dealt with.

          2, If you think that there are any errors in the summaries. Please
          specify the errors so that if appropriate they can be corrected.
          If we cannot agree a particular point than it may be necessary to
          delete it ehlirely from the summaries. I will decide what
          action is needed in the light of any comments and in relation to
          the importance or otherwise of the point that is disputed.
          Flease note that it is likely that for convenience the summaries will
          be merged and presented e& one, They have simply been prepared in the
          present format, and, in the interests of time I am circulating them
          split.
          There is a further matter that has occurred to me. I have taken it
          that you have kept your client(s) informed of the recomencement of the
          resumed inquests and I have not written to them personally informing
          them of this fact, I have also taken it that neither you nor your
          Client(s) object to this. If these aauumptions are incorrect please
          let tfe have by return and preferably by FAX the full name and
          current address o£ yourclient(s) so that" t Can formally write to
          them.




RECEIVED FROM    0213596735                                               1 19 « 19 9 3     1 1 5 1/6                        ? , 13
                    DRAFT OF PROPOSED SUMMARY OF AGREED FACTS


The present road network from Liverpool to Sheffield, has a motorway road
system around Manchester, which now provides a complete bypass to the south of
the City which was incomplete on 15 April 1989. At that time the M63 finished
at Portwood roundabout, to the east of Stockport at the junction with the
A 5 6 0 . The final part of the M63 providing the last link to the M67 at Denton
was not opened until 28 April 1989.

The recommended route published in the Liverpool Programme advised supporters
to follow the M62 east out of Liverpool, north of Manchester, across the
Pennines to Junction 42 of the Ml.  It was then suggested that they travel
south on the Ml, leaving at Junction 35 for Sheffield.  Supporters who followed
that route did not report any great delays.

It is clear that many Liverpool supporters chose to follow the M62 or M56 east
of Liverpool, then joining the M63 to the west or south of Manchester.   This
motorway terminated to the east of Stockport and supporters were then required
to follow the A560 to Mottram in Longdendale, where they could join the A57
over Snake Pass to Sheffield,  Supporters who chose this route -were the ones
subjected to long delays.  However, some of the accuracy of this evidence has
to be viewed in the context that many people are confused as to their correct
location when they were delayed and also, they were frustrated by the hold-ups
and may have understandably felt the period of the delay to be longer than it
actually w a s . .

M62, WEST OF JUNCTION 15 EASTBOUND CARRIAGEWAY

At 1106 hours a damage only road traffic accident occurred between a motor
cycle and a saloon car. The motorway, which at this point has four lanes, was
reduced by two lanes for only about 15 minutes. No reports of serious delays.

M62 JUNCTION 15 EASTBOUND CARRIAGEWAY

Between 0830 and 1345 hours, the   three lane motorway at this point was reduced
by one lane, due to a third lane   closure for essential central barrier
renovation. During the closure,    traffic was flowing slowly through the road
works and was only delayed for a   maximum of 10 minutes.

M62 BETWEEN JUNCTIONS 21 & 22 BOTH CARRIAGEWAYS

Contraflow, two lanes in each direction.    Long term work relating to widening
scheme. No serious delays reported.

M63 BETWEEN JUNCTIONS 2 & 3 EASTBOUND CARRIAGEWAY

The three lane motorway at this point was reduc&d by one lane to direct traffic
into a suitable configuration for approaching contraflow.

M63 BETWEEN JUNCTIONS 3 & 6 BOTH CARRIAGEWAYS

Contraflow, two lanes in each direction. Long term work relating to widening
scheme. Long delays reported by supporters and coach drivers.

M63 END OF MOTORWAY PORTWOOD ROUNDABOUT

At that time the motorway terminated at a roundabout, at the junction with the
A560. Heavy congestion reported due to volume of traffic.   This delay varies
between a 1/2 hour and 1 hour 10 minutes between 1215 and 1325 hours.
                                           -   2   -




     M67 END OF MOTORWAY MOTTRAM IN LONGENDALE

     This is a traffic bottleneck caused purely by the combination of a heavy volume
     of traffic and the road layout. At this location the motorway terminated into
     a single lane Carriageway, close to a crossroads controlled by traffic lights
     in a small village centre.  The A560, which carried traffic from the M63, joins
     the M67 at a rounabout at the terminus of the motorway,just   prior to this
     point and this further contributes to the bottleneck.

     As far as can be ascertained some 102 coaches containingLiverpool   supporters
     travelled to Sheffield on 15 April 1989.

     To evaluate the number of supporter who travelled to the ground in mini buses
     and using their private vehicles is difficult, but all available parking within
     a radius of approximately 1 1/2 miles from the ground was utilised.

     Clearly the greater number of supporters travelled to the ground in this manner
     and although traffic volume was heavy on all approach routes, traffic delays
     were not a significant factor in the late arrival of fans.

     A Map showing various routes from Liverpool to Sheffield and identifying
     trouble spots is produced.

     RAIL TRANSPORT                >

     Two British Rail Stations were used for the transport of supporters, the
     Midland and Wadsley Bridge. The former was used for both Liverpool and
     Nottingham Forest supporters and the latter for Liverpool supporters only. One
     special train and three service trains from Liverpool conveyed a total of 825
     supporters, 430 to Wadsley Bridge, with service trains from other areas
     bringing this to a total of 1,337.

     LICENSED PREMISES

     Premises selling alcohol in and around the Sheffield area were identified and
     sub-divided into full On Licences, that is public houses, and Off licences,
     which includes shops and supermarkets. The general opening hours for licensed
     premises on this date were for public houses 11 am to 11 pm and o££ licences 8
     am to 11 pm.

     193 Public houses were visited in an attempt to identify those frequented by
     Liverpool supporters on Saturday, 15 april 1989. These can be graded as
     follows;-
     10 Public   Houses remained closed on this date.
     72 Public   Houses were frequented by local persons only.
     37 Public   Houses reported having less than 20 Liverpool supporters,
     51 Public  Houses reported having in excess of 20 Liverpool supporters.
     23 Public   Houses reported having in excess of 100 Liverpool supporters.

     Seventy-four off licenses were identified as open. These were also visited and
     enquiries show that some of thoses closer to the ground were particularly busy
     prior to the kick off,  It is not possible to quantify this further.

POLICE ARRANGEMENTS

A comparison Of the South Yorkshire Police orders for the Cup Semi Finals 1988
and 1989 has been made.

This reveals that the 1989 order was basically a repetition of the 1988 order,
although there was a reduction in manpower in some areas.' Details are as
follows

    The Chief Inspector in charge of Sub Section 2A and an Inspector in charge of
    Serials 16, 17, 18 and 19 posted to the front of Leppings Lane turnstiles
    performed the same duties in 1988 and 1989.

    An Inspector in charge of Serials 14 and 15, comprising 2 Sergeants and 20
    Constables, was posted to the concourse area behind the West Stand, one serial
    to the North and one South in Phase 1 (before kick off).  There were no
    officers specifically posted to the central tunnel during this phase.   In Phase
    2 (after kick off) Serials 14 and 17 should have taken up a position in the
    central tunnel but it appears they were overtaken by events.

    Initially there were 5 mounted officers posted to Leppings Lane area. At 1415
    hours approximately this was increased by the arrival of a further 8 mounted
    officers who had escorted Liverpool fans from Wadsley Bridge Railway Station,
    These can be sub-divided into 4 from South Yorkshire Police and 8 from
    Merseyside Police and 1 from the Nottinghamshire Constabulary, Between 1440
    and 1452 hours this was supplemented by an additional 8 mounted officers, 3
    South Yorkshire Police, 3 Merseyside and 2 Nottinghamshire Constabulary, making
    a total of 21 in all.

In addition to these people there were 45 programme sellers, 50 catering staff,
15 lottery ticket sailers and 77 additional catering staff.

Each section of the Football Ground hag stewards allocated. In the area of
Leppings Lane there were 37 stewards covering the West Stand, 23 Turnstile
operators covering the turnstiles in Leppings Lane.

As far as can be ascertained manning levels for both semi finals were similar
in numbers.
                             DRAFT OF PROPOSED SUMMARY OF AGREED FACTS


    Sheffield Wednesday Football Club was formed in 1867 and elected to the
    Football League in 1892. Sheffield Wednesday moved to their present ground at
    Hillsborough in 1899. Rubbish was tipped at either end of the pitch to form
    banking and a stand moved from their previous ground was erected on the site of
    the present South Stand. This was replaced in 1913 by the exisiting South
    Stand, the Spion Kop being added in 1914, the North Stand in 1961 and the West
    Stand in 1965 following the decision to stage a number of World Cup games at
    the venue in 1966.

    Since 1912 30 FA Cup Semi-Finals, 19 International and 3 World Cup matches have
    been played at this venue.  Xn addition the stadium has been used to stage
    religious meetings, a basketball display, world class tennis and schools
    display for the Queen in 1954. The record crowd for the ground is 72,841 in
    1934.

    Hillsborough Stadium was designated in 1979 under the safety of Sports Grounds
    Act 1975, An inter-agency group known as the ’Officer Working Party’ was set
    up to monitor safety aspects of the stadium.  They met twice annually or such
    shorter periods as were necessary.  It was comprised of the following
    representatives!

    1.   Sheffield Wednesday Football Club
    2.   South Yorkshire Police
    3.   South Yorkshire County Fire Service
    4.   South Yorkshire County council and later City of Sheffield
         Metropolitan District Council
    5.   Consultant Engineers (Eastwood and Partners).

    They would sometimes meet ’on site' end discuss'and approve alterations for
    example, the removal of barrier 144 from enclosure 3 (this has been referred to
    by many witnesses as Pen 3) in 1986.

    The Leppinge Lane End of the Ground has been the focus of attention throughout
    the Inquiry, On 15 April 1989 this End was allocated to the Liverpool Football
    Club Supporters and in order to gain entry into the ground, whether it be to a
    seating or standing area, supporters first had tonegotiate the ironperimeter
    gates situated at the funnel entrance to the ground immediately before the
    turnstiles.  These gates are set out in a bank of six double gates and are
    situated across the mouth of the entrance into the ground from Leppings Lane,
    They are made of wrought iron and painted blue.

    Having negotiated these gates the supporters would enter a courtyard.  This
    area is shaped like a funnel between the outer perimeter gates and turnstiles 1
    to 16 and A - G. In normal league matches access can also be given to
    turnstiles 19-22 and 23-28.  This was not so on 15 April 1989.

    The courtyard is divided by a wall of metal construction running from the
    perimeter gates to the brick wall of turnstile 16. There is also a metal
    barrier running almost parallel to this from half way across the courtyard to
    the wall adjoining turnstile G. The effect of this is to divide the courtyard
    between the two banks of turnstile 1 to 16 and A to G and create a funnel for
    people towards the appropriate turnstiles depending on which part of the ground
    they wish to enter.

    The wall of metal construction was built in 1985 to segregate home and away
    supporters. At about the same time proposals by Eastwood and Partners, which
    would have achieved enclosures having their own turnstile entrances and
    individual crowd capacities, were rejected by the Club.

     There are a total of 95 turnstiles at Hillsborough, 12 of which (Nos 77 - 88 )
     were not in use for reasons o£ segregation on 15 April 1989. Nottingham Forest
     fans were allocated 60 and Liverpool the remaining 23 all from Leppings Lane,

     The 23 turnstiles in Leppings Lane contained in two sections 1 to 16 and A to
     G, are divided by the metal wall previously mentioned,  They were designed in
     Such a way that turnstiles 1 to 10 served the West side of the North Stand
     seated area, 11 to 16 the West Stand seated area and A to G the West Stand
     terraces. In actual fact turn'stiles 11 to 16 and A to G give access to the
     same concourse area at the rear of the West Stand, Confusion was caused by the
     turnstiles being signed from left to right A,C.B,   The tickets given to
     supporters added to the confusion and the generallayout once inside   the iron
     perimeter gates caused congestion if a supporter needed to get from turnstiles
     A to G to 1 to 16 or vice versa,

     As a result if a supporter went through the outer perimeter iron gates towards
     turnstiles A-G and found he needed turnstiles 1-16 he would have to return
     through the outer perimeter iron gates into Leppings Lane and then to the
     correct turnstile,

     Also in this area are three Exit Gates A, B and C, These Gates are large
     concertina type metal gates measuring 4.064 metres across and 2,184 metres
     high, except 'B’ gate which is 3.2 metres high.  They were built in 1985 during
     modifications to the turnstiles and concourse area. Both sides of the gates
     closed towards the centre and are operated from the inside only they were
     painted blue and were capable of being locked and bolted, in each pair of
     gates one was fitted with a non-opening glass observation panel at about eye
     level.

     Looking from Leppings Lane Gate *A’ is situated to the left of turnstile 1 and
     adjoins the outer perimeter wall of the ground running parallel to VereRoad,
     Gate ’B ’ is at the end of the metal wall across the courtyard and between
     turnstiles 16 and A, Gate 'C’ is located to the right in the wall running
     parallel with the River Don beyond turnstiles A to G.

     Emergency Gate *E’ is a small concertina type gate opening from inside only and
     located in the wall running parallel with the River bon, immediately before it
     joins the side of the South Stand and behind the Police Control Box,

     Beyond the turnstiles and behind the West Stand.is a concourse area which is
     divided into three sections, Each of these sections serves a different part of
     the West and North Stands and the West Terraces.  The three sections are
     created by a metal fence and a brick wall. There was no access from the
     central concourse through the metal fence to the North Stand section but a
     gate in the brick wall did give access throughout the standing terrace
     concourse area,

     Entrance through turnstiles 1-10 would only give access to the North concourse
     area and thus the seated North Stand,

     There were a total of six portacabins on the  concourse at the rear of theWest
     Stand. Of these, two serviced the turnstiles   in the northern part of the
     concourse at the rear of turnstiles 11-16. The portacabins were variously used
     for selling programmes or souvenirs and in one case by the Police to store
     property seized from supporters. One of these portacabins was positioned
     behind gate 'B* near to the brick wall giving access throughout the stand
     terrace concourse area,

     Having entered through one of the turnstiles A to G and on the southern part of
     the concourse, supporters could either go to their left through the gate in the
     wall and into the central concourse area giving access into enclosures 6 and 7
     or up to the West Stand seating area; straight ahead into the tunnel and
     enclosure 3 and 4 ; or round to the right andeither up another access into the
     seated area or alongside the West Stand into enclosure l and 2,

       That explained, the main sign for the standing areas, measuring 2.591 metres x
fj     .305 metres was immediately above the entrance to the tunnel and comprised of
       the word ’STANDING' in .18 metres letter painted in blue on a white
       background,   Positioned on both sides of this sign were the letters B + A
       respectively.   In the normal course of events, following letter ’B ’ would take
       supporters along the left hand side of the tunnel and into enclosure 4.
       Likewise following the letter ’A ‘ would take supporters up the right hand side
       of the tunnel and into enclosure 3.

       The only other sign on this concourse section Indicating a standing area was a
       small one at a height of 3.658 metres in letters .09 metres high on a concrete
       pillar to the right supporting the West Stand. This directs supporters along
       the side of the Stand and into enclosures 1 and 2. No signs existed on this
       part of the concourse to indicate that access to standing areas in enclosures 6
       and 7 could be reached by going to the left through the gate in the wall.

       The tunnel is 22,17 metres long and unlit.   It is located under the seating
       area of the West Stand and is used primarily by supporters entering through
       turnstiles A to G. Rising at first it then levels off briefly before
       descending towards the terraces on a gradient of around 1 in 6 .
C' )   The recommended gradient from the Green Guide is 1 In 1 0 , The tunnel was of
       course built prior to the introduction of this Guide,

       As the tunnel opens out on to the terrace a radial fence divides enclosure 3
       and 4. Enclosure 3 is on the right and enclosure 4 on the left as you enter.
       Short walls on either side extend out. into the enclosures. There are gates at
       the tunnel concourse entrance capable of being closed. In addition it is
       possible to close off each enclosure (3 and 4) by a gate to each at the
       enclosure end of the tunnel.

       At the rear of the terraces and where the radial fences finish are gates which
       provide access to those persons wishing to walk along the terraces.  Thus there
       is unrestricted access to each enclosure if these gates are left open. Anyone
       entering enclosures 3 and 4 and wishing to then enter enclosures 2 or 5 would
       in effect have to take a couple of paces backwards to the rear of the pen and
       walk alongside the real wall.

       Running parallel to the goal line across the front of the West Stand seated
       area, are the terraces with a total of 7 enclosures, numbered by their gates
O      from left to right as you look at them from the pitch, i.e. enclosure 1 is in
       the South West Corner, immediately under the Police Control box and enclosure 7
       is in the North West Corner. Both corners are banked higher than the rest of
       the terracing, with enclosure 5 being a sterile area or void, unused by
       spectators.   The terracing gradient has been identified as between 1 in 4 and 1
       ■in 4.5. on the West Terraces.

       There are 3 rows of barriers on the terraces in enclosures 3 and 4 running
       parellel with the goal line. The barriers are of two designs; those fitted by
       Husband and Co., the previous engineers, and those fitted by Eastwood and
       Partners the current engineers.  In 1986 barrier 144 was removed from enclosure
       3 to facilitate easier crowd movements.  This has been the only significant
       change in barrier configuration on the Leppings Lane terraces.

       Perimeter fencing was installed in 1977. At the front of the terrace this
       fence is 2,896 metres high, comprising of heavy gage metal wire supported at
       intervals by metal posts set in concrete which in turn are supported on the
       pitch side by metal frames. At the top of each of these fences .381 metres of
       wire folds inwards. This is designed to make it harder for fans to climb over
       the fence onto the perimeter track or the pitch.  The wire is welded to the
       metal supports for strength and rigidity.

               In each of the enclosures there is a numbered gate to the perimeter track which
               is primarily designed for access to the enclosure in an emergency.  Eastwood
               and Partners have measured the width of Gate 3 as 0,85 metres and Gate 4 as
               0,83 metres between the gate posts. These gates are smaller than the Green
               Guide recommendation (1.1m) but they were constructed before this minimal width
               was suggested.

               Originally the West Terrace was completely open, Radial fencing between the
               perimeter fence and wall of the West stand, and which created three large
               enclosures, was installed in 1981. Further radial fencing was added in 1985
               dividing the large centre enclosures into what are now enclosures 3, 4 and the
               void enclosure 5. This radial fencing is 1,68 metres high and comprises of
               blue painted metal bars and was erected at the request of the Police to
               facilitate crowd control. This was agreed by the Officer Working Party.
               Enclosure 1 and 2 and 6 and 7, are not further subdivided by radial fences.  In
               fact they are still the large enclosures as orginally created in 1981.

               Schedule 2, Paragraph 3, of the Safety certificate specifies the number of
               spectators admitted to the stadium. Part 1 of Schedule 3 details the number of
               spectators permitted in various section of the ground, a figure which should
               not be exceeded.   The relevant capacities are:-
                                    West terrace          7,200
                                    North West terrace    2,900
               In late 1989 some 6 months after the disaster it was discovered that the
               capacity for the North West Terrace was wrong having been calculated with the
               wrong scale.   The result was that 2,900 was excessive. The revised figure is
               now 1,500,   The figure is based on. an amended Certificate fssued by Sheffield
               City Council on the 24 November 1989.

               In 1981 when the first radial fences were installed on the terraces, creating
               the 3 large enclosures a crowd capacity of 2,200 was declared for the centre
               enclosure by Dr EASTWOOD based on calculations in the 1976 Green Guide. When
               this large enclosures was divided in 1985 into enclosures 3 and 4 and the void
               5, Eastwood and Partners split the capacities as follows!- 1,200 into enclosure
               3 and 1,000 for enclosure 4. These figures were included on a plan of
               Eastwoods but the author of the figures has not been identifed.  These new
               capacities were never referred, it seems, to the Council or the Club in order
               that the Safety Certificate could be amended.  In any event the ability to
               restrict those enclosures to those capacities was not possible with the
               turnstile system in operation.

               It also appears that despite the introduction of these additional radial fences
               which created the void enclosure 5, no amendment was considered to the overall
               capacity of the West Terrace even though the barrier configuration remained the
               same (until 1986).

               Access to the West Stand which is all seating is by way of turnstiles 11 to 16
               and A to G, using the staircases off the concourse. The front of the West
               Stand overlooks the terraces, giving seated spectators a view of the terraces.
               The West Stand is divided by gangways for safety purposes. At the rear of the
               West Stand is a refreshment kiosk.

               The Police Control Box is situated in an elevated position in the South West
               Corner of the ground overlooking the Leppings Lane Terraces, a distance of 35
               meters from gate 3 and 47.5 meters from Gate 4. The control Box houses the
               Police Communications System and Video Monitors for the five fully remote
               controlled cameras which are operated from this location.  There is also a
               facility for the Police to over-ride the ground tannoy system usually operated
               by the disc jockey.

               A Club Control Room is situated on the ground floor at the rear of the South
               Stand, close to the players changing rooms.

 /—         There is no view of the pitch from this room. The occupants monitor the entry
  —         through the turnstiles around the ground, with a computer supplying ’print
            outs’ for the ground management purposes.   The room also contains the TV
            monitors from the various cameras located at turnstiles around the ground.
            Recordings are made on a bank of 16 video recorders. There is an ability to
            monitor any one of the five C.C.T.V .8 being operated by the Police from their
            control box on request to them. A telephone connects the Police Control to the
            Club Control Room.

            In addition this Club Control room, acts as the main base station for the Club
            personal radio scheme. This rpdio system is used by Senior Stewards, Security
            Officers and Management on a talk-through basis.

            The Director's Box is centrally situated overlooking the pitch in the upper
            tier of the South Stand,  There is access to the board room, the office complex
            below, the Nostalgia Bar and Steps Restaurant to the rear of the South Stand.

            The current tannoy public address system was upgraded in 1988 and broadcasts to
            locations in and around the ground, including the Leppings Lane turnstiles.
            Capable of being directed selectively to areas of the ground the system is
 v_J        operated from the South Stand near to the Police Control Box, by a Disc Jockey
            employed by the Club, Normally used for Club announcements and musical
            entertainment, the system can be over-ridden by the Police from their Ground
            Control Box.

            Situated to the right of the Police Control Box, when looking from the pitch
            above the Finlux TV and video S i g n is an electronic clock. A board is also
            located there being capable of displaying messages.

            The Police Room is located under the North Stand adjacent to the First Aid
            Room,  It is used as the detention and documentation room for persons arrested
            or being ejected from the ground.

            A first Aid Room is required uhder Schedule 2, Paragraph 8(1) of the Safety
            Certificate.  This room, which was upgraded in 1979, is manned by the St John
            Ambulance Brigade personnel during matches,  St, John Ambulance Staff advise
            the Club on the purchase of equipment for the room which is located on the
            ground floor at the rear of the North Stand alongside the Police room. A
            gymnasium is situated at the rear of the North Stand.

            A purpose built commentary box is located above the South,Stand.

            As previously mentioned, the Club have staged many large scale functions at
            Hillsborough.  These can give some indication of the level of their experience
            and that of the other agencies involved. That said, during the course of
            enquiries in connection with the disaster evidence has emerged of crushing
            involving supporters in the West Stand terracing at previous F.A. Cup Semi
            Finals.

            The Semi-Finals concerned are 1956, 1981, 1987 and 1988,

            In 1956 a match was played between Birmingham City and Sunderland and took
            place on 17 March 1956, where a surge of people caused crushing on the West
            Stand terracing.

            On 11 April 1981 a Semi-Final Was held between Tottenham Hotspur and
            Wolverhampton Wanderers.  This is the best document and the most serious of the
            previous incidents. Tottenham fans arrived late due to a combination of
 O          difficulties on the Ml Motorway and local diversions. There was crushing on
            the Leppings Lane terraces and during this match.
                                            - 6 -

    The Police and Sheffield Wednesday Football Club held discussions following
    this incident and the evidence points to the later implementation of the radial
    fences forming initially five large enclosures (the centre enclosure being
    later divided into enclosures 3,4 and 5), being the action taken to prevent &
    similar incident.

    On 12 April 1987, a Semi Final between Leeds United and Coventry City was
    played,  Evidence from one supporter suggests there was overcrowding on the
    Leppings Lane terraces.

    In 1988 the Semi Final took place between Nottingham Forest and Liverpool.
    Evidence obtained suggested crushing occurred on the Leppings Lane terraces.
    There is no evidence, however,'to show the 1987 or 1988 incidents were brought
    to the notice of the Police or Sheffield Wednesday Football Club.

    The HillBborough Football Stadium was designated under the provisions of the
    Safety at Sports Ground Act 1975, on 1 January 1979, the safety Certificate for
    Hillsborough was issued by South Yorkshire County Gouncul on 21 December 1979,
    on Sheffield Wednesday Football Club’s promotion to the Second Division.
    Attached to the Certificate are a number of schedules.  Schedule 1 deals with
    Interpretation; Schedule 2, the General Terms and Conditions; and Schedule 3,
    Crowd Capacity and Safety Stewards.

    South Yorkshire County Council, as the issuing authority, was responsible for
    the administration and supervision of the certificate until their demise in
    1986 when reponsibility was transferred to Sheffield City Council,  The Officer
    Working Party, now called the Sheffield City Council Safety at Sports Grounds
    Advisory Group, at the time of this disaster comprised of representatives from
    Sheffield City Council, Sheffield Wednesday Football Club, Eastwood and
    Partners, South Yorkshire Police, South Yorkshire Fire Brigade and South
    Yorkshire Metropolitan Ambulance Service.

    At the time the County Council transferred responeibilty for licensing to the
    City Council, there was a prepared schedule of responsibilities under the
    Safety of Sports Ground Act 1975 in existence. This document showed the
    responsibilities of the County, Police, Fire Brigade and Building Control
    Authority. According to correspondence this scheduule was adopted by the City
    Council which meant they then assumed the former County and Building Control
    functions.

    In July 1987, these responsibilities were re-drawn by the City Council in draft
    form in a document entitled ’Division of Responsibilities between Authorities',
    which proposed responsibilities being divided between the Building surveyors
    (Department of Land and Planning) and the Director of Environmental Health and
    Consumer Services.

              DRAFT OF PROPOSED SUMMARY OF AGREED FACTS


     It is noted that there are two documents of the same title. For
clarity, I have refered to these as
         a)  Traffic, Police and Club arrangements, and
         b)  General.                                          ’’


Traffic, Club and Police arrangements.

     Page 3     In   the ground sector duties table it is noted that even,
with a variance of minus 1, there was still   22 police officers on duty at
the Leppings Lane Terraces.

      Page k.   It     is noted that the number of Police officers on duty at
the Leppings Lane Roundabout was significantly reduced from the 1988 figure
by 3 , from 23 to 1 8 .

        Page k    The number of ground staff serving the West Stand, by S.W.
F.C.    , was increased by 11 to 37 for this match.

     Page 5 i - Note that 37 stewards were allocated to the area covering
the West Stand.


General

     Page 1      In the first paragraph, it suggests that the West Stand
was first errected in 1965. This is incorrect.    This Stand was erected
subsequent to the Building byelaw application in May 1928, and existed,
according to a photograph taken in the 1930s. -The tunnel access formed part
of this scheme. The gradient of the tunnel appears not to have been altered
since that time.

     In the table to para 3 on page 1, Sheffield City Council were always
part of the Officer Working Party in their role as Building Authority.
As an Officer Working Party, Sheffield Wednesday F.C., or Eastwood & Ptns.
wold not be an official part of the group.

     In the 4th paragraph, it states that they would sometimes meet on site,
and discuss and approve alterations. The word approve should be changed to
agree .

     In the 7th and 8th paragraphs on page 1, reference is made to a wall
of metal construction. I believe that this is a fence .   Without my office
records, I cannot confirm that this was built in 1985*

     Page 2     In the 2nd and 5th paragraphs ,I believe that      the reference
to metal wall should be altered to metal fence.

     In the 2nd para., the statement that turnstiles 11 to 16 and A to G give
access to the same concourse area is misleading. Note should be made here
that there was a brick wall accross this concouse area, even though the gates
in that wall were left open.

        In the 4th paragraph,   it suggests that all the gates were built in
1985 . Some of the gates existed before that time, as office records will
show.
     In the 9th paragraph on page 2, reference is made to six portacabins.
Portacabins are proprietory temporary buildings. The structures refered to
were caravans.

     In the last part of the 9th paragraph, reference is made to one of these
structures being positioned behind gate B. After the words- brick wall, the
following should be added     "holding the gate in the brick wall open and1*.

     Page 3     In the 3rd para, it states that the tunnel was unlit. There
is light fittings in the tunnel but i± is not known if they produce very low
lighting levells or are emergency lighting only. .

      In the 6th para., reference is made to 7 enclosures. There are 7 areas
but only 5 enclosures. Subsequent references to enclosures in the 6th and
7 th paras, shoud be amended to areas.
     In the 7th para., it states that some of the barriers were of a design
by Husband & Co. The first involvement of Husbands at the ground , according
to B.S.D. records was in 1954. Some of the barriers are known to have been
in existance in the 1930 s.

     The last sentance in the 7th paragraph refers to the removal of barrier
144 as being the only significant change on the Leppings Lane Terraces. It
does not however state from when.

     Page 4    In the 2nd para.,    in the penultimate line the word enclosure
should be changed to a r e a s .

     In the 3rd p a r a . , the revised figure for the North West Terrace was agreed
as 1400, not 1500 .

     In the 5th para., instead of "no amendment was considered” , it should
read "no amendment was m a d e ’*.

     In the 6 th p a r a . , Not all the seated spectators had a view of the
terraced area. The second part of the sentance should read, "giving some
seated spectators a view of the terraces. »»

     Page 6 :-In the 1st para.,    initially there was 3 large enclosures - not
5 as stated.

     In the 5th p a r a . , at the time of the disaster, the officer working party
did not include representatives from Sheffield Wednesday Football Club,
Eastwood & Partners, or The South Yorkshire Metropolitan Ambulance Service.

     In the 6 th paragraph, reference is made to the building control authority.
The word control should be deleted, since its correct title was The Building
Authority.

     In the last paragraph on page 6, at line 3» after the words "proposed
responsibilities", there should be added ", to sdvise the Administration and
Legal D e p t . , ".


     Many of the above comments may be seen as being of minor importance to
some, but may have a major significance to the legal argument on behalf of
the Council. I trust that you will make the necessary representations on
these matters.

Dear Sir,

Safety of Sports Grounds - Sheffield Wednesday Football Club -
Proposed use of the North West Terrace for the admission o£ spectators

1 refer to Chief Inspector Beal's telephone conversation with ray Chief
Licensing Officer, Hr. Bownes on Wednesday 8th Novesnaer, 1989 and to the
discussion which took place at the Safety of Sports Grounds Advisory Group
Meeting oa Thursday 9th November.

As I understand it, the Police intend at theSheffield United v Sheffield
Wednesday football match oa 21st November to per®It the itarth West Terrace
to be used for the admission of spectators in the oridiaary course oi; events
rather than in the emergency situation as dealt with in additional Condition
10 of the Sheffield Wednesday Safety Certificate. It was explained at the
Advisory Group, that in view of the anticipated numbers or. away supporters
likely to wish to gain admission to the Sports Ground, it wowld be
appropriate for the North West Terrace to be brought lato use as they could
n o t be accommodated fully in the West Stand. If the North Wes>t Terrace
facility were not to be available chan it would be iiksly that Che Sheffield
United fans might enter the Kop with the Sheffield Wednesday fans and thus
give rise to a potential problem.

At the Advisory Group meeting oo one dissented £rota this; proposal aad
bearing this factor in mind and also tnat the quest io?> or policing at sports
grounds will be discussed in principle witb meabers ot the General Purposes
Panel on 20tb November, I can confirm that the local authority do not, at
this stage, propose to interfere with the proposed arrangements for the
football match on 21st November. The arrangements t o r that natch are
therefore regarded as an operational matter between the Police and the Club
at this stage.

I look forward to a wider discussion of these policing issues on 20th
November.

Yours faithfully,

Dear Sir

Safety of Sports Grounds - Sheffield Wednesday Football Club - Proposed Use
of the North West Terrace for the admission of spectators

Thank you for your letter dated 15 November 1989 under the above heading.

I note that your letter states that the arrangements to use the North West
Terrace to accommodate Sheffield United fans on 21 November 1989 is regarded
as an operational matter between the Police and the Club. That, I presume, is
a personal view, since the Advisory Group were party to those arrangements
and in the absence of any dissent the arrangements were made. Had there
been dissent, the terrace would not have been used.

You may regard the arrangements            as an operational matter between the Police
and the Club - I regard them as            arrangements agreed with thefull authority
and aquiescence of the Advisory            Group.

I too look forward to the further discussion on 20 November 1989.

Yours faithfully

        THE OFFICER DEALING WITH THIS CORRESPONDENCE IS               EXTENSION
ADM/1
Policing Issues at Sports Grounds in Sheffield - Briefing Note

Purpose of the Note

This note is prepared in order to assist members and Officers attending
the meeting with the Police, which will take place on Monday 20th
November, 1989. There are three points to be made in this note firstly,
that relating to the initial Police attitude to the Council with regard to
their plans at Sheffield Wednesday; secondly the proposed changes in
policing arrangements which took effect on 28th October, 1989 and thirdly,
further changes in the policing arrangements at Sheffield Wednesday on
21st November.

The initial Police attitude

At a meeting of the General Purposes Panel on 17th August, Chief Inspector
Beal of the South Yorkshire Police gave a very thorough presentation to
the Panel about the proposed policing arrangements at Sheffield Wednesday
and in particular the use of the North Stand at the Hillsborough Football
Ground.  I believe the members of the Panel felt that this information was
most helpful and it indicated a positive attitude on behalf of the Police.

Essentially the Police proposal in relation to the North Stand at
Sheffield Wednesday was, simply to use it for home supporters via the
Penistone Road turnstile and not as has been traditionally the case, to
allow the Sheffield Wednesday supporters to enter both via the Penistone
Road turnstiles and the Leppings Lane turnstiles.

The Leppings Lane turnstiles would be used in part for the admission of
away spectators to the West Stand and by means of the proposed Police
arrangements complete segregation would be maintained between away
supporters and home supporters.

Proposed Revision in Policing arrangements with effect from 28th October

At a meeting of the Advisory Group on the 19th October, the Police
mentioned that they intended to change the operational arrangements in
respect of games taking place at Sheffield Wednesday. They said that the
revised arrangements would take effect on 28th October and that, they
would write to the Council concerning this issue. It should be noted,
that there was no prior notice to the Council that this issue would be
raised at the Advisory Group on 19th October.

Following the meeting, both my Assistant Solicitor, Mrs. Woodhead and
Mr. Bownes (The Chief Licensing Officer) made telephone calls to various
Police Officers in attempts to obtain the letter which had been mentioned
on the 19th October. Eventually, a copy of a letter detailing the
proposals was sent by Sheffield Wednesday to the Council by fax on 27th
October. On 31st October, a letter was received from the Police (which
was dated 25th October) enclosing a copy of the letter sent to the Club on
11th October about the proposed revised policing arrangements.

In the Star of Tuesday October 24th, 1989 there was a report indicating
that the Leppings Lane turnstiles would be open again and detailing the
revised policing arrangements.

Mrs. Woodhead consulted with the Chair of the General Purposes Panel and
in view of the fact, that there could be a greater danger to spectators in
insisting upon the original arrangement being reverted to, it was decided
that in the interests of safety, it was proper for the revised
arrangements to stand. This information was transmitted to the Police by
a letter dated 2nd November, 1989 a copy of which is attached.

It should be pointed out, that the letter is slightly inaccurate in that
it says that, the usual arrangement is that no use is made of the Leppings
Lane turnstiles; in fact, the Leppings Lane turnstiles would normally have
been used to admit away supporters.

The Police proposal was to permit the old arrangement whereby home fans
could use the North Stand, both by means of the Leppings Lane turnstiles
and the Penistone Road turnstiles.

The 21st November Proposals

At 2.45 p.m. on Wednesday 8th November, 1989 Chief Inspector Beal rang and
spoke to Mr. Bownes and indicated that he would like another item to
appear on the Safety of Sports Grounds Advisory Group Agenda for 9th
November.

Mr. Beal indicated that there was to be a local Derby match between
Sheffield Wednesday and United at Hillsborough on 21st November, and the
Police would like to use the North West Terrace as part of the oridinary
spectator accommodation. The idea of the proposal is that it would enable
an appropriate number of spectators to be accommodated and that it would
be unlikely that any would remain outside the ground and attempt to gain
access to it by other methods.  It was also proposed by the Police that at
the Liverpool match (29th November) the same arrangement would apply.

The amended additional Condition 10 of the General Safety Certificate
issued to Sheffield Wednesday (which was dated 19th August, 1989)
indicates that the South Yorkshire Police Officer in command of the ground
may authorise the use of the North West Terrace if he "... is of the
opinion that use should be made of that area in emergency to ensure the
reasonable safety of spectators at the sports ground ...".

The matter was discussed briefly on 9th November, and no members of the
Advisory Group dissented from the Police proposal. A letter was therefore
sent to the Police a copy of which is attached.

Summary and Conclusion

The basic problem highlighted by these two incidents appears to be one of
communication. Whilst the Council as Safety of Sports Grounds Authority
would not want to get involved in the detailed policing arrangements for
football matches, it would be assisted in its functions if, it could
simply be made aware of them and given appropriate notice if changes were
planned. It is also sometimes not appreciated that changes in policing
can have effects on other issues for example the means of escape in the
case of fire upon which the Fire Service would no doubt wish to comment
and it is therefore important that the Council have sufficient information
to enable all aspects to be considered.

One other matter that perhaps needs clarification is the perception of
what is an "emergency" in police operational terms. The police view was
that about 10 days before a match, tickets would need to be sold and
therefore the question of use of the North West Terrace would need to be
decided shortly after that date; this is not the same as the normal
perception of an emergency as being something happening at very short
notice.

          Hillsborough Football Ground

          I feel I must pass on my concerns after attending the match between Sheffield
          Wednesday and Sheffield United on 21st November, which I list below::

              1)   The Crows Nest section at the Leppings Lane end was obviously overcrowed
                   the the police very sensibly moved a large number of spectators to the
                   new stand.  I am concerned that perhaps more people may have been allowed
                   in than the Taylor recommendations would allow and would like to know if
                   the capacity of this area has been reassessed in the light of-the report.

              2)   As far as I could see there were only two small exits for the spectators
                    and it took longer for them to leave the terrace than for those on the large
                    Kop end of the ground.

              3) The police kept the supporters in the Leppings Lane stand behind for sometime
                  in order to let the fans from the crows nest get.out first. I am not
                  criticising this action, but when were allowed to leave it took me over< :: :
                  15 minutes to get .out and I was not the last. I understand thatthe stand
                  has a capacity of about A,000 and I could only see A exits which were very
                  narrow, barely wide enough for 2 people to pass through. I think it would
                  be impossible   for the stand to be evacuated in 8 minutes, as has been
                  requested for   the Kopat Bramall Lane where it is also possible to exit on
                  the pitch, which is impossible from the stand at Hillsborough.

              I would be grateful for your comments, as it seems to me that different standards
              appear to exist.

NOTE OF A MEETING WHICH TOOK PLACE AT HAMMERTON ROAD POLICE STATION AT
3.00 P.M. ON WEDNESDAY, 22ND NOVEMBER, 1989


The meeting had been called by the Police following minor incidents of
overcrowding at the derby match between Sheffield Wednesday and Sheffield
United on 21st November, 1989. Present at the meeting were Superintendent
Sleath and Chief Inspector Beale, myself and John Derricott from the
Administration and‘Legal Department, Arthur Butler and Don Sheriff from
the Building Surveyor's Department and Ron Grimshaw and Roger Woodhouse
from the Fire Service. I had, prior to the meeting, telehoned both Ken
Hodgson from the Department of Health and Consumer Services and Mr. Morley
from SYMAS inviting them to attend- if they wished. Both were uable to do
so. After the meeting, however, I telephoned Ken Hodgson and explained
the problems to him. Superintendent Sleath had confirmed that the video
would be retained should he wish to see it. I left a message for Mr.
Morley to ring me concerning the matter.

Superintendent Sleath showed the Group a video recording which had been
taken at the football match. Firstly, this indicated that there had been
overcrowding problems on the north-west terrace. However, the video did
not show the full picture in that prior to the commencement of the match,
Chief Inspector Beale, who had been in charge of operations in that
section of the ground, had ordered the turnstiles to be closed when he
appreciated that the north-west terracing was already overcrowded. There
were a fairly substantial number of people, I think he said approximately
60, who were unable to get onto the terraces. In addition, he held back
approximately 50 at the turnstiles. It was clear from the video and the
comments of the Police Officers that one of the problems on that terrace
was the presence of a screen which impeded visibility to the pitch. This
meant that people were unwilling to stand in that portion of the terrace.
However, it was not considered desirable to remove the screen. It had
originally been put there to act as a shield from bad weather and also
serve the purpose of preventing the throwing of missiles across the
terraces.

Some minutes into the match, a portion of the crowd were gesticulating.
Police Officers moved into the crowd to investigate.  Their complaint was
that they were overcrowded. As a result, a hundred plus people were moved
from the north-west terrace into the north stand. The general concensus
was that the capacity needed to be reduced to 1,500. We agreed that we
would discuss the matter with the Club and arrange for the Safety
Certificate to be amended. The Police do not intend to make regular use
of this area as from now. It will only be used on a contingency basis.
The Police confirmed that they had already discussed the matter with the
Club and the Club were agreeable. There was also a letter being sent from
Headquarters to the Local Authority about the matter.  I confirmed that we
would discuss the matter with Graham Mackrell when he came for a meeting
on 23rd November, 1989.

Later in the match, another problem became apparent as people left. At
the end of the match, the Police held the west end back.  Superintendent
Sleath wondered whether this contributed to the problems which then
ensued. He was concerned about the exiting of fans into the South Stand
lane. There was a mingling of crowds from the Kop with those in the south
stand. The problem appears to be a narrow section in the South Lane. The
Police feel that the ultimate solution to the problem is for the Club to
erect a bridge from the back of the South Stand over the river direct into
Parkside Road.  They also felt that a reduction in capacity in the south
stand would help since it was clear that this was impossible to exit in 8
minutes. It took between 15 and 16 minutes to clear the South Stand. One
suggestion made by the Building Surveyor was that the removal of a wall
would ease congestion beyond the gate.    It was also commented by Don
Sheriff that people exit in two ways inSouth Lane and there was also a
need to make it one way.

It was therefore agreed that the Fire Service would measure the gates and
review capacity.  It was also noted that there was a report going to
General Purposes Panel suggesting a reduction in capacity in the South
Stand anyway. The Building Surveyor and the Fire Authority also intended
to obtain aerial ph'otographs of the South Lane at the match on New Year's
Day between Manchester City and Sheffield Wednesday Football Club.

      Dear Sir

      HILLSBOROUGH FOOTBALL GROUND - THE NORTH WEST TERRACE

      As you are aware, on the evening of 21 November 1989 Sheffield Wednesday played
      Sheffield United at the Hillsborough Stadium. As a contingency the north west
      terrace was taken into use to accommodate the Sheffield United fans. The present
      capacity of this terrace is 2300 but, in the view of the officer in charge on the
      night - Chief Superintendent Nesbit 'F' Division - that number cannot be safely
      accommodated. Approximately five minutes before the kick-off there were 200/300
      people standing in the gangways and at the bottom of the stairwells, being unable
      to gain access into this terrace. Having examined the situation, Chief
      Superintendent Nesbit concluded that this number of people could not be safely
      accommodated within the terraced area and made pleas to have them transferred to
      another part of the ground. Whilst this exercise was being carried out it was
      seen that a further 100/150 spectators were still outside in Leppings Lane
      waiting to be admitted. These people, too, were accommodated in the north stand.

       It will be seen that around 450 people could not be accommodated and this was at
       a time when tickets had been sold which should have ensured that the capacity
       would not have been exceeded.

       It is the view of Chief Superintendent Nesbit that the capacity for this north
       west terrace should be reduced, and he has held preliminary discussions with the
       Sheffield Wednesday Football Club Secretary, Mr Graham Mackrell, who has agreed
       that a realistic figure should be 1500 maximum.




                                                                                 Cont'd


                                                                                 3403

Clearly, urgent attention needs to be given to this matter since the fixture next
week on 29 November - Sheffield Wednesday -v- Liverpool - is expected to draw a
good crowd and it would seem that lessons had not been learnt if on that night
gates had to be closed before the official maximum capacity had been reached.

I await your early reply.

Yours faithfully

               Capacity of Upper North West Terrace

               Subsequent to a meeting at Hantnerton Road Police Station on 22nd November
               to discuss various matters arising from the natch between Sheffield
               Wednesday and Sheffield United on 21st November, I have had cause to
               revise the recommended holding capacity for this area of the ground.

               You will recall that the present capacity figures were produced within
               hours, on list August, 1989, and therefore only a paper exercise was
               carried out in that restrictive time.

               A site visit earlier today revealed the extent of the area of terrace
               partially blinded by the screen between the North West Terrace and the
               North Stand.

               Accordingly that area has been omitted from the gross available area of
               terrace.

               The holding capacity of the remaining areas has been re-calculated and
               modified in accordance with the Taylor recommendations, giving a resultant
               figure of 1,700.

               Eastwood and Partners drawing number 1610/64E has been used for the layout
               of this area. In a telephone conversation between Mr Strange of Eastwood
               and Partners and my Principal Structural Engineer, late this afternoon, it
               was intimated that this drawing may not be accurate, and that the gross
               available space may be slightly smaller than is shown on the drawing.

               Until the area has been resurveyed and revised drawings received, I would
               recommend that the holding capacity for the Upper North West Terrace be a
               maximum of 1,500.

For the attention of Mr* J. Strange

Dear Mr. Strange,

The Sheffield Wednesday Football Club - Capacity of North West Terrace

I refer to your telephone conversation with Hrs. Woodhead on the 24th November,
1989. I confirm that the Chair of the General Purposes Panel has authorised
that the safety certificate be amended to reflect the fact that the capacity of
the north west terrace should be reduced to #1 ,500 in view of the crowd control
difficulties there were at the match on Che 2lst November. I understand that
this accords with the new calculations you have made this week. I look forward
to hearing from you with the revised plan you have prepared of this portion of
the stadium.

As you are aware from the conversation with Mrs. Woodhead, the Building Surveyor
has advised me that the plan upon which the original calculations was based was
incorrect.  In view of the fact that fresh calculations have been made in
respect of the north west corner, this appears to resolve the problem in that
respect. However, I am concerned about the plans and calculations for the
remainder of the ground. With reference to the Kop area, I understand that you
are confident that these plans are correct. I would be grateful if you would
confirm this.

I am pleased to note that you will be attending the General Purposes Panel
Meeting at 2.30 p.m. on Monday, the 27th November, since I am sure members will
require clarification of a large number of natters at that meeting.

Yours sincerely,




Head of Department

        I refer to the football match which took place at your Sports Ground on
        Tuesday evening, 21st November, 1989.

        As a result of the match, toe South Yorkshire Police have hlgftl igh ted' two
        a r e a s of concern:-


        (1)    the capacity restriction tor the North-West Upper Terrace*; and

        (2)   egress through the gate into Leppings Lane,

        Please will you forward details to rev Licensing Office by 3<?th *k>vprrfber,
(   j   1989 of how many persons were allowed into the North-West Upper Terrace on
        trie night.

        The capacity for the North-West Upper Terrace hab with your agteiaent ween
        reduced to 1 ,500. This amendment has been incorporated into th<- Safe ty
        Certificate and is effective iraaiediately.

        The   second area of concern relates to the egress oi people froia t:\i- Ground
        onto Leppings Lane. At the moaent people funnel through a gateway. A s
        people approach this gateway there is a bottleneck and a resultant slowing
        of movement.   One proposal put forward to alleviate this problem is the
        installation of a Bridge-link to the Sou in Stand. 1 unaerstand you have
        already costed this proposal and prepared p l a n s . This proposal is obviously

             Meeting at Haaaerton Road Polioe Station Wednesday 22nd November 1989 at 3 pra

             I refer to the above meeting attended by Mrs. F» Woodhead and Mr* Derricott
             (Administration and Legal Departaant) your Mr. A. Butler and Mr, D. Sheriff,
             Mr, Ryder and Hr. Woodhouse (South Yorkshire Fire Service) and Hr. Sleath and
             Hr. Beal (South Yorkshire Polioe and to your conversations with Ety Chief
             Licensing Officer Mr. Derricott on Thursday 23rd November, 1989.

             I now write to confirm the revised capacity figure for the Horth Vast Upper
             Terras© (Sheffield Wednesday Football Club): 1700 (exact calculation 1,698.3)
             reported to Mr# Dorrioott bf your Hr. Butler by telephone on 23rd IJovenber”. I
             understand the revision has been sad© after taking into account the fact that
             people have a restricted view of the playing area due to a perspex sheet which
             divides the Borth West Upper Terrace and the North Stand. Whan the Terrace is
             full sos© people have a restricted view which results in a movement of people
             to the centre of the Terrace and towards the West Stand. These areas
             therefore becoae crowded with people.

             I also understand the South Yorkshire Police had requested at the meeting a
             capacity restriction of 1500 and the Club had agreed to this. As the 1500
             figure is the lower of the two I have recosaaended to the Chair of the General
             Purposes Panel, Councillor Butler that the General Safety Certificate be
             amended to take, account of the lowest figure.

             The action will be reported to the General Purposes Panel at its meeting on
             Monday 27th Sovember, 1989 and the Chair has requested that either your Hr.
             Butler or Mr. Sheriff attend the Panel meeting to answer questions about the
             capacity revision. Pleas© will you arrange for either Mr. Butler or Mr.
             Sheriff to attend the Panel meeting on Monday.

             In the light of the capacity revision for the North West Upper Terrace
             Councillor Butler has also jaentioned that the Panel Bay request that other
             spectator areas in the certified sports grounds be re-assessed. ■

             Your Mr. Butler say also recall that the question of gangway(s) for this area
             was raised at the iseetlng. Pleas® will you explore the possibility of
             Installing gangways, if required, in this area. This natter will be discussed
             at the next Advisory Group aeeting on 6th December, 1989 at 10.30 a.®.

             The second area of concern highlighted by the Polls'? at the nesting was the
             means of escape/egress onto Leppings Lana, I understand the Police are
             concerned that a bottleneck occurs at the gate entrance/exit onto Leppings
             Lane. A solution was put forward i.e. asking the Club to build a bridge-link
             to the South Stand, but by its very nature this is not a proposal that oan be
             actioned in the near future. I realise that steps are being taken to gather
             further information but would you please give soee thought as to what action
             could be taken quickly to ease the problem. This matter will be raised at the
             next Advisory Croup aeeting for preliminary discussion.

          REPORT OF THE HEAD OF ADMINISTRATION AND LEGAL DEPARTMENT
                        TO THE GENERAL PURPOSES PANEL

                                  EMERGENCY ITEM

                SAFETY OF SPORTS GROUNDS ACT 1975 (AS AMENDED)

     Capacities of Terrace Areas at Certificated Football Grounds and in
particular the North West Upper Terrace, Sheffield Wednesday Football Ground


1 .   Introduction

1.1   On Wednesday, 22nd November, 1989 at the request of the South Yorkshire
      Police, Officers from the Administration and Legal Department, the
      Department of Land and Planning and the South Yorkshire Fire Service
      attended at Hammerton Road Police Station to view extracts from the
      Police video of the football match that had taken place at Hillsborough
      Sports Stadium the night.before.

1.2   The Police highlighted the problem that had been experienced by a
      number of spectators in the North West Upper Terrace of the Ground and
      the action they had taken to alleviate the problem.

1.3   It was suggested that in the absence of further data, a revised
      capacity of 1,500 be placed in this area and that the General Safety
      Certificate in respect of Sheffield Wednesday Football Club be amended
      to reflect this.  It was pointed out by the Police that the Club had no
      objection to this and the proposal was confirmed by Mr. Mackrell on
      behalf of the Club on Thursday, 23rd November, 1989.

1.4   The General Safety Certificate was amended with the approval of the
      Chairman of the General Purposes Panel on Friday, 24thNovember, 1989.
      I attach a copy of the amendment.

2.    Building Surveyor's Memorandum of 23rd November, 1989

2.1   Mr. Butler informed my Chief Licensing Officer (Sports Grounds), Mr.
      Derricott, in a telephone conversation at approximately 10.30 a.m. on
      23rd November, that Mr. Strange of Messrs. Eastwood & Partners,
      Consulting Engineers, had spoken to Mr. Sherriff, Principal Structural
      Engineer, Department of Land and Planning, and suggested that the plan
      on which capacities had been calculated for the North West Upper
      Terrace of the West Terrace was incorrect.

2.2   Mr. Butler confirmed this in a memorandum to me dated 23rd November,
      1989, and received by my Chief Licensing Officer at 11.30 a.m. on 24th
      November, 1989.  I would draw your attention to paragraph 6 of the
      memorandum.

2.3   The capacity of 2,300 was incorporated into the Safety Certificate
      after I received a memorandum from the Building Surveyor dated 11th
      August, 1989 (copy attached).  This amendment was authorised by the
      Panel at its meeting on 17th August, 1989.
    Messrs. Eastwood & Partners

    My Assistant Solicitor, Mrs. Woodhead, telephoned Messrs. Eastwood &
    Partners on Friday afternoon, 24th November, 1989 at approximately
    1.00 p.m. and spoke with a Mr. Strange.

    Mr. Strange pointed out that a revised plan was being drawn up based on
    calculations that had been made that day. He informed my Assistant
    Solicitor that the initial calculations for the area put the capacity
    at 1,594. This figure has not yet been confirmed by Messrs. Eastwood &
    Partners.

    My Assistant Solicitor queried whether or not the plans for the Spion
    Kop Terrace area were correct. Mr. Strange confirmed that the plans
    deposited with the Council for the Spion Kop were, as far as he was
    aware, up to date and correct.

    I have written to Messrs. Eastwood & Partners confirming my Assistant
    Solicitor's telephone conversation and inviting a representative to the
    Panel meeting on 27th November (copy letter attached).

    Items for Consideration

    To confirm the actions of the Chairman in conjunction with the Head of
    Administration and Legal Department in authorising the amendment to the
    General Safety Certificate in respect of Sheffield Wednesday Football
    Club reducing the capacity for the North West Terrace Upper from 2,300
    to 1,500.

2   To consider what further action, if any, is needed in view of the
    forthcoming match on Wednesday, 29th November, 1989.

3   To consider asking the Club to submit a full set of plans in respect of
    the Ground for the purposes of reassessing capacities.

    Documents Attached

1   The amended Schedule of Capacities incorporated into the General Safety
    Certificate for Sheffield Wednesday Football Club.

2   The Building Surveyor's memoranda dated 11th August, 1989 and 23rd
    November, 1989.

3   My letter to Messrs. Eastwood & Partners dated 24th November, 1989.

                                     Estimated Terrace Capacity

            I refer to the telephone call between Mr. Bownes and my Principal District
            Surveyor, Mr. Butler, earlier this afternoon.

            The approximate holding capacities produced for the standing terrace
            areas do not take account of any turnstile ingress limitations, or
            those of egress or emergency egress limitations since it is my understanding
            that the Fire Authority will consider all these matters being that they
            have the primary function of estimation of terrace capacity.

            These figures therefore need to be carefully checked with those produced
            by the Fire Authority to ensure that account is taken of the need for
            any further limitations for the purposes of the proposed certificate
            amendment.

            My calculations based on the "green guide" modified by the Taylor Inquiry
            recommendations give the following

            1. Spion Kop                            18,200
            2. North West Terrace (Upper)            2,300
            3. North West Corner (Lower)                680        (Pen 7)

            In accordance with our consultations, figures have not been produced for
            Pens one to six of the West Terrace.

            I would appreciate the sight of the Fire Authority figures before the
            Certificate is amended.

                  Sheffield Wednesday Football Club PIC
                  Capacity of Opper North fest Terrace

                  Subsequent to a meeting at Hanmerton Read Police Station on 22nd November
                  to discuss various natters arising from the match between Sheffield
                  Wednesday and Sheffield United on 21st November, I have had cause to
                  revise the recomnended holding capacity for this area of the ground.

                  You will recall that the present capacity figures were produced within
                  hours, on list August, 1989, and therefore only a paper exercise was
                  carried out in that restrictive tine.                 *•'

                  A site visit earlier today revealed the extent of the area of terrace
                  partially blinded by the screen between the North West Terrace and the
                  North Stand.

                  Accordingly that area has been emitted from the gross available area of
                  terrace.

                  The holding capacity of the remaining areas has been re-calculated and
                  modified in accordance with the Taylor recoranendations, giving a resultant
                  figure of 1,700.

                  Eastwood and Partners drawing number 1610/6 4E has been used for the layout
                  of this area. In a telephone conversation between Mr Strange of Eastwood
                  and Partners and rny Principal Structural Engineer, late this afternoon, it
                  was interested that this drawing may not be accurate, and that the gross
                  available space may be slightly snail er than is shown on the drawing.

                  Until the area has been resurveyed and revised drawings received, I would
                  recommend that the holding capacity for the Upper North West Terrace be a
                  maximum of 1,500.

     I refer to your telephone conversation with Mrs. Woodhe&d on the 24th November,
     1989. I confirm that the Chair of the General Purposae fteael %»« authorised
     that the safety certificate be amended to reflect the fact'tSisut the capacity of
     the north west terrace should be reduced to £1,500 In tie* e£ tS« crowd control
     difficulties there vere at the match on the 21st Hovember. T e n d e r s t a n d that
     this accords with the new calculations you have made this ,»eek. 1 look forward
     to hearing from you with the revised plan you have prepared «f this portion of
     the stadium.

     As you are aware from the conversation with Mrs. Wctodhead, tfce Suilding Surveyor
     has advised me that the plan upon which the original calcals£±ens was based was
     incorrect.  In view of the fact that fresh calculations have %een made in
     respect of the north west corner, this appears to resolve the .problem in that
     respect. However, I am concerned about: the plans and calculations for the
     remainder of the ground. With reference to the Kop area, 1 understand that: you
     are confident that these plana are correct.  I would be grateful if you vould
     confirm this.

     I am pleased to note that you will be attending the General Purposes Panel
     Meeting at 2.30 p.m. on Monday, the 27th November, since I am sure members will
     require clarification of a large nunber of matters at that meeting.

    #   (1)   SAFETY OF SPORTS GROUNDS
                        The Panel considered a number of items relating to the
              safety of sports grounds.  The meeting was attended by
              representatives of the South Yorkshire Police, the South Yorkshire
              Fire Brigade, the Building Surveyor, the Director of Health and
              Consumer Services, Sheffield Wednesday Football Cl ub, Owlerton
              Sports Stadium Ltd., and the Consultant Engineers for the
              proprietors of the sports grounds concerned.

               Crowd Capacities at Sports Grounds
                          The Head of Administration and Legal Department submitted
               a report on action taken to reduce the permitted crowd capacity of
              . the North West Upper Terrace at the Hillsborough Stadium as a result
               of the viewing by Officers of the Administration and Legal
               Department, the Department of Land and Planning and the South
               Yorkshire Fire Service of extracts from a Police video of the
               football match held there on 21st November, 1989. The report
               indicated that the crow capacity figure for that area in the General
               Safety Certificate for the Ground of 2,300 had therefore been
                reduced to 1,500 with the approval of the Chair of the Panel but
                there remained some doubt as to the correct figure because of
               possible inaccuracies in the plans used for the calculations.
\              RESOLVED: That (a) confirmation be given to the action taken by the
               Head of Administration and Legal Department, in consultation with
                the Chair, in issuing an amendment to the Certificate for the Ground
                indicating a reduced capacity for the North West Upper Terrace of
                1,500;
                          (b) in view of the possible inaccuracies now mentioned in
                the plans used for the calculations, and after hearing from Mr. J.
                Strange of Eastwood and Partners, Consultant Engineers, a further
                reduction to 1,400 in the permitted crowd capacity of the North West
               Upper Terrace be implemented; and
                          (c) the Safety of Sports Grounds Advisory Group be
                requested to issue appropriate guidelines for use by the proprietors
               of sports grounds in the City in the preparation of crowd-capacity
                plans.

               (NOTE: In accordance with the provisions of Section 100B(4)(b) of
               the Local Government Act 1972, as amended by the Local Government
               (Access to Information) Act 1985, the Chair of the Committee
               (Councillor Butler) decided that the above item should be considered
               as a matter of urgency, as the matter had arisen after the despatch
               of the agenda and was of a serious nature.)

          Note 2.1 states:-

                   Mr Butler informed by Chief Licensing Officer (Sports Grounds), Mr Derricott,
                  in a telephone conversation at approximately 10.30 am on 23rd November,
                  that Mr Strange of Messrs Eastwood &Partners, Consulting Engineers,
                  had spoken to Mr Sherriff, Principal Structural Engineer, Department
                  of Land and Planning, and suggested that the plan on which capacities
                  had been calculated for the North West UpDer Terrace of the West Terrace
                  was incorrect1.

          My understanding is that the scale of the plan referred to showed the North
          West Upper Terrace as being larger than it actually is. Can you please confirm
          that fact or otherwise?

          Additionally, I am anxious to ascertain the accuracy of the plans and the
          subsequent calculation of the capacity for the Leppings Lane Terrace prior
          to 15 April 1989. Again, can you assist, please?

          Yours sincerely

                    DRAFT OF PROPOSED SUMMARY OF AGREED FACTS


Sheffield Wednesday Football Club was formed in 1867 and elected to the
Football League in 1892.  Sheffield Wednesday moved to their present ground at
Hillsborough in 1859. Rubbish was tipped at either end of the pitch to form
banking and a stand moved from their previous ground was erected on the site o£
the present South Stand.  This was replaced in 1913 by the exisitihg South
Stand, the Spion Kop being added in 1914, the North Stand in 1961 and the West                            IV*.                          OCbLot                         tOCWwS                              pV\W
Stand in 1965 following the decision to stage a number of World Cup games at
the venue in 1966.

Since 1912 30 FA Cup Semi-Finals, 19 International and 3 World Cup matches have
been played at this venue.  In addition the stadium has been used to stage
religious meetings, a basketball display, world class tennis and schools
display for the Queen in 1954, The record crowd for the ground Ls 72,841 in
1934.

Hillsborough Stadium was designated in 1975 under the safety of Sports Grounds

The Leppings Lane End of the Ground has been the focus of attention throughout                               |M^                             be.
the Inquiry. On 15 April 1989 this End was allocated to the Liverpool Football
Club Supporters and in order to gain entry into the ground,whether it be to a
seating or standing area, supporters first had to     negotiate theironperimeter
gates situated at the funnel entrance to the ground immediately before the
turnstiles.  These gates are set out in a bank of six double gates and are
situated across the mouth of the entrance into the ground from Leppings Lane,
They are made of wrought iron and painted blue.

Having negotiated these gates the supporters would enter a courtyard.  This
area is shaped like a funnel between the outer perimeter gates and turnstiles 1
to 16 and A - G. In normal league matches access can also be given to
turnstiles 19-22 and 23-28.  This was not so on 15 April 1989.

The courtyard is divided by a wall of metal construction running from the                                   (S-wCC-        inscfcfe-f

perimeter gates to the brick wall of turnstile 16. There is also a metal
barrier running almost parallel to this from half way across the courtyard to
the wall adjoining turnstile G, The effect of this is to divide the courtyard
between the two banks of turnstile 1 to 16 and A to G and create a funnel for
people towards the appropriate turn9tiles depending on which part of the ground
they wish to enter.

 The wall of metal construction was built in 1985 to segregate home and away
 supporters. At about the same time proposals by Eastwood and Partners, which
 would have achieved enclosures having their own turnstile entrances and
 individual crowd capacities, were rejected by the Club.



                                                                          ..   .... ......... .
There are a total of 95 turnstiles at Hillsborough, 12 of which (Nos 77 - 88)
were not in use for reasons of segregation on 15 April 1989.  Nottingham Forest
fans were allocated 60 and Liverpool the remaining 23 all from Leppings Lane.

The 23 turnstiles in Leppings Lane contained in two sections 1 to 16 and A to
G, are divided by the metal wall previously mentioned.  They were designed in
such a way that turnstiles 1 to 10 served the West side of the North Stand
seated area, 11 to 16 the West Stand seated area and A to G the West Stand
terraces. In actual fact turnstiles 11 to 1$ and A to G give access to the          A lo r r c M           usvlfcr
same concourse area at the rear of the West Stand. Confusion was caused by the
turnstiles being signed from left to right A.C.B.  The tickets given to
supporters added to the confusion and the general layout once inside the iron
perimeter gates caused congestion if a supporter needed to get from turnstiles
A to G to l to 16 or vice versa.

As a result if a supporter went through the outer perimeter iron gates towards
turnstiles A-G and found he needed turnstiles 1-16 he would have to return
through the outer perimeter iron gates into Leppings Lane and then to the
correct turnstile.

Also in this area are three Exit Gates A, B and C. These Gates are large
concertina type metal gates measuring 4.064 metres across and 2.184 metres
high, except ’B' gate which is 3.2 metres high.  They were built in 1985 during
modifications to the turnstiles and concourse area. Both sides of the gates
closed towards the centre and are operated from the inside only they were
painted blue and were capable of being locked and bolted. In each pair of
gates one was fitted with a non-opening glass observation panel at about eye
level.

Looking from Leppings Lane Gate 'A* is situated to the left of turnstile 1 and
adjoins the outer perimeter wall of the ground running parallel to Vere .Road,
Gate ’B ’ is at the end of the metal wall across the courtyard and between
turnstiles 16 and A, Gate ’C is located to-,the right in the wall running
parallel with the River Don beyond turnstiles A to G.

Emergency Gate *E’ is a email concertina type gate opening from inside only and
located in the wall running parallel with the River Don, immediately before it ..
joins the side of the South Stand and behind the Police Control Box.

Beyond the turnstiles and behind the West Stand is a concourse area which is
divided into three sections, Each of these sections serves a different part of
the West and North Stands and the West Terraces.  The three sections are
created by a metal fence and a brick wall.  There was no access from the
central concourse through the metal fence to the North Stand section but a
gate in the brick wall did give access throughout the standing terrace
concourse area.

 Entrance through turnstiles 1-10 would only give access to the North concourse
 area and thus the seated North Stand.

 There were a total of six portacabins on the concourse at the rear of the West             >K v vdU   .
 Stand.  Of these, two serviced the turnstiles in the northern part of the
 concourse at the rear of turnstiles 11-16. The portacabins were variously used
 for selling programmes or souvenirs and in one case by the Police to store
 property seized from supporters. One of these portacabins was positioned
 behind gate *B' near to the brick wal^giving access throughout the stand
 terrace concourse area.

 Having entered through one of the turnstiles A to G and on the southern part of
 the concourse, supporters could either go to their left through the gate in the
 wall and into the central concourse area giving access into enclosures 6 and 7
 or up to the West Stand seating area; straight ahead into the tunnel and
 enclosure 3 and A; or round to the right and either up another access into the
 seated area or alongside the West Stand into enclosure 1 and 2.
                                       - 3 -


That explained, the main sign for the standing areas, measuring 2.591 metres x
.305 metres was immediately above the entrance to the tunnel and comprised of
the word ’STANDING* in .18 metres letter painted in blue on a white
background,   Positioned on both sides of this sign were the letters B + A
respectively.   In the normal course o£ events, following letter *B’ would take
supporters along the left hand side of the tunnel and into enclosure 4.
Likewise following the letter ’A ’ would take'.supporters up the right hand side
of the tunnel and into enclosure 3.

The only other sign on this concourse section indicating a standing area was a
small one at a height of 3.658 metres in letters .09 metres high on a concrete
pillar to the right supporting the Vest Stand.  This directs supporters along
the side of the Stand and into enclosures 1 and 2. No signs existed on this
part of the concourse to indicate that access to standing areas in enclosures 6
and 7 could be reached by going to the left through the gate in the wall.

The tunnel is 22.17 metres long and unlit.  It is located under the seating
area of the West Stand and is used primarily by supporters entering through
turnstiles A to G. Rising at first it then levels off briefly before
descending towards the terraces on a gradient of around 1 in 6.
The recommended gradient from the Green Guide is 1 in 1 0 . The tunnel was of
course built prior to the introduction of this Guide.

As the tunnel opens out on to the terrace a radial fence divides enclosure 3
and 4. Enclosure 3 is on the right and enclosure 4 on the left as you enter.
Short walls on either side extend out into the enclosures.  There are gates at
the tunnel concourse entrance capable of being closed.  In addition it is
possible to close off each enclosure {3 and 4) by a gate to each at the
enclosure end of the tunnel.

At the rear of the terraces and where the radial fences finish are gates which
provide access to those persons wishing to walk along the terraces. Thus there
is unrestricted access to each enclosure if these gates are left open. Anyone
entering enclosures 3 and 4 and wishing to then enter enclosures 2 or 5 would
in effect have to take a couple of paces backwards to the rear of the pen and
walk alongside the real wall.

Running parallel to the goal line across the front of the West Stand seated
area, are the terraces with a total of 7 enclosures, numbered by their gates       1   ' ftxieM S kfu r
from left to right as you look at them from the pitch, i.e. enclosure 1 is in
the South West Corner, immediately under the Police Control box and enclosure 7
is in the North West Corner. Both corners are banked higher than the rest of
the terracing, with enclosure 5 being a sterile area or void, unused by
spectators.  The terracing gradient has been identified as between 1 in 4 and 1
in 4.5, on the West Terraces.

There are 3 rows of barriers on the terraces in enclosures 3 and 4 running
parellel with the goal line. The barriers are of two designs; those fitted by
Husband and Co., the previous engineers, and those fitted by Eastwood and
Partners the current engineers.  In 1986 barrier 144 was removed from enclosure
3 to facilitate easier crowd movements. This has been the only significant
change in barrier configuration on the Leppings Lane terraces.

Perimeter fencing was installed in 1977. At the front of the terrace this
fence is 2.896 metres high, comprising of heavy gage metal wire supported at
intervals by metal posts set in concrete which in turn are supported on the
pitch side by metal frames. At the top of each of these fences .381 metres of
wire folds inwards. This is designed to make it harder for fans to climb over
the fence onto the perimeter track or the pitch. The wire is welded to the
metal supports for strength and rigidity.

           In each of the enclosures there i8 a numbered gate to the perimeter track which
           is primarily designed for access to the enclosure in an emergency.  Eastwood
           and Partners have measured the width of Gate 3 as 0.85 metres and Gate 4 as
           0.83 metres between the gate posts. These gates are smaller than the Green
           Guide recommendation (1.1m) but they were constructed before this minimal width
           was suggested.

           Originally the West Terrace was completely open. Radial fencing between the
           perimeter fence and wall of the West stand, and which created three large
           enclosures, was installed in 1981. Further radial fencing was added in 1985
           dividing the large centre enclosures into what are now enclosures 3, 4 and the
           void enclosure 5. This radial fencing is 1.68 metres high and comprises of
           blue painted metal bars and was erected at the request of the Police to
           facilitate crowd control. This was agreed by the Officer Working Party.
           Enclosure 1 and 2 and 6 and 7, are not further subdivided by radial fences. In
           fact they are still the large enclosures as orginally created in 1981.

           Schedule 2, Paragraph 3, of the Safety certificate specifies the number of
           spectators admitted to the stadium. Part 1 of Schedule 3 details the number of
           spectators permitted in various section of the ground, a figure which should
           not be exceeded. The relevant capacities are:-
                                West terrace         7,200
                                North West terrace   2,900
           In late 1989 some 6 months after the disaster it was discovered that the
           capacity for the North West Terrace was wrong having been Calculated with the
           wrong scale.   The result was that 2,900 was excessive. The revised figure is
           now 1,500.   The figure is based on an amended Certificate issued by Sheffield
           City Council on the 24 November 1989.

           In 1981 when the first radial fences were installed on the terraces, creating
           the 3 large enclosures a crowd capacity of 2,200 was declared for the centre
           enclosure by Dr EASTWOOD based on calculations in the 1976 Green Guide. When
           this large enclosures was divided in 1985 into enclosures 3 and 4 and the void
           5, Eastwood and Partners split the capacities as follows:- 1,200 into enclosure
           3 and 1,000 for enclosure 4. These figures were included on a plan of
           Eastwoods but the author of the figures has not been identifed.  These new
           capacities were never referred, it seems, to the Council or the Club in order
           that the Safety Certificate could be amended.  In any event the ability to
           restrict those enclosures to those capacities was not possible with the                \J6V possitoU.                  -Mr*   ^y-<3w*-v£A.               -'fcfev'v   uoitU   -ttsioatr Ictyo-cr*"
           turnstile system in operation.

           It also appears that despite the introduction of these additional radial fences
           which created the void enclosure 5, no amendment was considered to the overall         fV©                fV \c*^C L
           capacity of the West Terrace even though the barrier configuration remained the
           same (until 1986).

           Access to the West Stand which is all seating is by way of turnstiles 11 to 16
           and A to G, using the staircases off the concourse.  The front of the West
           Stand overlooks the terraces, giving seated spectators a view of the terraces.                          kpwe      c\                    i& v ^ a o z ,
           The West Stand is divided by gangways for safety purposes. At the rear of the
           West Stand is a refreshment kiosk.

           The Police Control Box is situated in an elevated position in the South West
           Corner of the ground overlooking the Leppings Lane Terraces, a distance of 35
           meters from gate 3 and 47.5 meters from Gate 4. The control Box houses the
           Police Communications’System and Video Monitors for the five fully remote
           controlled cameras which are operated from this location. There is also a
           facility for the Police to over-ride the ground tannoy system usually operated
           by the disc jockey.

           A Club Control Room is situated on the ground floor at the rear of the South
           Stand, close to the players changing rooms.

           There is no view of the pitch from this room. The occupants monitor the entry
           through the turnstiles around the ground, with a computer supplying 'print
           outs’ for the ground management purposes.  The room also contains the TV
           monitors from the various cameras located at turnstiles around the ground.
           Recordings are made on a bank of 16 video recorders.  There is an ability to
           monitor any one of the five C.C.T.V.s being operated by the Police from their
           control box on request to them. A telephone connects the Police Control to the
           Club Control Room.

           In addition this Club Control room, acts as the main base station for the Club
           personal radio scheme. This rpdio system is used by Senior Stewards, Security
           Officers and Management on a talk-through basis.

           The Director’s Box is centrally situated overlooking the pitch in.the upper
           tier of the South Stand.  There is access to the board room, the office complex
           below, the Nostalgia Bar and Steps Restaurant to the rear of the South Stand.

           The current tannoy public address system was upgraded in 1998 and broadcasts to
           locations in and around the ground, including the Leppings Lane turnstiles.
           Capable of being directed selectively to areas of the ground the system is
           operated from the South Stand near to the Police Control Box, by a Disc Jockey
           employed by the Club. Normally used for Club announcements and musical
           entertainment, the system can be over-ridden by the Police from their Ground
           Control Box.

           Situated to the right of the Police Control Box, when looking from the pitch
           above the Finlux TV and video Sign is an electronic clock. A board is also
           located there being capable of displaying messages.

           The Police Room is located under the North Stand adjacent to the First Aid
           Room.  It is used as the detention and documentation room for persons arrested
           or being ejected from the ground,

           A first Aid Room is required uhder Schedule 2, Paragraph 8(1) of the Safety
           Certificate.  This room, which was upgraded in 1979, is manned by the St John
           Ambulance Brigade personnel during matches.  St. John Ambulance Staff advise
           the Club on the purchase of equipment for the room which is located on the
           ground floor at the rear of the North Stand alongside the Police room. A
           gymnasium is situated at the rear of the North Stand.

           A purpose built commentary box is located above the South.Stand.

           As previously mentioned, the Club have staged many large scale functions at
           Hillsborough.  These can give some indication of the level of their experience
           and that of the other agencies involved. That said, during the course of
           enquiries in connection with the disaster evidence has emerged of crushing
           involving supporters in the West stand terracing at previous F.A. Cup Semi
           Finals.

           The Semi-Finals concerned are 1956, 1981, 1987 and 1988.

           In 1956 a match was played between Birmingham City and Sunderland and took
           place on 17 March 1956, where a surge of people caused crushing on the West
           Stand terracing.

           On 11 April 1981 a Semi-Final was held between Tottenham Hotspur and
           Wolverhampton Wanderers. This is the best document and the most serious of the
           previous incidents.  Tottenham fans arrived late due to a combination of
           difficulties on the Ml Motorway and local diversions.  There was crushing on
           the Leppings Lane terraces and during this match.

The Police and Sheffield Wednesday Football Club held discussions following
this incident and the evidence points to the later implementation of the radial
fences forming initially five large enclosures (the centre enclosure being
later divided into enclosures 3,4 and 5), being the action taken to prevent a
similar incident.

On 12 April 1987, a Semi Final between Leeds United and Coventry City was
played. Evidence from one supporter suggests•there was overcrowding on the
Leppings Lane terraces.

In 1988 the Semi Final took place between Nottingham Forest and Liverpool.
Evidence obtained suggested crushing occurred on the Leppings Lane terraces.
There is no evidence, however/ to show the 1987 or 1988 incidents were brought
to the notice of the Police or Sheffield Wednesday Football Club.

The Hillsborough Football Stadium was designated under the provisions of the
Safety at Sports Ground Act 1975, on 1 January 1979, the safety Certificate for
Hillsborough was issued by South Yorkshire County Councul on 21 December 1979,
on Sheffield Wednesday Football Club’s promotion to the Second Division.
Attached to the Certificate are a number of schedules.  Schedule 1 deals with
Interpretation; Schedule 2, the General Terms and Conditions; and Schedule 3,
Crowd Capacity and Safety Stewards.

South Yorkshire County Council, as the issuing authority, was responsible for

1986 when reponsibility was transferred to Sheffield City Council.  The Officer

Yorkshire Metropolitan Ambulance Service.

At the time the County Council transferred responsibilty for licensing to the
City Council, there was a prepared schedule of responsibilities under the
Safety of Sports Ground Act 1975 in existence.  This document showed the
responsibilities of the County, Police, Fire Brigade and Building Control
Authority. According to correspondence this scheduule was adopted by the City
                                                                                                                                                                    sou/vyc.   IWrs'v-^gl-n^v'Ct •
Council which meant they then assumed the former County and Building Control
functions.

In July 1987, these responsibilities were re-drawn by the City Council in draft
form in a document entitled ’Division of Responsibilities between Authorities*,
which proposed responsibilities being divided between the'Building Surveyors
(Department of Land and Planning) and the Director of Environmental Health and                ^^pc^vo\W\.UV>'«€-S     v*3«-ce-    cJL&o    cb ^cb a -e k                       'ttu z     PSUlee-             ifc a

PRIVATE AND CONFIDENTIAL


20th November, 1990


NOTE TO MR. MAXWELL

Application for certain witnesses not to give evidence on the basis that any
questions put to them they can refuse to answer because they may incriminate
themselves.

You will see from pages 25 to 53 and 83 to 97 that the representative of
Mr. Duckenfield made an application that his client should not be put in the
witness box.   The arguments for that application are set out in full in the
transcript.

A number of other representatives then joined in that application, in
particular the police officers who I presume were also interviewed under
caution and Sheffield Wednesday Football Club.

David Bownes has asked if applications in respect of himself and Arthur Butler
should be also made on this basis.

I have had a brief word with David and confirmed that it is a point that is
being considered, but the possible consequences of such an application should
also be borne in mind.   In particular, if we stand up and say they will not
give evidence because they may incriminate themselves, this may move attention
to the local authority and to them as individuals, which has so far been
directed elsewhere.

I note from the transcript that the suggestion is that other people could give
that evidence other than the individuals themselves.   It may be in David’s
mind that someone else could give both his and Arthur’s evidence and
consideration needs to be given to this point as well.

I assume that you are aware that both David Bownes and Arthur Butler were
interviewed by West Midlands Police and Section 9 statements taken, but those
interviews were not under caution.   They were informed that they were being
interviewed as potential witnesses.

Thera are a total of 95 turnstiles at Hillsborough, 12 of which (Nos 7 7 - 8 2 }
were not in use for reasons of segregation on 15 April 1989. Nottingham Forest
fans were allocated 60 and Liverpool the remaining 23 all from Leppings Lane.

The 23 turnstiles in Leppings Lane contained in two sections 1 to 15 and A to
G, are divided by the metal wall previously mentioned.  They were designed in
auch a way that turnstiles 1 to 10 served the West side of the North Stand
seated area, 11 to IS the Vest Stand seated area and A to G the West Stand
terraces. In actual fact turnstiles 11 to 15 and A .to G give access to the
same concourse area at the rear of the West Stand. Confusion was caused by the
turnstiles being signed from left to right A.C.B. The tickets given to
supporters added to the confusion and the general layout once inside the iron
perimeter gates caused congestion if a supporter needed to get from turnstiles
A to G to l to 16 or vice versa.

As a result if a supporter went through the outer perimeter iron gates towards
turnstiles A-G and found he needed turnstiles 1-15 he would have to return
through the outer perimeter iron gates into Leppir.gs Lane and then to the
correct turnstile.

Also in this area are three Exit Gates A, B and C. These Gates are large
concertina type metal gates measuring 4.064 metres across and 2.134 metres
high, except ’B ’ gate which is 3.2 metres high. They were built in 1985 during
modifications to the turnstiles and concourse area. Both sides of the gates
closed towards the centre and are operated from the inside only they were
painted blue and were capable of being locked and bolted.  In each pair of
gates one was fitted with a non-opening glass observation panel at about eye
level.

Looking from Leppings Lane Gate ’A ’ is situated to the left of turnstile 1 and
adjoins the outer perimeter wall of the ground running parallel to Vera Road.
Gate ’B ’ is at the end of the metal wall across the courtyard and between
turnstiles 16 and A. Gate ’C ’ is located to the right in the wall running
parallel with the River Don beyond turnstiles A to G.

Emergency Gate ’E' i9 a small concertina type gate opening from inside only and
located in the wall running parallel with the River Don, immediately before it
joins the side of the South Stand and behind the police Control Box.

Beyond the turnstiles and behind the West Stand is a concourse area which is
divided into three sections. Each of these sections serves a different part of
the West and North Stands and the West Terraces. The three sections are
created by a metal fence and a brick wail. There was no access from the
central concourse through the metal fence to the North Stand section but a
gate in the brick wall did give access throughout the standing terrace
concourse area.

Entrance through turnstiles 1-10 would only give access to the North concourse
area and thus the seated North Stand.

There were a total of six portacabins on the   concourse at the rear of theWest
Stand. Of these, two serviced the turnstilesin the northern part     of the
concourse at the rear of turnstiles 11-16. The portacabins were variously used
for selling programmes or souvenirs and in one case by the Police to store
property seized from supporters. One of these portacabins was positioned
behind gate ’B* near to the brick wall giving access throughout the stand
terrace concourse area.

Having entered through one of the turnstiles A to G and on the southern part of
the concourse, supporters could either go to their left through the gate in the
wall and into the central concourse area giving access into enclosures 6 and 7
or up to the West Stand seating area; straight ahead into the tunnel and
enclosure 3 and 4; or round to the right and   either up another access   intothe
seated area or alongside the West Stand into   enclosure 1 and 2.
That explained, the main sign for the standing areas, measuring 2.591 metres x
.305 metres was immediately above the entrance to the tunnel and comprised of
the. word ’STANDING' in .18 metres letter painted in blue on a white
background,   Positioned on both sides of this sign were the letters B + A
respectively.   In the normal course o£ events, following letter *B’ would take
supporters along the left hand side of the tunnel and into enclosure 4.
Likewise following the letter ’A ’ would take supporters up the right hand side
of the tunnel and into enclosure 3.

The only other sign on this concourse .section indicating a standing area was a
small one at a height of 3.658 metres in letters .09 metres high on a concrete
pillar to the right supporting the Vest Stand. This directs supporters along
the side o f the Stand and into enclosures 1 and 2. No signs existed on this
part of the concourse to indicate that access to standing areas in enclosures 6
and 7 could be reached by going to the left through the gate in the wall.

The tunnel is 22.17 metres long and unlit. It is located under the seating
area of the West Stand and is used primarily by supporters entering through
turnstiles A to G. Rising at first it then levels off briefly before
descending towards the terraces on a gradient of around 1 in 6.
The recommended gradient from the Green Guide is 1 in 10. The tunnel was of
course built prior to the introduction of this Guide.

As the tunnel opens out on to the terrace a radial fence divides enclosure 3
and 4. Enclosure 3 is on the right and enclosure 4 on the left as you enter.
Short walls on either side extend out into the enclosures. There are gates at
the tunnel concourse entrance capable of being closed,  In addition it is
possible to class off each enclosure (3 and 4) by a gate to each at the
enclosure end of the tunnel.

At the rear of the terraces and where the radial fences finish are gates which
provide access to those persons wishing to walk along the terraces. Thus there
is unrestricted access to each enclosure if these gates are left open. Anyone
entering enclosures 3 and 4 and wishing to then enter enclosures 2 or 5 would
in effect have to take a couple of paces backwards to the rear of the pen and
walk alongside the real wall.

Running parallel to the goal line across the front of the Vest Stand seated
area, are the terraces with a total of 7 enclosures, numbered by their gates
from left to right as you look at them from the pitch, i.e. enclosure 1 is in
the South West Corner, immediately under the Police Control box and enclosure 7
is in the North Vest Corner. Both corners are banked higher than the rest of
the terracing, with enclosure 5 being a sterile area or void, unused by
spectators.  The terracing gradient has been identified as between 1 in 4 and 1
in 4.5, on the Vest Terraces.

There are 3 rows of barriers on the terraces in enclosures 3 and 4 running
parallel with the goal line. The barriers are of two designs; those fitted by
Husband and Co., the previous engineers, and those fitted by Eastwood and
Partners the current engineers.  In 1985 barrier 144 was removed froir. enclosure
3 to facilitate easier crowd movements. This has been the only significant
change in barrier configuration on the Leppings Lane terraces/

Perimeter fencing was installed in 1977. At the front of the terrace this
fence is 2.896 metres high, comprising of heavy gage metal wire supported at
intervals by metal posts set in concrete which in turn are supported on the
pitch side by metal frames. At the top of each of these fences .381 metres of
wire folds inwards. This is designed to make it harder for fans to climb over
the fence onto the perimeter track or the pitch. The wire is welded to the
metal supports for strength and rigidity.

         Xn each of the enclosures there is a numbered gate to the perimeter track which
         is primarily designed for access to the enclosure' in an emergency.  Eastwood
         and Partners have measured the width of Gate 3 as 0.85 metres and Gate 4 as
         0.83 metres between the gate posts, These gates ate smaller than the Green                                                           i
         Guide- recommendation (1.1m) but they were constructed before this minimal width
         was suggested.

         Originally the Vest Terrace was completely open. Radial fencing between the
         perimeter^ fence and wall of the West stand, and which created three large
         enclosures, was installed in 1981. Further radial fencing was added in 1985
         dividing the large centre enclosures into what are now enclosures 3, 4 and the
         void enclosure 5. This radial fencing is 1.68 metres high and comprises of
         blue painted metal bars and was erected at the request of the Police to
         facilitate crowd control. This was agreed by the Officer Working Party.
         Enclosure 1 and 2 and 6 and 7, are not further subdivided by radial fences.  In
         fact they are still the large enclosures as orginally created in 1981.

         Schedule 2, Paragraph 3, of the Safety certificate specifies the number of
         spectators admitted to the stadium. Part 1 of Schedule 3 details the number of
         spectators permitted in various section of the ground, a figure which should
         not be exceeded. The relevant capacities are:-
                              West terrace         7,200
                              North West terrace   2,900                                                                          CAPACITY                   « L     Th*         i»eStrN   o«Cr*          f& g U A C *       u M *-

         that the Safety Certificate could be amended. In any event the ability to
         restrict those enclosures to those capacities was not possible with the
         turnstile system in operation.

         It also appears that despite the introduction of these additional radial fences
         which created the void enclosure 5, no amendment was considered to the overall
         capacity of the West Terrace even though the barrier configuration remained the
         same (until 1936).

         Access to the West Stand which is all seating is by way of turnstiles 11 to 16
         and A to G, using the staircases off the concourse. The front of the West
         Stand overlooks the terraces, giving seated spectators a view of the terraces.
         The West Stand is divided by gangways for safety purposes, At the rear of the
         West Stand is a refreshment kiosk.

         The Police Control Box is situated in an elevated position in the South West
         Corner of .the ground overlooking the Leppings Lane Terraces, a distance of 35
         meters from gate 3 and 47.5 meters from Gate 4. The control Box houses the
         Police Communications System and Video Monitors for the five fully remote
         controlled cameras which are operated from this location. There is also a
         facility for the Police to over-ride the ground tannoy system usually operated
         by the disc jockey.

             A Club Control Room is situated on the ground floor at the rear of the South
             Stand, close to the players changing rooms.

         There is no view of the pitch from this room. The occupants monitor the entry
         through the turnstiles around the ground,-with a- computer supplying ’print
         outs’ for the ground management purposes. The room also contains the TV
         monitors from the various cameras located at turnstiles around the ground.
         Recordings are made on a bank of 16 video recorders.   There is an ability to
         monitor any one of the five C.C.T.V.s being operated by the Police from their
         control box on request to them. A telephone connects the Police Control to the
         Club Control Room.

             In addition this Club Control room, acts as the main base station for the Club
             personal radio scheme. This r^dio system is used by Senior Stewards, Security
             Officers and Management on a talk-through basis.

             The Director's Box is centrally situated overlooking the pitch in the upper
             tier of the South Stand.  There is access to the board room, the office complex
             below, the Nostalgia Bar and Steps Restaurant to the rear of the South Stand.

             The current tannoy public address system was upgraded in 1988 and broadcasts to
             locations in and around the ground, including the Leppings Lane turnstiles.
             Capable of being directed selectively to areas of the ground the system is
             operated from the South Stand near to the Police Control Box, by a Disc Jockey
             employed by the Club. Normally used for Club announcements and musical
             entertainment, the system can be over-ridden by the Police from their Ground
             Control Box.

             Situated to the right of the Police Control Box, when looking from the pitch
             above the Finlux TV and video sign is an electronic clock. A board is also
             located there being capable of displaying messages.

             The Police Room is located under the North Stand adjacent to the First Aid
             Room. It is used as the detention and documentation room for persons arrested
             or being ejected from the ground.

          A first Aid Room is required uhder Schedule 2, Paragraph 8(1) of the Safety
           Certificate. This room, which was upgraded in 1979, is manned by the St John
        ?. Ambulance Brigade personnel during matches.  St. John Ambulance Staff advise
           the Club on the purchase of equipment for the room which is located on the
           ground floor at the rear of the North Stand alongside the Police room. A
        : gymnasium is situated at the rear of the North Stand.

             A purpose built commentary box is located above the South.Stand.

             As previously mentioned, the Club have staged many large scale functions at
             Hillsborough. These can give some indication of the level of their experience
             and that of the other agencies involved. That said, during the course of
             enquiries in connection with the disaster evidence has emerged of crushing
             involving supporters in the West Stand terracing at previous F.A. Cup Semi
             Finals.

             The Semi-Finals concerned are 1956, 1981, 1987 and 1988.

             In 1956 a match was played between Birmingham City and Sunderland and took
             place on 17 March 1956, where a surge of people caused crushing on the west
             Stand terracing.

             On 11 April 1981 a Semi-Final was held between Tottenham Hotspur and
             Wolverhampton Wanderers. This is the best document and the most serious of the
             previous incidents. Tottenham fans arrived late due to a combination of
             difficulties on the Ml Motorway and local diversions.  There was crushing on
             the Leppings Lane terraces and during this match.
The Police and Sheffield Wednesday Football Club held discussions following
this incident and the evidence points to the later implementation of the radial
fences forming initially five large enclosures (the centre enclosure being
later divided into enclosures 3,4 and 5), being the action taken'to prevent a
similar incident,

On 12 April 1987, a Semi Final between Leeds United and Coventry City was
played. Evidence from one supporter suggests there was overcrowding on the
Leppings Lane terraces.

In 1988 the Semi Final took place between Nottingham Forest and Liverpool.
Evidence obtained suggested crushing occurred on the Leppings Lane terraces.
There is no evidence, however,’ to show the 1937 or 1938 incidents were brought
to the notice of the Police or Sheffield Wednesday Football Club.

The Hillsborough Football Stadium was designated under the provisions of the
Safety at Sports Ground Act 1975, on 1 January 1979, the safety Certificate for
Hillsborough was issued by South Yorkshire County Councul on 21 December 1979,
on Sheffield Wednesday Football Club’s promotion to the Second Division.
Attached to the Certificate are a number of schedules.  Schedule 1 deals with
Interpretation; Schedule 2, the General Terms and Conditions; and Schedule 3,
Crowd Capacity and Safety Stewards.

South Yorkshire County Council, as the issuing authority, was responsible for
the administration end supervision of the certificate until their demise in
1986 when reponsibility was transferred to Sheffield City Council. The Officer
Working Party, now called the Sheffield City Council Safety at Sports Grounds
Advisory Group, at the time of this disaster comprised of representatives from
Sheffield City Council, Sheffield Wednesday Football Club, Eastwood and
Partners, South Yorkshire Police, South Yorkshire Fire Brigade and South
Yorkshire Metropolitan Ambulance Service.

At the time the County Council transferred responsibilty for licensing to the
City Council, there was a prepared schedule of responsibilities under the
Safety of Sports Ground Act 1975 in existence. This document showed the
responsibilities of the County, Police, Fire Brigade and 3uilding Control
Authority. According to correspondence this scheduule was adopted by the City
Council which meant they then assumed the former County and Building Control
functions.

In July 1987, these responsibilities were re-drawr. by the City Council in draft
form in a document entitled ’Division of Responsibilities between Authorities',
which proposed responsibilities being divided between the Building surveyors

                        HILLSBOROUGH DISASTER INQUIRY


                             FINAL OBSERVATIONS




I. INTRODUCTION
1.      A large number of witnesses and a great deal of evidence has
been heard in the course of the 31 days during which the inquiry has
been sitting.      We do not propose in these observations to go into
detail or seek to resolve issues of minor importance.       We will give
our views on the major issues and seek to indicate what in our opinion
are the important findings of fact which the Tribunal ought to make.
We do not conceive it to be our task to invite the       Tribunal to
apportion blame, but we recognise that is inevitable that criticisms
will be made in the course of deciding what happened and why.          We
shall not .shrink from making such criticisms as we consider
appropv'i ate.


2.      in deciding what happened, we have been greatly assisted by
the video and photographic records, all of which have been freely made
available by their owners.       We should like also to place on record our
gratitude to the interested parties for their co-operation in
producing relevant documents and witnesses and to the West Midlands
Police for their immense effort in interviewing witnesses and
collecting the necessary evidence and in producing for us, often at
very short notice, exceedingly helpful reports and summaries of their
enquiries.       Without that assistance and co-operation our task would
have been impossible.       As it is, we are conscious that we have
completed this stage of the inquiry within 3 months of the occurrence
of the disaster and that many witnesses who were at the ground and who
                                   2



could have given relevant evidence have not been called.     Me have
taken the greatest possible care to try to call a representative cross
section of witnesses and to ensure that no serious issue has been left
uninvestigated or uncovered by evidence.     We are satisfied that we
hav,e succeeded in this objective and that sufficient evidence has been
called before the Tribunal to enable it to reach proper and accurate
findings.     All parties represented have had the opportunity to
nominate witnesses whom they considered were able to give useful
evidence and we have, so far as possible, tried to accommodate them.
We confidently believe that there are and can be no complaints that
any relevant witness, who could add to the account given by others,
has been overlooked or that any evidence has been omitted which
affects any material finding of fact.


3.      In opening this inquiry on 15th May, there were set out what
the indications were at that stage of the sequence of events.       After
31 days of evidence, it is not necessary to change anything of
importance.     The picture, broadly speaking, remains the same.    By
about 2.30 pm, there was a serious crush outside the turnstiles at
Leppings Lane.     As the minutes went by, the situation deteriorated and
by 2.47 had reached such a state that the experienced police officer
in charge, Superintendent Marshall, decided that the only way to avoid
injuries or death was to open the exit gates to relieve pressure.        He
radioed a message to the controller, Chief Superintendent Duckenfield,
who authorised the opening of the gates.     At 2.52 pm Gate C was opened
and about 2000 went through it.     By this time, the two central pens on
the terraces, 3 and 4, were full, although there was space on the
                                   3


wings.   When the gate was opened, no measures were taken to prevent
those entering going down the tunnel ahead of them into the already
crowded central pens.    Most did so, causing severe congestion in the
pens.    As a result, 95 in the pens were crushed to such an extent that
they died and many more were injured.     Unfortunately, the police
officers in the control room and on the perimeter of the pitch failed
to appreciate that the pens were overcrowded and that fans were in
distress.    The perimeter gates, inadequate as they were, were not
opened in time and measures to relieve the situation were
insufficiently expeditious or adequate.     This does not mean that
individual police officers did not do all they could.     The fault lay
in a lack of planning and of leadership and, above all, in a failure
to appreciate the need to control the numbers in the central pens.


II. STATE OF THE GROUND
1.        Following representations by the South Yorkshire County
Council in April 1978, on 7th August 1978 Hillsborough was designated
as a stadium requiring a safety certificate under the Safety of sports
Grounds Act 1975 with effect from 1st January 1979.     The club
appointed Dr. Eastwood’s firm, Eastwood and Partners, Consulting
Engineers, to act on its behalf in its dealings with SYCC and/or
Sheffield Metropolitan District Council "in relation to the ground
being designated under the Safety of Sports Grounds Act" (Doc: 30).
There wer e meetings and correspondence about various improvements
which were needed to the ground in order to achieve the capacity
desired by the Club.    The Leppings Lane terraces were awarded a
capacity of 10,100, after the existing crush barriers had been tested
and, as necessary, replaced and new ones positioned.     This capacity
                                    4


was based on the figure in the Green Guide, stated to be the maximum,
of 5.4 per   m2 reduced by about 10% to take      account       of the lack of
gangways.    This lack was not considered by      Dr. Eastwood to be of
significance because of the ease of movement throughout the terrace:
at that time, there were     no radial fences.


2.      In   1981 at a cup semi-final there was some    crushing. This was
caused by a combination of uneven distribution on the terrace, an over
capacity of about 500 and the late arrival, due to traffic problems,
of a number of supporters.     An early goal exacerbated the situation,
because there was a surge, and a number of fans were injured.
Perimeter gates were eventually opened and fortunately sufficient fans
were able to escape to alleviate the problem.     There had been some
crushing at the turnstiles and the police were, according to Mr Vaux,
slow to react to events.     There are obvious similarities to the events
of 15th April 1989, but fortunately the injuries were few.


3.      It is significant that the police at the time appear to have
believed that the figure of 10,1000 in the Safety Certificate was too
high: see Doc: 136.   Their letter to the FA does not reflect this
b elief - see Doc: 138 - and it does not seem to have been put to the
W or king Party of SYCC concerned with the Safety Certificate.       The
answer to the problem was considered to be the division of the terrace
by radial fences with 3 pens of roughly equal areas.        Eastwood and
Partners were asked by the Club at the same time to consider an
alteration to the turnstiles, but that did not in the end come to
anything.
                                   5


4.        The erection of the pens was not of itself a bad idea.     The
fences were to have gates &t the top, to enable egress to be made to
the adjoining pens.    Much has been asked about these gates and the
arrangements, if any, to man them, w he ther by stewards or by the
police.    It seems they were to have a dual use: first, to enable fans
to go from one pen to another to help in an even distribution on the
terrace as a whole and secondly, as emergency exits in case of the
need to evacuate the pen.    Dr. Eastwood said that he believed there
would be police control over these gates because he recognised the
importance of maintaining the numbers of people in the pens.
Unfortunately, although he was aware of the importance of this
control, he does not seem to have impressed the club or the working
party with it.    The police interpreted control as meaning that the
gates should be left open, only needing an attendant if they were to
be closed and might need to be opened in an emergency.


5.        The reality was, as Dr. Eastwood accepted, that without any
mechanical means of counting, there was no possibility of adhering to
the capacity in the pens.      Accordingly, no capacity was formally
adopted and the safety certificate remained as it was.       Reliance was
placed on visual assessment.    The problem with that was that all
responsible, both police and stewards, accepted and tolerated density
in excess of that which was proper.      Evidence was given by police
officers to the effect that full meant chest to back and shoulder to
s houlder and that it was only when people were in obvious discomfort
that action would be taken to shut off a pen.       This is not
intentionally callous; it is a reflection of what football crowds have
been conditioned to put up with.       It is significant that in both 1987
                                      6



and 1988 the conditions on the terrace in the central pens were
thoroughly unpleasant, but no-one complained and each match received a
clean bill of health.     The failure to seek the views of supporters or
to take any steps to inquire into the ir comfort is a notable feature
of t h e s t o r y unfolded in the evidence.   It has led to assumptions
being made which were dangerously inaccurate.


6.       In 1985 there were plans to improve the turnstiles at Leppings
Lane.    In addition, the police asked for more radial fences.       The main
purpose of those changes was segregation, so that home and away
supporters could both be accommodated at the west end of the ground.
In the result, the scheme to increase the turnstile numbers, and to
achieve not only segregation but a means of counting numbers into each
part of the terrace, was not pursued due to the reluctance of the club
to incur the expense.      In fairness to the club, it does not appear
that Dr. Eastwood impressed upon them with sufficient emphasis the
absolute need to keep the numbers in the pens to a safe level and the
desirability of the increase of turnstiles to achieve that.         He said
that he saw it as his duty to advise the club on the safety
implication of any proposal and to raise any objections he may have
had on that score.     But he seems, perhaps understandably, to have
adopted the attitude that the working party was there to approve or to
disapprove and, if it was satisfied, all well and good.         The working
                                                                                /
party for its part did not appreciate the absolute need for regulation
of the numbers in the pens and so no steps were taken to review the
     /
safety certificate appropriately.         In the result, the centre pen was
divided by a radial fence down its centre and part of it was taken out
of commission by a second fence to form the sterile area now known as
                                     7


pen 5.   The barriers in pen 3 had to be modified because one stretched
                                                                               /


right across it.     This was done by removing two sections of railing.
This had an effect on capacity and also resulted in the gaps being too
wide.    In 1986, as a result of a police request, barrier 144 in pen 3
was removed because it was said to be causing an obstruction at the
mouth of the tunnel.     This, too, had an effect on capacity.


7.        It is clear from the history that the pens were developed in a
piecemeal fashion.     It is difficult to accept Dr. Ea s t w o o d ’s evidence
that he made a positive decision not to follow the Green Guide advice
on the width of gaps and that there was a full discussion at the
working party.     There is no record of such a discussion, which is
surprising.    One suspects that the significance of the changes and the
need to ensure that there was no overcrowding was not fully
appreciated at the time and there is an element of hindsight creeping
into the evidence that has been given.        Furthermore, the record of the
telephone calls at docs. 379 and 380 do not suggest that Dr. Eastwood
was as concerned as he now suggests about the need to monitor and
control numbers in the pens.      His evidence that he was misquoted by
his colleague Mr Strange is not very convincing.          Be that as it may,
the result of the changes was that the capacities of the pens
according to the formulae set out in the Green Guide were 822 in 3 and
871 in 4.     A conservative estimate of the numbers in pen 3 at 1503 pm
on 15th April 1989 is 1576.      It is likely that that pen contained at
least double its safe numbers.

8.        In April 1986 the Sheffield City Council became the licensing
authority.   Mr Bownes was the individual responsible.      He himself had
no direct knowledge of s p o r t s ’ grounds and their safety and was
responsible for a large number of disparate licensing systems.           In May
1986 he reported that the conditions attached to the safety
certificate gave "some cause for concern, as they appear to be
inadequate or inappropriate in some areas".       In evidence, he said that
those were ill-chosen words and he meant nothing more than that the
certificate should be updated to reflect the substitution of the City
for the County Council.     We find that evidence unsatisfactory,        but we
are left in the dark      as to the precise ways in which Mr Bownes
believed the conditions were inadequate or inappropriate.        They
clearly were in that they failed to reflect the existence of the pens.
Mr Bownes very properly embarked upon a review of the conditions and
decided that the working party system inherited from the County
Council needed to be changed.     Sadly, his review was not concluded,
nor indeed nearly concluded by 15th April 1989.       He was undoubtedly
overburdened and he did not appreciate that there was any real problem
at Hillsborough.    Nevertheless, there can be no excuse for the failure
to sort the certificate out and more particularly to ensure that
something was done to prevent overcrowding on the terraces.         In
fairness to him, the other members of the advisory committee (as the
working party became) did not apparently appreciate the need for
action.    The absence    of any certificate at all at Sheffield United      and
the glaring omission      to change the capacity for the Kop are
symptomatic of failure to do what ought to have been done.
9.      The police and fire authority both had an input, being
statutory consultees.     But on the key issue of capacity neither had a
direct concern.     The police were, of course, concerned with problems
of order and generally safety.     They were not experts in capacity nor
is it altogether surprising that they thought in terms of visual
monitoring.   The fire service was concerned with the sufficiency of
emergency evacuation measures.     They say they were given to understand
at a meeting on 10th April 1985 that the police would man the gates at
the back of the radial fences and thereby be able to monitor numbers.
The police deny this.     It is difficult to believe that there was such
a positive undertaking by the police: if there had been, one would
expect it to be recorded in writing and it is not.     The only record is
back in 1981 (Doc: 153) where it is noted that the new gates would be
under police control.     The probability is that the need to control
numbers was not properly appreciated so that having men at the gates
was not considered to be as important as it now appears.     The fire
service may well have believed that the police would be in charge of
the gates.    In league games they were, and the system involved the
filling of the pens one after the other.     In 1985 and 1986 there were
no semi-finals and the problem of a capacity crowd into all the
terrace did not arise.     This may have given rise to any
misunderstanding.


10.      It will be clear that it is our view that the avoidance of
overcrowding in the pens is the key to safety.     The perimeter fences
are needed to prevent pitch invasions and they, or some similar
barrier, are a requirement of UEFA and of the FA: see Doc: 296.     They
are not in themselves the problem, although the gates or means of
                                    10



egress through them must be adequate to cater for an emergency.        Those
at Hillsborough were not, being narrower than the 1.1 metres required
by the Green Guide.     Provided that the fans' are properly distributed
in proper numbers, no problem of crushing should arise.      Indeed,
smaller areas ought in theory to be safer, since they contribute to
ease of distribution.     However, the smaller the area, the greater the
significance of an increase in numbers over the safety limits.


11.       There are other defects in the ground which contributed to the
disaster.    There were an insufficient number of turnstiles to
accommodate the 24,000 or so fans who were to come through them.        The
Leppings Land entrance to the ground formed a natural bottleneck.
Crushes at the turnstiles were, it seems, not uncommon, but normally
they were shortlived and contained well within the perimeter gates. •*
Unless fans came to the ground over a reasonably long period,
ie. about 90 minutes, and at a reasonably steady rate, problems were
likely.     Furthermore, there was a complete absence of adequate signing
inside the turnstiles.     All fans were encouraged to go down the
central tunnel and would be forgiven for not being aware of any
alternative route.    Suggestions that anyone who had been before,
indeed any fan who knew football grounds generally, would have
realised that they could go round the side of the west stand we found
unacceptable.    The lay out at Leppings Lane was the result of a need
to segregate.    That need had not existed since the 1987 season, but no
changes had been made and no signs put up.      It was accepted by Mr
Mackrell that the club could not at semi-finals comply with the
requirements of condition 28(1) of the Safety Certificate that a
record be kept of the numbers of spectators admitted to the west and
                                    11



north west terraces respectively.        There were no means of controlling
the numbers on any part of the terrace within the limits of total
capacity.


III. OTHER PRELIMINARY MATTERS
A. Who was to control the fans on the t er race?
1.      The Green Guide clearly places the responsibility of ensuring
the safety of spectators upon the management of the ground, in this
case, the club: see paragraph 23.        The South Yorkshire Police Standing
Instructions for the Policing of Football Matches (Police Doc: 11)
include as one of the specific duties of stewards that they should
prevent overcrowding and ensure that crowd limits in various parts of
the ground are complied with: see Appendix L paragraph 7(a).        The
evidence of all senior police officers from Chief Superintendent Mole
at the outset has been consistent.        The police did not expect there to
be any stewards on the terraces and no active steps were to be taken
by anyone to control or direct spectators on the terrace so as to
avoid overcrowding.   The fans were expected to find their own levels.
If the central pens became overcrowded, the fans would either turn
round and go back up the tunnel or disperse by the gates at the rear
of the radial fences to the adjoining pens.        The police in the control
room would keep an eye on the pens and, if overcrowding was detected,
should take steps to stop more coming in.        Alternatively, although it
was not part of the match operational order, police officers on the
perimeter of the pitch and in the west stand would report any problems
to Control to enable them to take necessary action.        The club was
clear that it had no responsibility for the management of the fans on
the terrace and said there was an agreement, not in writing or
specifically recorded (pace Mr Lock whose evidence in this regard we
consider unsatisfactory: such an agreement would in our view
necessarily have been recorded somewhere), that the police should take
on that responsibility.     At league matches, it seems that the police
did manage the pens.    At semi-finals, the arrangement was as described
above.


2.       In the light of the evidence, which is all one way, it is in
our view futile for the police to attempt to suggest that the club and
not they were responsible for the safety of the fans on the terrace.
It is interesting to note that in Harris v. Sheffield United Football
C l u b .'South Yorkshire Police asserted that their responsibility went
beyond maintaining law and order and extended to the safety and
comfort of the fans.    This is not at all surprising, since it was
accepted in evidence that the police were concerned with the safety of
everyone in the ground.     There certainly ought to have been a clear
and explicit written agreement between the Club and the police to
ensure that there was an effective means of maintaining and
controlling the numbers going into the pens to prevent overcrowding
and its attendant dangers.     It was a grave defect that not only did
no such agreement exist but no arrangement at all was made which
produced any effective means of avoiding overcrowding.        The policy of
allowing the fans to find their own level was dangerously useless:
Dr Ea s t w o o d ’s description of it as ridiculous is clearly right.
Furthermore, the monitoring of the state of affairs in the pens by
/Control was ineffective.    It is quite extraordinary to find that Chief
Superintendent Duckenfield could look at a photograph of pen 3 at 2.45
(Composite II DB16/29) and say that there was still plenty of space in
                                     13


it.   There manifestly was not, particularly when one bears in mind
Dr. Ea s t w o o d ’s evidence that people tend to avoid the very front
because it is below the level of the pitch and so the view is poor.
That evidence of Mr Duckenfield is a good example of the conditioning
referred to in I1/5 above and the dangers of reliance on visual
monitoring.    It seems, too, that the view from the control box          tended
to give a false impression.      No field glasses were available and the
camera, which could have been used for close-up shots, was defective
and in any event not used at the material time because those in the
control box were concentrating on the problems outside the turnstiles.
The police failed to make it clear to the officers who could have seen
the numbers building up that they should report to control; there was
nothing to that effect in the Operational Order or any briefings and
Mr Du c k e n f i e l d ’s evidence that he expected the officers to report
those matters is not credible.      There was no system to deal with
overcrowding and the problem does not appear to have been foreseen.
This is surprising since in 1988 the tunnel was blocked off to prevent
more going into the central pens, which was overcrowded although not
dangerously so.    That was not reported in the course of any debrief
and was unknown to Chief Superintendent Mole or any senior officer
involved in the planning.      It ought to have affected the 1989
operational order.


B. The decision to give Liverpool the Lepoinqs Lane end
1.       Chief Superintendent Mole made it clear that he would only
agree to police the semi-final at Hillsborough if each t e a m ’s
supporters had the same end as they had had in 1988.          That decision
was in our view justified and it was left to the FA to decide whether,
                                     14


in the light of it, to choose Hillsborough.       The 1988 fixture had,
according to Mr E v a n s ’ report, gone well.   In fact, Liverpool had then
complained that, although they had more support, they had the smaller
ticket allocation.     In addition their supporters had further to
travel.   Mr Kelly accepted that, in retrospect, the choice of
Hillsborough for the second year running was somewhat unfair to
Liverpool.     It was also unfortunate that Liv e rp oo l’s complaints about
the choice of Hillsborough for 1989 were not put before the Committee
which had to decide on allocation.        Liverpool and its supporters had
reason to feel unfairly treated.      There were no factors which
militated in favour of Hillsborough rather than Manchester United.
Those set out by Mr Kelly in his evidence are unconvincing.         The truth
seems to have been t h a t i t was thought convenient to use Hillsborough
because things seemed to have gone well in 1988.


2.        Although the wrong decision was in our view made, it is
difficult to see how it had any direct connection with the tragedy.
There wer e no doubt a number of fans who were unable to get tickets,
perhaps more than there might have been had the match been played
elsewhere.     This may have resulted in more ticket!ess fans coming to
Sheffield in the hope of getting into the ground.        Certainly, there is
evidence of considerable numbers of fans asking for tickets.         It is
clear that after the tragedy, some Liverpool fans were blaming the
allocation of ends.     We do not think that an inference can be drawn
from that that Targe numbers of ticketless fans gained admission.            In
     i
the shock and confusion things were said which were not properly
thought out.     There is no reason to change the opinion stated in
opening this inquiry that a disaster such as this could have occurred
at any semi-final and that, if Nottingham Forest supporters had been
allocated to the Leppings Lane end, an Inquiry might well have been
considering why some of them were crushed to death.


C. The testing and collapse of barrier 124A and the removal of 144
1.      Two sections of barrier 124A in pen 3 collapsed as a result of
the overcrowding.    There can be no doubt that that collapse caused a
number of deaths.    The barrier had been tested by Dr. Eastwood’s firm
in July 1988 and had passed.


2.       The test had been carried out in accordance        with
Dr. Ea s t w o o d ’s interpretation of Annex C to the Green Guide.   The
force of 6.0 KN/metre width has to be applied for three 5 minute
periods, a record being kept of the amount of deformation during each
loading and of the percentage of recovery.       If the recovery is. less
than 50% after the third application of force, there is a failure: if
it is 50%-75%, there must be a retest.       As may be apparent, the
question is 50% or 75% of what?      Is the recovery by reference to the
position of the barrier before the first application of force or
before the third?    If the former, a span of 124A recorded 53% and
should have been retested; if the latter, it recorded 100% and passed.
 Dr. Eastwood adopted the latter and so passed it.        He justified his
interpretation in evidence.     We think he was wrong and that safety
ought to have dictated that the recovery must be by reference         to the
position of the barrier before the first application of force.          But we
do not think we can be criticised for adopting his interpretation,
because it is fairly open on the language of Annex C and has some
support from the tests in the British Standards.
                                    16



3.        Although the collapse of the barrier caused deaths, there were
many who died elsewhere in pens 3 and 4 and, if it had not collapsed,
fans would in all probability have been crushed to death against it.
In his'statement, Dr Eastwood said that it was in his view "reasonable
to believe it failed on 15th April 1989 because it was subjected to a
significantly greater crowd pressure than is envisaged in the 1986
Guide".     That evidence was not challenged, since it is manifest that
the gross overcrowding in pen 3 would have created an excessive
pressure.     The vertical run behind it to barrier              and the
diagonal run to the tunnel side of the pen at the top would have
increased that pressure.     There is no certainty that the different
interpretation and a retest would have led to renewal of the barrier
or that, even if it had been renewed, it would have survived the
pressures exerted upon it.     Furthermore, even if it had survived, it
is difficult to say that lives would have necessarily been saved.              It
is incidentally unfortunate that Dr Ea s t w o o d ’s test records were
incomplete, since the test of one out of three of the spans was not
recorded.     It happens that in the case of 124A the one omitted was the
one which survived.


4.        We should also refer to the removal of barrier 144 in 1986.
This did materially affect the capacity and we think that insufficient
consideration was given to the adverse effects of the removal.            It
made it all the more important to regulate the numbers going into the
pens; this no-one seems to have appreciated. . Its removal made it the
more easy for fans coming down the tunnel to spread out into the pen
 and we believe that its absence did result in a greater flow down the
 pen. The evidence of Inspector Bullas, who was looking down from the
                                    17



west stand, of a sea of people flowing down the pen is graphic and
consistent with the sort of movement one would expect.       A number of
fans spoke of being carried down the pen from the tunnel as they
entered after Gate C was opened and we know that at least 20 of those
who died came in through Gate C after 2.52 (a fact which gives the lie
to the opinion expressed in some quarters that drunken late-comers
killed those who     had arrived in good time) and some of those ended up
at the front of pen 3.


D. The Police Planning
1.      The police operational order for 1989 was essentially a
reproduction of that which had apparently worked well in 1988.         So
much was this so that it omitted to include the instructions to the
police Tango units to assist the ambulance and fire services to make a
rendezvous point     at Herries Road Bus garage as had been agreed in
August 1988: see     Doc:477.   This omission might have been important: in
the event, despite the emergency that arose, it seems to have made
little difference.    Since there had been a minor pitch invasion at the
end of the 1988 match the Order underlined the instruction to serial
1, the offices on the perimeter track, to forbid anyone "access to the
track from the terraces without consent of a senior officer (except to
receive medical attention)".      In this context, senior officer meant an
inspector of higher ranking officer.      Thus it was drummed into all
officers that access to the pitch must not be permitted except in the
most exceptional circumstances.     This led to the failure to react
quickly enough to the emergency that in fact arose.      Police were
conditioned to believe that any attempt to come out of the terraces
must be a pitch invasion and therefore must be prevented.      In
addition, there was insufficient planning to deal with the arrival of
                                   18



fans at the    turnstiles.   It was assumed that   they     would arrive ina
steady flow and that there would be no build       up.      It is interesting
that there was a considerable body of evidence from fans to the effect
that in 1988 there had been a much higher profile policing en route to
the ground.     Fans coming down Leppings Lane had been stopped and asked
if they had tickets and steps had been taken to weed out those who had
not and to control those going to the turnstiles.         Some witnesses even
talked of a recollection of barriers across Leppings Lane.         The police
denied that there was any difference and there is nothing in the
Operational    Order which suggests any change,    save     for a reduction in
numbers of officers posted to public order duties away from the
ground.     It may be that the relatively smooth running of things in
1988 has led people to think there was more control than in the chaos
of 1989, whereas in fact there was no material difference.         In any
event, it is clear that in 1989 insufficient consideration was given
to the possibility of the arrival of large numbers at once or to the
problem of a substantial number of latecomers.      The need to control at
a distance from a ground was identified in 1926; that lesson was not
learnt at Hillsborough.


2.         The plan had been operated in 1988 by Chief Superintendent
Mole.     He had considerable experience of overseeing the policing of
Hillsborough.     He was moved to a new post at the end of March 1989 and
was succeeded by Chief Superintendent Duckenfield.         Mr Duckenfield had
little recent experience of policing football grounds and had not been
to'Hillsborough for some 10 years.      That was, of course, not his
fault.     He inherited a plan which had appeared to work well and was
content that it would work well again.      He did not have the experience
                                    19



to recognise all the potential problems.     This was not his fault, but
we feel that he. should have taken more time and greater care to
familiarise himself with the ground and all its problems.
Alternatively, Mr Mole could have been asked to deal with the match,
notwithstanding his new posting, since to require that Mr Duckenfield
should be in control if such an important match with a capacity crowd
so soon after his appointment was to ask a great deal of him.


Ill   SATURDAY 15TH APRIL 1989
A.    The crush at the turnstiles
1.      .Because of the need to segregate Liverpool from Nottingham
Forest-fans, 12 turnstiles which normally were used to gain access to
the North Stand from Penistone Road were not used.      This meant that
all 24,000 Liverpool fans had to enter by the Leppings Lane
turnstiles.    1-10 were allocated to the 9880 in the North Stand, 11*16
to the 4465 in the West Stand and A-G to the 10,100 on the terrace.
This meant that there was considerable pressure on the turnstiles and,
assuming a hoped-for rate of 800 an hour was achieved, it would have
taken well over an hour to get everyone in.      Any hold ups would have
increased that time.    The design of the ground made this imbalance of
turnstiles inevitable and it is a defect which undoubtedly contributed
to the disaster.


2.        It was essential that there should be no impediment to the
smooth operation of the turnstiles.      However, there are a number of
things which did cause fans to congregate outside the turnstiles and
to obstruct and delay the entry to the ground.      In particular, we
would identify the following matters:-
(i) The confusing nature of the ticket's coupled with the
signing outside the turnstiles.    1-10 were marked A, 11-16 C
and A-G B, so that they ran ACB.   B was the other side of a
wall to A and C, so that anyone getting himself on the wrong
side had to extricate himself and go to the other side.
Furthermore some of the signs placed to show the appropriate
colour coding of the relevant turnstiles were too low and
invisible once a substantial queue built up.    Police officers
said that there were numerous queries from fans as to where
they should go and that the signing was not at all good.    The
Club ought to have made sure that the tickets and signs were
clear.


(ii) The activities of ticket touts.    There were touts
operating, albeit not in large numbers, in the vicinity of the
Leppings Lane turnstiles: one at least was arrested for
obstruction.   Touts are a menace because (a) they encourage
fans to come without tickets in the hope of being able to buy
one, (b) they sell supporters tickets for the wrong end of the
ground, thus imperilling the segregation of the fans and (c)
they cause obstruction.   Ideally, they should be barred from
the vicinity of any ground, but there are difficulties in
devising .a means of curtailing their activities without
preventing the perfectly lawful and unobjectionable swapping
or selling of tickets other than as a business.
                        21



(iii). The presence of ticketless fans.    The evidence makes it
clear that there were many fans asking for tickets.      Police
officers on dut y at and near the turnstiles give various
estimates of the numbers, ranging from 200 to 2000.      Fans have
told the inquiry that much more was done in 1988 to try to
weed out the ticketless than in 1989.     Wh ether or not that is
right, very little was done in 1989.      The police told the
inquiry that there was little they could do, since no offence
was committed in being near a ground without a ticket,
provided there was no obstruction or breach of the peace.         We
do not think the police are so powerless.      Ticketless fans do
cause problems and, in sufficient numbers, are almost bound to
cause an obstruction.   It is in our opinion perfectly
reasonable for a police officer to ask a fan if he has a
ticket and, if he has not, it is lawful to refuse him access
to the immediate vicinity of the ground.      Such refusal can be
justified on the basis of an apprehended obstruction.      In any
event, we suspect that in many cases an indication by an
officer to a ticketless fan to go away would suffice.


(iv) Some ticketless fans tried to get in by bribing turnstile
operators or by rushing or climbing over turnstiles.      Others
with tickets for the Kop tried to get in the Liverpool end.
Both of those categories of people delayed the turnstiles and
affected the smooth running of entry to the ground.
3.        By 2.30pm all pretence at orderly queueing had ceased and
there was a crush of fans at the turnstiles.        Although, according to
the operational order; officers outside the turnstiles had inter alia
to form orderly queues, the Inspector in charge (Inspector Sykes) told
the inquiry that that was an impossible task when a large crowd
attended.      By 2.40pm or thereabouts the police had lost control.     The
crush got worse and worse and the gates had to be opened.         Attempts to
save the situation by the use of mounted officers failed.         Despite the
views of Inspector Hand-Davies, which must be given considerable
weight, it seems to us that the area was too confined to permit of
effective action by horses. T h e y did not have sufficient room to
manoeuvre and were enveloped by the crowd since individuals were
unable to move away, there being nowhere to move to.         Superintendent
Marshall himself was overwhelmed by the crowd and his efforts to
alleviate the crush were ineffective.         At some stage, an attempt was
made to shut the perimeter gates and to form a barrier of horses to
prevent new arrivals coming down Leppings Lane joining the back of the
crush and so making things worse.         This tactic seems to have
succeeded, at least for a time, but it was too late, for, very soon
afterwards, Gate C was opened.         Evidence was given that, despite the
barrier, fans were forcing themselves through, even going under the
h o r s e s ’ bellies.   The perimeter gates, or some of them, were pushed,
open.    The evidence of what precisely happened is confusing.        There is
no doubt that there were fans, particularly among those arriving at a
relatively late stage (i.e. 2.45 onwards) who, perhaps because they
had had too much to drink or because of selfishness or to create
difficulties in the hope of getting an advantage (e.g. admission to
                                 23



the ground without a ticket) or for some other reason, did push and
shove and exacerbate the position.    But those were a minority.


4.      The manual log kept by Superintendent Murray shows that at
14.17 there was a' request to close Leppings Lane.    Mr Marshall and Mr
Duckenfield think the request came later and certainly Leppings Lane
was not closed to traffic until after 2.30.    If Mr M u r r a y ’s timing is
correct, the police outside were aware of problems building up at a
comparatively early stage.    We find it surprising that no measures
were taken by those inside the ground in the control box to try to
seek information to ascertain whether many fans were still coming
towards-the ground.   It is also surprising that nothing Was done by
the Commander outside to deploy officers to try to control the fans
arriving further away from the ground to create a breathing space.           At
about 2.30, Mr Duckenfield, seeing the crowd at the turnstiles, asked
Mr Murray if they would get everyone in by 3pm.      Mr Murray said he
thought they would.   It does not seem to have occurred to them to
check the turnstile count or to find out how many were to come.         It
should by 2.40 at the latest have been apparent that all would not be
in by 3pm and the kick-off should have been postponed.       It had been
decided that kick-off would only be postponed if there were some
reason other than their own volition which caused late arrival of a
substantial number of fans.    This was to adopt too inflexible an
approach.   Postponement might not have eased the crush, but, since it
was accepted by many witnesses that things got worse nearer to 3pm
because fans did not want to miss any of the game, it might well have
done.   If a dangerous situation was created, it should not have
                                       24



    mattered what caused it.     If postponement of the kick-off might
    reasonably have overcome the danger, it should have been done.


    5.        All the police witnesses concerned in the policing asserted
    that they did not foresee that there would be so many arriving late,
    and at once.    They go on to suggest it was unforeseeable.       We
    disagree.    It is, we would have thought, not in the least surprising
    that fans should be reluctant to        spend many minutes standing on a
    terrace or, for that matter, sitting       in a seat with   very little in the
    way of entertainment provided.     There was some evidence of knowledge
    by the police that fans were developing a pattern of arriving 15
    minutes or so before kick-off because, it was thought, they were
    seeking alcoholic refreshment elsewhere since they could not get in
    the ground: see Doc:    434A.    This was not particularly referable to
    Liverpool fans, but,      on the day, the police were ata fairly early
    stage aware of a considerable amount of drinking by supporters.            It
    was a fine and fairly warm day, such as would encourage people to sit
    around in the sunshine.     It was an all-ticket match, so that fans
    would be forgiven for believing that it would not take very long to
    get in.


    6.        In any event, we do not think that those who arrived ihour
    before kick-off can properly be branded latecomers, particularly since
    the tickets said spectators should be in their places by 2.45.           It was
    taking up to 20 minutes to get through the crush and into the ground.
    Once the crush developed, there was more difficulty in getting through
i

    the turnstiles which worsened the crush.
                                      25



7.         It has been said that, had the fans not pushed, the problem of
crushing would not have arisen.       This is a superficially plausible
view.   But it ignores the reality of crowd behaviour.          It has not been
seriously suggested by any police officer that the mood of the crowd
up to about 2.30 was other than good natured.           It is precisely because
people who are aiming to go to a particular place through a limited
means of access do tend to crowd together that there is a need for
control.     And, as one witness said, once you are in that sort of a
crowd, you only move forwards or sideways, never backwards.           Sideways
was constricted, so all were tending to move forwards.


8.      We should refer to other factors which have been suggested as
causative of the crush.


           (a)   Ticketless Fans
           As we have already said, it is very difficult to estimate the
           number of ticketless fans.        It has been suggested that there
           were a substantial number who were determined to get into the
           ground without a ticket.        There is some evidence, notably
           from Mr Taylor, the effect of which is that some fans were
           overheard expressing the intention to get in by way of an open
           gate or to cause a gate to be opened.        Attention is drawn to
           the arrival of large numbers of Liverpool fans at all-ticket
           League matches in the hope of gaining admission.        And it is
           pointed out that at this y e a r ’s Cup Final there were up 1000
           fans who had come to force an entry to Wembley Stadium.           We do
i       not doubt that there probably were some fans who came without
                            26



tickets determined to gain entry.        But we find it impossible-
to accept that the crushing was caused by such fans so as to
engineer the opening of a gate, a theory propounded by
Superintendent Greenwood.        (See Day 12, p.95).   That would
have involved a truly amazing degree of preparation and good
fortune.      However, there may well have been a number of fans
who t o o k advantage of the situation and were happy to
exacerbate and make use of the crush.        Opportunists probably
did hope that a gate would be opened and that they would get
in through it.     To that extent, ticketless fans may have
contributed to the difficulties at the turnstiles.


(b)   Drink
Many witnesses, particularly the police, refer to a large
consumption of alcohol, mainly lager.        Fans arrived in
Sheffield in good time but then stayed outside the ground
drinking, either at pubs or in public places.          Some police
officers suggested that the ban on the sale of alcohol in the
ground contributed to this pattern of behaviour.          It was
pointed out that, having regard to the crowds, those seeking a
drink inside the ground, if it was permissible to sell it,
would be un l i k e l y ’to succeed in getting more than a pint (i.e.
a single drink).      It does certainly seem that a significant
number of fans did decide*to take advantage of the sunshine
and drink so that they arrived comparatively late and in a
condition affected by alcohol.        The drink had increased
selfish and stupid behaviour, leading to pushing and a
                                   27



        failure to take any notice of police appeals to hold back.
        There was a considerable amount of boorish and loutish
        behaviour (e.g. urinating in gardens or backyards, throwing
        empty cans all over the place, shouting, swearing and
        chanting) which sadly tends to be associated with football
        crowds.   That sort of behaviour is inexcusable.   But it was a
        minority of fans who were guilty of it and it did not cause
        the trouble.   It probably contributed to the inability of the
        police to alleviate the trouble once it had arisen.


        (c)   Hooliganism
        This is really coupled with the taking of drink, although
        those may well have been fans who did not need drink to behave
        in a thoroughly antisocial fashion.    Police horses were burnt
        with cigarettes, there was pushing and shoving and some fans
        behaved in a thoroughly selfish way, concerned only to get
        themselves into the ground w it hout caring for the comfort or
        safety of their fellows.    But this sort of behaviour was that
        of a minority and did not cause the problem.    The primary
        cause of the crushing was the bottleneck at Leppings Lane, and
         insufficiency of turnstiles and a failure by the policy
         properly to control fans arriving before they reached the
         perimeter gates and the turnstiles.


B.   The opening of the gates
1.       At 2.47 Superintendent Marshall radioed the first request to
open gates.   Ground control was focussing on gate C and so it was that
                                        28



gate that was expected to be opened.         At 2.48 it opened to eject a fan
and some 200 or so outside burst in.         This happened before Mr
Duckenfield was able to decide on an answer.          Shortly afterwards the
request was repeated, again that the gates should be opened.           Chief
Superintendent Duckenfield realised that to open the gates would be to
act contrary to all the planning and# would let unsearched and
possibly ticketless fans into the ground.          He had a difficult decision
to make and he took his time making it.          Unfortunately, neither he nor
any of his advisers in the control room took any steps to prepare for
the consequences of opening Gate C in particular.          The inevitable
result would be an influx of fans down the central tunnel and into
pens 3 and 4:      this should have been foreseen.      Mr Murray attempted,
he says, to contact Mr Lock, but was unsucc es sf ul . Otherwise, no
attempt was made to contact or to warn the stewards in the club.            The
suggestion that the officers on the concourse ought to have acted on
their own initiative         does not bear examination: they did not know
that       the gate was to be opened nor did they know       that pens 3 and 4
were already full.          In fact, by 2.50 pens 3 and 4 had reached their
safe       capacity.   This should have been obvious to      those inthe control
box.        Even if it was not, steps should have been       taken to prevent the
large numbers who were bound to come through Gate C from going down
the central t u n n e l .


2.          At 2.54 the teams came out onto the field.      This resulted in a
roar from the crowd, encouraging entrants to the ground to hurry to
       i



t he ir places.    So it was that the greater portion of the 2000 or so
who entered through Gate C went into pens 3 and 4.          They came in in an
                                    29



orderly fashion, glad to escape from the dangerous crush outside.          At
2.58 Gate A was opened, but this.time there was some preparation
inside, largely because of the foresight of Sgt. Higgins.     Mr
Duckenfield took additional     steps by deploying a    serial to the front
of the North Stand to cater     for that influx which might   have caused
trouble to the seated customers in that stand.     Those standing on the
terrace were left to fend for themselves.


3.       It is clear that the failure to take any steps to prevent fans
going from Gate C to pens 3 and 4 was the effective cause of the
disaster.     The decision to open the gates cannot be criticised:       the
f ai lu re to foresee the result can.


C.   Inside the ground
1.       It has been submitted that a video shows       activity inpen 3
suggesting that the barrier broke before 2.52.     We do not find that at
all likely.     It is contrary to the evidence that is available from
fans who were in the vicinity of that barrier.     It is also less
probable, since a surge in an overcrowded pen was far more likely to
have done the damage.     It was believed at an earlier stage of the
inquiry that the surge of fans coming in from Gate C, coinciding with
the arrival of the teams on the pitch, caused the collapse.        The
evidence now available suggests it may have occurred later, possibly
even as late as 3.05, when the hitting of the bar at the Nottingham
Forest end caused a surge on the terrace.     There is much conflict, but
it seems that by 3.02 or thereabouts, when Gate 3 had been opened
properly, a pile of bodies was already obstructing it.
                                       30



2.         Since no steps were taken to prevent it happening, the pens
got fuller and fuller.       As they did, people began to be crushed to
death.     Some fell to the ground and were asphyxiated as a result:
others were unable to breathe standing up.          Almost all died from
traumatic asphyxia - the crush was so great that they could not
breathe.       As this happened, they began to cry out in distress.        The
police officers at the perimeter fence were slow to react, partly
because they were accustomed to overcrowding, partly because the noise
level made it difficult to hear that the cries were of people in real
distress and partly because they wer e conditioned and instructed to
          i5
p w s s w w t h e integrity of the pitch.    PC Hooson told the inquiry that
he came past the North Stand and, as he approached gate 4, he realised
                                            Vi.
that fans were in distress and he tookjjjpon himself to open Gate 4.
This was sometime between 2.55 and 3pm.           Thereafter, Gate 4 remained
open.     PC Illingworth, the officer on Gate 4, does not agree; he says
he opened that gate.        It is possible that it had originally been
opened by PC Illingworth and shut again and then reopened by PC
Hooson.        But insofar as there is a conflict of evidence to be
resolved, we would submit that PC H o o s o n ’s account is to be preferred.
PC Illingworth must feel hi mself open to criticism; PC Hooson has, on
the face of things, no axe to grind.


3.         Gate 3 was opened, according to PC Smith, by the force of the
fans in the pen.        He shut it again.   The same happened again and it
was only then that he appreciated the need to keep it open to try to
help to extricate the injured.        This account, courageously given, is
corroborated by fans.        Dr Eastwood accepted that, given sufficient
pressure, the gate could have opened in the way described.
                                   31



4.      It is not possible to say p recisely when the gates were
opened, since the videos available wer e not focussed on the pens at
the crucial time.   The photographs in Composite Album II show gate 4
open at 15.00 and gate 3 at 15.02.      Videos show both gates closed at
15.00:45 (MAP 1) and gate 4 open at 15.00:50 (MAP 3).      The earliest
that Gate 3 is shown open on a video is 15.03: 49 (MAP 8).      All this
makes Mr Grobelaar’s timing very suspect and his description of the
various moves in    the match is not borne out by the video of the game.


5.      Not only    was there a slowness to react to the situation in the
pens, but also, once fans had begun to climb over the perimeter fence
(at about 3pm), the immediate reaction was that it was a pitch
invasion.    This was unlikely for various reasons, not least because
(a) the fans did not go on the pitch and (b) there was no conceivable
cause for an invasion at that stage of the game.      Valuable minutes
were spent while those in the control box tried to find out what was
happening.


6.      Attempts were made   by standing on the perimeter fencing and
gesticulating to    get those at the back of the pens to move back.
These attempts failed.    This was not in the main due to cussedness
on the part of the fans, but to (a) an inability to move and (b) a
failure to realise what was going on down the front.      No senior
officer thought to send police down the tunnel to haul fans out the
back - that was left to the initiative of junior officers.
                                      32



7.         There was an absence of leadership by the senior police
officers.     Individual efforts were made to try to save lives and to
evacuate the pens, but the picture was one of chaos and lack of
organisation until Chief Superintendent Nesbitt came on the scene at
about 3.15.     No attempt was made to use the tannoy to try to summon
medical assistance until about 3.20.       Similarly, those not directly
involved, particularly the Nottingham Forest fans on the Kop, were
left ignorant of what was happening.        Chief Superintendent
Duckingfield defended his decision to say nothing on public order
grounds.     We can quite see that fans had to be kept in their places to
avoid interference with the emergency services, but we think that some
announcement should have been made.        Most football fans are decent
law abiding people and, if treated as human beings, are likely to
react sensibly.      When an announcement was eventually made, the fans
all behaved w e l l .'


8.         The club had an agreement with the St. J o h n ’s Ambulance
Brigade to provide sufficient numbers to comply with the requirements
of the safety certificate.        Their members did all they could when the
tragedy occurred.        SYMAS had very prudently, by stretching the
relevant DHSS guidelines, determined that two of their personnel
should attend the ground with an ambulance,        two complementary tickets
had been provided for league games, but not for semi-finals.           It did
appear that there could be some criticism of the club for withdrawing
the tickets, but we heard from Mr M a c k r e l l , and we have no reason to
     /

doubt,that it arose from an administrative error.        In any event, the
personnel were at the ground and able to react quickly.        There was,
                                        33



however, a lack of proper liaison with the police, largely because the
police had no plan specifically to deal with a disaster at
Hillsborough Stadium.     The same comment applies in respect of liaison
with the fire service, who were eventually called to produce bolt
cutters to remove the perimeter fencing.            The first fire officer to
arrive was told he w a s n ’t wanted.        In addition, there was confusion
between the club and Dr Purcell as to his role.            He thought he was
present to administer to the team or directors and was not the
physician referred to in the safety certificate.


9.       Much publicity was given to the attempt by the police to
summon the fire brigade and the conversation seeking to identify the
precise location of Hillsborough Stadium.            It would be unfair to blame
the fire brigade operator for her endeavours to get the right
information for the computer.      She expected the police to be precise
and there ought to be full briefing so that the police know what is
needed of them.     There was some confusion as to what was needed from
the fire brigade.


10.      Complaints have been made of the lack of proper medical
equipment.   We do not think any football club could reasonably be
expected to carry sufficient equipment to cater for. a disaster of the
magnitude of that which occurred.            But there should have been at least
a resuscitator.     The SYMAS ambulance had all necessary equipment and
oxygen was quickly available.      It became clear that a defibrillator
would not have been a sensible piece of equipment to use in the pitch.
 We were not impressed with the complaints made by Dr Ashton and Dr
Phillips in that regard.
                                          34



11.       although there was confusion and disorganisation and a failure
to act as expeditiously in summoning the necessary assistance as was
desirable* we doubt that the delays caused deaths which would not in
any evenl itave occurred.          We do think that, had the perimeter fence
been opetsd earlier and positive steps taken to get people out of the
back of l i e pens, some lives might have been saved.         But we doubt that
the delate ;,in seeking medical aid and a sufficiency of ambulances made
any real #ffference.         As was pointed out in evidence, the first 4
minutesitsrat crucial and immediate mouth to mouth resuscitation is the
only reallj' effective and practical treatment.          This was given by
police oilircers, St. J o h n ’s personnel, fans etc.


12.       'fesfh ill-feeling was generated by the allegation made that
afternoai ttfchat fans had taken down a fence and thereby caused the
tragedy, ffihis version was given by Mr Duckenfield to Mr Kelly-at
about 3.S.          Mr Duckenfield has admitted that he deliberately did not
tell t h e t m i t h .   That account had been given to the fire service-and
to SYMAS,         There was scope for misunderstanding, since the call to
SYMAS msj w*el1 have referred to the forcing of a perimeter gate.            That
possibility/ of misunderstanding cannot exonerate Mr Duckenfield.


D.    Radio Communication
1.        Sadio communications were generally poor.        This was largely
due to the fact that over 100 officers had radios and so, particularly
as the situation became more difficult, there was a tendency for more
than ons     to    talk at once.    In addition, shortly after 2.30 a problem
was apparent and the control box seemed to have lost transmission.
                                    35



The reserve station was brought into use.     This was so badly sited
that it was impracticable to use it.     Hence the control box Rad to use
a set instead, thus losing the ability to switch to non-talk through
so as to override all other transmissions.      It did gain the advantage
on talk through that it was able to compete on equal terms with the
other officers.


2.        The situation was wholly unsatisfactory.   Many messages did
not get through.     Officers on the perimeter were not heard trying to
announce that there was crushing and asking for ambulances.
Superintendent Marshall could not get through his request to open the
gates and had to route it via the police station.


3.        Since an inspection by a Home Office expert has disclosed no
faults, the breakdown must have resulted from too much traffic-on the
air.     Too many officers had radios for the system to cope.    Clearly,
consideration will have to be given in Stage 2 to means of improving
communications and avoiding the problems which arose.


IV . 1     As will be apparent, we have not sought to cover all the
matters dealt with in the evidence.      We have not thought it necessary
to suggest the resolution of disputed evidence as to who said what and
when in relation to numbers still to come into the ground.       No doubt,
those matters are important to the individuals involved.        It is
possible that some people ought to have been aware of things which
should have led them to take action which might have changed events.
We are not satisfied that identification of the shortcomings of

ACTION OF P. T. JACKSON, ACTING PRINCIPAL OFFICER,
ENVIRONMENTAL PROTECTION UNIT, HEALTH AND CONSUMER
SERVICES, SHEFFIELD CITY COUNCIL


At approximately 4.30 p.m. on Saturday, 15th April 1989, I learnt of the
incident at the Sheffield Wednesday Ground. At that time I was in Goole
Rugby Union Football Club and I then telephoned my home and spoke to my
wife.  I found that John Rice, the Assistant Director, had already tried
to contact me and as more information came into the Clubhouse at Goole I
decided that I should proceed back to Sheffield, which I did, arriving
home at approximately 5.20 p.m. I picked up sandwiches, coffee and
various items of emergency equipment and proceeded to the Leppings Lane
entrance of Sheffield Wednesday to meet Mark Ford, the Acting Assistant
Principal Officer, a course of action which I had agreed on the telephone
with Mr. Rice at approximately 5.25 p.m.

Mr. Ford and I entered the Ground at approximately 6.00 p.m. and
consulted with various Police Officers and in particular with a Sargeant
whose name I believe is Stuart Basford, who I have dealt with before on
public entertainment licensing. Initially we were unable to enter the
area in which the incident is understood to have occurred as Scenes of
the Crime Officers were still busy and as it was felt that some personal
effects may still be remaining.

Around 6.45 p.m. we were allowed access to the area and we carried an
initial inspection of the area where it' was understood fatalities had
occurred and of the area of the Ground immediately to the west of the
tunnel entrance to Pens 3 and 4. At approximately 7.00 p.m. I made some
notes in my notebook concerning the failed barriers and I noted
distortions and associated corrosion. This concerned me and I made a
note that I would like Brian Hibbs, who is a Consultant Engineer for the
Health and Safety Executive, who I have worked with before, to be
involved to have a look at the metal and assess the sort of pressures it
had withstood before failure.  I also moved one piece of barriers which
was approximately 2.5 metres long, which was on the pitch area and which
had been subjected to bending and showed evidence of fracture of metal at
its ends. I replaced this on the terrace in roughly the position at
which it had been before the failure.   I spoke to Mr. Graham Makrell, the
Club Secretary, and asked him if he had a list of stewards available.   I
learnt that he did not and I advised him that this would be needed either
by myself or by some other investigating authority in the immediate
future. He was clearly in a state of considerable shock and I did not
press the matter.

At 8.15 p.m. I examined a wall and steel gates at the rear of the West
Stand. There are two gates approximately 2.5 metres in a high brick wall
and I was advised by Mr. David Bownes, the Council's Licensing Officer,
that these would normally be closed during the game in order to control
the crowd.  I observed that a portakabin which had been positioned for
the sale of programmes was blocking the swing of one of the gates and
therefore I concluded that the gate had not been closed that day and
without moving the portakabin it would be incapable of being closed.   The
portakabin was on hire from M.P.H. Hire, a telephone number, which was
Sheffield 442007, was displayed as was a notice advertising programmes.

Following consultations with other Council Officers, including the
Assistant Director and Director, we agreed to meet at Town Hall Chambers,
the time was then 8.25 p.m.  I recorded in my notebook my initial
thoughts on the incident, which were as follows.

That the wrong gate had been open to the Ground, that the other security
gate could not have been closed. The bright sunlight would have led to
the temporary b l inding of people W ho ran into the dal'k Luuuel UfTtIyT”TlTC..
S'Eand. Only a small area of the pitch would have been visible over the
heads of the people who were already in Pens 3 and 4 and this would have
contributed to the obstruction of light and confusion.  I felt that
people unfamiliar with the Ground would have believed that the enclosure
that they were running towards was larger than it actually was and I also
felt from the degree of barrier defamation and the variation between
different barriers that wedges of stationary people had effectively been
formed and that this had diverted the pressure across the Pen at an angle
towards the pitch. I discussed these' observations with Arthur Butler,
Building Surveyor, David Bownes, Council's Licensing Officer, and Mark
Ford, and received a reasonable amount of agreement.

I started to leave the Ground and was placing equipment in the car with
Mark Ford when I met David Purchon, the Director of Health and Consumer
Services, Sheffield City Council, and Stuart Nattrass from the Health and
Safety Executive, at approximately 9.00 p.m. We discussed the
investigation and the information available and I requested that Brian
Hibbs, the Field Consultant, be sent to assist us in examining barriers.
Stuart Nattrass agreed to consider this.

I returned to the Office and then I returned home at approximately 10.00
p.m.   Once I was home I made a further note in my notebook that I had
asked for security to be arranged on the Pens by Mr. Makrell, the Club
Secretary of Sheffield Wednesday, as I was concerned that there was free
access to the area and there were already a number of people who were
going into the area as sightseers.  I was concerned that the metal which
had already failed may be subject to some kind of further amateur tests
and this could lead to some confusion when tests were carried out by the
Health and Safety Executive or other appropriate authority.


SUNDAY, 16TH APRIL

I arrived in the Office at approximately 8.30 a.m. and discussed the
matter with Mr. Purchon and then arranged various items of equipment
which I felt would be necessary to carry out the area of investigation
which had been allotted to me, which was to carry out a detailed
examination of the areas of Pen 3 and Pen 4 and of the tunnel giving
access.  I had declined to take a wider role in the investigation which
had been suggested by Mr. Rice, the Assistant Director, as I felt that
items such as statements from the crowd would be obtained far more
effectively by the Police and I felt that it was necessary to have
discreet areas of investigation at this stage as I suspected that some
kind of Inquiry would follow and that the evidence which we were
obtaining would be used in this Inquiry.
                                    - 3 -

At 9 o'clock on the Sunday morning a meeting was held in the Director's
Office and representatives from the Health and Safety Executive, that is
Mr. Johns, Principal Inspector, and Mr. Nattrass were present, Arthur
Butler from the Building Surveyors, as was David Bownes, together with
Mark Webster, the Assistant Head of Admin. & Legal, Mark Ford, myself,
John Rice and David Purchon.

Copies of a plan of the area of the Ground, including Pens 3 and 4, were
available and I enlarged and photo-copied those plans and then with Mark
Ford left the meeting early and proceeded to Sheffield Wednesday's ground
at approximately 10 o'clock knowing that we were to meet Mr. Hibbs at
approximately 10.30.

At the ground I encountered substantial problems with access, which was
not surprising in the circumstances as there was a large body of press
who were all trying to. gain access to the building, some using various
subterfuges. However, I was admitted and at 10.20 a.m. commenced taking
photographs of Pens 3 and 4 and we also started to draw up a detailed
plan of Pens 3 and 4 showing the position of the barriers and of the
fences etc. At approximately 11.00 a.m. we were joined by Brian Hibbs
and Chris Nicholson from the Health and Safety Executive.
I remained concerned about the lack of security to the area and I spoke
to Inspector John Bennett and asked if he would contact the Coroner and
get permission for us to remove certain of the items of metal from the
barriers on the terrace, in particular the broken piece of barrier which
1 had recovered from the pitch area the night before.   Inspector Bennett
undertook to try and do this and mentioned a Chief Inspector McRaby, and
said that they would try and get this permission for us. However, when I
spoke to him later it appeared that they had been unable to contact the
Coroner and permission could not therefore be assumed to remove this
evidence.

Dr. Eastwood of the Consulting Engineers was present on site together
with several members of his staff and test equipment which was capable of
demonstrating the pressure at which barriers yielded and a test was
carried out on Barrier No. 137 on the plans supplied by Eastwoods, which
demonstrated it yielding at 500-lbs. per linear foot with the central leg
becoming torn at approximately 1.6 tons pressure on each section.

At 12.35 Barrier 128 was tested, this held the test load at 400-lbs. per
linear foot on the two sections nearest the centre with a non-elastic
deformation of 4 millimetres after 5 minutes.  It was then reloaded to
1.4 tons again for a further 5 minutes, which it withstood without any
difficulty. The loading was then increased to give an overload of 25%,
at which stage 27 millimetres' deflection was observed after 3 minutes.
The jack was then taken up to 2.1 tons maximum pressure and substained at
2 tons, at which time a deflection of 40 millimetres was observed.  On
removal of the load this recovered to a total deflection of 13
millimetres.

At 1.25 p.m. I arranged for the length of tube to be stored initially in
the Referee's Changing Room and then later in a lockable Club Office.  I
then returned to Town Hall Chambers and with Mark Ford considered the
Guidance Note on Safety in Sports Ground. Having done this I prepared a
report of my initial observations and recommendations. This Report was
                                    _ 4 -


passed to John Rice, the Assistant Director. I also carried out various
tasks such as trying to fax a copy of the Certificate to the Home Office
and left messages for the Licensing Officer before returning to my home
at approximately 5.30 p.m. where I further studied the Safety in Sports
Ground Guidance Note.


MONDAY, 17TH APRIL

At approximately 8.00 a.m. on the 17th April I came into my office and
recorded my observations on the weekend's activities.

I also had discussions with colleagues over their action and how we thought
action should proceed and at 9.00 o'clock I went to a meeting with the
Health and Safety Executive at the Research and Development Laboratories,
Broad Lane, Sheffield. Also attending the meeting were Dr. Chris Nicholson,
Brian Hibbs, David Waterhouse, Phil Hayes and Chris Purtee of Health and
Safety Executive. The strategy for determining forces on the crush barriers
and fences and the causes of failure were discussed and it was decided to
proceed to site to carry out preliminary investigations.

The meeting finished just after 10 o'clock and I then returned to the
Office, following which I went to Sheffield Wednesday, arriving at about
11.05 a.m. at which time the Health and Safety Executive Officers were
already on site, as was Mr. Ford and Mr. Pitts, of my Section who were
drawing up detailed plans of all the positions of barriers, fences
etc. within the 2 affected enclosures.

I then met Alan Seaman, the Assistant Chief Fire Officer of South Yorkshire,
and had some discussions with him before going on to look briefly at Spion
Kop, I was concerned to note that the new works completed in 1986 did not
entirely comply with the Guidance Note, particularly in respect of the
gradient which I determined to be greater than 1:2, measuring some of the
new sections as having a rise of approximately 175mm for every 280mm of
going.

I returned to the Office at approximately 1.30 p.m. and at 2 o'clock had a
meeting with John Rice, the Assistant Director, prepared various letters
and made arrangements concerning mobile phones and then listened to the
broadcast from the House of Commons at 3.30 p.m.

I then drafted letter to the Club Secretary of Sheffield Wednesday and
delivered that letter at 4.05 p.m. in the afternoon by hand to Sheffield
Wednesday, where it was received by Mr. Makrell and I discussed the contents
of the letter briefly with him, in particular the problem of arranging a
visit by Councillors and Officials from Liverpool on the Tuesday afternoon.


TUESDAY, 18TH APRIL

On Tuesday, the 18th April, at 7.25 a.m., I spoke to John Rice regarding a
meeting which was then cancelled, and at 7.50 a.m. I came into the Office
and discussed the action we were taking with Mark Ford and agreed to
continue a full survey of the area.
                                    - 5 -


At 9.30 a.m. I spoke again to Mark on the phone and discussed the recall of
David Moore, an Officer from the Unit who was on attachment to the Health
and Safety Executive and who was experienced in the inspection of sports
grounds.  I then received further information regarding Assistant Chief
Constable Mervyn Jones and his request or instruction that nothing should be
removed from the Ground, and on site I met Chief Inspector Mick Taylor and
discussed access for Officials with him. There was no problem with us
carrying on with our investigation at this stage. I saw Brian Hibbs of
H.S.E. on site and discussed the need for a copy of all test certificates
and calibration of pressure testing rigs and plans. I was also advised that
Malcolm Jones, Senior Principal Inspector H.S.E., was advising that the West
Standing Area was not used until further notice. This was something I had
already decided was wise and I spoke to Graham Makrell in his office at
approximately 4.05 p.m-. and he agreed that there would be no use of standing
area of the West Terrace until further notice.

At 5.05 p.m. I was informed by John Rice that all inquiries were suspended
until further notice and I notified all staff that were present to that
effect and left a notice in a prominent position to inform other members of
staff.

I dictated these notes with the assistance of my notebook at approximately
4.50 p.m. on Wednesday, the 19th April.

We travelled          to the gams          by car    leaving                      at about       10 am

(1000},        The journey              to S h e f f i e l d took a b o u t '3 hours.          We stopped at a

p u b 1 i c house     just o u t s ide She ff i e 1d t o r 1un c h a na a d r i nk ha v ing

a s c e r t a i n e d from the        licensee     that we     could     reach the stadium              in about

an hours       time.      We    intended w a t ching         the Saint and Greavsie at                   the

pub.      There were a few othe r football                     suppor ters        i n the      pub h a v i n g a

drink and        it was a good a tm o s p h e r e we           left after w a t c h i n g        the show as

I had a r r a n g e d also       to visit another            public: house         to see friends               just

prior     to the game at the Gate                  public    house,     so we      parked the         car       in a

side    road about a five minute walk                     from the ground and went                  to the        pub.

I saw a police           presence         in the streaa,        asking a. police            officer      for

direction,          I saw no fighting              orVcii sorder     in the street.

I e v entually a rr iv ed               at the Larppings Lane             entrance at about              1445/50

hours     (1445)      (1450).            I can/only describe              the scene as a solid mass                            of

people,        1 saw 2 m ou n t e d A>o 1 i ce officers and several                     foot     patrol

officers       including a savior              officer      who were attem p t i n g           to organise

the fans       into some semblan ce              of order.        1 joined the           crowd and

a t t e m p te d to make my way to the               turnstile       entrance.          All     the time more

fans were a r r i v i n g and           coming     in behind me,         there were also            fans who

in my opinion did not have tickets                        and they,       once they joined the

crush added to the              crush.        There were a lot of               late   comers,      mostly

stand ticket          holders arriving and a lot of                    pushing and shoving               took

place,       1 myself was             not too w o r r i e d about      the si t u a t i o n     I have      been

in a lot worse,             I remained         in the     crowd for about              10 mine trying            to

get    into the ground and                it was    fast ap p r o a c h i n g    kick off       time.       I

ov e r h e a r d a ge n t l e m a n    r e m o nstrating w ith the senior               police     officer,           he

was    intimating        that    he w ou l d     report     the officer and that                he had his

collar     number.         1 also       heard, other      people     requesting          the    police      to

open the gate and allow them through or someone would be ser i o u s l y

i njured.

After about 30 seconds                   the ga'te to my        left opened and          I together         with

I took up my seating                   position       I was aware      of BEAJjHSBLEY striking             the

bar.      Tins made         the a t m o s p h e r e    electric and J m e       next    thing    I was aware

of seeing was a fan grabbing                      hold of the/Civerpooi               goalkeeper,         Bruce

G RG B 8 E L A R and directing            his attenticwo^to what              1 could only assume was

the start        of a pitch            invasion.        i never watched any more              of th*-'game

as my a t t e n t i o n was also           drawn/to        other     fans   climbing     ov^f the front

perimeter        fence and onto tyfe pitch and                     could see      poli/fe officers          ,

standing        up a g a i n st the fence             p h ysically    pushing f/ns       back    into      the

pens - some         of the        officers       had their      trundheooe        in their      hands.

The    next     thing      1 was aware        of was      seeing      the   referee a b a n d o n i n g    the

game and        leading      the       players    off the      pitch.

I a s s u m e d that after a brief                interlude and once            the    police had

restored order             the    game w ould         recommence.

The    first     I realised that            the si t u a t i o n was more         than just a pitch

invasion was when                I saw a w oman member             of the St Johns Ambulance

brigade working             on a fan lying             near   to the    18 yard box.          I witnessed

more    supporters          climbing       the fence and onto the               pitch and       I heard the

N o t t i n g h a m fans    chanting.         "Die you bastards             die.”      This   only    incensed

the    incident and some Liverpool                      fans made a move          towards     the

N o t t i n g h a m End.     At about       the same time as            the    police    formed a cordon

along     the    centre      of the       pitch this a c t i o n a p p e a r e d      to desolve      the

situation.

1 then saw a young                supporter walk           past the front         of the N o r t h S tand he

had his arm e x t e n d e d out            in front        of him     I could see his .arm was              badly
                                                                                                            PAGb.           '
                                                                                                            S3653

I saw a lot of supporters                 rip down the a d v e r tising                 hoardings      to use as

make    shift    stretchers        to carry the              injured fans,

I realised that           very serious         injurias had occurred                    to a lot of

supporters and           I heard a tannoyy^nriouncement                      requesting any doctors                    or

t rai ned medi cal staff who              c ovri d assist            in any way to report             to the

first aid       post.      As    1 am trained          in First Aid             I a p p r o a c h e d a steward

and    informed him of this.               He took me to a police                     officer    towards          the

L e p p i n g s Lane    end of the stand and                 this     offj^fer took me onto            the

pitch.      1 was       informed by another                 offica'f present          that most       injured

supporters were           being a t t e n d e d to          I/ a w    a young fan with a cut hand

w h i c h needed       stitching.       1 tied jr rag            round his hand to stave                the

bleeding and tried to              c o n s o 1e H n i m .     T here were a lot of other

supporters who were              o b viously      in deep shock ar o u n d me.                There wasn't a

lot    I could do.         So    I decided to get more                   hoardings       from the      side

which    1 gave        to other    fans to use to               carry     injured and dead fans,

   saw a lot <^r fans ar o u n d me who were                         very a n g r y   I my s e i f waj^ angry
                                                                                            A
real isi ngy^hat         this    tragedy had been               caused by the g a t e c h               I

ente r e^ be 1 ng o p e n ed by the Police.                     I saw the lyi v§^<ooi           and

NcLitirngharri Forest Manager walk                  onto the          pitch,     "They both stared

tol/ards Leppings Lane as               if in a trance.

I was    incensed and went            over     to    remonstrate with them.                   1 told them

fans were       dying     over    there and to do something                      intimating      there were

about 50      people      dead over there.              There were               lice    officers

surrounding        them and a lot of Tv                camerainan taking              film of the

incident.        I had my ticket            in my hand /and was a t t e m p t i n g             to show

D A L G L I S H the Liverpool       Manager my yrcket.                    One    of the    camera      crew,       I

think    it was        from Channel       f our     sprouted to me,             "Hold that      ticket       up

tell    me what y o u ’ve just          saicftr-'"     So     I d i s played      the entire      ticket          to

the    camera a reporter a sked me what                       h a p pened and         I informed them,

"they just       opened the gates."
               I then returned to my friends                   in the stand and sat down until                  such

               times as         I heard the game was           offic i a l l y abandoned.

               We    left the ground shortly after                hearing    the ann o u n c e m e n t   and    returned

               to our       car.

               I was     not    injured during        the a f t e r n o o n either    inside or outside            the

               ground.

               I did not witness anything               I w ould     consider     to be a criminal             offence,

              My views and o b s e r vations           on the     incident are       that    the Fire Service

               ex c elled themselves and did a m a r v e l l o u s           job,     .Everyone did as            best as

               they could once they             realised the e n o rmity of the tragedy,

               I think what          I feel    is vital    to this      enquiry      is that    the      police

               officer      outside who was          responsible      for opening       the gate was

               frigh t e n e d for his own life..

              On the day of the m atch               1 was wear i n g    blue stone wa s h e d jeans and a

                                              shirt w x Xh a                          on the      left     breast

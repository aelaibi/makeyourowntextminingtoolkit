             I am a POL DC in the South Yorkshire Police                     stationed at Attercliffe

             Pol Stn.

             At 4.00 pm <1600) Saturday 15 April                1989 <150489)     I commenced my tour

             of duty at Attercliffe Pol Stn.

         J   Shortly a f t e r 5.00 pm (1700) that date I attended at the Medico Legal

             Centre, Watery St, Sheffield together with the following officers!



             POL DC 1008 AKERS

                                   V         dt&A                    ouojl

             We were there informed that we were to process the deceased resulting

             from the Hillsborough disaster.
                                                                        PAGE      2

The system subsequently used to process the bodies involved POL P C ’S

AKERS and         ogether with                   stripping e a ch individual

body arriving at the mortuary.      I then entered the identities of the

deceased together with details of clothing and personal        property onto

a triplicate form contained within a body and property register which

I compi1ed.

Each entry consisted of a consecutive number I awarded it at the

Mortuary < ie 1-94) followed by the identification number given it by

the officers handling the bodies at the temporary mortuary at

Hillsborough (Body No).

The name of the deceased (if known) and the details of each Police

officer appointed to convey the body from Hillsborough to Watery St

were then out 1i ned together with a comprehensive     list of clothi ng and

any personal   property present.

The address of the deceased was then entered       (if kn o w n ) together with

the time and date when the body arrived at the mortuary.

The details entered therein are consistent throughout and are repeated

for each individual body received at the Mortuary that night.

"THE R E G l S T a / w A S COMPILED FIRST AND FOREMOST AS A BODY AND PROPERTY

REGISTER DESIGNED TO ASSIST THE SUBSEQUENT ENQUIRY"

I can identify the register by the attached signed labe1 (Exhibit No

   I).   The bodies arrived at Watery St iri ambulances which contained

three bodi es and three po1 i ce officers.    After they had been processed

by ourselves the bodies were then dealt with in the normal manner by

the Mortuary Staff assisted by

The officers conveying the bodies then 1 iaised with POL DC638 WEIGOLD

who acted as identification officer for all the bodies that night.

I have compiled a sketch plan of the scene at the mortuary on the 15

A p r i 1 whi ch outlined the position of those involved from the police

side.    I can identify the sketch plan by the attached signed exhibit

         entered as stated.       However,    consecutive number 3 wa s identified to me

         as being body number 20 from the temporary morgue at Hillsborough.                I

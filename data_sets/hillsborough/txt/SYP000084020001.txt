              1 am    presently on a Y T S             course at S h e f f i e l d P o l y t e c h n i c and        I reside

              at the above addr e s s w i t h my                parents.

              I also     hold a part           time    job e m p l o y e d by S h e f f i e l d W e d n e s d a y Football

              Club as a s t e w a r d .

              On S a t u r d a y    151h A p r i 1 1989       (150489?,        I w o r k e d at        the ground    in the

              capacity       of a s t e w a r d .      I a rr i v e d at     11am     (1100)      and a fter      b r i efing

              took    up my        position     in the Kop end of the g r o u n d .

              In my opinion things were                    like any       other m a t c h day,          until    a bout 3 . 02prn

              <1502).        I saw fans         from the West S t a n d           climbing        over     the fence and

              onto    the edge         of the football           field.        I i m m e d i a t e l y thought      it was a

              pitch     invasion,        a few min u t e s        later    the game was a b a n d o n e d and           the

              players w a l k ed        off.      I still       thought      it was      only a pitch           i n v asion so      I

              s tarted     to walk       down towards           the West Stands            to help clear          the fans,
                                                                                                                         P A GE
                                                                                                                         S2828

                it was      only at this        stage       I saw    people    ripping      the a d v e r t i s i n g    boards

                off and       using these as          s tretchers      that    I realised what was                happening.

               By    this     time more and more             people were       getting      onto    the    pitch,        the

               Pol i c e made a barrier              across     the field to stop fans mixing.

               N o tt in g h a m s u pporters        were    trying to a g g r e v a t e    the Liverpool

               supporters.            Several       bodies    had been       placed on the field,              I went        up

               and a s k e d what       I could do,          I just    ''mucked*      in a n d helped to           carry

                injured       people    on the       boards     over to where         the   gym w a s , where           doctors

               and     first aid staff were working.                    We    left    them on the st r e t c h e r           and

                returned to where             the    incident was,        I think      I made      this    journey         twice

               wit h stretchers,          but       several    times w i t h s u pporters who had                 1eg

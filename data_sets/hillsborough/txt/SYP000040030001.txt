                                     of                       Liverpool      Merseyside
                     On 15th April 1989 I went to Hillsborough to watch the FA cup semi-final
                     between Liverpool and Nottingham Forrest.            When I arrived at the ground
                      I was with my friend                             We were in the ground by
                      1.30 p.m. and we took up positions in the centre of the terracing
                     of the Lepping Lane end of the ground.            The ground began to fill up
                     and by 2.30 it was getting so full we decided to move forward. We
                     ended up standing in front of a barrier which was eventually shown
                     in the media as badly buckled. More and more people started to arrive
                     at the ground and they came under the barrier as well.           Gradually
                     space became tighter so that it was inpossible to move at all. The
                     situation grew so bad that everyone around was shouting at the
                     police asking them to do something.         I began to panic but tried
                     to calm myself down. However, the crush got worse and one man's
                     arm was suffocating me.        I bit the man immediately in front to catch
                     his attention and he told the lad who was suffocating me to move his
                     arm.    He eventually managed to do this.         Once I could see and breath
                     again my concern was to look for             but I could not see her anywhere.
                     I shouted for her and I heard a lad say there war somebody on the floor.
                     I could then feel             vith nry one free hand and I tried to pull her
                     up by the hair.      I could see that she had blacked out.       a little
                     later |      was pulled up onto her feet and eventually.,,:-anoeuvred to the
                     front and over the fence. By then she was screaming for me, I
                     that I then blacked out. I am not sure how long it was before I came
                     to again.    I remember being near the front and there were bodies arour. t
                     me. People tried' to pull me up and I remember a lad shouting at
                     me saying "get out".     Eventually I was pulled to my feet.         I ther
                     remained at the front until eventually the crush managed to ease
                     and I was helped by a girl to walk out ofc the exit. With many other
                     people I waited around the exit until 4,20 p.m. when I eventually
                     met up withf         again.
                     My injuries include the following


                     1.     A strain and bruising tu my back.
                     2.     Bruised legs.
                     3.     A strain around my left shoulder where my left arm had
                            been twisted back in the crush.
                     4.

                      I lost a bangle which had bean a birthday present from work
                      only a week before the match and had cost about £50.
                      I paid £6 for my ticket and also paid £2,60 for my prescription
                      from my doctor._______________________________________________

              cups      of    tea,    etc.       and were             then       told     to     t ake      our    places          in the        North

              Stand      for    10am       briefing.

              2   .             I was       in      charge           of    serials        61     to 6 4 w h i c h w e r e m o b i le

              transit         patrols,          n one      of    those          serials        comprised any              officer           from

              *E1*      Sub Division and                   I therefore                 made    my way        to    row 3 5         to   liaise

              w i t h my      serials.            I made         my       first        contact     with       some       of    those        officers

              about      9.50am       as    they         began        to    take        their     seats.

                                After       the m a i n          10am       briefing           by C h i e f       Superintendent

              Duckenfield            and    other          senior          officers            I arranged          for    the       f our

              sergeants         in m y      serials             to    be    briefed           by me:         this     consisted             of

              reminding         them       of     their         geographical              areas        of    responsibility,

   checking          t hat          t h e y all      had wide               previous             experience              of     policing            the

   ground - which                    they      had,      and         instructing                 them     to       pay     regular

   attention              to    licensed            premises              in t h e i r      areas.             They were               then       told

         brief        their          own      serials.

   A.                 I had           been      fully          briefed          by Supep^rfxenden t                       Chapman           and

   Chief       Inspector               Price        at    the        special           briefing           w h i c h wa s         h e l d at         10am

XZ1an    the    da y       before          and      it w a s         only       necessary               for Mr.          Chapman            and     I to

   have      a very            brief       conversation                   on the        Satu rda y morning.                           I can h a r d l y

   recall       what           we    said      on    the S a t u r d a y           morning              but    I think           it      centred          on

   checking           public           houses.            He        had     told       me    to     remain with                 serial         62

   (call       sign Tango                Eight).

   5.                 At       11.15am          on S a t u r d a y            15 A p r i l       1 went        on        pa t r o l     covering

   the S o u t h e y           Green area with Tango                            Eight        and        visited          various            pu blic

   houses        in t h a t          area.          We w e r e           responsible              for N o t t i n g h a m F o r e s t               fans

   but w e r e        not       sent       to a n y       incidents               of    violence              or    disorder             created          by

   them.        As        time wore            on     it was             obvious        that        a    reasonable                 proportion            of

   fans      were         becoming            under       the        influence              of    drink        but        they were            all

   good-humoured.

   6 .                About           2.40pm        I began              to    notice        t hat m a n y          of        the     f a n s who

        ti b e e n    in the           public        houses              on H e r r i e s        Road were           beginning                to m a k e

   their       way        to    the      football              ground.            Quite a           few w e r e           under        the

   influence              of a l c o h o l       and      noisy           but     not       overly        disorderlys                    to    h ave

   tried       to a r r e s t          a n y at      t his          stage w ou ld            have        been       counter-productive

   in t hat          it    could         have       been       the        catalyst           for a m a j o r             disturbance

   caused       by o t h e r           f ans     trying             to    prevent           arrests.               Because            the     fans

   were      in a         good mood            I f elt          it       the    better           alternative               to       ' jolly'        them

   along.

   7.                     About        2.45pm,           or     p^sibly            slightly              later,           I was        sitting         in

   my    transit           vehicle            in H e r r i e s           Road,     n ea r        to H e r r i e s        Drive         w h e n we

   began       to     hear          r a dio    messages              t hat      indicated               that       the     officers            in the

                                                                                                                                                                   R 127

L e parings L a n e           were    experiencing                          difficulties                        with       the     crowd and                          they

(the     police)          wan te d a gate                    opening,              I believe                     they       said Gate                           'A*.

Numerous        messages             were       passed asking                          for         the          gates       to     be      opened                     that

it    became        the       subject          of       humorous                 comment               by       the     officers                in the

transit        and myself.                 Comments                    s u c h as       'Do y o u                think        someone                   wants               a

opening."            I seem          to    recal l             saying             words            like              ’I can      imagine                        someone

became        a big       joke       at    t hi s           time            (clearly           we w e r e             not     to    know what                             was

to    happen        later).

Herries        Road when             Inspector                 Bateman,                ’C2'            Sub       Division           walked                       past me

towards        the       ground,          he    too m a d e                 jocular            comment                about        'Do y o u                     think

of    humorous           comment          by us all.                        He    then         continued                   towards              the

ground.         I cannot             reca l l           whether              the       gate            was       in fact           opened                       but         I

seem     to    think          there       was       a       r a d io        message            from Control                      giving

permissiorf          for       that       to    happen.

                    About       3.00pm          I seem                 to     rec a l l        an       officer,              possibly

                              either            Inspector            Sewell        or C h i e f           Inspector             Sumner,        informed         the        officer

                              The     game was             not        in      progress.          I believed                  it was       a    pitch      invasion and

                              c o n s i d e r e d we        had          potentially a very                      serious           public       disorder

agreed         and       I indicated                 for      the       cordon        to m o v e     away       and    towards           the

halfway          line.              At    this       point         I was       still      not      really aware               of      the      full

enormity            of     the       situation.                  As     we m o v e d    away       towards           the    halfway            line

the     crowd         in the             North Stand               cheered        us.

a s we     did        so,       a    large          number         of    peole,        whom     I presumed were                    Liverpool

fans,      began           to       run t o w a r d s         us      from     the     Leppings         Lane         end.        They       ran

through          our       loose          cordon          towards          the    S pi on Kop          (the N o t t i n g h a m          Forest

’F u c k i n g      kill        them,          i t ’s t h e i r         fault’.         Police         officers            ran t o w a r d s

the    Spion Kop                and       prevented              the     Liverpool           f ans     from      trying          to     climb

into     the Kop.                   We    managed           to     get     the    fans       back      towards          the      halfway

line     by      both       force          and       persuasion.

'16.                  Chief          Superintendent                     Nesbit        then    joined        us a n d        ordered a

cordon across                   the       full       width         of    the     pitch.         I then          gave       the     command

for    that         to     occur.              We    then        slowly        moved      the      cordon        towards           the

centre         of     the       pitch          and    r e m a i n e d at         the    halfway         line.          By     this       time,

such was            the     number             of    officers            who     had    trickled           onto       the     pitch,           lir.

Nesbit         ordered           a double             cordon,            which        I arranged.               By    this       time,

there      were          about           100    to    150 o f f i c e r s         involved           in the          c ordon .

'17.                  It a p p e a r e d            to me        that     the    whole        football           stadium           could

have     erupted            and          I was       very        concerned.             I was        s ti l l    worried           that        the

major      police           p r oblem was              one         of    potential           large      scale         public          disorder

the    rumours             began         to     spread           that     people        were       dead and           the     numbers

continued           to      inflate.                 I was        first        told     by a       police        colleague              that

do    no    think        that       any       police        officer           in the          cordon     believed          that       such

a    high     figure          of    d e a d was         true.

18.                 As we          stood       in the          cor d o n ,     sti ll         expecting        trouble,          a

number        of    drunken          fans          kept     running           up    to    individual           officers          or

groups        of    officers             and       shouting          obscenities               s u c h as    ’Y o u ’ve        fucking

killed        them,       you       bastards’.                 'It's       your      fucking         fault*.            and     so

fort h .         They     were       obviously              distressed              and       I g ave    instructions                that

people        should          not    be a r r e s t e d         unless         absolutely             necessary           as    I felt

that       any     display          of    force          could       have      caused          the    crowds        in the       stands

to    h ave      created           further          violence.              I was         so    concerned          t hat    lar ge

scale       violence           would          break       out,       either         d i r e c t e d at      opposing           fans       or

at    the     pol i c e ,      that       I asked Chief                   Superintendent                Nesbit       to    consider

seeking          implementation                    of    ’O p e r a t i o n    li.A.I.N.E.’              I was       convinced

that       there       would        be m a s s          violence          towards         the     police       as    it wa s

obvious          that     a    lot       of    f a ns     believed            we    had       been    responsible              for     the

injuries/deaths.

19.                I became          aware          t hat      someone         was       speaking        over       the    public

announcement              system,             I presume           it w a s         Messrs       D al g le is h and Clough

because          the     crowds          hushed when              they        spoke       and     they      seemed        to    h ave      a

calming          effect        on    the       crowd s.           I would           have       preferred          this     to    have

happened           some       time       earlier          as    I am       sure      it w o u l d       have      allowed        the

police,          particularly                 my    cordon,          to    have      participated more                    actively             in

rescue        rather          than       public         disorder           prevention.               I would        add    that

earlier          announcements                 over       the     public           address        system       had      in the m a i n

been       ineffectual              and       hardly audible,                  either          because       of     the    quietness

of    the     individual             using          the     system,           or    the       actual     poor       quality          of    the

system.

20.                After       the       calming           influence           of Mr.          Dalgleish          I f elt       it was

safe       for     me,    qualified                First       Aid    Instructor,               to    leave       the     cordon and

do w h a t       I could           for    the       injured.              I went         to    some L i v e r p o o l      f ans      who
                                                                                                                             PAGE

were    wandering           aimlessly          about        and    told       them       to g r a b a         ’h o a r d i n g

s t r e t c h e r ’ and     follow       me.

21.             I walked amongst                 a     large       number          of    people        who      were       lying        on

the    ground and           being       treated        by    police          officers,             ambulance

personnel       -    both        local    authority           a n d St.        Jo hn,         firemen         and     civilians,

but w a s     informed           by a    senior        police       officer,             possibly          an      inspector,

that    there       were     sufficient          stretchers              a n d all           casualties            were     being

looked after.               I thanked          the     fans       who    had a c c o m p a n i e d         me,       asked       them

to    put    their     hoarding          to    one     side,       told       them       to     sit    around         the

perimeter,          and     returned          to my     cor d o n .

22.             A    short        time    later,        an a n n o u n ce me n t          was      made       over     the

public       address        system       t hat   the        game    was       not       to    be    played and             fans

were    requested           to    remain       in the        ground          for    the       t i me    being .        However,

fans    started        to    leave       the S p i o n K o p        from       each          end and       I was

instructed          by S u p e r i n t e n d e n t     Chapman,          who       had       been      near     the     cordon

for m o s t    of    the     time,       to    take     half       the       cordon          outside       the       ground and

to    form    cordons        across       Penistone           Road North                 to     control         opposing

fans.        I took       approximately              100 to        150       officers           out     onto Penis tone

Road North          via     the    'gymnasium           entrance'             a n d we        formed       various

cordons,       both along           the       length and w i d th              of       t hat      road.        I helped           to

supervise        crowd       control          but we        did    not       experience             any    disorder           in

this    area.

23.             Whilst           supervising           the    remnants             of    the       crowds       who    were

leaving       the    ground        I heard a           call       that       fighting           was     taking        place        in

Hillsborough           Park.        I saw        nearby       one       of    the       transits          from my          ser i a l

call    sign     Tango       T e n w i t h PC 7 1 8 P o n t             as    driver          accompanied             by P S 2 7 3 7

Hallett       his    serial        sub    commander.               I collected                a number          of    officers

who were       standing           near    me a n d      together             with       the     above      named       officers

I attended          that     particular           incident,             which       had       cleared         by     the    t ime       we

arrived.        We     then       remained        on    patrol          and    attended a further                      call        to

Hillsborough               Park       but     a g a i n all        was      quiet    on a r r i v a l .

24.                We      also       attended          the B a s e t t       Public        Hou s e ,      where       the     front

windows         had     been       damaged          by,      it    is b e l i e v e d ,     Liverpool            fans,       who     had

tried      to    get       the      licensee           to    open      up    so    they     could       use      the

telephone.              He      refused and             they       broke      the w i n d o w s       along       the       length        of

the    pub f r o n t a g e .           A    crime       report         was    submitted           but      there       are     no

useful      lines          of     enquiry.

25.                   At     6 . 5 5 p m we      attended          the N o r t h S t a n d        for      de-briefing              but

were       s ent      out       to a n i n c i d e n t       at    the      N or t he r n General           Hospital           where

it w a s    believed              that      relatives             were      causing        problems         to    st a f f .        Other

officers         had a r r i v e d          before          us a n d     it w a s    ascertained                that    the P r e s s

had    been        harrassing relatives                       which         had    caused        them      to    take       issue

with       the     Press.            No a r r e s t s       were    made      and    the        matter      was    dealt        with

sensitively             by      the    police.

26.                We      continued           on      patrol       and      event u al l y went            off    d u t y at

OVERALL         COMMENTS

This    section            covers          the    remaining            questions           posed      by C h i e f

Superintendent                  Wain's        enquiry         questionnaire                and    describes            my    general

feelings         of     the       day.

•1 .               I have           had     very       little       experience             of    policing         football

matches         even       though          I have       been an          inspector          for      twelve       years.            I last

worked      the       Hillsborough                ground when               I was    the        inspector         in    charge          of

the M o u n t e d       and       Dogs      Section          in    1981/82         but     even      then       I was       mostly

concerned with                  duties        outside         the      ground.            I h a ve      considerable

experience            of     dealing          with      large        football        crowds          in the       city       centre

when    I was         the 5 t h        Inspector             at    West      Bar    in the        late      7 0 ' s . I also

have    considerable                  experience             of    large       crowds       in    industrial            disputes.

2.                 During          the      Hillsborough               incident          I did       not    handle       any        bod i e s .

            3.                 I am       not    aware       of    the       time        that       the      turntiles           were        unlocked.

            4„                 I did       not    witness          the a c t i o n s            of a n y        stewards.

            3.                 My    general           feelings         about          the       d a y are       that      the    pre-match

            briefing        on       the    Fr id a y morning,                   14 A p r i l ,      was      excellent.               All    senior

            officers           present          that    day were            given          the     opportunity             to     familiarise

            themselves           with       the     ground,            particularly                those         who     had     not    worked        it

            before.            Most       officers       were          taken around                 their        areas      of    responsibility

            unless        they       regularly          worked          the       football              gro u n d .

                                The       briefing       on the             day     of     the      m a t c h was        e q u a l l y well         run

            and     the    logistics             were    very          good.

                                My    one       criticism          is t hat           I would            h ave       preferred         to    h ave

            been     in    charge          of m y      o w n men,           for     they wo ul d             have       k n o w n my face           and

             capabilities             and       vice-versa.                 As     it w a s        I was        in    charge      of a t r a n s i t

             full    of men,          some       of w h o m       I had          never        seen        before.         In n o r m a l

             circumstances,                because       we w e r e          all      together              in one       van     it w o u l d       not

             have    mattered             but    because          of    the        events          of     the    day,     we     very       quickly

             became       detached          from       one    another,              despite             me m a k i n g    great        efforts        to

             g et   them       to    f o l l o w me w h e r e v e r          I went.               As     .it was,       sometimes           they

            were     b e h i n d me        and    then       they       had        been moved              elsewhere.             By    the     end       of

             the    day    I had a          combination                of    one      of      my    transits           and a      smattering              o-f

             officers          from       foreign       serials             (partly           my    fault        -    p a r a g r a p h 23).         Had

             I been with             my    own    men     I would            like        to     think        that      there      would        have

             been    more       cohesiveness.

                                For       most    of    the       t ime      I was         on      the      pitch      I was      very

             concerned          that       the    crowds          would          invade         it a n d        start     fighting           with     the

             police       and       one    another.           The       antipathy               and       hostility         towards           the

             police       of    the       fans    in b o t h       the N o r t h           Stand          and Leppings            Lane       was

             frightening             and    I was       very       surprised               t hat        extreme         violence did            not

             occu r ,     especially when                 they         left        the     ground.

E N D OF   REPORT
          INCIDENT AT HILLSBOROUGH FOOTBALL GROUND
            SHEFFIELD ON SATURDAY 15 APRIL 1989




BRIAN THOMS WALLACE, POLICE INSPECTOR, 'EM SUB DIVISION, 'B' GROUP



At 8.30am on Saturday 15 April 1989 I reported for duty at Hackenthorpe
Police Station, supervised the embussing of the 'E' Sub Division contingent
of men, and then went in a convoy of one SYT double decker bus and two
marked police transits to Hillsborough Football Ground.    vie arrived at
the ground about 9 .15 am, obtained cups of tea, etc and were then told to
take our places in the North Stand for 10am briefing.
I 'was in charge of serials 61 to    which were mobile transit patrols,
none of those serials comprised any officer from 'E' 1 Sub Division and I
therefore made my way to row 35 to liaise with my serials.   I made my first
contact with some of those officers about 9 «50 am as they began to take
their seats.

After the main 10am briefing by Chief Superintendent Duckenfield and other
senior officers I arranged for the four sergeants in my serials to be
briefed by me:   this consisted of reminding them of their geographical
areas of responsibility, checking that they all had wide previous experience
of policing the ground - which they had, and instructing them to pay
regular attention to licensed premises in their areas.    They were then
told to brief their own serials.

I had been fully briefed by Superintendent Chapman and Chief Inspector
Price at the special briefing which was held at 10am on the day before
and it was only necessary for Mr. Chapman and I to have a very brief
conversation on the Saturday morning.    I can hardly recall what we said
on the Saturday morning but I think it centred on checking public houses.
He had told me to remain with serial 62 (call sign TANGO EIGHT).

At 11.15am on Saturday 15 April I went on patrol covering the Southey Green
area with TANGO EIGHT and visited various public houses in that area.       We
were responsible for Nottingham Forest fans but were not sent to any incidents
of violence or disorder created by them.    As time wore on it was obvious
that a reasonable proportion of fans were becoming under the influence of
drink but they were all good-humoured.
About 2.^0 pm I began to notice that many ox the fans who had been in the
public houses on Herries Road were beginning to make their way to the football
ground.   Quite a few were under the influence of alcohol and noisy but not
overly disorderly:    to have tried to arrest any at this stage would have
been counter-productive in that it could have been the catalyst for a major
disturbance caused by other fans trying to prevent arrests.       Because the
fans were in a good mood I felt it the better alternative to 'jolly' them along.

About 2.*+5pm i or possibly slightly later, I was sitting in my transit
vehicle in Herries Road, near to Herries Drive when we began to hear radio
messages that indicated that the officers in the Leppings Lane were
experiencing difficulties with the crowd and they (the police) wanted a gate
opening, I believe they said Gate 'A' . Numerous messages^^reQgassed asking
for the gates to be opened that it became the subject of/comment by the officers
in the transit and myself.      Comments such a s M Do you think someone wants
a gate opening?"     i!I get the distinct impression someone wants a gate opening.”
I seem to recall saying words like "I can imagine someone making 'T' shirts
with t0pen the Gate' on them."     The whole matter became a big joke at this
time (clearly we were not to know what was to happen later).

About 2.50pm or slightly later I was still in my transit on Herries Road
when Inspector Bateman, 'C'2 Sub Division, walked past me towards the ground,
he too, made jocular comment about "Do you think someone wanted a gate opening."
Again the situation was the subject of humorous comment by us all.       He then
continued towards the ground.      I cannot recall whether the gate was in fact
opened but 1 seem to think there/s^rinfio message from Control giving permission
for that to happen.

About 3«00pm I seem to recall an officer, possibly Superintendent Marshall,
saying words like "We're losing it." and asked for more manpower.       I recall
an officer, possibly Inspector Sewell, saying that he had 100 men in the
gymnasium and that he would send 5 serials.     A voice then said "Send everybody."
I then thought that there was a serious disorder situation and decided to
take my serial into Penistone Road North.        I did not inform Control because
the radio was very busy.     We parked the transit on that road and I took my
men into the ground to a position between the North Stand and Spion Kop and
near to the gymnasium.

Once inside the ground I saw there were a nun^sr of police officers standing in
a state of readiness.     I also saw a large number of dogs and handlers,
together with some mounted officers.     I saw either Inspector Sewell or Chief
Inspector Sumner, informed the officer how many men I had with me and asked
for instructions.      We were told to remain where we were and to await
                                         -   3-




          further instructions.

    11.   After a couples of minutes I decided to walk onto the pitch area between
          the North Stand and Spion Kop.          I looked towards the Leppings Lane end
          and saw a large crowd of supporters on the pitch.          The game was not in
          progress.      I believed it was a pitch invasion and considered we had potentially
          a very serious public disorder situation on our hands, although I could not
          see any fighting.     I then returned to my men.

    12.   Shortly afterwards, a senior officer, I think it was Superintendent
          Chapman, told me to bring all the men behind me - approximately 75 to 100
          officers, onto the playing area and to form a cordon along the front of the
          North Stand.     1 told the men to form a cordon and also indicated this by
          holding out my arms horizontally to my sides in the correct PSU fashion.
          As I did this I was hit by several coins which were thrown towards us by
          the crowd in the North Stand.           The crowd were very hostile and kept indicating
          towards the Leppings Lane end.

    13.   I then saw people being carried out on stretchers and hoardings and I think
          that both police and civilians were doing this.          Owing to the hostility of
          the crowd in the North Stand I felt that our presence was aggravating the
          situation, which at this time I thought was one of public disorder which had
          caused injuries, I radioed to Control to explain the situation and said that
j
          we should move.     I was instructed to remain in situ.

    1^.   A few minutes later, because by now the crowd in the NQrth Stand were
          shouting obscenities at us, were becoming far more hostile and agitated,
          and shouting things like ;,Get over there and help.1’, I again radioed to
          Control and said that I was taking the cordon away because we appeared to be
          seriously inflaming the situation.          Control agreed and I indicated for the
          cordon to move away and towards the halfway line.          At this point I was still
          not really aware of the full enormity of the situation.          As we moved away
          towards the halfway line the crowd in the N0rth Stand cheered us.

          We began to form a loose cordon along the. halfway line and as we did so, a
          large number of people, whom; I presumed were Liverpool fans, began to run
          towards us from the Leppings Lane end.          Tney ran through our loose cordon
          towards the Spion Kop (the Nottingham Forest end)and were shouting obscenities
          such as "Kill the Bastards."       "Fucking kill them, its their fault."     Police
          officers ran towards the Spion Kop and prevented the Liverpool fans from
          trying to climb into the Kop. tfe managed to get the fans back towards the
          halfway line by both force and persuasion.
Chief Superintendent Nesbit then joined us and ordered a cordon across the
full width of the pitch.     I then gave the command for that to occur.
We then slowly moved the cordon towards the centre of the pitch and remained at
the halfway line.     By this time, such was the number of officers who had
trickled onto the pitch, Mr. Nesbit     ordered"a double cordon, which       I
arranged.     By this time there were   about 100 to 150 officers involvedin
the cordon.

It appeared to me that the whole football stadium could have erupted and
I was very concerned.      I was still worried that the major police problem
was one of potential large scale public disorder and it was only slowly
that the realisation dawned on us all that it had been a crushing incident
which had caused the injuries.     Slowly the rumours began to spread that
people were dead and the numbers continued to inflate.       I was first told
by a police colleague that 'People were dead", then "Five are dead", then
Twenty11 and so on.     I do not think that any police officer in the cordon
believed that such a high figure of dead was true.

As we stood in the cordon, still expecting trouble, a number of' drunken
fans kept running up to individualofficers or groups of officers and
shouting obscenities such as "YOU'VE FUCKING RILLjID THEM, YOU BASTARDS."
"IT'S YOUR FUCKING FAULT." and so forth.      They were obviously distressed
and I gave instructions that people should not be arrested unless absolutely
necessary as I felt     that any display of force could have caused the
crowds in the stands to have created     further violence.     I was so concerned
that larhe scale violence would break out, either directed at opposing
fans or at the police, that I asked Chief Superintendent Nesbit to consider
seeking implementation of'Operation M.A.I.N.S.'      I was convinced that
there would be mass violence towards the police as it was obvious that a
lot of fans believed we had been responsible for the injuries/deaths.

I became aware that someone was speaking over the public announcement system,
I presume it was messrs DALGLISH and CLOUGH because the crowds hushed when
they spoke and they     seemed to have a calming effect on       the crowds.I would
have preferred this     to have happened some time earlier       as I am sureit
would have allowed the police, particularly my cordon, to have participated
more actively in rescue rather than public disorder prevention.       I would
add that earlier announcements over the public address system had in the
main been ineffectual and hardly audible, either because of the quietness
of the individual using the system, or the actual poor quality of the system.

After the calminginfluence of Mr. DALGLISH, I felt it v/as safe for me,
qualified First Aid instructor, to leave the cordon and do what I could
for the injured.      I went to some Liverpool fans who were wandering
aimlessly about and told them to grab a 'hoarding stretcher' and follow me.
I walked amongst a large number o   people who were lying on the ground
and being treated by police officers, ambulance personnel- both local
authority and St. John, fireman and civilians, but was informed by a senior
police officer, possibly an inspector, that there were sufficient
stretchers and all casualties were being looked after.     I thanked the fans
who had accompanied me, asked them to put their hoarding to one side, told
them to sit around the perimeter, and returned to my cordon.

A short time later, an announcement was made over the public address system
that the game was not to be played and fans were requested to remain in
the ground for the time being.   However, fans started to leave the Spion
                                    o
i£op from each end and I was instructed by Superintendent Chapman, who
had been near the cordon for most of the time, to take half the cordon
outside the ground and to form cordons across Penistone Road North to
control opposing fans.   I took approximately 100 to 150 officers out onto
Penistone Road N0rth via the1gymnasium entrance1 and we formed various cordons,
both along the length and width of that road.      I helped to supervise
crowd control but we did not experience any disorder in this area.

Whilst supervising the remnants of the crowds who were leaving the ground
I heard a call that fighting vas taking place in Hillsborough Park.        I sawnearby
one of the transits from my serial call sign TANGO TEN with PC 718 Pont as
driveraccompanied by PS 2737 Hallett his serial sub commander.     I collected
a number of officers who were standing near me and together with the above named
officers I attended that particular incident, which had cleared by the time
we arrived.    We then remained on patrol and attended a    further call to
Hillsborough Park but again all was quiet on arrival.

We also attended the Bassett public house, where the front windows had been
damaged by,it is believed,Liverpool fans who had tried to get the licensee
to open up so they could use the telephone.      He refused and they broke the
v/indows along the length of the pub frontage.    A crime report was submitted
but they are no useful lines of enquiry.

At 6.55pm we attended the N0rth stand for de-briefing but were sent out to
an incident at the NQrthern General Hospital where it was believed that
relatives were causing problems to staff.        Other officers had arrived
before us anci it was ascertained that the Press had been harrassing relatives
which, had caused them to take issue with the    Press.   No arrests were made
and the matter was dealt with sensitively by the police.

We continued on patrol and eventually went off duty at 8 .*tOpm at Claywheels
OVERALL COMMENTS

This section covers the remaining questions posed by Chief Superintendent
'Wain's enquiry questionnaire and describes my general feelings of the day.

1.         I have had very little experience of policing football matches
           even though I have been an inspector for twelve years.    I last
           worked the Hillsbro1 ground when I was the inspector in charge
           of the Mounted and Dogs Section in 1981./82 but even then I was
           mostly concerned with duties outside the ground.     I have
           considerable experience of dealing with large football crowds
           in the city centre when I was the '5th Inspector1 at West Bar
           in the late ?0's.    I also have considerable experience of
           large crowds in industrial disputes.

2.        During the Hillsborough incident I did not handle any bodies.

3.        I am not aware of the time that the turnstiles were unlocked.

           I did not witness the actions of any stewards.

5.        My general feelings about the day are that the pre-match Briefing
           on the Friday morning 1*f April was excellent, all senior officers
           present that day were given the opportunity to familiarise
           themselves with the ground, particularly those who had not
           worked it before.   Most officers were taken around their areas
           of responsibility unless they regularly worked the football
           ground.

           The briefing on the day of the match was equally well run and the
           logistics v/ere very good.

           My one criticism is that I would have preferred to have been in
           charge of my own men, for they would have known my face and
           capabilities and vice-versa.    As it was I was in charge of a
           transit full of men, some of whom I had never seen before.      In
           normal circumstances, because v/e were all together in one van it
           would not have mattered but because of the events of the day, we
           very quickly became detached from one another,: despite me making
           great efforts to get them to follow me wherever I went.       As it
           was, sometimes they were behind me and then they had been moved
           elsewhere.   By the end of the day I had a combination of one
           of my transits and a smattering of officers from foreign serials
           (partly my fault - paragraph 23).      Had I been with my own men
               I would like to think that there would have been more cohesiveness
               For most of the time I was on the pitch I was very
               concerned that the crowds would invade it and start
               fighting with the police and one another.   The antipathy
               and hostility towards the police of the fans in both the
               North Stand and Leppings Lane was frightening and I was
               very surprised that extreme violence did not occur,
               especially when they left the ground.

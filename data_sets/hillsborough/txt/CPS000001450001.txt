        Dear Sirs,

         R E:    ADLINGTON v DUCKENFIELD AND MURRAY


         Thank you for your letter of 30 December 1998 addressed to Mr. Croston and I refer
         to our subsequent telephone conversation.

         I note that you have offered disclosure of evidential material to the Hillsborough
         Family Support Group. I also note particularly the point you drew to my attention,
         i.e. that you do not consider it necessary to obtain the consent o f the maker.

         I am consulting with others within the CPS about this position but I can tell you that
         my view is that there is a very strong public interest in ensuring that a fair trial takes
         place. Accordingly, my view is that it is not necessary to obtain the consent of the
         maker of the statement before proceeding to make voluntary disclosure.

         As discussed with you on the telephone, I will seek to assert privilege for a number of
         documents, such as counsel’s opinion, internal memoranda etc. I understand that you
         agree that this is the appropriate course and you will adopt a similar approach should
         there be any such material contained in the Hillsborough archive.

         Thank you for your assistance.

         Yours faithfully,




         Christopher H. Enzor

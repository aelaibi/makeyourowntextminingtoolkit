                   I am the above               named ancj/ live at the above men t i o n e d address

                   I am a Liverpool                football      team supporter and,                     in view of the semi             Cup

                   m atch due          to be     p 1ay ed\jbe tween Liverpool                  and N o t t i n g h a m Forest,      at

                   Hillsborough Stadium                  on S a t u r d a y   15th April           1989     (150489),       I decided

                   that       I w ould      like      to be   present
                                                                    during the match. /However, I am not a
                                                                      T l O C £ - ( > m i C £ 5 , ' V O TTCvc£rr’
                   se a s o n ticket           holder    and therefore could not obt/ain a ticket for the

                  match.           For    that     reason,     on the morning             of tty s       venue,     I tra v e l l e d    from

                  my home address,                 setting     out at about 9.00/arn                     <0900 hrs),      hoping        that

                   I could arrive               in S h e f f i e l d at a reasonable               time and       perhaps      purchase

                  a ticket           from somebody.

                   I experienced               no travel      delays and e v e n t u a l l y             parked my     car,    a Ford

                  Escort                        , in Sheffield,          near to a park,                 being a p p r o x i m a t e l y 5

                  minutes*           walk away         from the Ground.             I left my             car at about        12.00
                                                                                                           PAG E          2
                                                                                                           S2003

12.30    pm    (1200 -         1230 hrs).

Being    in      need of a ticket,               I waited on a       s t y l e t c o r n e r , asking    other

fans as       they   came by       if they         had spare t            e t s ,A    short    time      later, a

man w hom        I do not know,            came up to me and a sked if I wa n t e d a ticket.

He    had one that        lie sold me for £6.00 at                 the L e p pings Ln stand.

I made my way towards                the Stadium;           I have    been there         before and knew

the way,      a lt h o u g h    en route     to the Ground, there were a few Police
                                                     /
Officers       along     the     route,     I received no directions from them.

I walked       through the G r o u n d           entramce and made            towards     the turnstiles.

There    were     no queues        of     people           t h is time;     this was about            1.30     pm

<1330 hrs).          There were           other /pans around,           but    no     large   crowds

whatsoever.          I simply wa l k e d           ,o a turnstile,          handed my ticket             in,      and

walked    through.             I remember        that    just as     1 wa l k e d through,          a steward

at a nearby turnstile                received help from two Police Officers                             in

ejecting a fan who               had a t t e m p t s # to enter       the Ground without a ticket.

Once    inside the Ground, hav     been there before, I decided to pick
        S £ - M I f i'N/ztt (3< _
the    same viewing point as JL had last y e a r . That was at the right

w i n g s area    o f t h e L.e p p i n^ s L n s t a n d a n d , n o t n e e d i n g d i r e c t io n s , 1 did

not    notice any        signs      or    witness any Police            or stewards'1 d i r e c t i o n s as

to where       I could or         could     not    view the m a t c h from.             I was    initially           in

t he stand,       i n P eris 1 and 2,            be i ng a p p r o irna t e 1y a few ya r ds f r om t he

corner    f 1ag and to the                       of the Police        viewi ng h u t .

I r e m ained there            or therea b o u t s and saw the            penned areas          behind the

Leppings       Ln end begin          to fill       up to what a p p e a r e d to be a normal

crowd.        At about 2.3 0 - 2.40               pm (1430-1440 hrs),                I had to    leave my

st a nding area to go to the toilet, w h i c h                       is s i t uated at        the     rear of

the L e p p i n g s Ln stand area,               and to the      left     of entrance         ’B".

When    I came out         of the        toilet,       it became a p p a r e n t      to myself      due     to     the

cheering       of the      crowd that        the football          teams were on the             pitch.

There was a normal               size     type    of    crowd   in the area           between the

                    I managed          to go w i t h the           crowd thorough the              tunnel.       There were         no

                    only     remember a steward s e 1 1 i n g \ p r o g r a m m e s .                 At first,       w h e n entering

                    the tunnel,           I could easily make my way a l t h o u g h                          people were     close

                    a r o u n d me.       Towards       the      end of the tunnel                there was a bit of jostling

                    and     I became aware            that       people were being                packed tightly at           its exit

                    leading        to the       terrace.           In the       later      half    of the       tunnel     it was

                    necessary           to use slight            force     to make a yard or two forward.

                    I began        to feel       u n c o m f o r t a b l e at    the    position         I ended up        in Pen 3;

                    there were           o b v i o u s l y more     peoples coming            from behind and those               in the

                    tighter.            I reached       the yar d area;             a gain there was a crowd                 in the yard

                    area,        but    I was able       to move along the                   rear of the stand and               into Pen

                    packed tigh t l y together.

            thing         that    spring       to my mind,          ma i n l y because my brother              is a fireman,

            is that         the    fire       service     did not become              involved quickly enough

            it was         obvious       that    some were          either       ser i o u s l y    injured or dead.          1 did

            is that at            the    time    people were             o b viously making attempts              to escape

            apparently            in charge,        had   no     idea      in the earlier             stages as    to what      had

            gone         on in the       pens.

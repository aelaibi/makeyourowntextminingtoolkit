Dear Mr. Whitehurst,

         We are in                                          of your letter of 5 May.

      We confirm that ITN was represented at the pre-inquiry
meeting on 28 April when Lord Justice Taylor requested that, to
avoid, prejudicing proceedings, no contact should be made with
'witnesses.'

      However when we spoke to Mr. J. Stone during the course of
our research into the background of the Hillsborough disaster,
we found that he had no communication from the police, the
inquiry solicitors or hi# employers, Sheffield Wednesday, even
though it was 17 days after the event. The fact that he had not
been interviwed lsy the police was confirmed by West Midlands
Police./' It was on this basis that we interviewed Mr. Stone/. We
should point out that he neither sought nor received any payments
for the interview.      .___      _                          -   ;

     We would like to apologise to Lord Justice Taylor if our
action contravened hislordship's request and we confirm that it
is not IT»»« intuition to interview witnesses before they have
given evidence to the Inguiry.




                                                                                        itcomb

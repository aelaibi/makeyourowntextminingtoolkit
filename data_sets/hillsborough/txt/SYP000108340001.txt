REPORT RE HILLSBOROUGH DISASTER
                         ■r>
  »




At 8.00 am, Saturday,    15th April 1989,   I commenced duty at Main

Street Police Station,     Rotherham.   At this time,   I was in full

Police uniform forming part of Serial 4 0 which was under the

supervision of Police Sergeant Cloke, with members of our

Serial who were under the direct supervision and control of

Inspector Meek whom we were to meet at the Hillsborough

Football Ground.



A short time later,   together with other officers, we were

conveyed via a force coach to Hillsborough Football Ground.         On

arrival at the Stadium, we all assembled in the North Stand of

the ground where we received a pre-match briefing regarding the

F.A.   Cup Semi-Final between Liverpool and Nottingham Forest.



On conclusion of this briefing all members of our

Serial made their way to phase~one of our duties, that being to

position ourselves on Claywheels Lane/Halifax Road.        Our duties

consisted of meeting arriving coaches of Liverpool Fans,

directing them to park along the length of Halifax Road and

Claywheels Lane.   Tickets were then to be checked and supporters

searched for offensive weapons.



At this stage only one or two coaches had arrived.        It was

approximately 11.30 am, when our Serial attended Halifax Road

for the expected arrival of large numbers of coaches containing

Liverpool Supporters.
Together with PC 3311 Baker,   I was instructed to take the

registered numbers of the arriving coaches.



Only a few Liverpool coaches had arrived up until about

2.00 pm, as we spent our time chatting to the coach drivers.

Fans descending these coaches had been searched and although

they were in high spirits, they were all well behaved.       Many

went off in search of local public houses.     Numerous private

vans and cars containing fans were arriving and these parked in

nearby side streets.    Many of the occupants had already been

drinking.



At approximately 2.15 pm, there was a constant flow of coaches

arriving on Halifax Road and these were directed to park down

the length of that road.



During the time of their arrival,    great numbers of fans were

hurriedly making their way down to the football ground,      far

more than were descending the coaches.     Many of these fans were

carrying cans of beer and lager,    some of them several at a time.

There were   a large number of fans who were unsteady on their

feet, appearing to be fairly drunk.     I remember one youth being

so drunk that he could hardly walk in a straight line.       I

commented that he would have to do a lot better than that if he

hoped to get in the ground.    One of his friends replied,       "He's

doing his best love."
                                                  -    3    -




As    each      coach          arrived,           almost          in       consecutive              ord er,        groups             of

fans      assembled             to    ask     if       any       of    the       fans        on    the    coaches            had

s p are     tickets.                They     were          nearly          always         told      no.      Despite              the

large       numbers            of    fans      'swarming'                  down       towards        the     gro u n d ,          the

majority          were         in    good     spirits             an d      appeared              well    behaved.




Once      the     majority            of     fans          had    cleared             the     area,       our      Serial

assembled            to    a    ' Fu n e r a l        Directors'             on H a l i f a x        Road.           It      was       at

that      point        that         I was     able          to see          that        on    both       s i des     of      the

road,       pavements,               verges           and       gardens          w er e      littered        with         what

seemed       to be         hundreds           of e m p t y            beer       an d     lager      cans       and       bottles.




At    approximately                  3-00     pm,          we    made       our       way     down       towards

Claywheels             Lane         for    refreshments.                     Upon         reaching          the      junction

of C l a y w h e e l s         Lane       and H a l i f a x           Road,       we      met      with     other         officers

and    Detective               Inspector              Charles.              Detective              Inspector            Charles

was    in    possession               of     a radio             and       was    in      the      process         of

communicating                  with       ground           control.              There        appeared          to      be    a

request         for       assistance              at       the    gr ound.              Under       the     direction                 of

Detective            Inspector             Charles,              several          serials/part               serials,

organised            themselves              and       we m a d e          our    way        to    the    Leppings            Lane

end    of    the       ground.             Approximately                    five        to    ten m i n u t e s         later          we

assembled            at    the       junction              of    Leppings             Lane/Vere           Road       in

serials.             We    remained           there             several          minutes           and    following               a

number       of      r a d i o .m e s s a g e s        which          we    found         difficult          to      hear

because         of     the      noise        in       the       ground,          we     were       requested

to e n t e r      i nto        the    Hillsborough                    Footbal'l G r o u n d              through          the

Leppings          L ane        entrance           as       assistance             was        a matter        of      urgency.
There were large numbers of football fans crowded round the

entrance way to the Leppings Lane end, the majority of whom. •

were abusive and agitated.     Upon running into the Leppings Lane

entrance, we were greeted by hostile fans who were shouting

abuse at us demanding to know where we had been and why           it had

taken us so long to get to them.     Some of the fans were injured

clutching their chests,    some blood stained.     Ahead of me,       I

could., see several people laid on the floor at the entrance to a

tunnel which gives access to the terraces.        Some people were

bent over them attempting to give them the kiss of life.              There

was an air   of great panic and confusion and my     immediate

impression   was that fighting had broken out on     the terraces.

However,   I was unable to reconcile this thought with the sight

of persons   having to be resuscitated.



The tunnel   leading down to the terraces was very congested,

people were pushing and shoving each other in and out of the

tunnel.    There seemed to be many injured people,     some actually

lying in the tunnel itself.     I could hear screaming and

shouting, many people were hysterical.     On getting into the left

hand section of terracing    (as you descend the tunnel)    I could

see that people had fallen forwards upon one another and were

pinned up against the wire fences.     Not being fully aware of

what had actually happened together with other officers,          I

began pulling people up.     Many were badly injured, holding

their chests and being unable to breathe.        Several times I

rushed injured people up to the top of the tunnel at the

Leppings Lane entrance where I thought I had seen an ambulance.
The sheer number of injured people was overwhelming,     some were

obviously severely injured or dying.      A large number of fans

were angry and hostile towards us blaming us for what had

happened.     Others were attempting to help us, blaming their own

'hot heads'    for what had happened.   A large number of fans

refused to leave the section of terracing stating they'd come

to see the match, this was despite pleas from myself and

others.     Some fans appeared too shocked to do anything,

seemingly frozen with fear.



It was obvious that people just couldn't get out of this

section of terrace because of the sheer numbers and the high

wire fences.     I remember helping one man to the top of the

tunnel who appeared seriously injured.      He was clutching his

chest,    could not breath and was doubled up in pain.   I had to

leave him propped up against a wall at the top of the tunnel,

leaving him in the arms of a fan who promised to stay with him

so that I could help others.     I am unable to recall what he

looked like.



I returned to the terraces where people were still pushing and

shoving, and at that point, with others, tried to clear a

gangway for officers rushing the dead and injured up through

the tunnel.    Officers and fans alike were frantically trying to

rip the wire fencing behind the goal with their bare hands in

order to let people out.
After a short while an Inspector pulled me towards either a

gate or hole in the fencing and I went out onto the pitch.

In front of me were lines of bodies,        at least forty in all.

Some were being resuscitated by Police Officers and fans alike,

others lay motionless.



A short distance away from the goal         were two men who were      laid

out, ,pne on his front and the other        on his back. ' Someone

shouted that it was too late for the man lying on his front as

his chest appeared to be completely crushed,         so I started to

give the kiss of life to the man lying on his back.             He was

about 20 - 25 years of age, with fair hair, a moustache and

wearing what I think was a beige coloured shirt and jeans.               His

eyes were glazed over, there was frothy mucus around his nose

and he had turned blue.        Although there were no obvious signs

of life and despite the fact that I         suspected he was possibly

dead,   I attempted to revive'him.      I   was joined by PC 3311      Baker

who assisted me and then I was assisted by a civilian woman who

also rendered heart massage.
                      ✓


During our efforts,       another young man joined us, apparently a

friend of this man.       He called him "Gazzer" and thought his

friend was going to be ok.       We tried again and again to revive

him without gain when I told the man it was         'too l a t e '5   He was

distraught and pleaded with me to keep on trying.            We assured

him we'd done as much as we could and after comforting him,              I

left him with the body in order to help other people.
It was a scene of chaos, panic and fear, especially when the

extent of what had happened began to dawn upon people.



At one stage,   together with fans,    I assisted with the

collection of advertising boards which were used as makeshift

stretchers pending the   arrival of ambulances.



Throughout this time, the mood   of the Stadium was one of       panic

and fear.   Fans were hysterical,     it was obvious that many

thousands of people in   the other stands weren't aware of       what

was happening and were   jeering the Liverpool fans.     I genuinely

feared that the fans would riot, angry because of what had

happened, angry with us as Police Officer and angry with rival

fans .



I remember a call for doctors being made over the address

system and after ambulances arrived,     PC Baker and I attempted

to console distraught fans and calm those who wanted to vent

their anger out on us.    One St Johns Ambulance Officer broke

down and wept for ifiinutes on my shoulder.    At one stage I was

ordered to prevent further fans from climbing through the holes

in the fencing out on the pitch behind the goal.      Many of these

fans were deeply distressed,   searching for their loved ones.

We were unable to prevent them from doing this out of sheer

sympathy.
Until the fans were addressed by Kenny Daglish,      they remained

agitated.   They then slowly began to leave the ground.



As PC Baker and I had been separated from our Serial, we joined

Detective Sergeant Tissington and his Serial on the pitch.



I am unable to recall seeing any stewards at the ground but was

a w a r e o f people handing out cups of water to people on the

pitch at the Leppings Lane end of the ground.



Not having a radio,   I was unaware of any radio transmissions

that took place during the incident.



After what seemed like hours, under the supervision of Chief

Superintendent Nesbit, we gently ushered the few remaining fans

from the ground.   The bereaved and lost remained.



We then returned to the North Stand where we later received a

debriefing.

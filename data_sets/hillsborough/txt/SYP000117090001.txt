During         this          time       1 had        to a p p r o a c h       several       fans       outside           the      off

worse        for        drink.          The      people           at    t hi s     time    also       spilt        onto       the

to     a group           of     about         5/6      supporters             stood       across       Penistone              Road,         who

were       seen         to    open       beer/lager               cans     take         several       sips     from          them      then

they would               throw          the    can       containing              alcohol        on    the     r o of     of      adjacent

occasionally                  elderly          and       infirm         people          requested        that       they         should        be

allowed          to      go     up V e r e       Road        towards          Leppings          Lane     for       various            r e aso ns,

including               several         with         c h i ldren who             were     frightened           to       go    down

Penistone               Road       because           of L i v e r p o o l        supporters           that     were          about.

At     about        1500        hours         supporters               kept      rushing        around        showing            us    tickets

for      the     North          and     West         Sit a n d a r e a     of      the    ground and           seemed            to    be

frustrated               due       to    having         been       outside          the    ground        prior          to    the      kick

off.         The        next       thing       I knew was              when        supporters          were        coming         down Vere

             first       thing       we       knew    t h at     there       was     anything         wrong       was    when a          local

             resident          came       up    to    us a n d        said    that       the    supporters             were? on the            pitch

             and    t ha t     the       game    was       stopped»           I stayed          at    that     point         u n t il    the

             majority          of    supporters                had    cleared        w h e n we      were    then       told      by o t h e r

             officers          coming          along       Penistone          Road       from     the    s a me    serial         at     about

             4.30     p.m.          to    return          to    the     grandstand            within     the      ground        w h i c h we

             then    did.           On arr i v i n g           in the      ground        I saw       that    the       crowds        had

             di s p e r s e d a n d       we    then       had       d e — br ief    by a s e n i o r       of f i c e r ,      At      about

             6    p.m.    we      then went           to C l a y w h e e l s        Traffic       Depot      where       we     remained          unti

             we    returned          to       Doncaster          Police       Station,          arriving          at    about        7.45      p.m.

             when    1 then went                off       duty.

             The    atmosphere                outside          the    ground        between 3.15            p.m.       and    4.30       p.m.     was

             electric          and       tense       giving          concern        as   we    eventually          through           residents

             learned         of     the       picture          inside      the      ground      from     fans      and       local

             residents            had     been watching                 television.            That's       why    we    remained

             outside         the     ground          in    case       of a n y      trouble       from      supporters            leaving         or

             again       trying          to    get    into       the     ground.

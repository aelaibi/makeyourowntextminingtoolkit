HILLSBOROUGH STADIUM DISASTER INQUIRY

As you will be aware, Lord Justice Taylor has now embarked upon
the second stage in which he will be looking at the wider issues
of crowd control and safety at sports events.
                *


Lord Justice Taylor has expressed interest in your research work
on crowd behaviour and is aware of your contributions in this
field. It would be very helpful to him and his Assessors if you
were able to let him have some written material, either copies of
paXt papers you have prepared which might assist, or a short
paper summarising the issues as you now see them. Would this be
possible? If it would be helpful to you to discuss first what is
involved, please telephone me.


                                                            /

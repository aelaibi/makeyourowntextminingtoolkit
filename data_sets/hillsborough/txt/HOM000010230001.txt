Division clubs and the handful of big clubs outside the First
Division. The advantage of a narrow interpretation is that there
would be no question about the ability of the clubs concerned to
pay for the conversion of standing to seating accommodation
themselves. On the other hand, all First Division clubs are
regularly involved in games which attract significant crowds and
might therefore have problems of crowd pressures; there are
several clubs generally considered to be "major clubs" outside
the first Division; and the public expectation seems to be that
the aim will be to go wider than the top ten clubs. DoE and Home
Office officials would recommend the longer list.
5. The criteria which the Secretary of State would operate in
deciding which clubs should be required to g o all-seated would
probably depend primarily on a judgement about the likelihood of
crowd "surges", of the kind that occurred at Hillsborough. These
criteria would no doubt take account of Lord Justice Taylor's
report. For the purposes of illustration, we have prepared a list
of clubs and their ground capacities in Divisions 1-3 and
underlined those outside the First Division which might be
chosen. The selection is an arbitrary one (based on our own
estimation of likely trouble spots) and is no basis for decision
now but it Is a useful starting-point for estimating the possible
cost (see below).
6. Whatever list of "major clubs” is eventually chosen for a
requirement for all-seater stadia, there would remain a danger
that clubs outside the list could encounter special crowd surge
problems at particular matches; for example if a "minor” Fourth
Division club, like Tranmere Rovers, drew one of its neighbours
Liverpool or Everton in a Cup match. Subject to anything that
Lord Justice Taylor might say on this matter, it would almost
certainly be desirable to require the host club to impose tighter
than usual crowd-limits (or even to close the terracing
altogether) for such matches. This might be achieved through a
condition of the licence under the Football Spectators Bill or
through the safety certificates issued under the Safety at Sports
Grounds Act.
Cost
7. Annex B gives the present seating and standing capacity of
clubs in Divisions 1 to 3, with an estimate of the initial
capital cost of replacing the standing accommodation by seating.
The cost estimate is based on the Football Trust's figures of £35




                          CONFIDENTIAL
                          CONFIDENTIAL


per seat and of one seat per 2.2 standing spectators. These
figures were widely quoted last week and seem to be generally
accepted. They allow for the costs of fixing seats to existing
terracing and for any changes that might be necessary to the
elevation of the terracing. They do not allow for the seating to
be covered or for larger structural alterations to the ground,
and they may, therefore, bear no relation to what individual
clubs such as Liverpool might choose to spend to improve their
ground (£6.8m in Liverpool’s case).
8. The total capital cost of seating, based on the estimates in
Annex B, for the clubs identified in Annex A, would be about
£12m. This makes no allowance for the effect on clubs' revenue,
of reduced capacity. If no Government support were forthcoming
the Football Trust would probably meet 75% of the capital cost,
based on the figures quoted, (over a two-to-three y e a r period).
Their grant would take into account only the basic cost of
i nstalling seating, because that would be all that was required
for safe t y purposes.

Timing

9. If the requirement to move to all-seater accommodation is
imposed by means of the licensing provisions of the Football
Spectators Bill, it will come into force when they do, ie when
the membership scheme itself does: on present plans, August 1990.
Clubs which took the simplest approach, of putting seating on
existing terracing ought to be able to meet that target, (though
they might not receive grant from the Football Trust until after
the work had been done). Those who decided to make more
substantial   alterations  would   take  a good     deal  longer;
Liverpool’s target date is 1992. We could deal with those who
proposed more substantial, and long-term, alterations either by
introducing an element of flexibility into the Secretary of
State's powers to require seating or by insisting that clubs
closed all their terracing, from a certain date, while they put
in seating.
10. The preceding paragraphs assume that we would expect the
clubs concerned to replace all their standing accommodation by
seating. It would, of course, be possible, to allow some
terracing to remain - as it does on the often-quoted large
European grounds and at Xbrox stadium in Glasgow, and as Lord
Justice Taylor might conceivably recommend. This again could be
dealt with by allowing the Secretary of State a measure of
flexibility in operating the licensing provisions under the Bill.

Issues for decision
11. The decision to delay the Bill to allow for Lord Justice
Taylor's interim report means that most of these issues can be
left until his interim report has appeared. In particular, it may
be wise to delay taking a firm view on the timing and other
points in paragraphs 8 and 9. Ministers will, however, wish to
confirm to the football authorities, when they see them, that it
is their intention to take a power to require all seater-stadia
in the Bill. They will be pressed to say whether the Government
will contribute to the costs of installing seating.
12. The main arguments against a Government contribution are:

       - football is a prosperous industry which should pay for
       its own safety measures;
       - the major clubs, in particular, can afford to pay the
       relatively small capital costs of installing seating;
       - the Football Trust has played a large part in paying for
       safety-related improvements before now and could do so
       again;
       - paying for seating would set a precedent for other
       safety measures that Lord Justice Taylor may recommend and
       possibly for other sports grounds;
       - it would be that much harder to insist that the national
       membership scheme should be financed entirely         from
       football.

13. In favour of a Government contribution:

       - it would be popular with the Government’s supporters;
       - it might, therefore, make        passage   of   the   Football
       Spectators Bill rather easier;
       - just as the decision to press for all-seater stadia was
       taken in advance of the Taylor Inquiry, so a Government
       contribution to the cost could be separated from other
       demands for support;




                           CONFIDENTIAL
                          CONFIDENTIAL


       - it would make it easier to       insist   on   clubs   moving
       rapidly to all-seater grounds.

14. If Ministers were to decide to make a contribution, the level
could be set at, say a quarter or a half of the total cost
estimated by the Football Trust, ie £3m or £6m. If the Trust
were, in any case, willing to pay 75% albeit over 2/3 years, it
might be hard to justify a Government contribution of more than
25%. On the other hand, a contribution of £6m would be recognised
as significant; £3m would be less so.
15. We could perhaps invite the Home Office to share the cost
(though the initial official reaction has been negative). The
Treasury would presumably resist meeting the cost from the
reserve. Depending on decisions about timing, the cost would
probably fall mostly in the next financial year, some in the
present year. The grant could be paid through the Sports Council,
though they have limited experience of         football,   or in
combination with the Football Trust, subject to our preserving
accountability for the money. The advantage of using the Football
Trust is that the Government would get the full credit (rather
than sharing it with the Sports Council) and that the Trust has
extensive experience of providing grants to football clubs.

Conclusion
16. It would be helpful to know whether Ministers wish:

       a) to go for a relatively wide definition           of   "major
       clubs", ie all First Division + 10 others?
       b) to leave decisions on when the requirement to replace
       terracing will take effect (and on whether any residual
       terracing is to be allowed) until the interim report of
       the Taylor Inquiry is available;
       c) pursue the possibility of a Governmentcontribution
       towards the basic capital cost of installing seating, of
       £3m or £6m or some other figure?

17. If the answer to (c) above is "yes”, we should approach first
the Home Office, and then the Treasury, and the territorial
Departments, with a view to making a decision before Ministers
see the football authorities. It ought to be possible to reach



                           CONFIDENTIAL
                          CONFIDENTIAL


such a decision in the next two weeks, which suggests a meeting
with the football authorities in the week beginning 8 or 15 May,
perhaps to be followed by Third Reading in the Lords before
Whitsun?

          HILLSBOROUGH DISASTER APPEAL FUND

          In his statement to the Commons yesterday about the incident at
          Sheffield Wednesday Football ground on 15 April, the Home
          Secretary announced that the Government intended to contribute
          £500,000 to the Hillsborough Disaster Appeal Fund which has been
          established with the (interim) terms of reference "An appeal fund
          for the assistance to those who have suffered injury or loss as a
          result of the Hillsborough disaster".  This appeal fund is being
          administered by the civic authorities of Sheffield, Liverpool and
          Nottingham and probably also by Liverpool Football Club. You
          will see from the attached note that the fund which the football
          club had established is merging with the one established by the
          civic authorities.  I have asked those involved in the
          administration of the fund to write to me to provide details of
          the funds status, terms of reference, names of trustees, etc.

          I should be grateful for your assistance with regard to the
          actual arrangements for payment.  To cover the point, I confirm
          that the funds cannot be found from the Fire Department budget.

HILLSBOROUGH DISASTER APPEAL

The Home Secretary might like to know that the appeal fund set up
by the Liverpool Football Club is to merge with the fund
established by the civic authorities of Sheffield, Liverpool and
Nottingham.

I understand that the fund managers are looking toward making
some immediate payments to assist with the funeral expenses of
those who died in the incident.

HILLSBOROUGH STADIUM DISASTER INQUIRY

We spoke on the telephone the other day about Lord Justice
Taylor's plans to visit football matches during Part II of his
Inquiry. I mentioned that he would be in Manchester on Friday 6
October and would like to have the opportunity to visit Maine
Road. You kindly agreed to make arrangements to show him round
the ground in the afternoon.  (He will be visiting Old Trafford
in the morning with a working lunch there).

Lord Justice Taylor would like to meet the Club officials who are
responsible for crowd control and safety. He would also like to
meet the police concerned, and I am in touch with Greater
Manchester Police about this.

I will accompany Lord Justice Taylor throughout. Perhaps you
could be kind enough to let me have details as to which entrance
of the ground we should come to. I suggest a starting time of
2.30, if you agree. Please get in touch if you would like to
discuss the arrangements further.

We look forward to meeting you and your colleagues on 6 October.

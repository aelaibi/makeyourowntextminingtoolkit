neck of p e o p l e         trying      to g e t in             the match.

As    1 wns .standing in the q u e u e of p e o p l e h e a d i n g                          towards        the

Feople started              Lo push f o r w a r d              to a v o i d    the f r i g h t e n i n g horses,

I slipped         around        the back of             the h o r s e s        in a panic       lo cjet away

from      them.

I forc-ed my;?elf a r o u n d             the b ac k of                the c r o w d and lo the sides.

I was       s w a m p e d by    Lhe cro wd        towards              the    turnstiles,       you co ul d

People' w e r e g e t t i n g s t u c k        at    the t u r ns ti le by       the p u r e v o l u m e

of p e o p l e    there wh ich was d e l a y i n g p e o p l e g e t t i n g            in.

1 and other:?           tried     to h e l p    them over,         the p ol ic e w o r e u n c e r t a i n

what        to do but       thankfully         (I thought)         they did o pe n        the gates.

As    1 turned         to go insi de        the g r o u n d     there was o nl y one o b v i o u s

entrance         I cou ld see.

Thej.e w ore no s t ew a r d s or p o l i c e               to d i r e c t us    to the f.lanks

or o t h e r ports of           the g r o u n d      so w e all h e a d e d      to the s e c t i o n

behind        the goal.

I thought         it was like A n f i e l d w h e r e when y ou a r r i v e on                  the

Terraces         you fan out,          there wars no d i r e c t i o n          to the flanks.

It was        immediately obvious               that     this s e c t i o n was        full,    p ac k ed

Lo    the brim.

1    couldn't        turn back b e c a u s e of          the p e o p l e behind.

I was        forc ed    to the l eft h an d c or ne r of                the s ectio n,        it was

too packed,            it w a s n ' t c o m f o r t a b l e and I f el t        then    that 1 w a n t e d

to get        out.

Apparently           the g ame had        k i ck ed off a nd c a u s e d a f urt he r            surg e

forward,         I avoided        the b a r r i e r s    and was p u s h e d      f urther      forward

towards         the fence.

The        cro wd had     s t o p p e d m o v i n g f o r w a r d but    the s ur g e of p r e s s u r e

had no I .

1 war. g e t t i n g c r u s h e d and the re was no let up from b e h i n d .

It was y e t t i n g much h arder               to breath.

1 was w a i t i n g       for it to ease up but it never.

People started              to panic and            tried    to get      out.

T he r e was yet a n o t h e r m a s s i v e surge,              popping        the air out

of my body.

                                                -2-

The p rr sp u r c on my back was forcing my                      throat     onto      tho

po ison in front of me,                into his elbow.

1 c o u l d n ’t move,          not a s in gl e part of        my body.

1 tried       to call out but couldn't.

1 couldn't        breath,         it felt     like a b e n c h     vice    t i g h t e n i n g up

slowly,       it must h av e b e e n        sus ta ined      for at least         j   minulco.

I was so c r u s h e d          against other people           I could not get              anot h er

 I honestly        felt I was dying.

 The re was no physical               pain,     not until       muc h later.

 I felt light          h e ad e d and very s leepy,           I w a nt ed      to go a s l ee p

 as if I      was g oi n g        to bed,    my eyes w e r e h e a v y and         I star t ed

 to cJose       them,      it was     like goi ng i n t o a dream.

 My body was g e t t i n g p u s h e d and f o r c e d           to the l ef t and my

 head    to    the right,          still unable        to move.

 My hands w e r e c r u s h e d        agai n st my ch e s t but          they w e r e u se le s s ;    .

  I c o u l d n ’t e ven get         the man's      elb ow   o u t of my       throat.

  ]: thought       "This is it - I'm g o i n g            to die".

  A friend of mine had s een my p r e d i c a m e n t and s o m e h o w got

  the man'., e l b o w off my             throat,     he s a i d   later       that   I was     turning

  My face was          forc ed into         the b a c k of s o m e o n e ' s    PVC jacket.

  P e o p l e s t o o d on me as if             I was a s p r i n g b o a r d        to .safety.

   It was s h e e r panic.

  -1. was s c a r e d    that I w o u l d n ' t        get up.

  I just g r a b b e d hold of s o m e o n e ' s               leg   as he was g o i n g over              the

  1 w as h e l p e d over          the railings.

  i was     in shock         and    trying       to recover.

  I looked       up     to see      a man i m p a l e d on        the spikes,            a man was        trying

  lo push him back,                out of pure         instinct          I h e l p e d h i m push        him

  1 turned       to go out          of    the     tiny doors.

 ’Ihere was       a man in          a r ed j u m p e r on       top of the r a ilings

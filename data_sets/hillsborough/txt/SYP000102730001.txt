                                                                                 : i
                        HILLSBOROUGH DISASTER 15TH APRIL 1989




 I have been a Police Constable in the South Yorkshire Police since 13th April
 1 98 1 .   I would say that since that time I have worked all but a half a dozen
 of Sheffield Wednesday Football Club's home fixtures.      I have also worked
 football matches at Barnsley, Rotherham, Doncaster and Bramall Lane.


 For the last three football seasons I have worked the same duty.       This being,
 after briefing, to stand outside the Director's entrance until ten minutes after
 kick-off.     I then go to the player's tunneluntil half time when I   return to the
 Director's. entrance until the second half kick's off, then I return to the
 player's tunnel near to the perimeter track      and ten minutes before the final
whistle I return to the Director's entrance       and remain there until the South
Stand is clear of all supporters.
'l




I also worked the Leeds v Coventry semi final in 1987 suicl the Liverpool v Nottingham
Forest semi final in 19 88 , again doing the above duty.


At 9*^5am on Saturday 15th April 1989 I commenced duty at the Sheffield Wednesday
Football Club.      After briefing and a short meal I took up my duty at the Director's
entrance accompanied by PC Janet Cruttenden whose duty it was also.       I was looking
forward to the day being a keen football fan and PC Cruttenden and myself chatted
and joked with numerous supporters throughout the morning and afternoon.         The
Directors entrance which is situated in the middle of the South Stand was quite
busy and everything seemed to be going fine, there was a steady of flow of people
at this stand.


At approximately 2.00pm I left the Director's entrance to go for my meal and
whilst walking around the perimeter track I recall thinking how nice it was to
see the Kop full but when I glanced across to the Leppings Lane end I was surprised
that the two end pens were relatively empty.      I returned to the Directors entrance
about 2.30pm and recall saying to the two youngsters who work for the club and
stand inside the Directors entrance (Jane and Ian) that I hoped more Liverpool
supporters would turn up because there was loads of space at their end.


A short time later I realised from listening to my personal radio that we (the Police)
were having problems at the Leppings Lane end with Liverpool supporters.         I heard
that the supporters were climbing over the South Stand wall into the ground.           I
walked away from the Directors entrance and looked up the car park to see if I could
                                                 (2)




sos any fr?.-I-:, cl ; i iag over.               I couldn't and assumed it would be further up
neas s? to               1? \'s!:W Stand.       There was then a lot of messages over the radio
arv,- j res& i is *                     - an officer asking for the gates at the West Stand to be
opened but Ic IIoy iJig the radio messages that I heard I got the impression that
tbs* iiverpoe                 swpp ^rters had forced open a gate and recall saying so to PC
Ciattendee,


A shyrt ti’& Jsatr* I heard a roar from the crowd and assumed they had kicked
off.        A        0        s of ninutes later I heard - PS 616 Goddard I think - request all
avaxsable                jv-isis to get onto the pitch.       I then said to PC Cruttenden 'I am
golug to s£j                 suit is happening down there1.      I walked through the reception area
antf r'.own                  flayer's tunnel towards the pitch.       As a reached the perimeter track
I looked m e                  to the Leppings Lane end and saw supporters climbing over the
perimeter > ts n ; and also climbing upto the West Stand.                    %   immediate reaction was
that there                   l been a pitch invasion.      As a walked towards the Leppings Lane end
I was aet.               ?      Fenwick Collins who asked if I had a radio, I replied that I had
and *e said '«■*»i; down there, there’s a young kid having a heart attack'.                    I ran
down        .ad ? < a Police Officer giving mouth to mouth to a young boy, not realising
the aKveri if of > hat was happening I got on my radio and requested anasibulance.
i   rfc'S'©iv«ft *i« reply to my request.               I then saw an ambulance driving around the
periraettr                      of the pitch and thinking it was as a result of my request, ran
dowc ••••.-j t h e Loppings Lane goal mouth to try and clear the way, it wasn't until I
got■teer©                      I realised there were other supporters on the pitch either dead or
dying                         ambulance stopped behind the goal mouth.      A Liverpool supporter
then    r                i ay iTK and pulled me towards a male laid on the pitch, he was crying
and                            .the side of his friend asked if there was anything I could do.
The ms)          1 oa* eft f’cad, his eyes bulging.          I felt his p'ulse, there wasn't one.    I
felt X > w tc fey to resusitate this male and as I was going so another supporter
got hole e f my -houlders and said something like 'It's all your fucking fault,
murder          e>                  .    I then saw the man who had asked me for help, hit the abusive
support ?                      f m-n then seemed to realise that his friend was dead and I told
him to                       ; i?■ iim for identification purposes.    I then tried to help others
but fel                  yWi-.v-«nd told friends to stay with injured friends or relative and
get a Po/ i              t     'icici* or St. John's ambulanceman if their condition worsened.       By
this tin*-               i=• ‘-tarted breaking up the advertising boards to use as stretchers.
A young ? , fhr o                       Iked up to me and asked me for some water, the only water I
could thi«* a                  wot in the buckets near to the dug outs where the substitutes sit
and walked ^                        tnere.     When I reached the player's tunnel I saw that there

were proble m?                  ;          ^rters wanting tp go up the tunnel and PC Dennis Webster
asked me to give him a hand to control the supporters, which I did.         I noticed
as soon as I assisted him to push back the supporters that there was a very strong
smell of alcohol and the majority of fans were the      worse for drink and slurring
their words.     I then saw one supporters who was particularly the worse for drink
approach Desmond Lynam, the T.V. presenter, and he started to give his version of
what had happened.     He was complaining that he had   been in a crush at the
Leppings Lane end when a Police Officer opened the gates and let everyone in and
he was brandishing his ticket.     I heard Desmond Lynam   say   to a man with a camera
"Listen to this man, he's been in the middle of it".       This man was then interviewed
and filmed.     I just couldn't believe what I was seeing, I thought to myself if he
was in the* crush at the Leppings Lane end how come he's now on the pitch, without
any sort of injury.     How did he get from the back of the supporters onto the
pitch?     This man then became vefbally abusive to both myself and PC Webster and
would have been arrested in any other circumstances.        At this stage I didn't really
know the severity of what had happened but was extremely angry at being verbally
abused and threatened by Liverpool supporters who had obviously been drinking
heavily.    The supporters who appeared sober were helping to restrain their fellow
supporters.


A short time later I was approached by a man from the BBC who asked if I knew what
the casualty number was for people to telephone igas the BBC switchboard was being
jammed.     I told him I would find out for M m and went to an office and tried to
get through to Hammerton Road Police Station to get the telephone number but when
I got through they were unable to assist.     The BBC man then said they were going
on air in eight minutes and desparately needed the number.        I then contacted PC Ryan
in the Police Control Box who asked me to hold on as the number was just coming
through.  I then gave the number to the BBC man and returzx^to the player's tunnel.
                      ✓
I stayed there for a short while until it was announced that the game was cancelled.


I then returned to the Director's entrance in case there were any problems there.
At this time I estimated that there were about ^0 people dead.         When I got to
the main reception at the Director's entrance, obviously all the staff were
extremely upset so I stayed at the door and refused admittance to the people who
were trying to get in.    At this stage I tried to take in what had happened but
found it was very difficult to believe that such a- tragedy had occurred.        I then
found out that 93 people had died and difficult as it was continued with my job
and tried to comfort members of staff at the ground.       Once the South Stand appeared
to be clear I left the Director's entrance to return to the gymnasium via the
perimeter track.    I had walked half way down the player's tunnel to the pitch when
                           (4 )                                           1^




I was overcome by emotion and began to cry.   Mr. Douglas Lock in charge of
security at The footbail club approached me, took me to an office and gave
me a cup of coffee.   Some 15 minutes later I regained my composure and
returned to the Police room.   I was given a drink by someone and then Chief
Supt Mole asked if I was O.K. I replied that I was.   I sat there for a few
minutes when I was approached by Chief Supt Nesbit who also asked if I was
alright, then he told me to go home.   ^ short time later I was taken home.

      Dear Sir


      I refer to your recent letter dated 17 August 1990 asking for a copy of a
      statement made by yourself.

      In view of the current criminal investigation taking place under the guidance
      of the Director of Public Prosecutions and the supervision of the Police
      Complaints Authority I am not at liberty to release any material at this
      stage.

      If this situation changes I will inform you accordingly.      I trust you
      understand the current position.

      I can however confirm that you did make a statement to the Hillsborough
      Inquiry.

      Yours faithfully




     M J FOSTER
     DETECTIVE CHIEF SUPERINTENDENT




     PLEASE REPLY TO THE OFFICE A T ____

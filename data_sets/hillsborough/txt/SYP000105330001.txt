 Briaa KELLY,   Police Constable 2177

MALTBY POLICE STATION, HIGH ST., MALTBY, ROTHERHAM.

TEL ROTHERHAM 812282.




I am a Police Constable in the South Yorkshire Police, at present stationed at

Maltby.

At 8am on Saturday 15th April 1989, I commenced duty at Maltby Police Station, from

where I was transported to Hillsborough Football Ground, Sheffield.

At 10am a briefing was held in the main stand, which I attended.

My detail was Serial No       which entailed the supervision of Nottingham Forest

supporters and traffic on Herries Road South. I took up these duties at 11.15am«

At 300pm, Phase 1 of this detail was completed and it was our intention to attend

Claywheels Lane for a meal, however, we were instructed to stand by at the junction

of Herries Road South and Penistone Road,

At 3»05pm we were directed into the grouad, and upon reaching the main stand at it's

junction with the Kop, further directed to go onto the pitch and form a cordon

across the pitch near to the goal at the Leppings Lane end of the ground*

Upon arrival at this point I saw that many of the supporters from this section of

the stand were on the pitch and many of-them appeared dazed and distressed.

It appeared that there was some major problem inside the stand, and more and more

people were trying to get through the gaps in the wire fencing and onto the piten.

General control was maintained of the crowd coming onto the playing area. This

control was kept until all the crowd had left the stand.

At 4.^5?™ we left the ground to perform stand by duties on Penistone Road, at it's

junction with Herries Road South.

At 5•20pm we returned to the main Stand where an appraisal of the day's events was

given by a senior officer. We were stood down at 5*^5prc, returning to Maltby at 7.30pm,

where after a further de-briefing, we retired from duty at 8.00pm.

           I am a single man I live at the above address with my parents,



           I am employed at



           Since December 1988 I have been a member of the Heart of E n g l a nd

           Liverpool Football Supporters Club, and I have attended the majority

           of home and away matches of Liverpool and I have travelled with the

           Heart of England Club.       The Secretary of the Club is



           On Saturday,    13th April   1989 <150489)       I went to the pick up point in

           Vicarage ST, Nuneaton for the Heart of England Supporters Coach.                    I
                                    u& m -
           went with my friend             and we met two other friends                       and

                               it the pick-up point.        I also noticed that there was a
                                                                      FAGE     2
                                                                      S 1632

number of regular travellers at the pick-up point.       The coach arrived

at about    10.40 am <1040).              was on the coach and he gave us

our tickets, my ticket and              were for the W Stand Standing

Terraces.                      had tickets for the seating in the N Stand.

My ticket cost me six pounds.



The four of us, t h a t ’s                     and myself sat on end seats

half way along the coach in order that we could play cards



The coach stopped again at Hinkley and Leicester and a number of

supporters got on at both places.      They were regular passengers     I

didn't take much notice.



The coach stopped once more by the motorway to pick up one more person.



We didn't stop again until we got to Sheffield.       We were diverted

around Sheffield to miss the Nottingham Forest end of the ground.



As we were driving    into Sheffield we were stopped by the Police who

were   checking to see if we had any alcohol and to ensure that we had

tickets for the match.



The coach was parked in a side road where other      coaches were parked,

it was by a brewery about ten minutes walk from the Hillsborough

Football Ground.



The Police were in attendance in the vicinity where the coaches         parked.



Myself and three friends       <                       eft the coach and

walked to the Leppings LN turnstiles.       I didn't see any other
                                                                       PAGE      c
                                                                       S I 632

passengers from our coach again until      I was walking back to where the

coach was parked.       Later that day after the match was abandoned.



When we got to the Leppings LN turnstiles            and I went through

together but                     left us because they were going to the

seated area of the stand,



While we were walking to the ground I saw Police stationed along the

route.     I did not see any drunken or violent behaviour.      I was asked

four or five times      if I could sell them a ticket.



The queues at the Leppings LN turnstiles were orderly there were

Policemen about some where on horseback.       There were groups of

supporters hanging about the turnstiles.



I am fairly certain that I was searched when I went through the

turnstiles,      I also handed my ticket to the operator.



When I got through the turnstile      I am fairly certain there were police

officers just inside the ground.



         and 1 went through the tunnel   in the W Stand.    We had easy

access through the tunnel.       However there were people blocking the end

of the t u n n e l .



I didn't see any Police or Stewards at either end of the tunnel



It was about 2.00 pm (1400)      or just after that we went down the

tunnel,    the terracing was quite crowded but we managed without too

much difficulty to make our way down the terracing on the right of
                                                                            PAGE    4
                                                                            S1632

the barrier which runs down the centre from the tunnel           it is Pen 3,



We stopped about half-way down the terracing and stood there.



However after about five minutes it started to get more crowded so we

decided to get over the centre fence to Pen 4 where it was           less

crowded.



We took up our match viewing position which was about half-way down

the terracing a number of feet away from the centre barrier dividing

Pens 3 and 4.



The   crowd kept building u   p   w   a   s   stood behind me.   The crush

started getting worse until eventually about ten minutes before kick-

off the crowd crush was really b a d .         I coul dn’t move it got very hot I

was sweating.   The crush was so great that I could feel the coins             in

rny trousers pocket digging    into my groin .



While the players were kicking the ball around on the pitch just prior

to kick-off   I saw people up the front clambering over the perimeter

fencing onto the football     pitch.      I was very concerned for            who

is smaller than me.



I couldn’t see when the game kicked off because of the people who

were climbing over the fence obstructing my view.



Because of the crowd crush I didn't notice any crowd surges.            I forced

myself to the front.    I managed to clamber onto the centre

barrier and then clamber over the perimeter fencing with great

difficulty onto the football      pitch,      by this time the players had left
                                                                         PAGE
                                                                         S I 632

the pitch.



I sat on the grass for a minute or so to recover.



I then looked around to see if I could help anyone.        There were a

number of people who were lying on the pitch motionless.         Other

persons    including Police were trying to assist them.



I d i d n ’t see a barrier break in Pen 3.



I left the football    ground with           who joined me on the pitch at

about 4.45 pm (1645).     Having first made our way to the N Stand where

we met up with



We then made our way back to the coach.



Prior to leaving Sheffield we were told that two passengers were

missing from the coach and they were two Leicester       lads.



I have since seen the photographs of the brothers Carl and Nicholas

HEWITTS in the local    paper and I recognised them as being fairly

regular passengers on our supporters     coach.    I can't remember them

getting on our coach that day.



I didn't see any drunken violent behaviour nor did I see any criminal

offence.



I wasn't    injured other than shock.



I think everything has been said with regard to the incident.

The Police were in attendance in the vicinity where the coaches parked.

for     Dave         who     was       only      tw o     or     three      people          behind         me,      I saw a

saw     three         stewards           standing              there,       we     then walked              over        to    the      g e n ts

and     managed            to     push       our      way      in to       go    to    the     toilet.              In f a c t        it was

packed          in the           toilet,         because            we    knew     t hat     time/was            getting           on we          came

were       people          just        walking            around,          like a          normal        game,        when      I wa s

walking          down        the       tunnel         it w a s       my    intention           to     go    to      the      r ight      hand

through          the       cr ow d,      it      was      quite          easy    to    go    through           th e     c r o w d a n d we

reached          a    place        where         we     could        see    the       pitch       so we        j us t     stood        there,

it w a s        very       close        to w h e r e        we      were    last       year,        at     t hi s     ti me     it w a s

singing          and       chanting.               I was         ju st     getting          built        up for         the     g am e       to

still        comfortable,                with         a good a t m o s p h e r e            with     everybody               enjoying

and     tighter            in the        crowd          because           I remember           pushing           back,        but      I still

w a s n ’t c o n c e r n e d           about       the      the      crush.           It w a s      about        kick        off      time        when

try and         get me        off     because              I was        dobuled             over       the    barrier          and my           hip s

happened            I stopped             and     put        m y f oo t        back on           the    g ro u n d ,     it was           painful

but      I managed             to    do     it,. I s t a r t e d         struggling               to    get     to      the     end       of    the

g e t t i ng    crushed,             as     I went          round I t r ipp ed                over       the     s t a n d i on a n d           fell

o ve r    and       as    I fell          over        it    ripped        the      right          leg     of my         jeans        off       and    my

leg      got    trapped             between           the       bottom       of    the       stantion and                 the     concrete

step      and       I c o u l d n ’t get              up,       I could        feel         people        trying          to    pull       me    up

in    f act     I ’ve         got                                                                             from        the     hands         of

the      peeople,             but. t h e y       c o u l d n ’t m o v e        me,       the m o r e         they were            pulling            the

mare      it w a s        bending           my    leg       and       I thought             my    leg w as         going        to     b ra k e .

Somehow         my       foot       just     worked             l oose    and      I got          dragged          up     back       to m y      feet

and      Dave       was       still       there,           I must        have      been          on    the    floor        for       quite       s o me

t ime,     in       fact       it    felt        like       a    lifetime          because             when     I got          to m y      feet

all      I could          see       were     bodies             around       me    and       people          trying        to     revive

th em.         There          was    a mans           head       between          my    feet          with    two       supporters

trying         to    revive          him     pumping             on his        ch est .           A    policman           ran up          from       the

bottom         and assisted                 with       the       two     supporters.                   The    policeman              started

mouth      to m o u t h         with        the       m a n , the        policeman               checked        the      mans        eyes       and

pulse      and       then        pulled          the       mans       t shirt          up    o ve r     his     face.           The

in h is        twenties             and     wearing             an orange          coloured             t shir t,          I c a n ’t

remember            anything          else        about          him.

I remember              looking          down       in f r o n t      of me       d o w n at     the      w al l      and     it w as

just     a    pile       of    bodies          s o me     moving       and       some     not.        I had my a r m ar o u nd

my mate           Dave    because          my       leg    was       hurting        me    we    were      both        in a       state       of

shock        we    d i d n ’t k n o w w h a t            was    going       on t h e r e       were      ju st     bodies        all

round        us.        Dave       said    to       me    lets       get    out     and    he    helped          me     b a ck    up    the

terrace           and    out       through          the    tunnel,          people        were       carrying           bodies         out

through           the    tunnel,          we    got       out    into       the     yard       and    had a        sit      down       by

some     railings.                 I watched             people       bringing           bodies       out a n d         l ying     them

down     in f r o n t         of    us.        I hadn't          got       the    faintest           idea what           the      time       was

bu t    I think          I phoned          home          from    a shop          outside        the      g r o u n d at       about         4.00

pm.      After          I'd    phoned          home       we    had ano th er            sit    down and           we    eventually

went     b a ck     to    the       car    where          the    others          e v e n t u a l l y met       us.       Dave      drove

home     but       we                                            and       because        of    t hi s    we     had     to      keep

s t o p p i n g , I got            home    at       8.00       pm.

From     when       the       surge       hit       me    to    when       I got      back      to m y      f e et      I was      lying

on     the    floor       all       the    time,          fortunately             for     me    1 was       by the          side       of a

barrier           which       I think          saved       me    from       being        crushed,         I never           saw a

barrier           give    way       at    any       time,       in f a c t       I didn't        really          see     anything

from     where          I wa s      including             any    of    the       game     because         when        I got       to m y

feet     there          was    plenty          of    room       r o u n d me.

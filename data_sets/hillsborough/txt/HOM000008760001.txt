Re the Hillsborough Family Support Group fax, copy attached undated. As I understand it, the
material they seek access to is the attached list (from George Howarth's letter). I have seen
the information myself and confirmed that all except 'Report by Noel Burnes (a structural
engineer)' is in the Library; I have confirmed this to the HFSG.

I cannot myself see the objection to paying for photocopying, as even in discovery of
documents in legal proceedings such costs are payable. My staff do not have time to go and
photocopy it given other burdens on their time.

I doubt myself whether this material will make any substantial difference to matters igven
that we already know the full story, but it would be unfortunate if Mr Hammond's view, that
they are being prevented from having access to crucial material, gained currency.

Can the Home Office assist in ensuring this view cannot be sustained?

Thanking you in anticipation.




Yours si iperely,

Dear Sir

Availability o f Access to Hillsborough Docum entation

Our latest efforts to view the material deposited in the House o f Commons Library following
Lord Justice Stuart-Smith’s “Scrutiny" have again proved to be unsuccessful.

The documentation appears to be crucial to our campaign. However, despite requests to the
Home Office and Merseyside MP’s, it has been extremely difficult to establish what was
placed in the Library, when it arrived, and how we could gain access to the material.

Maria Eagle’s office have offered their assistance but because o f the burden it would put on
her staff, they are not able to undertake the whole exercise single-handed. We did intend to
have a member of our own staff travel down and copy the material, but as we now understand
that she will not be allowed admission into the Library. We have also been advised that we
will be charged “per page” for the photocopying.

I understand that the material is due to be returned to South Yorkshire Police on Friday 31
July. This means that unless this impasse is resolved quickly, the Group will effectively have
been prevented from access to the material, which I am sure was not your intention when you
spoke to the House on 18 February 1998.


 Yours sincerely




 Phil Hammond
 Vice-Chairman/Secretary

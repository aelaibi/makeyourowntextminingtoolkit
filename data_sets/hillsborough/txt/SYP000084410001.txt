hoases       a 1ong       that     route.

At 2 .45       p.m.       we    parked       on Co c k s h u t t s    L a n e , Oughtibridge.               At     this    time

messages           wars    being       passed on the             radio,,         By this         time we    realised

that     there was             some    sort      of    problem at the             g r o u nd .     As we were meant

to be meeting at C l a y w h e e l s                   Lane at 3,15          p . m . , it was          deci d e d to make

our way        towards          the    ground         in case any a s s i s t a n c e            was    neafled.

As we got           closer       to the       ground,       the      radio t ra n s mi s s ioyf bee ame more

clear and            I could       hear      someone       shouting         to    110 pen tfare gate, '            This was

re p e a t e d a few t ime s .

As the       van turned            left      into        Leppings      Lane from C a t c h B a r L a n e ,I could

see    there was a p p r o x i m a t e l y               three    h u n d r e d people milling about at                  the

entrance           to the       qround and/^S*}. 1 along L e p o i n q s L a n e .

The    van     parked on L a p p i n g s              L a n e , 1 could      see S u p e r i n t e n d e n t     Marshall

stood on the              b r i d g j ^ w a l 1 , looking        towards         the    ground.

As we were m o n i ^ f r i n g             the    crowd f r o m j/ne van               1 saw some Polic e

officers and special                    constables           runrfrom        the       traffic         lights    down

towards       the ground.               We    got out J5f the            van to give              some assistance,,

As we a p p r o a c h e d        the L e o p i n g s / . a n e    e n t r a n e e to the          ground we were

ordered       to form a cordon a l/rig this                          entrance          and told not         to     let

an y o n e   in at all,,              Whilst/this          cordon was            in ope r a t i o n an a m b u l a n c e

ground.            The a m b u l a n c e     stopped at about               15 yards         on the       road w hich

runs     round the             ground      from the        cordon.          At    this     time        I saw a young man

and w oman          emerge       from      the    ground and          sit    on the        floor        by the     side    of

My serial           was    then orde r e d            to enter       t h e /round,         as     there were        reports

of a possible              pitch       invasion.           We w a l k e d    past       the a m b u l a n c e    having        to

step     over about             three      or four        people who were               laid on the         gro und       being

treated,,           I saw an a m b u l a n c e m a n          treating           a teenage         boy who was

ob v i o u s l y    unconcious          or                    dead.

We ente r e d the gr o u n d via the gate w h i c h                     is opposite             the    tunnel      which

leads     to the      centre        pen of the L a p pings Lane                terraces.              In this

en c losed area betw e e n the                gate and the tunnel                  entrance,          there were a

mass    of people        just       stood around.           As we       entered          into    the     crowd,     a lot

of the     people      began shouting at us.                     We    tried to disperse                 this    crowd

to the     perimeter        of the         enclosed area.              It was at this             time      I rrearci

that    there were         people at          the entrance            of the       tunnel       requi r i/ig medical

attention,.          I made my way            over      to this area,          therefore          getting

d e t ached    from my serial.                I saw about         12 to       15 bajLires        laid on the
                                                                                  "                    — ..
ground,       the m a j o r i t y    of    them a l r e a d y    r e c e p *'frig treatment,,              I then saw

an ambulanceman,            I d i r e c t e d him to the              people       who were       in urgent         need

of    professional        medical          attention,,          I saw    two       bodies       one    of a man

possibly       in his     late       twenties and one             in his       early twenties               who were

obviously already             dead.

As more       injured      people         came    into the are a         the       people who were              stood

around    became a g i t a t e d and             tempers    began       to    rise.        As    people        in the

g round    became aware             of what was          happening,,         relatives          from other areas

of the    ground who          had family           in the L e p p i n g s      Lane       end ana        friends

began     to arrive       in the          enclosed area to get                into       the    pen to find their

friends       or family.

Due    to this,       I was     told to join other                officers          at    the    entrance        of tr.e

tunnel    to prevent          the     people       from entering             the    pen.        There was about

s e v e n officers a l t o g e t h e r includi ng a Sergeant.

It became       very d i f ficult           to    prevent       the    people       from entering              because

emotions       were    so high,           some    of the    suppo r t e r s        tried       to get      in by

p h ysically forcing            us    back       but   they were        not    successful.               I then fauna

myself    tending        to an e x t r e m e l y upset middle                 aged       lady who        had    lost    her

h u s b a n d and to a young              girl with her          b o y f r i e n d who     had    lost      their

friend.        The    remainder           of the       time was       spent    comforting             and a d v i s i n g

the    supporters.

            As    the m a t c h was    d e c l a r e d abandoned,       the   exit    of the s upporters         was

            monitored.        The     serial      I was      in reformed and went           back   on patrol       and

            to    reports    of d i s t u r b a n c e s   in the H i l l s b o r o u g h area.

            At 8 . 1 5 pm the serial           returned to E c c l e s f i e l d Police S t a t i o n and went

            off    duty.

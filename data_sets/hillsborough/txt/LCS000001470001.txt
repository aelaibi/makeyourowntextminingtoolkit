         I wrote to you recently, saying that a Hillsborough Memorial Garden

      has been created in Port Sunlight Village.                   Some of the Relativies

         have asked for a photograph.                We have had the enclosed photograph

         taken.         Please accept it with my compliments and condolences.

      Mr Mason of Liverpool Social Services Department has, again, kindly

      agreed to distribute this note for me.

My Company, UML Limited, is responsible for Port Sunlight, the historic
Unilever Village on the Wirral.   We would like to dedicate one of the gardens
within Port Sunlight to the memory of those who died so tragically at
Hillsborough on 15th April.   We have planted flowers to represent a
spectator's scarf and two beds with the Liverpool Football Club Liver Bird
symbol.

We will be holding a-short service.'-of dedication, led by the Minister of
Christ Church, Port Sunlight at 2.30 p .m on 10th August, 1989.                 We are
planning a small gathering with one or two representatives from Liverpool
F.C., the Unilever 'Cetopanies o n .M e r s e y s i d e ‘and the" Wirral Borough Council.
We would warmly welcome any of the relatives' and friends of those involved to
join us on that occasion.

M r . Mason of Liverpool Social Services Department has kindly agreed to
distribute this note for me, as we are most anxious not to trespass on
anyone's privacy at such a time.

If you would like to join us, you will find the Memorial Garden site behind
the Hulme Hall and facing our War Memorial and the Lady Lever Art Gallery.  It
is slightly elevated and surrounded by pillars and a stone ballustrade. It is
possible to park on many of the roads in the Village.

Yours sincerely,

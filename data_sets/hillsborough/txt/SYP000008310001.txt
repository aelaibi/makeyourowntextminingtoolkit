             I am a married man and reside at the                 above address together       with my

             wife.      We have   lived he re for about           two y e a r s .

            At approximately 11am on the morning                  of Saturday 15th      April 1989 I

            was       in the front upstairs       room of my      house engaged inre~de corat i ng

             it.      My home is within walking distance of the Sheffield Wednesday

             Football Ground,        Hi 1 lsborough.      From the upstairs         room 1' could see the

             junction of                        and Leppings Lane.           I remained in that     room

             up until about 3pm in the afternoon.                  During the time I spent upstairs

             I noticed a continual          flow of Liverpool         supporters walking to the

             ground.      Large numbers of people were still walking along the road up

             until about 2.50pm,         when there seemed to be a drop in the number of

             people passing our         road.

            During the two years           I have lived in this            road I have never seen so

                                                                             £5733

many people attending Hillsborough.         I was   in my house for the 1988 F .

A. Cup semi    final   between the two teams     but the number of people      in

and around our street on that occassion was significantly lower than

those who attended this y e a r .

Shortly after 3pm on Saturday       15th April    I heard on my radio that the

match had been abandoned.       I later   learnt that this was due to the

tragic deaths of people      in the ground on learning this      I walked down

to the junction of our      road and Leppings Lane and saw crowds of people

leaving the g rou nd.     I shouted that rny tele phone was available for

anyone wishing to phone home and about 6 people           came back to the house

with m e .   They made   phone calls home and I went back out into the

street and shouted the same thing and more          people followed me in.           I

kept on doi ng this and would estimate that about 70 people used my

telephone to phone home.       A number of these have since written to me

to thank me and have      left me their names and addresses:

they are as follows

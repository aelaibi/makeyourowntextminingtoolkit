FOOTBALL SPECTATORS BILL AND SAFETY AT SPORTS GROUNDS



Memorandum by the Secretary of State for the Environment



•
1.           X am writing to follow up the exchange of correspondence I

have      had with        the Home Secretary on the options                      available       to

achieve       any       amendments      to    legislation      on     safety     wh ich    may   be

necessary          in    the    light    of    the    report   of     the    Taylor       Inquiry.

    Copies    of    the       letters    are    at    annexe      A    to    this     paper      for

    colleagues' information.


    2.       I have       proposed,      and    Douglas     Hurd has         agreed,      that we

    should pursue option C in my letter of 25 Kay.                           This would give

    the licensing authority provided by the Football Spectators Bill

    power to monitor local authorities.' performance in issuing safety

    certificates         and    to enforce      any direction         the        Home Secretary

    might make about the contents of the certificates,                           following the

    Taylor Inquiry.


    3.        i    moved        the     necessary      instruction          to      the   Standing

    Committee, after            the Bill's second reading on                27 June, to enable

     it to make provision in the Bill relating to any aspect of the

     safety of spectators at designated football matches.                            In doing so

     I   explained       to     the House      that    we   had       it    in   mind that       the

     licensing authority should be given a monitoring and enforcement

     role to back up the Home Secretary's existing powers under the

     Safety of Sports Ground Act 1975.

                 and outside football*
7.       For example the Sports Council,                     in its submission to the
Taylor Inquiry,        proposes that a central licensing, authority for

major     spectator        stadia     should      be    established            and     expresses

concern     about    the     perceived       variety         in    standards         applied    by

different local authorities.                The Council concludes that central

licensing      would        go    some      way    to        providing         co-ordination,

consistency     of    approach        and   improved         monitoring.             The    Sunday

Times ran a feature on                             claiming that the enforcement

of legislation covering safety at sports grounds was inadequate.

The same article reports a Football League Club chairman denying

the need      for his club          to deal with         five          separate agencies on

safety     issues     -     the     local   authority,            the     police,      the     fire

service,      the     St    John     Ambulance         Brigade          and    the     licensing

justices.      He is quoted as saying "they overlap each other, they

contradict each other and they slow up everything..... We need

the Government to pull them into^one agency".



 8.       Thus far in the passage of the Bill we have argued that

 there    is no reason why            the local, authorities                  should not work

 together     with    the    licensing       authority            in   dealing       with    safety

 certificates        and    the     requirements        of    the       national      membership

 scheme.      But I think we must acknowledge that there could be a

 potential conflict in this area.                  The Hillsborough disaster, and

 the unsubstantiated assertions that the membership scheme "would

 h&ve made it worse", have increased the risk that a small number

 of   local   authorities might             seek to use their role as                       "safety

 authorities" to disrupt the membership scheme.
Available options



9.      It is against this background that the Home.Secretary and

I have considered how, in the context of the relationship between

the local authorities and the licensing authority, we might best

deal   with   any   amendments          to    legislation    on    safety       which      Lord

Justice Taylor may recommend.                  My letter of 25 May to the Home

Secretary identified three options:-



        A.      maintain the existing             role of local          authorities        as

        "safety authorities"             under the Safety of Sports Grounds

        Act and run alongside them a separate licensing authority

        under the Football Spectators Bill, with a procedure for

        resolving disputes between them;



        B.    taka away local authorities’ safety role in relation

        to    designated         football      grounds    and     five     it    to   a    new

        national safety authority,                for which we would provide in

        the     Football    Spectators          Bill   and   which       would      also    be

        responsible        for    the    licensing       functions       al.ready     in   the
        Bill;



        C.      give   the Bill's            licensing authority         the additional

        task of ensuring that local authorities’ were carrying out

        their responsibilities under the Safety of Sports Grounds

        Act in' such a way as to achieve a consistent standard of

        safety at designated football grounds.
    The preferred option



   10-       For the reasons given in our exchange of correspondence,

   the Home Secretary and I are agreed that option c represents the

   best     way    forward.        This      would     mean    that,   in    addition       to    its

^ ^ p o w e r s in respect of the national membership scheme set out in the

   Bill,     the    licensing       authority        would      be   given    two     additional

   powers in respect of safety which would enable it:                              (i) to ensure

   that    safety certificates are being applied so as to achieve a

   consistent       standard       of   safety       at    football     grounds      designated
   under the Bill, and (ii) to enforce, if necessary, any directions

   which the Home Secretary may make,                      if for example Lord Justice

   Taylor    should      recommend          that   a particular        matter      should    be    a

   mandatory       component of         a    safety certificate.             The    authority's

   powers would have to be drawn wide enough to enable us to ensure

   that local authorities could not use their safety certificates to

  disrupt the national membership scheme and that decisions taken
  by the licensing authority would take precedence.



  11.       A note on the licensing authority and the inspectorate it
  will need in order to carry out its functions is at annexe B.


  The status of the licensing authority



  12.       As     to   defining    the       nature      of   the   licensing      authority,
  there are three alternatives:-
           -    -axe    the    authority     part    of      the    Footj>aii        M > nbertMp

               house it in an NDPB.



           I would not wish to contemplate giving powers of the kind
  proposed to the Football Membership Authority which will draw up
  •nd run the national membership schM|e                                         ^    ^       ^

A ll seater stadia


15.         Following the Hillsborough disaster, we announced that we

shared the view of many in football that there should be a move

to    all    seater    stadia.         I have       discussed     this       issue     with     the

football authorities and made clear to them that it is not our

intention       that    there         should    blanket      change          to     ell    seated

accommodation.         The move to all seating would be appropriate fox

the    major     clubs,           which        ones wouldbe              a    matterforfurther

discussion,and         change     would         need      to be    phased            in at      the

designated       clubs.               The cost would befor               football.Itis clear

that there       is no consensus on the merit of                   all        seater      stadia
within      football    and there could be opposition                        to the proposal

from individual clubs.



16.         The Home Secretary and 1 agree that the move to all seated

accommodation at major clubs would be best tackled on a national

basis but using existing safety legislation to effect the change,

subject to ensuring that the Home Secretary's direction powers

are wide enough to encompass the requirement.                                It would be for

the     licensing      authority        set    up   under   the    Football          Spectators

Bill,       in consultation with the clubs, to identify which grounds

 should be made subject to the change, to what extent and to what

timetable.        We would reed to amend the Bill to provide for the

 Home Secretary to issue the appropriate direction in respect of

 designated grounds.            This power would be exercisable by statutory

 instrument,      subject        to    the     negative     resolution            procedure     and

 Parliament      would    therefore be able to debate                    and vote          on   the

 issue.        There would be presentational value in this approach,
    given that the requirement to move to all seated accommodation

    could    have   considerable    financial         implications        for     football

    clubs.



    The cost implications of the licensing authority

•                                                •
    17.      The Football Spectators Bill provides for some or all of

    the costs of the licensing authority in respect of its functions

    under the national membership scheme to be recovered through fees

    charged to football clubs for the issue of licences.                        1 do not
    propose    that we   should    seek   to provide        for     the   costs    of   the

    licensing    authority   in respect     of       its   safety    functions      to be

    recovered in this way.        Receipts from fees by the authority would

    be treated as revenue surrenderable to the Consolidated Fund and

    the authority's expenses would be met by grant in aid for which

    we would need to seek PES cover.



    18.       The proposal to extend the licensing authority's functions

    requires a revision of the estimated cost to public funds given

    in my letter of 28 September seeking the Committee's approval to

    Part I of the Bill.      The annual salary and ancillary costs of the

    authority would be some £100,000,            the inspectorate £360,000 and

    the administrative support team £                       .     Accommodation would

    cost some £              a year, travelling and subsistence £40,000,

    and a possible consultancy budget,               to cover the need to buy in

    any additional expertise not available to the inspection teams

    £30,000 a year.       This gives an annual cost to public funds of

    some £
E C implications



19.   The    functions   of   the   licensing    authority   have   no   E   C
implications.



Form of the amendment to the Football Spectators Bill



20.   To deflect any possible criticism that we were pre-empting

the Taylor inquiry,      I propose that we should       take an enabling
power in the Bill to give the licensing authority the proposed

extended powers in respect of safety.           As the Home Secretary has

commented,   we could present this as getting ourselves into the

position of being able to implement Taylor if he made                such a

recommendation and we thought the case for it was right.
THE LICENSING AUTHORITY AND ITS INSPECTORATE



1.       In    order     to    carry    out     its      functions     tho    licensing

authority would need to have an inspectorate.                     The Home Secretary

has    pointed   out    that    there would      be      strong misgivings      by    the

Association of Chief Police Officers and the Chief and Assistant

Chief Fire Officers' Association at the idea that the professional

competence of the police and fire services in making their input

into    the   content     of   individual      safety       certificates     should    be

supervised by the licensing authority.                     To secure the confidence
of    interested parties both           the authority and its            inspectorate

will therefore need to Include suitable people from the police

and    fire   services.         We   also   think        that   the   engineering     and

building      professions       would    have       to     be   represented    on     the

authority and the inspectorate teams since both make an essential

contribution to the content of safety certificates.



2.       I    therefore       propose   that    a     small     licensing     authority

should be set up on which the interests I have identified should

be represented under a lay chairman. Appointments would be at the

level    of    retired    Chief      Constable       and    his   equivalent.         The

inspectorate would comprise of teams of inspectors, and I think

we would require three teams or their part time equivalent,                            on

which the same interests would be represented.                        Appointments to

the inspectorate would be at Chief Superintendent level.



3.       The team of inspectors could be expected to spend some 4

days on a ground inspection, including preliminary work on plans

and the safety certificates, reappraisal and report in the light
     ^he   on   site   inspection     and   travelling.    We   envisage    fchftt

grounds should be inspected annually but that the authority would

have discretion about the nature and extent of each inspection.

It may decide that a full inspection is only required at less

frequent intervals say every two or three years and in the light

of   physical    changes   to   the    ground.     The    authority   and   its

inspectorate would       require    a small,     say 5 man,     administrative
support team.

    FOOTBALL SPECTATORS BILL: COMMONS COMMITTEE


    Mr Hogg will attend a briefing with Mr Moynihan and DOE officials
    at 2 Marshant Street at 4 pm on Monday 3 July, before the first
%   Committee session the next morning.       I will attend and can
    discuss any last minute points   with Mr Hogg in the car journey to
    DOE.


    2.     The main issues in Committee will be for DOE, for the
    present.    This note sets out a few topics Mr Hogg may wish to
    consider over the weekend.


    Amendments so far


    3.     All amendments on the list circulated this morning (ie given
    up to and including Thursday 29 June) refer to Clause 1 and are
    for DOE.     The issues raised relate mainly to limiting the type of
    match that can be designated, eg by reference to the percentage
    of seats, number of spectators, or number of arrests.       Other   ’
    amendments include excluding Wales from the Scheme, directing how
    phasing will be carried out, and limiting the criteria for
     refusal of a licence to admit spectators.


     4.    DOE are writing notes on all the amendments and will be/are
     sending them to Parliamentary Section here for Home Office
     distribution.


     Arrests


     5.    In the 1987/88 Season there were 6,106 arrests at and 6,542
     ejections from Football League matches in England and Wales.
ACPO have not yet completed the collation and checking of returns
from each force for the 1988/89 Season which ended around the
middle of last month, but the statistics should be available
within the next week or two.


Safety


6.   The important amendments under consideration to allow safety
to be covered in the Bill arise in the context of licencing
(Clauses 8 to 11).   David Mould, G1 Division, will provide
support for Committee work on that as necessary but it is not
intended he will attend the briefing on Monday.

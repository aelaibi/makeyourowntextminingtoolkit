Subject:                Hillsborough - further request for inquest - refused by AG - whether judicially reviewable




Hello Adam,

I believe that you may be in a position to assist the Attorney with an issue that has arisen.

The AG has refused his fiat for a further inquest into the death of a Kevin Williams in the
Hillsborough disaster in 1989. Solicitors have written stating that they wish to judicially review the
AG's decision.

can you assist with what power there is to JR a decision made by the AG?

happy to discuss if you require further information,

kind regards

                  We     left L iv erpool           air about         11.00 am         (1100 hrs)         but,     because    of

                  Fr om     the      point we        left      the    car    to the ground,             we    d i d n ’t see any      police

               crushing.          At   this       point    I d i d n ’t see any m a t c h        stewards               i rst

               As    soon as      I got       to the      end of the tunnel,             I noticed          it was a crush.

               I got       pushed agai ns t         a barrier and my             chest was against             the   barrier.

               My    friend manaQ/fed to drag me away                      f rorry^Uhe barriers.




               I think a factor    in
                            :t o r i n T p eZo p l e ’s injuries was                  the      fact    that    people    should

               have       been a l lo w e d      to get    out of the exit          gate       in the       pen.

               The    impre ss io n      I got      of    the    police was       to get       people       into   the ground

               as    quick as       possible        because        once    people are         in the       ground they     can be

               h a n d l e d with o ut      problem.

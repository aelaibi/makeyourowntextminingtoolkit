          COSTING FOR HILLSBOROUGH DISASTER - 1990/91
SUBJECT                                                            DATE        22.11.89



          The following are my ideas on staffing levels/costings in connection with the
          Hillsborough Disaster Inquiry for the financial year 1990/91 assuming the worst
          scenario.  The notes assume the same indexing policy as is presently in force
          and that there is some slipage because of this into the new financial year.   It
          also assumes that the papers have been forwarded to the Director of Public
          Prosecutions (to a large extent) and that we are waiting directions with regard
          to who is to be interviewed.

                             1 Car

                             4 Car allowances

          Assuming indexing is up to date at the end of February 1990 it will then
          take a further six months i.e. August 1990 to write up and copy 95 files for
          the Coroner.

          Reduce to one Detective Sergeant after August 1990.

                    Required April 1990 - March 1991


ACCOMMODATION

Nechells

All facilities at this police station, including two portacabins in outside
car park will be required April 1990 - March 1991.

Furnival House

Complete second floor - April 1990 - March 1991.


Transalnino House

It is anticipated that facilities will cease to be available before March
1990 and that consequently the typists presently deployed there will return
to Nechells Green.


FURNITURE

Furniture in position at Nechells and Furnival House as at 31 March 1990 will
be required April 1990 - March 1991.


TELEPHONES

The present telephone facilities will be required April 1990 - March 1991.
(One external ex directory line in portacabin and communications line at
Transalpino building may be negotiable for cessation after June 1990.

EQUIPMENT

Printers         - 2 laser printers - April 1990 - March 1991.
Fax Machines     - 2                - April 1990 - March 1991.

Video/Tape Recording Equipment

Equipment previously detailed by Detective Superintendent Beechey, including
video and tape recording machines - April 1990 - March 1991.

(In view of the length of time this equipment will now be required, it may be
deemed more appropriate to purchase at a cost of some £7,000, rather than to
lease/lend from the West Midlands Police.  This is an item for further
consideration.)


HOTEL ACCOMMODATION

                  Inspector              )    April 1990 - March 1991
                  Police Sergeant        )
                  Liaison Officers       )


                  4 Senior Officers - Maximum 6weeks -     Interviews, Sheffield

                  3 Senior Officers -   3 months          - Inquest, Sheffield

                  7 Additional Officers - 3 months    - Inquest, Sheffield
                  (This includes officers from body team, video unit and
                  those servicing Inquest.)

                  2 Senior Officers -  6 weeks            - Sheffield, for
                  old style committal.

In addition to the above there will also     need to be a contingency fund to be
established for incidental accommodation     incurred by officers completing
criminal/discipline or routine enquiries     during the period in question.  This
should be a matter for discussion at the     meeting to be held on 23 November
1989.


TRANSPORT

During the period in question there will be a need for additional vehicles
for short periods to service committal proceedings, Inquests, etc. This and
rail transport will need to be considered and a further contingency fund set
up to cover any expenditure. Again this is a matter to be discussed at the
above meeting.


CAR PARK PASSES

Six car park passes to enable us to cover all eventualities.

CATERING

Catering for those staff remaining full-time at Nechells needs to be
considered if the present policy of providing meals is continued.
                                   - 6 -




SUBSISTENCE

Not possible at this stage to accurately assess this. A contingency fund to
cover this will be needed.  This is another matter to be discussed at the
meeting to be held on 23 November 1989


These staffing levels and details of expenditure should not be regarded as
100Z accurate, they merely reflect what it is felt will be required during
the period in question. As will be appreciated they could be reduced or
increased as a result of changes in operational requirements/policy.

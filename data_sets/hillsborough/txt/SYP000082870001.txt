of the ground.                     The    other     officers were enga g e d on foot                     patrol       in

a l l o c a t e d areas            around     the ground.            The simple         brief was         to     respond              to

people acting                s u s p i c i o u s l y near    vehicles who           had been spotted                 by the

mo t o r c y c l i s t s .      The mo b i l e      officers        provided        the f a c ility            of   picking

the     ' f o o t m e n 5 up and t r a n s p o r t i n g          them to the areas               in question.              Due

to the       vast area to be                 covered        I worked w i t h DC TUKiE and J O N E S .

P a t r o l s were m a i n t a i n e d        during        the morning and              liaison was m a i n t a i n e d

with D e t e c t i v e S u p e r i n t e n d e n t M c K A Y wit h a view                 to    identifying

potential           'hotspots’.              The areas        of    concern w h i c h f e a t u r e d on previous

mat ch days were                v i si ted and       i t i s f ai r to state              the     situat i on fae came

very muc h a           ’potluck'           exercise         due    to the       volume      of traffic and

s u p p o r t e r s a ro u n d t h e g r o u n d .

At    1.30     pm    <1330)         I had a hot meal               at   the     gro u n d before          resuming

patrol       with DC TUKE" and J O N E S at 2 pm                         (1400).

At    this     time we          concentrated            on the Wisewood,               M i d d l e w o o d Rd,      Herries

Rd,    Hali f a x Rd and Foxhill                    areas.         P r o gress    thro u g h      the traffic was

slow and one             of my       lasting        impressions           was    the    number        o f -5u p p o r t e r s

d r i nking      outside           public     houses a r o u n d the            ground      in the hour             before

k i c k o ff time.

A fter     3 pm      (1500)         there was a radio m e s s a g e               received          requesting

a t t e n d a n c e at       the    ground.       I was      unable       to    either      clearly           int erpret         the

mess a g e     or transmit               using    the     radios        in our    possession.                 I decided          to

contact        the     ground by t e lephone and made my w a y to Foxhill                                       Po l i c e Box,,

to enga g e d        lines and            I believe         I o b t ained the          in f o r m a t i o n    that all

O f f i c e r s were         required        in the       ground from E c c l e s f i e l d           control.

We    i m m e d i a t l e y set      off    for     the     ground      but     became      quickly           bloc k e d    in

O f f i c e r s w i t h me to a b a n d o n         the    car on Hali f a x Rd              in a safe          location

and we made            our way to the ground                    on foot.

U pon arrival           we    entered      the      ground at          the    rear       of the N o r t h Stand,

first      impre s s i o n was       the    number         of    people       betw e e n the          slipway      to the

pitch at        the side        of the North S tand and the g y m n a s i u m area.

Ambulances            were    present and           injured s u p p o r t e r s were             being      treated,,

The    source         of this a c ti v i t y was           the     pitch.          I a sked a u n i f o r m Office

(male)      what       the s i t u a t i o n was and            I received          some m u m b 1ed         r e p 1y whic

I could not            understand.          The      officer          star t e d    to    cry and my next

s upp o r t e r s .

One    of my      first       thoughts      was      the    fact       that    the m a j o r i t y of Police

O f f icers w o u l d        probably      not      recognise          the O f f i c e r s    w ith me and mysel

due    to our mode            of dress and           the    fact       that O f f i c e r s      from all         over    th

F o r c e w er e o n du t y at         th e ground.

DC JONES,         TUKE and myself             were        quickly drawn to a s s i s t i n g                su pp o r t e r s

and Police O f f i c e r s who where                  carrying          casualties           from the         pitch.       T

majority        in hin d s i g h t were          dead.

Rather      than be drawn            further         onto       the    pitch       I deci d e d       to visit      the

g y m n a s i u m wit h a view to           locating and gat h e r i n g all                     the      offic e r s    und

my    command.          I e n t e r e d the g y m n a s i u m w i t h DC J O N E S and T U R K E and saw

the    e n o r m i t y of the      situation.              I believe          ther.e were            at   least £0

bodies      on the floor at             that        time.        N u m e r o u s O f f i c e r s were       inside       the

room and had o b v io u s l y            been       tasked wit h specific                  responsibilities,

saw D e t e c t i v e S u p e r i n t e n d e n t    M c K A Y and was         given       inst r u c t i o n s    to

obt a i n the      details       of m o r t u a r y space             throughout          the Force         area.

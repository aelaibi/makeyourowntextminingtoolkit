Q 48

 DID YOU ASSIST ANYONE WHO WAS DEAD OR INJURED IF SO BRJcfLY EXPLAIN.

YES, I SAW A YOUNG LAD AGED ABOUT 12 YRS LYING ON/TlHE PITCH NEAR TO THE GOAL

          ^ PEOPLE WERE JUST WALKING OVER AND ON HIM< I WENT UP TO HIM AND

CHECKED HIS PULSE BUT HE WAS DEAD.       I THEN MOVED HIM AWAY FROM THE AREA

AROUND THE GOAL TO THE CENTRE OF THE PFfCH, THATS THE LAST I SEEN HIM.

WHEN MY ATTENTION WAS ORIGINALLY DRAWN TO THE 12 YEAR OLD LAD ON THE PITCH.

HIS ORIGINAL POSITION WAS ABOUT 10 ’ FEET AWAY FROM THE LEFT HAND GOAL POST

AS YOU FACE THE LEPPINGS LANE TERRACES. THIS POSITION WOULD BE IN FRONT OF PEN

3 HE WAS LYING ON THE TOUCHLINE.

 IT WAS ABOUT 3.10PM (1510) WHEN I WENT UP TO THIS LAD, AS I SAY I TRIED BOTH

HIS WRIST AND NECK FOR A PULSE BUT HE WAS DEAD.         HE WAS VERY COLD.

 TETHER        WITH THREE OTHER SUPPORTERS WHOM I DO NOT KNOW I MOVED HIM AWAY FROM

 THE CROWDS AROUND THE GOAL AREA ON A PIECE OF HOARDING TO JUST OUTSIDE THE

 CENTRE CIRCLE OF THE PITCH LEPPINGS LANE SIDE.        WE LEFT HIM ON THE PIECE OF

HOARDING WHICH WAS BLUE AND WHITE IN COLOUR (BLUE BACKGROUND, WHITE LETTERS

 18 INCH HIGH, ONE OF THE LETTERS I REMEMBER WAS 'A').

 THE LAD I DESCRIBE AS FOLLOWS, WHITE HALE, A§gl5^1g— 13YRS, FAIR SHORT CROPPED

 HAIR, BLUE EYES. VERY SLIM BUILD, P 0 S S I B L ^ 4 F T 6 INS TO 4FT SINS, HE WAS

 WEARING BLUE FADED JEANS, A YELLOW LIVpRPOOL TOP WITH RED BANK AROUND THE

 COLLAR AND RED LIVERPOOL CREST ONTHEE/CHEST. HE HAD A RED LIVERPOOL SCARF T IED

 TO HIS RIGHT WRIST, HE WAS WEAi| INy WHITE BASKETBALL BOOTS, THE ONES THAT COVER

 YOUR ANKLE. AFTER THIS I WENT BACK TO HELP BUT COULDN'T BECAUSE THERE WERE TOO

VITAL TO THIS JUDICIAL INQUIRY?

ON ARRIVAL AT COACH CAR PARK,     I WAS SURPRISED TO SEE AT LEAST THIRTY

FANS FROM LIVERPOOL ASKING PEOPLE IF TNjEY H^D TICKETS FOR SALE .       I WOULD

ESTIMATE THAT ABOUT 200 PEOPLE WERE LADE n \ i1JH CANS OF INTOXICANTS AND

   IE   DRINKING ON THE SPOT.   THESE PEOPLE RANGED IN AGE FROM TEENAGE TO SIXTIES

THE STREET WAS HEAVILY LITTERED WITH EMPTY BEER/LAGER CANS.

AS WE WALKED FROM THE CAR PARK TO THE GROUND THERE WAS A STRONG POLICE

PRESENCE AND NO PROBLEMS.

HOWEVER AT LEPPINGS LANE WE WERE ALMOST SWEPT ALONG BY LIVERPOOL FANS GOING

INTO WEST STAND. AS WE HEADED TO THE NORTH STAND TURNSTILES WE BECAME CRUSHED

AND I NEARLY PANICKED. ThfEkCRUSH EASED SUDDENLY CLOSE TO THE NORTH STAND

TURNSTILES AND WE ENTERED WITTte^JT PROBLEM.

PRIOR TO ENTERING, JUST OUTSIDE THfes^GROUND, I HAD SEEN A GROUP OF ABOUT 6

^ 8     YOUTHS, ALL VERY DRUNK, NOT GOING\£NTO tHE GROUND.     ONE SAID, "WHICH

ONE ARE WE-------- <WORD FOR RUSHING)."    ANOTHER ONE SAID,   "WE D O N ’T WANT

TO BE IN THERE - OVER HERE."      THEY ALL THEN MOVED TO THE LEPPINGS LANE

TURNSTILE INTO THE WEST STAND.

INSIDE THE GROUND I WAS ASTOUNDED AT THE AGGRESSIVE MANNER OF THE LIVERPOOL

SUPPORTERS AROUND ME. THE GREAT MAJORITY OF THEM WERE SHOUTING "SCAB" AT

THE NOTTINGHAM FANS.     I SAW RESPECTABLE LOOKING ADULTS WHO HAD SALIVA

RUNNING DOWN THEIR CHINS, SUCH WAS THEIR HATE.

WHEN THE MATCH STARTED AND FANS CAME OVER THE FENCE I THOUGHT THEY WERE DRUNK.

I SAW TWO SCUFFLES BETWEEN POLICE AND LIVERPOOL SUPPORTERS ON THE PITCH AFTER
                                                                          PAGE   9
                                                                          QS0185

 THE GAME HAD   BEEN STOPPED.   ONE LIVERPOOL SUPPORTER RAN THE LENGTH OF THE

 PITCH AND BEGAN TAUNTING THE NOTTS FOREST FANS.    HIS BEHAVIOUR WAS OUTRAGEOUS

 INJURIES TO ANY PERSON?

 (1) THE INACTION OF THE POLICE TO RECOGNISE THE SITUATION UNFOLDING BEFORE

 THEM DUE TO THEIR CONDITIONING.

 SERIOUSNESS OF THE INCIDENT.     IN FACT,   I SAW ONE POLICEWOMAN DIVE FROM THE

 TOP   OF THE FENCE INTO THE TERRACES.

; G DEAR ESQ, CHIEF CONSTABLE, WEST MIDLANDS POLICE HEADQUARTERS, LLOYD HOUSE,

      PO BOX 52, COLMORE CIRCUS, QUEENWAY, BIRMINGHAM.

      25TH APRIL 19S9 (250489).

      DEAR MR DEAR

      tH    hillsborough   disaster

      I HAD THE UNFORTUNATE EXPERIENCE OF WITNESSING THE DISTRESSING SPECTACLE FROM

; A POSITION IN THE FIFTH ROW OF THE STAND IMMEDIATELY ABOVE THE TERRACING.

      A COLLEAGUE, WHO IS A FORMER MEMBER OF YOUR FORCE, SUGGESTED THAT IT MIGHT BE

      HELPFUL TO YOUR ENQUIRY INTO THE POLICING ASPECTS OF THE TRAGEDY TO SET OUT

      THE EVENTS AS I SAW THEM.         PERHAPS I MIGHT EXPLAIN THAT I HAVE BEEN ATTENDING

: FOOTBALL MATCHES SINCE 1946 (000046), MOSTLY STANDING ON SIMILAR TERRACES, AND

; THEREFORE HAVE CONSIDERABLE EXPERIENCE OF SUCH CROWDS BOTH PRE AND POST WHAT I

j MIGHT CALL THE HOOLIGAN ERA.             I HAVE ATTENDED MATCHES ON ALL THE MAJOR GROUNDS

| IN THIS COUNTRY AND ON MANY OCCASIONS IN FAR GREATER NUMBERS THAN WERE PRESENT
                                                                              PAGE 10
                                                                              GS0192

    AT HILLSBOROUGH.

    MY SON AND I ENTERED THE GROUND BY GATE C AT THE LEPPING LANE TURNSTILES AT

    AROUND 2.20 PM (1420).    AT THAT TIME THERE WAS A CONSIDERABLE POLICE PRESENCE

    BUT CONDITIONS WERE CALM AND WE STROLLED INTO THE GROUND HAVING BEEN CHECKED

    BY OFFICERS AT THE TURNSTILES FOR CANS OF ALCOHOL.     IT WAS HOWEVER BLATANTLY

    OBVIOUS THAT WITHIN 50-60 YARDS OF THE ENTRANCE GATES TO THE TURNSTILE BLOCK

    THERE WERE LARGE NUMBERS OF SUPPORTERS CONGREGATED AND A HIGH PROPORTION WERE

    CONSUMING CANS OF ALCOHOL.     IT WAS ALSO VERY CLEAR THAT PUBLIC HOUSES AROUND

    THE GROUND WERE OVERRUN WITH CUSTOMERS.

    IT IS APPARENT TO ME THAT BECAUSE OF THE GEOGRAPHY OF THE AREA (THE RIVER

    B^ND   THE STAND, THE ROAD LAYOUT AND HOUSES ETC) THE ACTUAL ENTRANCE TO THE

    TURNSTILE AREA WAS RELATIVELY SMALL.     THERE WERE I THINK FOUR MOUNTED POLICE

    AND AT THE TIME I ENTERED THEY WERE RELATIVELY UNUSED.     THERE IS ALWAYS A LAST

    MINUTE RUSH TO ENTER FOOTBALL GROUNDS BEFORE KICK-OFF AND IT SEEMED TO ME THAT

    BASIC POLICE PREPARATIONS WERE INADEQUATE.     I HAVE SEEN ON MANY OCCASIONS,

    PARTICULARLY AT VILLA PARK, OFFICERS ON HORSEBACK RESTRICTING ENTRANCE TO THE

    TURNSTILE AREA TO AVOID THE PROBLEMS THAT AROSE AT HILLSBOROUGH.     I HAVE ALSO

    SEEN POLICE INTERCEPTING AND CONTROLLING SPECTATORS CHECKING TICKETS ETC 50-60

    YARDS AWAY.    THESE SEEM EMINENTLY SENSIBLE BUT THERE WAS NO SIGN OF ANY SUCH

    PRECAUTIONS.

    B^NG   IN THE STAND AT THE TIME OF THE MAJOR CRUSH I WAS NOT AWARE OF WHAT WAS

    HAPPENING AT THE REAR OF THE TERRACING.     IT WAS HOWEVER VERY CLEAR TO PEOPLE

    IN OUR POSITION THAT THE MIDDLE OF THE TERRACING WAS EXTREMELY FULL BUT THERE

    WAS A LOT OF ROOM AT THE SIDES.     THE CRUSHING OF THE SPECTATORS AT THE FRONT

I WAS OBVIOUS TO US BY 2.45 PM (1445) YET AT THAT TIME THE POLICE ON THE TRACK

i AROUND THE PITCH DID SEEM DISINTERESTED.

j   MY OWN VIEW OF THIS IS THAT A LOT OF THE YOUNGER MEMBERS OF POLICE FORCES I

    HAVE ENCOUNTERED AT FOOTBALL MATCHES ALL OVER THE COUNTRY TEND TO CATEGORISE

    ALL FOOTBALL SUPPORTERS AS PROSPECTIVE HOOLIGANS TO BE CAGED IN AND TREATED

    LIKE SCUM.     MORE EXPERIENCED OFFICERS HAVE A FAR GREATER SENSE OF RAPPORT WITH
                                                                               PAGE    11
                                                                               G S0192

SPECTATORS AND LACK THE AGGRESSIVE INSTINCTS OF YOUNGER OFFICERS.

I REALISE THAT YOU MAY FEEL THIS IS A SWEEPING STATEMENT BUT I THINK A LOT OF

FOOTBALL SUPPORTERS OF MY GENERATION WILL RECOGNISE THE FEELINGS EXPRESSED.

THIS I THINK IS ONE OF THE FACTORS THAT LED TO THE SERIOUSNESS OF THE

SITUATION NOT BEING RECOGNISED AND WHEN THE TRUE POSITION WAS KNOWN IT WAS TOO

LATE.    AT THAT TIME IT SEEMED TO ME THAT THE OPENING OF THE GATE ONTO THE

PITCH MADE THE SITUATION EVEN WORSE AS ALL THE CROWD PANICKED AND TRIED TO

REACH IT. MOST OF THE DEATHS THAT I OBSERVED SEEMED TO 8E AROUND THE GATE AND

AT THE EXTREME LEFT HAND SIDE OF THE PEN CLOSE TO THE FENCE DIVIDING THE

TERRACING.       PERHAPS THERE WAS NO ALTERNATIVE TO OPENING THE GATE BUT I WOULD

G ^ p T I O N WHY THE SITUATION WAS NOT RECOGNISED AND WHY OFFICERS WERE NOT

STATIONED ON THE TERRACING ITSELF.       THIS SEEMS TO BE THE CASE AT MOST MATCHES

I ATTEND IN THE MIDLANDS WHERE PERHAPS MORE INITIATIVE IS ALSO ALLOWED TO

OFFICERS CLOSE TO ANY PROBLEMS,

IT IS INTERESTING TO OBSERVE FROM THE MATCH PROGRAMME A PICTURE ON PAGE 2 AND

3 OF THE SAME TERRACING LAST YEAR.       YOU WILL SEE EXACTLY THE SAME S

BUT ALSO NOTE ONLY 2 OFFICERS ON THE TRACK FACING<-J«C^CROWD.^O^J'

I MUST HOWEVER COMMENT UPON Th                      "HE ORDINARY POlICEMEN AMU

WOMEN ONCE THE POSITION BECAME CLE,         THEY WERE MAGNIFICENT IN THEIR EFFORTS

AND THEIR DESPAIR AT THEIR INI                       GET PEOPLE OUT WILL REMAIN TO

mA      TERRIBLE REMINDER OF THE TRAGEDY.

I HAVE TRIED TO RESTRICT MY COMMENTS TO THE EVENTS I ACTUALLY WITNESSED

ALTHOUGH I HAVE OF COURSE SEEN THE SCENES SHOWN ON TELEVISION AND IN

PARTICULAR THE EFFECTS OF THE PRESSURE CAUSED BY THE LATE ARRIVAL OF

SUPPORTERS.

I REALISE YOU HAVE AN ENORMOUS TASK IN COMPILING YOUR REPORT AND IF THERE ARE

ANY POINTS ON WHICH YOU REQUIRE CLARIFICATION PLEASE LET ME KNOW.

YOURS SINCERELY

  NO..


 Q17

  G49

  DID YOU WITNESS ANYTHING THAT YOU CONSIDER WAS A FACTOR

| IN THE DEATHS, OR THE INJURIES TO ANY PERSON?

  I FEEL THAT THE GATES IN THE FRONT FENCES SHOULD HAVE BEEN OPENED MUCH SOONER,

  HOWEVER,    IT MAY HAVE BEEN THAT THE POLICE THOUGHT THEY HAD A PITCH INVASION IN

  PROGRESS.

     JUDICIAL INQUIRY?

     HILLSBOROUGH WAS MY FIRST FOOTBALL MATCH.   I HAVE SINCE BEEN TO A MATCH AT

     ANFIELD AND SAW HOW ORDERLY AND ORGANISED THE FANS WERE OUTSIDE ANFIELD.             THE

I    POLICE HAD TOTAL CONTROL OUTSIDE THE GROUND. THERE SEEMED   TO     BE A LACK    OF

i    ORGANISATION AT THE HILLSBOROUGH MATCH.

     I CANNOT UNDERSTAND WHY LIVERPOOL WERE ALLOCATED THE SMALLER END     OF   THE GROUND

     WHEN THEY HAVE A MUCH LARGER FOLLOWING THAN FOREST.

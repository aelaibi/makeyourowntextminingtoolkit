Due to severe t r a f f i c hold-ups a t S tockport in p a r t i c u l a r we
arrived about three-quarter of an hour l a t e r than we had planned.
Probably many more people were la te for the same reason.
We made our way to Leppings Lane and Gate B, as s t a t e d on the
t ic k e ts .
Two lads asked i f we had any spare t i c k e t s as we approached
Leppings Lane end i t s e l f . When we tu rn ed the corner we were
confronted by a large crowd being held back by police on horses.
By now i t was 2.50 pm.
Some of the fans were eager to get in for the kick-off and there
were some challenges to the police but nothing serious - wanting to
know why we weren't being l e t through.       One policeman said 'You're
not going anywhere, so th e re 's no point in pushing forward' and
w h ile a few s t i l l t r i e d to get through most of th e crowd was
standing patiently back from the horses across the road.
About 2.55 pm a policeman said 'Right lads th ey 're opening the side
gate. You can go through t h e r e '.
We went through, but at th at point the surge from outside was not
so great.          I, for instance, was holding our 4 t i c k e t s , expecting to
give them in before going into the stadium. My elder son told me
to put them away in case they were snatched and, without being
j o s t l e d , I had time to stand and put them in my younger s o n 's
jacket pocket and secure i t .
We th e n e n te r e d a dark tunnel and i t was while we were going
through th e re t h a t p re ssu re from behind, then from a l l s i d e s ,
started to build up.
I was frightened but anticipated the crush would ease when we got
on the te rraces, but when we got into the fresh a i r , we came up
against another block of people and the crush was intense - swaying
in every direction.
I clung on to my husband, but we were separated from our sons.        I
f e l l , but was hauled up and we found ourselves with our bodies to a
b arrier which was behind us.
Meanwhile the game kicked o ff, and supporters s t i l l coming in, made
the crush even worse.       They could not see what was happening in
f r o n t - only that the match had started and they were caught up at
once in the furore of the game.
We ju st clung on to the b a rrier behind in desperation. Some people
began to climb over the 'cage' fence and i t 'looked' as i f they
were invading the pitch, but they were only escaping.

12           Then the game was stopped.         The police came to the 'cage' ra ilin g s
             as they would to suppress a rio tin g crowd - in a straig h t line
             y e l l i n g to everyone to get back but we could not as b a r r i e r s
             p a r a l l e l to the pitch prevented i t . Some supporters were dragged
             up to the seating area above, so as to leave more room below in our
             area.
13           Then the police opened the narrow gate through on to the pitch -
             only one gate - 3ft wide atmost.
14           Gradually the crush in front of us began to thin to reveal many
             dead and dying people - many on top of each other up to about 5ft
             back from the 'cage' ra ilin g s and some furtherback ju s t in front of
             us.
15           My elder son found his way back to us but had lo st            our younger
             son, and was panic stricken.
16           My husband was j u s t going forward to search f o r him among the
             people on the ground, when Daniel spotted him climbing the 'cage'
             fence and yelled to him to get over on to the p itch .
17           We saw him do so and knew he would be safe.
18           There were many people lying on the terraces in fro n t of us - many
             a purplish blue colour and obviously dead or dying.
19           Friends were trying to revive some people but there was very l i t t l e
             room to stretch people out.
20           We t r i e d to comfort two lads who had 'come round' without help but
             were injured and very shocked.
21           A fter what seemed a long while the police came through and began
             checking the people on the ground on the te rra c e s, but i t was too
             la te for many.
22           Ambulances started to arrive actually on the p itc h , by which time
             many of the victims were on the pitch receiving help.
    23       We l e f t as soon as we could fin d a way o u t, to r e l i e v e the
             congestion.

General comments

I feel t h is was an avoidable accident.

1       Allocation of tic k e ts inadequate
2       Liverpool fans housed in smallest section of stadium
3       Fans could not move across to less cramped terraces due to barriers
         a t r i g h t angles to p itc h preventing easy a c c e ss . Had we gone
        through the t u r n s t il e s however, we would not all have been
        channelled into th at central section but more would have gone to
        the less congested areas.
         No organised and audible communication with crowd outside wanting
        to get in to see the kick-off. They were ju st being yelled at to
         stay back by mounted police.
I asked a policeman i f kick-off had been delayed as i t seemed a sensible
id e a . He said not as yet.        One policeman said the large crowd outside was
the f a n s ' f a u lt fo r coming la te : unavoidable in some cases as explained :
but f a u lt was simply too many people who were in e ffic ie n tly controlled.
Some of the crowd were getting anxious to get in but i f they had been
properly informed of the overcrowding already on the te rra c e s , the majority
would have waited especially i f kick-off had been delayed, and gone through
th e t u r n s t i l e s and been channelled into t h e ir allocated areas. I query
whether communication was adequate with police inside and outside the
ground since there was already a bad crush inside before the gate was
opened as was evidenced when we were fin a lly allowed in.
As i t was the police crowd control went from f i r s t l y holding everyone back
to q u ite suddenly opening th a t large side gate to allow a ll and sundry in.
No t i c k e t s were checked.    Who can blame non-ticket holders for going in -
1f any did?         I t was a perfect opportunity. O fficials had no idea of the
actual numbers on the terraces - as a re s u lt.
Equally, i t seemed the police were slow to react to prevent even more
coming through from outside, when the real d isa ste r was under way.

In addition, conrnunication of events in the stadium were poor.             At one
pont opposing fans were jeering the Liverpool supporters on the pitch -
unaware of the problem - they thought i t was a pitch invasion - there
should be a national/international warning 's i r e n ' when a l i f e threatening
s i t u a t i o n has developed - ordinary public address 1s a waste of time - i t
c a n ' t be heard in a l l th e n o ise , but perhaps would be, i f used in
conjunction with siren.
Hopefully t h is would prevent other unnecessary incidents developing out of
f r u s tr a ti o n which demand even more police resources, which are required
elsewhere.
19th April 1989

In th e l i g h t of reports in the media following the d is a s te r we feel as a
family we must now add :
1    Wedid not witness any drunken people waiting outside the ground
2    We did not smell alcohol on the breaths of people in the crush
3     We did not witness any criminal acts or interference on any of the
     numerous bodies which lay on the terraces immediately in front of us or
     those "stacked" behind the perimeter fence
4    We did witness one distraught, angry and helpless supporter shouting
     abuse at a policeman, using very bad language.      My elder son said th is
     su p p o rter swung at the officer and knocked his helmet off but he f e l t
     i t was done out of sheer helplessness and fru stra tio n and with no other
     motive in mind.

                                    V.

                          ANTHONY DAVID BLAND

      (by the Official Solicitor as his Guardian ad Li-hmin

SIR THOMAS BINGHAM M.R.

     Mr.    Anthony    David   Bland,    then   aged   17%,   went   to   the

Hillsborough ground on 15 April 1989 to support the Liverpool

Football Club.    In the course of the disaster which occurred on

that day, his lungs were crushed and punctured and the supply of

oxygen to his brain was interrupted.            As a result, he suffered

catastrophic and irreversible damage to the higher centres of the

brain.     The condition from which he suffers, and has suffered

since April    1989,   is known as a persistent vegetative state

(abbreviated to PVS).



     PVS is a recognised medical condition quite distinct from

other conditions sometimes known as "irreversible coma",                  "the

Guillain-Barre syndrome",       "the locked-in syndrome" and         "brain

death".    Its distinguishing characteristics are that the brain

stem remains alive and functioning while the cortex of the brain

loses its function and activity.         Thus the PVS patient continues

to breathe unaided and his digestion continues to function.               But

although his eyes are open,        he cannot see.        He cannot hear.

Although capable of reflex movement, particularly in response to

painful stimuli, the patient is incapable of voluntary movement


                                    1
and can feel no pain.   He cannot taste or smell.   He cannot speak

or communicate in any way.   He has no cognitive function and can

thus feel no emotion, whether pleasure or distress.     The absence

of cerebral function is not a matter of surmise;         it can be

scientifically demonstrated.    The space which the brain should

occupy is full of watery fluid.



        The medical witnesses in this case include some of the

outstanding authorities in the country on this condition.       All

are agreed on the diagnosis.      All are agreed on the prognosis

also:    there is no hope of any improvement or recovery.       One

witness of great experience described Mr. Bland as the worst PVS

case he had ever seen.




                                  2
     At no   time before     the disaster did Mr.        Bland give     any

indication   of   his   wishes   should   he   find   himself   in   such   a

condition.   It is not a topic most adolescents address.              After

careful thought his family agreed that the feeding tubes should

be removed and felt that this was what Mr.              Bland would have

wanted.   His father said of his son in evidence:          "He certainly

wouldn't want to be left like that."           He could see no advantage

at all in continuation of the current treatment.                He was not

cross-examined.    It was accordingly with the concurrence of Mr.

Bland's family, as well as the consultant in charge of his case

and the support of two independent doctors, that the Airedale NHS

Trust as plaintiff in this action applied to the Family Division


                                    3
of the High Court for declarations that they might

      "(1) ... lawfully discontinue all life-sustaining
      treatment and medical support measures designed to
      keep AB [Mr. Bland] alive in his existing persistent
      vegetative   state  including  the   termination  of
      ventilation nutrition and hydration by artificial
      means; and

      (2) ... lawfully discontinue and thereafter             need not
      furnish medical treatment to AB except for              the sole
      purpose of enabling AB to end his life                  and die
      peacefully with the greatest dignity and the            least of
      pain suffering and distress."

After a hearing in which he was assisted by an amicus curiae

instructed by the Attorney-General, the President of the Family

Division made these declarations (subject to a minor change of

wording)    on    19 November    1992.     He declined to make        further

declarations which were also sought.           The Official Solicitor on

behalf of Mr. Bland appeals against that decision:              in doing so

he fulfils his traditional role as the voice of those who, for

reasons of incapacity, cannot speak for themselves, ensuring that

their interests do not go by default because of their involuntary

silence.

                         *
      The present appeal raises moral, legal and ethical questions

of a profound and fundamental nature, questions literally of life

and   death.       The    case   has   naturally   provoked    much    public

discussion and great anxiety.          Strong and sincerely held opinions

have been expressed both in favour of the decision under appeal

and against it.          The issues are such as inevitably to provoke

divisions of opinion.         But they are fairly and squarely before

the Court,       which has had the benefit of eloquent and erudite

argument.      It cannot shirk its duty to decide.       It is, however,

important to be clear from the outset what the case is, and is
not, about.    It is not about euthanasia, if by that is meant the

taking of positive action to cause death.                   It is not about

putting down the old and infirm, the mentally defective or the

physically imperfect.         It has nothing to do with the eugenic

practices associated with fascist Germany.             The issue is whether

artificial feeding and antibiotic drugs may lawfully be withheld

from an insensate patient with no hope of recovery when it is

known that if that is done the patient will shortly thereafter

die.



       There are certain important principles relevant to this

issue which both parties accept :

       (1)   A profound respect for the sanctity of human life

       is embedded in our law and our moral philosophy, as it

       is in that of most civilised societies in the East and

       the West.   That is why murder (next only to treason)

       has always been treated here as the most grave and

       heinous of crimes.

       (2)   It is a civil wrong,          and may be a crime,        to

       impose medical treatment on a conscious adult of sound

       mind without his or her consent:           In   re    F   (Mental

       Patient: Sterilisation^        [1990] 2 AC 1.

       (3)   A medical    practitioner must comply with clear

       instructions given by an adult of sound mind as to the

       treatment   to    be   given   or    not   given     in   certain

       circumstances, whether those instructions are rational

       or irrational     : Sidaway v. Governors of the Bethlem

       Royal Hospital and the Maudsley Hospital 1985 AC 871


                                      5
      at 904-5;               In re T (Adult; Refusal of Treatment)

      [1992] 3 WLR 782.             This principle applies even if, by

      the    time       the   specified        circumstances          obtain,     the

      patient is unconscious or no longer of sound mind.

      (4)    Where an adult patient is mentally incapable of

      giving his consent, no one (including the court) can

      give consent on his behalf.                 Treatment in such a case

      may    lawfully         be    provided      by    a    doctor     where     the

      treatment is in the best interests of the patient : E£

      F, above.

      (5)    Where the patient is a child and a ward of the

      court,     it     will       itself     decide    (paying        appropriate

      regard     to      professional          medical           opinion)     whether

      medical    treatment          is in the best               interests of the

      patient       :    In    re    B   (A   Minor)        (Wardship:        Medical

      Treatment) [1981]             1 WLR     1421;         In re B         (A Minor)

      (Wardship: Sterilisation)                [1988] AC 199; In re C (A

      Minor) (Wardship: Medical Treatment)                         [1990] Fam. 26;

      In re J (A Minor)(Wardship: Medical Treatment)                           [1991]

      Fam. 33.

It follows from these propositions that if, presciently,                                  Mr.

Bland had given instructions that he should not be artificially

fed   or    treated with           antibiotics     if       he    should     become   a   PVS

patient, his doctors would not act unlawfully in complying with

those instructions but would act unlawfully if they did not

comply, even though the patient's death would inevitably follow.

If Mr.     Bland were a child and a ward of the court,                            it would

decide what was in his best interests, having regard to the views


                                              6
of his parents but not treating them as conclusive : Re B [1981]

1 WLR 1421.        If the ratio of Re J above is sound,         an issue

expressly reserved by Mr. Munby (for the Official Solicitor) for

argument in the House of Lords, the court may judge it to be in

a child's best interest that life-saving measures be withheld if

of opinion       that the   life thereby prolonged would       be one of

intolerable pain and deprivation : Re B [1981] 1 WLR 1421; Re J r

above.       This case is novel because Mr. Bland is not a child and

a ward of the court, he is immune to suffering and, as already

stated, he gave no instructions concerning his treatment if he

were to become a PVS patient.



        There can be no doubt that the administration of antibiotics

is medical treatment : they cannot be lawfully obtained in this

country without prescription,        and the choice of antibiotic to

treat    a    given   condition   calls   for   professional   skill   and

knowledge.      The overwhelming consensus of medical opinion in this

country and the United States is that artificial               feeding by

nasogastric tube is alst> medical treatment.          This is a readily

understandable view.        The insertion of the tube is a procedure

calling for skill and knowledge, and the tube is invasive of the

patient's body to an extent which feeding by spoon or cup is not.

An intubated patient certainly looks as if he is undergoing

treatment, and the mechanical pumping of food through the tube

is a highly unnatural process.        It does not, however, seem to me

crucial whether this is regarded as medical treatment or not,

since whether or not this is medical treatment it forms part of

the patient's medical care and I cannot think the answer to this


                                     7
problem depends on fine definitional distinctions.



     It is relevant to consider the objects of medical care.         I

think traditionally they have been

     (1)     to prevent the occurrence of illness, injury

             or deformity (which for convenience I shall

             together call "illness") before they occur;

     (2)     to cure illness when it does occur;

     (3)    where illness cannot be cured, to prevent or

             retard   deterioration   of   the   patient's

             condition;

     (4)     to relieve pain and suffering in body and

            mind.

I doubt if it has ever been an object of medical care merely to

prolong the life of an insensate patient with no hope of recovery

where nothing can be done to promote any of these objects.        But

until relatively recently the question could scarcely have arisen

since the medical technology to prolong life in this way did not

exist.     That is also a new feature of this case.



     There are, however, a number of other jurisdictions in which

the question has arisen and been squarely confronted.



     In the United States the issue has been much litigated.

Despite variations of practice and strong expressions of dissent,

the courts have in the great majority of cases sanctioned the

discontinuance of artificial feeding of PVS patients.        They have

reached this result in deference to the express wishes of the


                                  8
patient where there were such and, where there were not, on the

basis either that the court could judge what the patient's wishes

would have been if expressed or that such discontinuance was in

all the circumstances       in the patient's best interests.               The

courts     have   consistently   rejected     the    suggestion   that    such

discontinuance amounts to suicide or criminal homicide.                  Since

US courts exercise a parens patriae jurisdiction even in relation

to adults, these cases must be viewed with reserve, but the trend

of authority is clear.



      In the South African case of Clarke v. Hurst (Supreme Court

of South Africa, Durban and Coast Local Division, 30 July 1992)

there was evidence of a PVS patient's wish that his life should

not be artificially prolonged,          but the court acted on wider

grounds    in sanctioning the discontinuance of nasogastric and

other non-natural feeding methods and the withholding of medical

treatment.



      In New Zealand the question arose in relation to a victim

of   the   Guillain-Barre   syndrome    who    had    expressed   no   wishes

concerning his treatment : In the Matter of JHL (High Court of

New Zealand, 13 August 1992).      Thomas J delivered a comprehensive

oral judgment in the course of which he said :

      "In my view,     doctors have a lawful excuse to
      discontinue ventilation when there is no medical
      justification for continuing that form of medical
      assistance. To require the administration of a life
      support system when such a system has no further
      medical function or purpose and serves only to defer
      the death of the patient is to confound the purpose of
      medicine. In such circumstances, the continuation of
      the artificial ventilation may be lawful, but that
      does not make it unlawful to discontinue it if the

                                    9
     discontinuance accords with good medical practice."

Having considered Re J r above, he said :

     "The point, for present purposes is, as I apprehend
     it, that a doctor acting in good faith and in
     accordance with good medical practice is not under a
     duty to render life support necessary to prolong life
     if that is, in his or her judgment, contrary to the
     best interests of the patient."

     Finally he concluded :

     "Medical science and technology has advanced for a
     fundamental purpose; the purpose of benefiting the
     life and health of those who turn to medicine to be
     healed. It surely was never intended that it be used
     to prolong biological life in patients bereft of the
     prospect of returning to an even limited exercise of
     human life. Nothing in the inherent purpose of these
     scientific advances can require doctors to treat the
     dying as if they were curable. Natural death has not
     lost its meaning or significance. It may be deferred,
     but it need not be postponed indefinitely. Nor,
     surely, was modern medical science ever developed to
     be used inhumanely. To do so is not consistent with
     its fundamental purpose. Take the case of a man
     riddled with cancer, in constant agony, and facing
     imminent death. Is he to be placed upon a respirator?
     On the contrary, it has been generally accepted that
     doctors may seek to alleviate a patient's terminal
     pain and suffering even though the treatment may at
     the same time possibly accelerate the patient's death.

     As I perceive it, what is involved is not just medical
     treatment, but medical treatment in accordance with
     the doctor's b e s t ‘judgment as to what is in the best
     interests of his or her patient.            They remain
     responsible for the kind and extent of the treatment
     administered and, ultimately, for its duration. In
     exercising their best judgment in this regard it is
     crucial for the patient and in the overall interests
     of society that they should not be inhibited by
     considerations pertinent to their own self-interest in
     avoiding criminal sanctions. Their judgment must be a
     genuinely independent judgment as to what will best
     serve the well-being of their dying patients.

     Conscientious doctors will undoubtedly continue to
     strive with dedication to preserve and promote the
     life and health of their patients. That is their
     primary mission. But with a patient such as Mr. L,
     where "life" is being prolonged for no therapeutic or
     medical purpose or, in other words, death is merely
     being deferred, the doctor is not under a duty to
     avert that death at all costs. If, in his judgment,

                                10
     the proper medical practice would be to discontinue
     the life support system, and that would be in the best
     interests of his patient, he may do so subject to
     adhering to a procedure which provides a safeguard
     against the possibility of individual error."

     In Nancy B v. Hotel-Dieu de Quebec [1992] 86 DLR (4th) 385

the Quebec Superior Court granted the plaintiff, a victim of the

Guillain-Barre       syndrome   whose    intellectual      faculties   were

unimpaired     but   whose   survival    was   dependent    on   artificial

respiration,    an order that further treatment be discontinued.

That was, however, in response to her express and informed wish.

A question closer to the present was addressed by the Law Reform

Commission of Canada in its Working Paper 28 on Euthanasia,

Aiding Suicide and Cessation of Treatment (1982), which at page

65 stated :

     "At this stage, it may be useful to summarise the
     tentative conclusions which the Commission has reached
     to date. These conclusions are as follows:

     (1)     the law should recognise the competent
             patient's wishes and respect them as regards
             the   cessation    or   non-initiation    of
             treatment;

     (2)     the  law   should clearly state that       a
             physician acts legally when he decides to
             terminate or not to initiate treatment which
             is useless or which no longer offers
             reasonable hope, unless the patient has
             expressed his wishes to the contrary;

     (3)     the law should recognise that the prolonging
             of life is not an absolute value in itself
             and that therefore a physician does not act
             illegally when he fails to take measures to
             achieve this end, if these measures are
             useless or contrary to the patient's wishes
             or interests;

     (4)     the law should recognise that a physician
             who continues to treat a patient against his
             wishes is subject to the provisions of the
             Criminal Code;

     (5)     the law should recognise that the incapacity

                                    11
              of a person to express his wishes is not a
              sufficient reason to oblige a physician to
              administer useless treatment for the purpose
              of prolonging his life;

        (6)   the law should recognise that in the case of
              an unconscious or incompetent patient, a
              physician incurs no criminal responsibility
              by terminating treatment which has become
              useless."

After    extensive   consultation,    the   Commission   recommended   in

Report 20 (on the same subject) at page 27 that

        "a physician should not incur any criminal liability
        if he decides to discontinue or not initiate treatment
        for an incompetent person, when that treatment is no
        longer therapeutically useful and is not in the
        person's best interest."

        In this country, a discussion paper published by the Ethics

Committee of the BMA in September 1992 recorded (at page 22) that

there had been no prosecutions in Scotland in cases where doctors

had withdrawn nutrition from PVS patients with the agreement of

the patients' families.      An earlier BMA report had expressed the

view that

        "feeding/gastrostomy tubes for nutrition and hydration
        are medical treatments and are warranted only when
        they make possible a decent life in which the patient
        can reasonably be thought to have a continued
        interest"

and that

        "... There is no justification for continuing medical
        intervention in such a state [PVS] and the working
        party feels that the individual concerned is most
        appropriately treated as an incompetent patient with
        a terminal condition."

In 1991 the Institute of Medical Ethics published a majority view

that

        "it can be morally justified to withdraw artificial
        nutrition and hydration from patients in persistent
        vegetative state.
        (Ibid. at page 16).


                                     12
     In seeking declarations from the court Mr. Francis (for the

plaintiff Trust) relied on the reasoning underlying this weight

of authority,     as did Mr. Lester who supported the plaintiff's

application.      The central steps in the argument were, I think,

these:

     (1)   The question whether artificial feeding and

           antibiotic treatment of Mr. Bland should be

           discontinued is one to be resolved by the

           doctors         in      charge        of     his    case,       in

           consultation             with        independent         medical

           experts,         conscientiously              exercising         a

           careful and informed judgment of what the

           best interests of their patient require.                        In

           forming that judgment it is appropriate for

           them to take full account of the family's

           wishes, as they have done.

     (2)   While the respect accorded to human                           life

           always raises               a presumption in favour of

           prolonging           i«t,    that     presumption        is    not

           irrebuttable.

     (3)   Mere    prolongation            of    the    life   of   a     PVS

           patient such as Mr. Bland, with no hope of

           any recovery, is not necessarily in his best

           interests, if indeed such prolongation is in

           his interest at all.

     (4)   In     making    an         objective       judgment     of    Mr.

           Bland's best interests, account can be taken

           not only of any pain and suffering which


                                            13
           prolonged feeding and medication might cause

           but   also     of     wider,           less     tangible

           considerations.

     (5)   The   assessment       of        Mr.    Bland's     best

           interests, although a matter for his doctors

           in the first instance, is ultimately subject

           to the sanction of the court where (as here)

           its jurisdiction      is invoked.         There is no

           ground for overriding their judgment.



     Step (1) of this argument is in my view consistent with the

English authority already referred to.              I do not think there is

any English authority inconsistent with it.



     If the reasoning of Re J . above, is sound, step (2) of the

argument is also sound.        I think that the reasoning in Re J is

sound.     It is also consistent with the reasoning in Re B [1981]

1 WLR 1421 and Re C r above.       In any event the ratio of Re J is

binding on this Court. »



     I would for my part accept step (3).                Looking at the matter

as objectively as I can, and doing my best to look at the matter

through Mr. Bland's eyes and not my own, I cannot conceive what

benefit his continued existence could be thought to give him.

It might be different were it possible to hope that, if he lived

long enough, means might be found to restore some part of his

faculties, but no grounds have been suggested for cherishing such

a hope and the physiological findings appear to preclude it.


                                       14
     It is of course true that pain and suffering, which may (if

the foregoing reasoning is sound) weigh in the balance against

the presumption in favour of life, are here to be ignored because

of Mr. Bland's insensible condition.             But I accept the argument

in step (4) that account may be taken of wider and less tangible

considerations.        An objective assessment of Mr.              Bland's best

interests,    viewed through his eyes,           would in my opinion give

weight to the constant invasions and humiliations to which his

inert body is subject;        to the desire he would naturally have to

be remembered as a cheerful, care-free, gregarious teenager and

not an object of pity;         to the prolonged ordeal imposed on all

members of his family, but particularly on his parents;                    even,

perhaps,     if   altruism    still    lives,    to   a   belief   that   finite

resources     are    better   devoted    to   enhancing     life   than   simply

averting death.



     I accept        step   (5).      In cases   where     assessment     of    the

patient's best interests is not undertaken by the court itself

(as in wardship), the doctors' assessment is nonetheless subject

to the court's review, where its jurisdiction is invoked.                      Such

review may be of real value in excluding the possibilities of

medical error, misapprehension of the correct approach, divisions

of opinion, conflicts of interest, improper motives and so on.

On the doctors' premises, the President found no reason to impugn

the doctors'        judgment and none was suggested.               Unless their

premises can be effectively challenged, there is in my view no

ground for withholding the court's sanction.




                                        15
     I have not so far directly addressed the submissions made

to the Court by Mr. Munby (for the Official Solicitor).           He did,

however,    challenge,   radically and robustly,        the premises upon

which the doctors' judgment was based.           To those submissions I

now turn.



     Mr. Munby's first submission was this:

     "To withdraw Anthony Bland's feeding tube is to do an

     act which will inevitably cause,          and is intended to

     cause,    his   death.    It   is,    therefore,    necessarily

     unlawful and criminal.         This is so whether or not

     artificial feeding is medical treatment."

The submission was a short one.           Reliance was placed on Devlin

J's famous direction in R v . Adams (1957) that

     "no doctor, nor any man, no more in the case of the

     dying than of the healthy, has the right deliberately

     to cut the thread of life."

Attention was also drawn to Ognall J's recent direction to the

jury in R v . Cox (1992)* that there is an

     "absolute prohibition on a doctor purposefully taking

     life as opposed to saving it."

Accordingly it is said that the doctors'            proposed course of

action (at least in relation to feeding) would amount at least

to manslaughter, at most to murder.



     I have some difficulty in regarding this as a practical

issue, since both R v. Adams and R v. Cox concerned drugs said

to have been deliberately administered to cause or hasten death


                                    16
and   I   cannot   on    the   present     facts    imagine   any   prosecutor

prosecuting, any judge leaving the issue to a jury or any jury

convicting.    But that does not meet the theoretical argument.



      The submission may perhaps be tested by three hypothetical

examples:

      (1) In compliance with the express instructions of a PVS

patient given before onset of the condition, when the patient was

adult and of sound mind, a doctor discontinues artificial feeding

after three years and the patient dies.             Has the doctor aided and

abetted suicide?        I think the answer plainly is that he has not.

Why not?     There are several possible answers.              One is that it

cannot be unlawful to act in accordance with the instructions of

an adult patient of sound mind.              Another is that the patient

lacked the intent necessary for suicide.             A third is that it was

not the discontinuance of artificial feeding but the patient's

condition and its underlying cause which caused his death.                   A

fourth is that the doctor lacked the intent necessary for aiding

and abetting suicide.          *It may be all four answers are correct.

But if it was not the discontinuance which caused the death or

if the doctor lacked the intent to kill he would have defences

to murder and perhaps manslaughter also even if the patient had

given no instructions.



      (2) A PVS patient's nasogastric tube becomes defective after

years of use and has to be removed.                The doctor has to decide

whether to continue artificial             feeding through a replacement

nasogastric tube or a newly implanted gastrostomy tube.                     He


                                      17
decides that in all the circumstances,                three years after the

onset of the condition and with no hope of improvement, it is not

in the patient's best interests to do so.               He does not do so and

the   patient    dies.      Is   the        doctor    guilty   of   murder      or

manslaughter?     In my view plainly not.             If that is so, and the

doctors here were to be guilty, it could only be because of a

distinction between initiating a new regime of artificial feeding

and discontinuing an existing regime.                Where the doctor's duty

to the patient (to care for him with ordinary professional skill

in the patient's best interests) is the same in the two cases,

I   cannot   think   that   criminal        liability    depends    on   such    a

distinction.    The doctor must be guilty in both cses or neither.

      (3)        A PVS patient shows signs of life-threatening failure

of, in succession, heart, lungs, liver, kidneys, spleen, bladder,

pancreas.     In each case the failure can be safely rectified by

serious surgery,     carried out without pain or distress to the

unconscious patient.        Is the doctor obliged to undertake these

life-saving procedures?       Although pointing out, correctly, that

his first submission related only to artificial feeding,                     Mr.

Munby answered that the doctor was so obliged.              Such a suggestion

is in my view so repugnant to one's sense of how one individual

should behave towards another that I would reject it as possibly

representing the law.         But if I am right to reject it,                the

doctors could only be guilty here if some distinction were to be

drawn between the surgical procedures described and artificial

feeding.     But I do not think that criminal liability can depend

on the relative invasiveness of different invasive procedures.




                                       18
       A    doctor      who    discontinues       artificial       feeding    of    a    PVS

patient, after a lapse of time which entitles him to be sure that

there is no hope of recovery, in pursuance of a conscientious and

proper judgment that such discontinuance is in the patient's best

interests,         is   in my view       guilty of no crime.               For     present

purposes I do not think it greatly matters whether one simply

says that that is not an unlawful act, or that the doctor lacks

criminal intent, or that he breaches no duty or that his act did

not    cause   death.          But   even    if    this     first    submission         were

(contrary to my view) sound, it would leave the doctors free to

discontinue antibiotics, with the result that Mr. Bland would die

sooner      rather      than    later,    perhaps     less     peacefully        than     on

withdrawal of artificial feeding.                    The factual merits of the

submission are not compelling.



       Mr. Munby's second submission was:

       "To withdraw Anthony Bland's feeding tube is a breach

       of    the    doctors'     duty     to care     for    and    feed     him    :

       discontinuance of ^mechanical hydration and nutrition

       involves the withdrawal of food, not the withdrawal of

       medical treatment. Since it will inevitably cause, and

       is intended to cause,              his death,      it is necessarily

       unlawful and criminal."



       I think it is evident from what I have already said that I

do not accept any ingredient of this submission for reasons I

have    given.           Its    falsity     is    in my   view      highlighted         by an

attempted      analogy with R v . Stone              [1977]      QB 354,      where      the


                                             19
defendant convicted of manslaughter had failed to supply food or

procure medical attention for an elderly and infirm but conscious

woman who was perfectly capable of feeding herself if food was

supplied.



       Mr. Munby's third submission was:

       "In   any    event,    and       even    assuming          that    artificial

       feeding      is   properly         to    be         regarded      as    medical

       treatment     (and    it       ought     not    to     be),    there        is   no

       justification        for       withdrawing          that   treatment.            To

       withdraw Anthony Bland's feeding tube is a breach of

       the doctors' duty to treat and nurse him.                              Since it

       will inevitably cause, and is intended to cause, his

       death, it is necessarily unlawful and criminal."



       Again, I think it is evident from what I have already said

that   I do not accept any ingredient of this                             submission for

reasons I have given.
                                  *

       I turn lastly to the issue of procedure, on the assumption

that the plaintiff Trust is entitled to the declarations made.

There was only limited dispute about this.                            At the end of his

judgment,     the    President          held        that    in    cases       of   this       kind

application should be made to the court to obtain its sanction

for the course proposed.               This was in my respectful view a wise

ruling, directed to the protection of patients, the protection

of   doctors,      the   reassurance           of     patients'       families          and    the

reassurance of the public.                The practice proposed seems to me


                                               20
desirable.   It may very well be that with the passage of time a

body of experience and practice will build up which will obviate

the need for application in every case, but for the time being

I am satisfied that the practice which the President described

should be followed.
    rT'                                                            f
    |I would dismiss   the appeal.   I have read in draft the

judgments of Butler-Sloss and Hoffmann L.JJ and agree also with /

their reasons for reaching this conclusion.




                               21
Lord Justice Butler-Sloss:

        This    is a tragic case and the necessary                  dispassionate

consideration of all the necessary components of the issues

before us should not blind us to the anguish of the family for

whom everyone feels the greatest sympathy.

        Each    court seized of these issues has an awesome task to

face.      In    doing    so   we   have   to   rid    ourselves    of   emotional

overtones and emotive language which do not assist in elucidating

the profound questions which require to be answered.

        The facts are not in dispute.           The present condition of Tony

Bland has been described by the Master of the Rolls.                     He is at

the extreme end of the spectrum of those suffering from the

condition of persistent vegetative state (pvs).                    He has been in

that state for three and a half years and there is, while he

lives,    no     release from it.           He is in a       'state of chronic

wakefulness      without
                      awareness' (AMA Council Report, January
                        *
1990), and has irreversible loss of cognition. A recent surgical

operation was carried out on him without anaesthetic, and his

future care and whether he does or does not receive nutrition and

hydration, or the manner in which he will die will be a matter

of indifference to him in his present state.

        His ability      to survive with artificial support is a product

of the medical advances in recent years.                   Medical science and

technology have provided for many a cure or alleviation of injury

or disease but have also created conditions which allow Anthony

Bland to exist in         a twilight world.           Twenty years ago he would

not have survived.
Self-Determination

     The starting point for consideration, in my              view, is the

right of a human being to make his own decisions and to decide

whether    to   accept    or   reject   treatment,   the   right    of   self-

determination.     Such a decision may        be rational or irrational,

(see Sidaway v Board of Governors of the Bethlem Royal Hospital

and the Maudsley Hospital [1985] AC 871 at 904-905). Counsel all

agree that the right to reject treatment extends to deciding not

to accept treatment in the future by           way of advance directive

or 'living will'.        A well-known example of advance directive is

provided by      those subscribing to the tenets of the Jehovah

Witnesses who make it clear that they will not accept blood

transfusions,(see for example Malette v Shulman (1990) 67 DLR

(4th) 321).     The provision of treatment by a doctor without the

consent of the patient other than in an emergency is likely                 to

be a trespass, (see Re F( Mental Patient: Sterilisation) [1990]

2 AC 1 per Lord Goff of Chieveley at page 71, Schloendorff v

Society of New York Hospital (1914) 211 NY 125 per Cardoza J at

page 129).                     *

     In this case Anthony Bland has not given a clear indication

of his views.     His family       are unable to consent on his behalf,

(see Re T (supra) per Lord Donaldson MR at p787).                  His father

expressed in evidence his view that his son would not have wished

to live in his present state.           As Lord Donaldson, Master of the

Rolls,    said (in Re T at page 787) the views of relatives may

reveal that the patient had made an anticipatory choice which

does not arise here. The           views of the family     must always be

treated with respect and will be an important consideration in


                                    page 2
the overall assessment.    In some cases the evidence of relatives

will require to be treated with great caution since there may

be hidden motives.    There is no    suggestion that such   concerns

arise in this family.

Lack of Consent

     Mr Bland is both by medical and legal standards incompetent

in that he lacks the capacity     to give valid consent to medical

treatment.    No-one can consent on his behalf.    The parens patriae

jurisdiction of the High Court no longer exists and in Re F

(supra) the House of Lords held that at common law there was no

jurisdiction in the court to approve or disapprove the giving of

medical treatment to such a patient.        The lawfulness of the

action depended upon whether        the treatment was    in the best

interests of the patient.      The House of Lords then devised a

procedure in cases of proposed sterilisation of those unable to

consent that a declaration might be made by the High Court as to

whether such an operation was        in the best   interests of the

patient.

     Two possible    approaches have been suggested to us,         the

United States preferred route of substituted judgment or the

objectively    ascertained best interests of the patient.

The majority of State superior courts,      (of the United States),

have, in the absence of expressed wishes, founded their decisions

on similar issues on the exercise of a substituted          judgment

based upon ascertaining the patient's known views,

    beliefs, philosophy     and lifestyle. In      the   absence    of

sufficient information many of the American courts have made

decisions     based upon the patient's 'best interests'.


                               page 3
        Although it appears     in origin derived   from the English

common law,       the American approach based on substituted judgment

appears to have little in common with the trend discernable in

recent English        decisions all of which consider the objective

best interests of the patient, (see for example Re F (supra), Re

T(supra)). I can see no reason to extend the test of substituted

judgement beyond the Court of Protection. In assessing the best

interests of Anthony Bland, however, his views, personality, how

others including his family saw him before his accident will form

part of that assessment, although that evidence has a subjective

element.

Medical Treatment

        Before considering the duty of care of the doctor towards

his patient,      it is necessary   to deal with the argument of Mr

Munby     that the method of providing nutrition to Anthony Bland

is not 'medical treatment'? All but one of the doctors who       gave

evidence to the President treated it as such, and even Dr Andrews

who   disagreed, accepted that, if asked to do so by a patient who

was capable of making *a decision,         he would remove the naso­

gastric tube.       The evidence of the doctors was supported by a

wealth of medical expertise that it is medical treatment,         the

Report of the British Medical Association, the American Medical

Association, The Medical Ethics Committees of England and of the

United States. It is also the conclusion of the Supreme Courts

of many      of    the States of the United States     and even more

persuasive,    of the Supreme Court of the United States in the

Nancy     Cruzan case. Interestingly, the Mental Health Act 1983

includes nursing in its definition of 'medical treatment'.


                                  page 4
         Although Mr Munby QC for the Official Solicitor argued that

it is not 'medical treatment' there was overwhelming evidence

upon which the President was entitled to conclude that it is.

        If we describe what is being done by the doctors and nurses

for Anthony     Bland and others in his condition as medical care

rather than treatment, it may to the layman make more sense and

avoid the uncomfortable attempt to draw a line between different

forms of feeding such as spoon-feeding a helpless patient or

inserting a tube through the nose or direct into the stomach.

        The definition of medical treatment does not, in my     view,

of itself resolve the problem.     The underlying   issue is whether,

under the extreme circumstances of this case, there is a duty

upon his     doctor   to continue to      provide   to Anthony Bland

nutrition and hydration by         an artificial method.    Mr Munby

argued that there are basic needs which are the right of a

patient, the need for air and the need for nutrition.        That is

in my    view too narrow an expression of basic needs, which cannot

be seen in isolation from general care including for instance

warmth and hygiene .        *

Duty of Care

        A doctor owes a duty of care towards his patient and in the

case of a patient unable to give instructions or consent to

treatment, a duty to treat him in the patient's best interests,

(Re F supra).         The general duty of a doctor     is to act in

accordance with a responsible and competent body of relevant

professional opinion       based upon the principles laid down in

Bolam v Frlern Hospital Management Committee [1957] 1 WLR 582,

(the Bolam test).       In carrying out his duty towards his patient


                                 page 5
a doctor is faced all the time with a series of decisions each

of which requires choices - a choice whether to operate, whether

to    initiate     other    invasive treatment          such as chemo-therapy,

whether     to    give     antibiotics.        As     his   care    of    the   patient

progresses        he may      have to decide whether to discontinue a

process     conscious       that   such   a    choice       marks   not    only     the

cessation of effective treatment but also brings closer the end

of    his   patient's      life.    Medical      ethics draw no distinction

between the withholding of treatment and the withdrawing of

treatment.       It is accepted by         Mr Munby          that in making those

decisions and choosing one course rather than another the doctor

is rightly        guided by the value of the treatment given and the

lack of value of other treatment proposed and from time to time

the futility of giving any                further treatment which will not

benefit     the    patient.    The assessment          of    the    futility of the

treatment is in his view justification for ceasing the treatment.

He argued nonetheless that, since feeding is not treatment, the

futility of continuing useless treatment does not arise, and in

any    event it is never ‘futile to feed.                   Nonetheless decisions

have to be made about future treatment which involve choices such

as whether to provide antibiotics.                  The President found that it

was the unanimous opinion of all the distinguished doctors who

have examined Mr Bland that there is no hope whatsoever of

recovery or improvement of any                kind.    The only      purpose of the

present care is to keep him artificially alive within his present

condition.        The medical team    caring for Mr Bland have formed the

medical opinion that it is in his best interests to discontinue

all forms of treatment including the provision of nutrition                         and


                                      page 6
hydration.

       The question then arises as to the extent or limit of the

duty   of      care    of   the    doctor     towards      a    pvs   patient.        The

formulation of the duty of care within the Bolam test may not by

itself    be    an     adequate     basis     for   this    grave     decision    which

requires more than the decision as to the uselessness of future

treatment.       The principle of the best interests of an incompetent

patient     in        the   present      circumstances           encompasses      wider

considerations,         including      some    degree      of    monitoring      of   the

medical decision.

       There     is     a   conflict     between      the       principle   of    self-

determination and whatever may be the equivalent right of those

who cannot choose and another basic principle of our society, the

preservation of life.             Lord Donaldson MR spoke in Re J.[1991] FD

33 of the       vast importance of the sanctity of the human life. I

respectfully          agree with       him.     Its importance cannot be over­

emphasised.       At page 46 he said:-

       "The decision on life and death must and does remain
       in other hands. What doctors and the court have to
       decide is whether,*in the best interests of the child
       patient, a particular decision as to medical treatment
       should be taken which as a side effect will render
       death more or less likely.    This is not a matter of
       semantics.   It is fundamental.   At the other end of
       the age spectrum, the use of drugs to      reduce pain
       will   often be fully justified, notwithstanding that
       this   will hasten the moment of death. What can never
       be justified is the use of drugs or surgical
       procedures with the primary purpose of doing so."


         Lord Donaldson then set out the balancing exercise to be

performed:-

       "This brings me face to face with the problem of
       formulating the critical equation. In truth it cannot
       be done with mathematical or any    other precision.
       There is without doubt a very strong presumption in

                                        page 7
        favour of a course of action    which   will prolong
        life, even   excepting the "cabbage" case to   which
        special considerations may well apply, it is not
        irrebutable."

          Mr Munby    argued in re J the fundamentalist or absolutist

approach,    that the pain and suffering experienced and to be

experienced by that child should not displace the sanctity of

life,    including the preservation of the life of that child,

whatever it was to be.             This Court rejected that approach and

placed on the other side of the critical equation the tragic

situation of the child concerned and the quality of her life.

Lord Donaldson       did not feel     bound to follow the views expressed

(obiter) in Re B(a Minor)(Wardship: Medical Treatment) [1981] 1

WLR 1421,    as to the degree of awfulness or intolerability of

treatment which might be proposed as providing a quasi-statutory

yardstick.     He left the door open.          Apart from preferring to use

a word other than "cabbage", I respectfully             agree with him.    In

Re B (supra) this Court was considering a simple operation to

clear an intestinal obstruction of a Downs' Syndrome baby.                The

circumstances of Re J or of this appeal were not considered by

the members of the court.           Dunn LJ pointed out at page 1424 that

there was no       reliable prognosis as to the life expectancy of the

child and no       evidence at all about the quality of life the child

might expect.

        Although    this   Court    in Re J was     exercising   the parens

patriae jurisdiction,         the approach is equally       apposite to an

incompetent adult, since the consideration of best interests has

to import a balancing exercise which Mr Munby             recognised.     His

answer was that severe pain and suffering as experienced by the

child in Re J is the only           factor which can be put on the other

                                      page 8
side of the equation to the sanctity of life.                    He reserved his

position to     argue elsewhere that Re J was wrongly                  decided and

there was nothing to place in the balance against the sanctity

of life.     In his argument to this Court the interests of the pvs

patient are limited to that sole consideration.

              To place pain and suffering in an unique category, the

existence of which may         justify      foregoing the preservation of

the sanctity of life, does not appear to me to be justifiable.

Two reasons come immediately            to mind.     First, on         a practical

level, according to Mr Munby            the exception of extreme pain can

be justified on the basis that it can be objectively                      verified.

The degree of resistance to pain varies enormously from person

to person and is intensely          subjective however its existence as

such may be objectively         verified.     It is not an absolute state

and it will always be a matter of degree as to whether the state

of pain of an incompetent patient is sufficiently                  severe to meet

the necessary      criterion.       If it is to be the only              criterion,

excluding    all   other   considerations,         the    lack    of     clarity    in

formulating when it contes into play, creates for me a logical

problem in accepting it alone on the other side of the equation.

     There is however a second and more fundamental objection.

The case for the universal sanctity of life assumes a life in the

abstract and allows nothing for the reality of Mr Bland's actual

existence.     There are clearly          dangers in departing from the

fundamental approach to the preservation of life,                      but in the

American decisions it is not conclusive.                      Two exceptions are

already     recognised in English common law, the right of self-

determination      and   the   Re   J   situation        of    extreme    pain     and


                                    page 9
suffering.     The quality of life has already been recognised as

a factor and placed in the equation to allow a life not to be

prolonged at all costs.     Taylor LJ said in Re J at page 55:-

     "Once the absolute test is rejected,          the    proper
     criteria must be a matter of degree."


To limit the quality of life to extreme pain is to take a

demeaning view of a human being.      There must be something more

for the humanity     of the person of a pvs patient.     He remains a

person and not an object of concern.     In the Matter of Conroy 486

A 2d 1209 NJ 1985) Handler J supports this approach at page

1248:-

     "Clearly, a decision to focus exclusively on pain as
     the single criterion ignores and devalues other
     important    ideals   regarding    life   and   death.
     Consequently, a pain standard cannot serve as an
     indirect proxy for additional and significant concerns
     that bear on the decision to forego life-prolonging
     treatments."

The concentration exclusively upon pain is to me an unacceptable

approach     to a patient in Anthony Bland's extreme situation.

There are other factors to be placed in the critical equation.

     Those other factor^ have not so far been explored in English

decisions but they have been considered extensively in the United

States and in a recent case in New Zealand.    In Cruzan v Director

Missouri Department of Health, (1990) 110 S.Ct.          2841,   (a pvs

case) Stevens J (in a dissenting opinion) said at page 2885:-

             "But Nancy Cruzan's interest in life, no
             less than any other person, includes an
             interest in how she will be thought of after
             her death by those whose opinions mattered
             to her. There can be no doubt that her life
             made her dear to her family, and to others.
             How she dies will affect how that life is
             remembered."



                               page 10
In Guardianship of Jane Doe, 583 NE 2d 1263                 (Mass.    992), the

Supreme Judicial Court of Massachusetts, (in a pvs case where the

patient    had   always   been   incompetent) held          that    incompetent

individuals have the same rights as competent individuals to

refuse and terminate medical treatment.               Abrams J., giving the

majority opinion, accepted the rights of the patient to bodily

integrity    and   privacy     and    upheld    the   judge's      decision    to

terminate nasoduodenal feeding and hydration.               In the Matter of

Nancy Jobes 529 AR. 2d 434 (NJ 1987), (a pvs patient) following

in   the Matter    of   Quinlan,     355 A     2d   647   (NJ),      upheld   the

principle of self-determination for the incompetent.                  The views

of the family      were accepted in each of those cases.              Handler J

in a concurring opinion, considered the best interests test and

after describing the extreme physical condition of Mrs Jobes,

(very     similar to Mr Bland), repeated a passage in his opinion

in Conroy (supra) at page 1249:-

      "The medical and nursing treatment of individuals in
      extremis and suffering from those conditions entails
      the constant and extensive handling and manipulation
      of the body.     At some point, such      a course of
      treatment upon the insensate patient is bound to touch
      the sensibilities of even the most detached observer.
      Eventually, pervasive bodily intrusions, even for the
      best of motives,     will arouse feelings akin to
      humiliation   and mortification    for the helpless
      patient.  When cherished values of human dignity and
      personal privacy which belong to every person living
      or dying, are sufficiently transgressed by what is
      being done to the individual, we should be ready to
      say: enough."

He went on to say:-

            "Based upon such factors it should be
            possible to   structure critical treatment
            decisions that are reliable, understandable
            and acceptable."


        The case of     JHL,   (High Court of New Zealand,             Auckland

                                     page 11
Registry,    judgment      given    13th August     1992),    was       an extreme

example     of   a   Guillain-Barre     Syndrome,      causing      a    condition

somewhat similar to a pvs patient where the doctors sought a

declaration that to withdraw artificial ventilation would not

constitute culpable homicide.          Thomas J granted the declaration

and in doing so considered decisions from a number of common law

jurisdictions including the American and our own.                   He referred

at page 17 to:-

             "The values of human dignity and personal
             privacy..... Human dignity and personal
             privacy   belong to every person, whether
             living   or    dying.      Yet,   the  sheer
             invasiveness     or    the   treatment   and
             manipulation of the human body which it
             entails,    the   pitiful   and  humiliating
             helplessness of the patient's state, and the
             degradation and dissolution of all bodily
             functions invoke these values."


The judge based his decision upon the best interests test.

Mr Munby accepted that there was no               difference in principle

between the ventilator and the naso-gastric tube.

       Although the American decisions are often based upon the

principle of achieving *the right of an incompetent patient to

make   decisions      as   if    competent   through    the   device       of   the

substituted judgment, in many          cases the distinction             from best

interests is blurred as Handler J pointed out in Jobes (supra)

at   page   456,     and in     some cases   it   is clearly an objective

assessment of best interests and the decisions are                      persuasive

support for considerations far wider than the factor of pain to

be taken into        account in balancing the critical equation.

       We all of course recognise that a patient unable to choose

cannot himself exercise his right of self-determination and he


                                     page 12
cannot make the irrational      decision he might notionally            have

made if in possession of his faculties.         But not to be able to

be irrational      does not seem to me to be a good reason to be

deprived of a rational       decision which could be taken on his

behalf in his best interests.        Otherwise, if, as I believe they

are, other factors as well as pain are relevant considerations,

he is put at an unfair disadvantage.

     A   mentally     incompetent    patient   has   interests     to    be

considered and protected, the basic one being the right to be

properly cared for by others.          He retains the right to have

proceedings taken on his behalf, for instance to claim damages

for negligence, or to have his estate or other property           managed

for him, or to respond to actions or proceedings taken against

him, such as divorce proceedings.         He retains in my       view the

right to be well-regarded by        others, and to be well-remembered

by his family.      That right is separate from that of his family

to remember him and to have the opportunity to grieve for him

when he is dead.    He has the right to be respected.     Consequently

he has a right to avoid1 unnecessary       humiliation and degrading

invasion of his body      for no good purpose.       I was dismayed to

hear the argument of the Official Solicitor that if Mr Bland

suffered a cardiac arrest or a renal failure, it would be the

duty of the doctors to perform a heart bypass operation or a

kidney   transplant.      I cannot believe that a patient in the

situation of Mr Bland should be subjected to therapeutically

useless treatment contrary     to good medical practice and medical

ethics which would not be inflicted upon the those able to chose.

It is an affront to his right to be respected.


                               page 13
        The considerations as to           the quality of life           of Mr Bland

now and in the future in his extreme situation are in my opinion

rightly to be placed on the other side of the critical equation

from the general principle of the sanctity                  and inviolability of

life.    In this appeal those factors which include the reality of

Mr    Bland’s    existence     outweigh        the   abstract      requirement        to

preserve life.       The doctors charged with his care have balanced

that     equation     from    the     medical          standpoint        and,   after

consultation         with    the    family     who    are   in    agreement,     have

concluded     that    his    best    interests       lie    in   not    artificially

prolonging his life.         The President reconsidered all the relevant

matters    and came     to the conclusion that               to discontinue          the

artificial      feeding would be in accordance with good medical,

practice and was in the best interests of Mr Bland.                             In my

respectful         view he was right and                I entirelyagree with his

conclusion.        The duty of the doctors              towards a pvspatient atthe

extreme end of the spectrum does not extend to prolonging his

life at all        costs.    Where they can             be medicallycertain onall

the     evidence     that    he     has    been      suffering         from   loss   of

consciousness without hope of recovery for a substantial period

of time, in my judgment they are not in breach of their duty                         of

care if they discontinue the artificial nutrition and hydration.

The criminal law

        The thrust of Mr Munby's argument has been that                         it is

unlawful to discontinue artificial feeding and consequently the

doctors would be at risk of criminal proceedings.                        If a doctor

owes a duty to         continue to treat or to provide artificial

nutrition, his failure to do              so   is a breach of his duty          to the


                                      page 14
patient and may        not only    be actionable, but also a criminal

act.     In my    view, as I have already   set out in this judgment,

I do not consider that there remains a duty of care upon the

doctors to continue the artificial feeding and I agree with Mr

Lester that there is no           actus reus and no   unlawful act or

omission.        The issue of mens rea does not arise.

        There has been no     criminal prosecution on these facts in

England.    My view is supported, however, by     the decision of the

Superior Court of the State of California, in the County of Los

Angeles in the case of Barber, 147 Cal Rpp 3d 1032 (1983).          The

Court    held    that the doctors' omission to continue treatment

though intentional and with knowledge that the patient would die

was not unlawful failure to perform a legal duty.

        The position of Dr Cox is different,    (R v Cox 18 September

1992, Ognall J).        He injected a lethal dose which was designed

to cause death and was an external and intrusive act committed

by   an outsider and was not in accordance with his duty of care

as a doctor.       The effect of the cessation of artificial feeding

is to place the patient in the position he would have been in

before the naso-gastric tube was inserted.        Without the tube he

would have died from his medical condition and with it he has

been artificially       kept alive despite that condition until now.

Whether this is act or omission carries the matter no          further.

The distinction       between Mr Bland's doctors and Dr Cox is between

an act or omission which allows causes already           present in the

body to operate and the introduction of an external agency           of
death.

       The idea of ceasing the artificial feeding is a distressing


                                  page 15
one for all of us to contemplate.               It would no doubt also be

distressing for those who are caring for Mr Bland.                       We know

however      from   the   medical   evidence    that    it    would    not   be   a

distressing or painful experience for him in his state of non­

cognition.      The manner of his death can be eased for him and

those seeing it by appropriate medical and nursing care until the

end of his life.

       I have anxiously considered whether this is a decision which

ought to be taken by the doctors alone.                As the House of Lords

said in Re F        (supra)   it is not generally         for the courts to

intervene in the decision-making process as to whether a course

of action is in the best interests of a patient.                 That process

is for the doctors.         The BMA have laid down careful            guidelines

for    these   cases.      Nonetheless     in Re   F    the   House    of    Lords

recognised an exceptional situation which required guidance from

the High Court.         I have been persuaded by the Amicus that in a

decision-making process of such gravity            as whether to continue

treating a pvs patient, the intervention of the High Court is a

proper safeguard.         I respectfully   agree with the formulation of

the procedures proposed by the President and that, for the time

being at least, each application to discontinue treatment should

be    made   to the High Court.          The   rapid advances         of medical

technology      create problems which may require the intervention

of the courts from time to time.               Such intervention may also

reassure public concern.

       I would dismiss the appeal.

The Master of the Rolls
Lord Justice Butler-Sloss
Lord Justice Hoffmann


                    Airedale NHS Trust v. Bland


HOFFMANN L J.


  Anthony Bland was a cheerful teenager from Keighley in York­
shire. He enjoyed pop music, football and drinking with his friends. In
the spectators’ pen at Hillsborough Football Stadium on 15th April
          *



1989 his lungs were crushed by the pressure of the crowd around him.
He ceased breathing until resuscitated by first aid. While he could not
breathe, his brain was deprived of oxygen.


  The human brain consists of the cerebral hemispheres and the
lower centre of the brain, which is called the brain stem. The cerebral
hemispheres, or more precisely their outer layers, which are called the
cerebral cortex, contain the function of consciousness. Without them,
we cannot see, hear, feel pain or pleasure, or make any voluntary
movements. The brain stem controls the body’s semi-autonomous
movements, like breathing, reflex actions and the beating of the heart.


   The cerebral cortex requires a constant supply of oxygen, glucose
and blood. An interruption of oxygen for a few minutes can cause ex­
tensive damage to the cells of the cortex, which never regenerate. But
2                       Airedale NHS Trust v. Bland


the brain stem is relatively resistant to being deprived of oxygen. It
may therefore continue to function, and enable the heart to beat, the
lungs to breathe and the stomach to digest, after the cortex has been
                                                           r
irretrievably destroyed. This condition has been called “persistent
vegetative state”.


    Since 15th April 1989 Anthony Bland has been in persistent vegeta­
tive state. He lies in Airedale General Hospital in Keighley, fed liquid
food by a pump through a tube passing through his nose and down the
back of his throat into the stomach. His bladder is emptied through a
catheter inserted through his penis, which from time to time has
caused infections requiring dressing and antibiotic treatment. His stif­
fened joints have caused his limbs to be rigidly contracted so that his
arms are tightly flexed across his chest and his legs unnaturally con­
torted. Reflex movements in the throat cause him to vomit and drib­
ble. Of all this, and the presence of members his family who take turns
to visit him, Anthony Bland has no consciousness at all. The parts of
his brain which provided him with consciousness have turned to fluid.
The darkness and oblivion which descended at Hillsborough will
never depart. His body is alive, but he has no life in the sense that
even the most pitifully handicapped but conscious human being has a
life. But the advances of modern medicine permit him to be kept in
this state for years, even perhaps for decades.            •


    The question in this appeal is whether the court should in these cir­
cumstances declare that those in charge of caring for Anthony Bland
                         Airedale NHS Trust v. Bland                    3



may lawfully stop providing the artificial means of keeping him alive.
This is a terrible decision because the consequence is that he will die.
It is a question which until relatively recently would never have arisen.
A person who had irreversibly lost consciousness would quickly have
died: from lack of nutrition or from one of the many complications
which have afflicted Anthony Bland’s body over the past three years
and which medical technology has been able to hold at bay. Modern
medicine therefore faces us with fundamental and painful decisions
about life and death which cannot be answered on the basis of normal
everyday assumptions.


   For reasons which I shall eventually state quite briefly, I agree with
Sir Thomas Bingham M.R. and Butler-Sloss L.J. that in English law it
would be lawful for the Airedale Hospital to stop keeping Anthony
Bland alive. But this case has caused a great deal of public concern.
People are worried, perhaps not so much about this particular case,
                     *

but about where it may lead. Is the court to assume the role of God
and decide who should live and who should die ? Is Anthony Bland to
die because the quality of his life is so miserable ? Does this mean
that the court would approve the euthanasia of seriously handicapped
people ? And what about the manner of his death ? Can it ever be
right to cause the death of a human being by deliberately depriving
him of food ? This is not an area in which any difference can be al­
lowed to exist between what is legal and what is morally right. The de­
cision of the court should be able to carry conviction with the ordinary
4                        Airedale NHS Trust v. Bland


person as being based not merely on legal precedent but also upon ac­
ceptable ethical values. For this reason I shall start by trying to explain
why I think it would be not only lawful but right to let Anthony Bland
die. In the course of doing so I shall also try to explain why the princi­
ples upon which this judgment rests do not make it afprecedent for
morally unacceptable decisions in the future.


    To argue from moral rather than purely legal principles is a some­
what unusual enterprise for a judge to undertake. It is not the function
of judges to lay down systems of morals and nothing which I say is in­
tended to do so. But it seemed to me that in such an unusual case as
this, it would clarify my own thought and perhaps help others, if I tried
to examine the underlying moral principles which have lead me to the
conclusion at which I have arrived. In doing so, I must acknowledge
                                                           m

the assistance I have received from reading the manuscript of Profes­
sor Ronald Dworkin’s forthcoming book Life's Dominion and from
conversations with hirq and Professor Bernard Williams.


    I start with the concept of the sanctity of life. Why do we think it
would be a tragedy to allow Anthony Bland to die ? It could be said
that the entire tragedy took place at Hillsborough and tbat the curtain
was brought down when Anthony Bland passed into a persistent
vegetative state. Until then, his life was precious to him and his family.
But since then, he has had no consciousness of his life and it could be
said to be a matter of indifference to him whether he lives or dies. But
the fact is that Anthony Bland is still alive. The mere fact that he is
                        Airedale NHS Trust v. Bland                     5



still a living organism means that there remains an epilogue of the
tragedy which is being played out. This is because we have a strong
feeling that there is an intrinsic value in human life, irrespective of
whether it is valuable to the person concerned or indeed to anyone
else. Those who adhere to religious faiths which believe in the sanctity
of all God’s creation and in particular that human life was created in
the image of God himself will have no difficulty with the concept of
the intrinsic value of human life. But even those without any religious
belief think in the same way. In a case like this we should not try to
analyse the rationality of such feelings. What matters is that, in one
form or another, they form part of almost everyone’s intuitive values.
No law which ignores them can possibly hope to be acceptable.


  Our belief in the sanctity of life explains why we think it is almost
always wrong to cause the death of another human being, even one
who is terminally ill or so disabled that we think that if we were in his
position we would rather be dead. Still less do we tolerate laws such as
existed in Nazi Germany, by which handicapped people or inferior
races could be put to death because someone else thought that their
lives were useless.


   But the sanctity of life is only one of a cluster of ethical principles
which we apply to decisions about how we should live. Another is
respect for the individual human being and in particular for his right
to choose how he should live his own life. We call this individual
6                         Airedale NHS Trust v. Bland


autonomy or the right of self-determination. And another principle,
closely connected, is respect for the dignity of the individual human
being: our belief that quite irrespective of what the person concerned
may think about it, it is wrong for someone to be humiliated or
treated without respect for his value as a person. The fact that the dig­
nity of an individual is an intrinsic value is shown by the fact that we
feel embarrassed and think it wrong when someone behaves in a way
which we think demeaning to himself, which does not show sufficient
respect for himself as a person.


    No one, I think, would quarrel with these deeply rooted ethical
principles. But what is not always realised, and what is critical in this
case, is that they are not always compatible with each other. Take, for
example, the sanctity of life and the right of self-determination. We all
believe in them and yet we cannot always have them both. The patient
who refuses medical treatment which is necessary to save his life is ex­
ercising his right to self-determination. But allowing him, in effect, to
choose to die, is something which many people will believe offends
the principle of the sanctity of life. Suicide is no longer « crime, but its
decrim inalisation was a recognition that the principle of self-
determination should in that case prevail over the sanctity of life.


    I accept that the sanctity of life is a complex notion, often linked to
religion, on which differing views may be held. The Jehovah’s Witness
who refuses a blood transfusion even though he knows this may result
in his death, would probably not consider that he was sacrificing the
                        Airedale NHS Trust v. Bland                     7



principle of the sanctity of life to his own right of self-determination.
He would probably say that a life which involved receiving a transfu­
sion was so defiled as no longer to be an object of sanctity at all. But
someone else might think that his death was a tragic waste and did of­
fend against the sanctity of life. I do not think it would be a satisfac­
tory answer to such a person to say that if he could only see it from the
point of view of the Jehovah’s Witness, he would realise that the prin­
ciple of the sanctity of life had not been sacrificed but triumphantly
upheld. Similarly it is possible to qualify the meaning of the sanctity of
life by including, as some cultures do, concepts of dignity and fufil-
ment as part of the essence of life. In this way one could argue that,
properly understood, Anthony Bland’s death would not offend against
the sanctity of life. But I do not think that this would satisfy the many
people who feel strongly that it does. I think it is better to accept this
and confront it.


   A conflict between the principles of the sanctity of life and the indi­
vidual’s right of self-determination may therefore require a painful
compromise to be made. In the case of the person who refuses an op­
eration without which he will certainly die, one o r other principle
must be sacrificed. We may adopt a paternalist view, deny that his
autonomy can be allowed to prevail in so extreme a case, and uphold
the sanctity of life. Sometimes this looks an attractive solution, but it
can have disturbing implications. Do we insist upon patients accepting
life-saving treatment which is contrary to their strongly held religious
8                        Airedale NHS Trust v. Bland


beliefs ? Should one force-feed prisoners on hunger strike ? English
law is, as one would expect, paternalist towards minors. But it upholds
the autonomy of adults. A person of full age may refuse treatment for
any reason or no reason at all, even if it appears certain that the result
will be his death.


    I do not suggest that the position which English law has taken is the
only morally correct solution. Some might think that in cases of life
and death, the law should be more paternalist even to adults. The
point to be emphasised is that there is no morally correct solution
which can be deduced from a single ethical principle like the sanctity
of life or the right of self-determination. There must be an accom­
modation between principles, both of which seem rational and good,
but which have come into conflict with each other.


    It would therefore be in accordance with the English approach to
resolving the conflict between the right of self-determination and the
sanctity of life that if Anthony Bland were to be momentarily restored
to consciousness with full knowledge that he would shortly revert to
his persistent vegetative state, and if he were to instruct those caring
for him that he no longer wanted artificially to be kept alive, the doc­
tors and nurses would be obliged to respect his wishes. If he were to
give such an instruction, I think that many would feel that his wishes
be obeyed, not only because they were his wishes, but because (unlike
the case of a person who for religious reasons refuses treatment which
could restore him to vigorous health) his wishes were entirely under­
                           Airedale NHS Trust v. Bland                 9



standable. The horror of his situation is such that few would not think
it perfectly reasonable for him to decide that as he had already lost all
sense and consciousness, he would prefer to die.


  In this case, however, Anthony Bland has not made such a decision
and never will. Some people make it clear in advance that if they
should fall into a state which seems to them in anticipation to be in­
tolerable, they do not want life-sustaining treatment to be continued.
The right of self-determination entails that such wishes should be
respected. Different jurisdictions have varying requirements about
how clearly such wishes should be expressed. But Anthony Bland ex­
pressed none at all. There is nothing to show that in the course of his
short life he gave the matter any thought. All that his family can say is
that from their knowledge of him and his general attitude to life, the
things that interested him and gave him pleasure, he would not have
wanted to survive in his present state.
                       *




   Does this mean that people who have not expressed their wishes in
advance and are now incapable of expression must lose all right to
have treatment discontinued and that those caring for them are in
every case under a corresponding duty to keep them alive as long as
medical science will allow ? Counsel for the Official Solicitor said
that this was so. If they have not chosen, the court has no right to
choose on their behalf. I think that the fallacy in this argument is that
choice cannot be avoided. To continue treatment is as much a choice
10                      Airedale NHS Trust v. Bland


as to discontinue it. Why is it not an act of choice to decide to con­
tinue to invade the privacy of Anthony Bland’s body with tubes,
catheters, probes and injections ? If on account of his unconscious­
ness he is obliged to submit to such treatment, one cannot say that it is
because the court is refusing to choose on his behalf. One way or the
other, a choice is being made. It is only if one thinks it natural and
normal to want treatment that continuing to provide it’seems not so
much a choice as a given state of affairs. And of course in most cases
this would be true. In a case in which it was being said that a person
should not be given treatment which would avoid death and restore
him to full health, one would want to know that this was his personal
choice and that it had been expressed very clearly indeed.


     But Anthony Bland’s is not a normal case. The continuation of
artificial sustenance and medical treatment will keep him alive but
will not restore him to having a life in any sense at all. It is necessary
to emphasise the awful certainty of his fate. We all know of cases in
which doctors have been mistaken and where people have recovered
to live meaningful lives after being given over for dead. But no one
has ever recovered any vestige of consciousness after being in a persis­
tent vegetative state for more than a year. Anthony Bland has been in
this state for more than three years. He has been examined by a num­
ber of the most eminent doctors and they are unanimous that there is
no hope whatever of any consciousness being regained. They say that
this is the worst case of irreversible cortex damage that they have
seen. Nor is this a case in which one has to make an assessment of the
                         Airedale NHS Trust v. Bland                 11



quality of life which Anthony Bland has. We all know and admire
people who suffer pain and disability, of whom many would think that
in their position they would rather be dead, and yet who endure their
lives and derive meaning and satisfaction from living. But the very
concept of having a life has no meaning in relation to Anthony Bland.
He is alive but has no life at all.


    Counsel for the Official Solicitor argued that however vestigial
Anthony Bland’s life might be, one could not assume that he would
choose to die. Being unconscious, he felt no pain or humiliation and
therefore had no interests which suffered from his being kept alive.
Anthony Bland was in fact indifferent to whether he lived or died and
there was nothing to put in the balance against the intrinsic value of
his life.


   I think that the fallacy in this argument is that it assumes that we
have no interests except in those things of which we have conscious
experience. But this does not accord with most people’s intuitive feel­
ings about their lives and deaths. At least a part of the reason why we
honour the wishes of the dead about the distribution of their property
is that we think it would wrong them not to do so, despite the fact that
we believe that they will never know that their will has been ignored.
Most people would like an honourable and dignified death and we
think it wrong to dishonour their deaths, even when they are uncon­
scious that this is happening. We pay respect to their dead bodies and
12                        Airedale NHS Trust v. Bland


to their memory because we think it an offence against the dead
themselves if we do not. Once again I am not concerned to analyse the
rationality of these feelings. It is enough that they are deeply rooted in
our ways of thinking and that the law cannot possibly ignore them.
Thus I think that counsel for the Official Solicitor offers a seriously in­
complete picture of Anthony Bland’s interests when he confines them
to animal feelings of pain or pleasure. It is demeaning to the human
spirit to say that, being unconscious, he can have no interest in his per­
sonal privacy and dignity, in how he lives or dies.


     Anthony Bland therefore has a recognisable interest in the manner
of his life and death which can help the court to apply the principles of
self-determination and the value of the individual. We can say from
what we have learned of Anthony Bland from those closest to him,
that forced as we are to choose, we think it is more likely that in his
present state he would choose to die than to live. There is no sugges­
tion that he was, for example, motivated by any religious principles
which would have made him want his life in its present state
prolonged. We can also say that in allowing him to die, we would be
showing more respect to him as an individual than by keeping him
alive.
                                                           ••




     Thus it seems to me that we are faced with conflicting ethical prin­
ciples. On the one hand, Anthony Bland is alive and the principle of
the sanctity of life says that we should not deliberately allow him to
die. On the other hand, Anthony Bland is an individual human being
                             Airedale NHS Trust v. Bland                             13



and the principle of self-determination says he should be allowed to
choose for himself and that if he is unable to express his choice, we
should try our honest best to do what we think he would have chosen.
We cannot disclaim this choice because to go on is as much a choice
as to stop. Normally we would unquestioningly assume that anyone
would wish to live rather than die. But in the extraordinary case of
Anthony Bland, we think it more likely that he would choose to put an
end to the humiliation of his being and the distress of his family.
Finally, Anthony Bland is a person to whom respect is owed and we
think that it would show greater respect to allow him to die and be
mourned by his family than to keep him grotesquely alive.


  There is no formula for reconciling this conflict of principles and
no easy answer. It does no good to seize hold of one of them, such as
the sanctity of life, and say that because it is valid and right, as it un­
doubtedly is, it must always prevail over other principles which are
                         *

also valid and right. Nor do I think it helps to say that these principles
are all really different ways of looking at the same thing. Counsel for
the Attorney-General said that there was


       “no conflict between having regard to the quality of life and respecting
    the sanctity of life; on the contrary they are complementary, the principle of
    the sanctity of life embraces the need for full respect to be accorded to the
    dignity and memory of the individual.”



   To my mind, this is rhetoric intended to dull the pain of having to
choose. For many people, the sanctity of life is not at all the same
14                          Airedale NHS Trust v. Bland


thing as the dignity of the individual. We cannot smooth away the dif­
ferences by interpretation. Instead, we are faced with a situation
which has been best expressed by Sir Isaiah Berlin:1


    “The world that we encounter in ordinary experience is one in which we are faced
with choices between ends equally ultimate, and claims equally absolute, the realisa­
tion of some of which must inevitably involve the sacrifice of others...The knowledge
that it is not merely in practice but in principle impossible to reach clear-cut and
certain answers, even in an ideal world of wholly good and rational men and wholly
clear ideas - may madden those who seek for final solutions and single., all-embracing
systems, guaranteed to be eternal. Nevertheless it is a conclusion that cannot be es­
caped by those who, with Kant, have learnt the truth that out of the crooked timber of
humanity no straight thing was ever made.”



     In my view the choice which the law makes must reassure people
that the courts do have full respect for life, but that they do not pursue
the principle to the point at which it has become almost empty of any
real content and when it involves the sacrifice of other important
values such as human dignity and freedom of choice. I think that such
reassurance can be provided by a decision, properly explained, to al­
low Anthony Bland to ftte. It does not involve, as counsel for the Offi­
cial Solicitor suggested, a decision that he may die because the court
thinks that his “life is not worth living”. There is no question of his life
being worth living or not worth living because the stark reality is that
Anthony Bland is net living a life at all. None of the things that one
says about the way people live their lives - well or ill, with courage or
fortitude, happily or sadly - have any meaning in relation to him. This



 1 ‘Two Concepts of Liberty” in Four Essays on Liberty (O.U.P., 1969), 168,170.
                        Airedale NHS Trust v. Bland                     15



in my view represents a difference in kind from the case of the con­
scious but severely handicapped person. It is absurd to conjure up the
spectre of eugenics as a reason against the decision in this case.


  Thus in principle I think it would be right to allow Anthony Bland
to die. Is this answer affected by the proposed manner of his death ?
Some might say that as he is going to die, it does not matter how. Why
wait for him to expire for lack of food or be carried off by an un­
treated infection ? Would it not be more humane simply to give him
a lethal injection ? No one in this case is suggesting that Anthony
Bland should be given a lethal injection. But there is concern about
ceasing to supply food as against, for example, ceasing to treat an in­
fection with antibiotics. Is there any real distinction ? In order to
come to terms with our intuitive feelings about whether there is a dis­
tinction, I must start by considering why most of us would be appalled
if he was given a lethal injection. It is, I think, connected with our view
that the sanctity of life entails its inviolability by an outsider. Subject
to exceptions like self-defence, human life is inviolate even if the per­
son in question has consented to its violation. That is why although
suicide is not a crime, assisting someone to commit suicide is. It fol­
lows that even if we think Anthony Bland would have consented, we
would not be entitled to end his life by a lethal injection.


   On the other hand, we recognise that, one way or another, life must
come to an end. We do not impose on outsiders an unqualified duty to
16                        Airedale NHS Trust v. Bland


do everything possible to prolong life as long as possible. I think that
the principle of inviolability explains why, although we accept that in
certain cases it is right to allow a person to die (and the debate so far
has been over whether this is such a case) we hold without qualifica­
tion that no one may introduce an external agency with the intention
of causing death. I do not think that the distinction turns upon
whether what is done is an act or omission. This leads to barren argu­
ments over whether the withdrawal of equipment from the body is a
positive act or an omission to keep it in place. The distinction is be­
tween an act or omission which allows an existing cause to operate
and the introduction of an external agency of death.


     What complicates this distinction, however, is another ethical prin­
ciple which demands that we should show kindness and humanity to
our fellow human beings. At the most basic level, this principle insists
that we should, if we are able to do so, provide food and shelter to a
human being in our caje who is unable to provide them for himself. If
someone allows a small child or invalid in his care to starve to death,
we do not say that he allowed nature to take its course. We think he
has committed a particularly wicked crime. We treat him as if he had
introduced an external agency of death. It is the same ethical principle
which requires doctors and hospitals to provide the patients in their
care with such medical attention and nursing as they are reasonably
able to give.
                        Airedale NHS Trust v. Bland                     17



  In the normal case there is no moral difference between violations
of these two principles - the prohibition on violating the person and
the positive duty to act with humanity towards the helpless. Starving a
child to death is no different from giving him poison. But there are
two distinctions between the prohibition on external violation and the
duty to provide humane care and assistance. One distinction is that
the duty to provide care - for example, to provide medical treatment -
ceases when such treatment can serve no humane purpose. In cases
when further treatment can prolong the life of the patient only for a
short period and at the cost of great pain and suffering, the doctor is
under no obligation to continue. Indeed, the duty to act with kindness
and humanity points in the opposite direction. But the prohibition on
violating the person is absolute. Whatever the patient’s sufferings, no
one is entitled to introduce an external agency of death. It was this
prohibition which Dr Cox violated by injecting Mrs Boyes with potas­
sium chloride. The debate over euthanasia centres on the agonising
conflict which can arise when, as in that case, the duty to act with
kindness and humanity comes into conflict with the absolute prohibi­
tion on the violation of the person. At the moment, English law un­
equivocally resolves this conflict by giving priority to the latter princi­
ple. This is not the place to debate whether this is the only morally or
socially acceptable position. In the present case, no such issue arises.
This is not a case about euthanasia because it is does not involve any
external agency of death. It is about whether, and how, the patient
should be allowed to die.
18                      Airedale NHS Trust v. Bland




     It is, I think, the duty to act with kindness and humanity which
leads people to say that whatever may be the position about artificial
medical treatment, it cannot be right to deny the patient food. The
giving of food to a helpless person is so much the quintessential exam­
ple of kindness and humanity that it is hard to imagine a case in which
it would be morally right to withhold it. If it is right that Anthony
Bland should be allowed to die, then refrain from giving antibiotics
and let him be carried off by an infection. But do not allow him to
starve.


     American writers have referred to these qualms about denial of
food as the “sloganism” and “emotional symbolism” of food. I do not
think that one should make light of these deeply intuitive feelings,
which derive, as I have said, from a principle of kindness which is a
badge of our humanity. But like the principle of the sanctity of life,
they cease to provide true guidance in the extreme case. It is of course
hard to imagine a case in which it could be humane to deny food to a
patient. But this case stretches the imagination. To deny someone
food is wrong because it causes suffering and death. But Anthony
Bland cannot suffer and his condition is such that it is right that he
should be allowed to die. His interest in the manner of his death - and
it is a very important one - is that it should not be distressing or
humiliating. If therefore, withdrawal of nourishment would produce
distressing symptoms of which Anthony Bland was unconscious but
which were visible to the nursing staff and family, this would be a
                       Airedale NHS Trust v. Bland                   19



good reason for allowing him to die in some other way. But the medi­
cal evidence is that suitable sedation can prevent any untoward symp­
toms and that withdrawal of nourishment is the most gentle and con­
trolled way in which to allow him to die.


  Counsel for the Official Solictor opened this appeal by saying that
the President “had held that it was lawful for a doctor to starve his
patient to death.” This is emotive language and by that I do not mean
that this is not a proper case for emotion. It certainly is. By emotive
language I mean language which evokes emotional images which are
false, which have no application to the present case. The use of the
language is intended to evoke images of cruelty, suffering and un­
welcome death. Such images have no part to play in arriving at an ans­
wer to the problem, already difficult enough, which this case presents
to the court.


   I said that there were two distinctions between the prohibition on
violating the person and the duty to provide care and assistance. So
far I have mentioned only one. The second is that while the prohibi­
tion on violation is absolute, the duty to provide care is restricted to
what one can reasonably provide. No one is under a moral duty to do
more than he can, or to assist one patient at the cost of neglecting an­
other. The resources of the National Health Service are not limitless
and choices have to be made. This qualification on the moral duty to
provide care did not enter into the argument in this case at all. The
20                         Airedale NHS Trust v. Bland


Airedale NHS Trust invited us to decide the case on the assumption
that its resources were unlimited and we have done so. But one is
bound to observe that the cost of keeping a patient like Anthony
Bland alive is very considerable and that in another case the health
authority might conclude that its resources were better devoted to
other patients. We do not have to consider such a case, but in princi­
ple the allocation of resources between patients is a matter for the
health authority and not for the courts.


     I can deal with the authorities very shortly. The House of Lords de­
cided in Re F. (Mental Patient: Sterilisation)2 that the duty of a doctor
towards a patient who lacks mental capacity to express his own wishes
(and has not expressed any at a time when he had such capacity) is to
give or withhold treatment according to what appears to be the best
interests of the patient. The best interests of the patient in my judg­
ment embrace not only recovery on the avoidance of pain (neither of
which apply to this case) but also a dignified death. On this issue I
respectfully agree with the dissenting judgments of Handler J. in In
the Matter o f Claire C. Conroy* and Brennan and Stevens JJ. in Cruzan
V. Director,   Missouri Department o f Health4. The patient’s best interests
would normally also include having respect paid to what seems most
likely to have been his own views on the subject. To this extent I think

that what the American courts have called “substituted judgment”
may be subsumed within the English concept of best interests. On the
other hand, cases involving minors like Re J. (A Minor) (Wardship:
Medical Treatment)s show that full weight has to be given to the prin­
ciple of the sanctity of life before deciding that a test of best interests
justifies a decision to allow the patient to die. In my judgment, how­
ever, such a decision is justified here. I agree with what Sir Thomas
Bingham M.R. and Butler-Sloss L J. have said about the procedure to
be followed in future cases.


   Finally I must deal with some aspects of the judgment of the Presi­
dent. As will be apparent, I am in agreement with the decision which
he reached. But there are certain points in his judgment which may
have given rise to concern. First, the judgment contains some discus­
sion about whether the administration of liquid food through a tube
can properly be called medical treatment. Some have felt that the is­
sues in this case could* not depend upon a semantic point like that. I
agree. As I see it, there are only two ways in which it may be relevant
to call the feeding medical treatment. They are to identify it as some­
thing upon which, first, the hospital can properly ask for the guidance
of the court as to what it should do and secondly, the medical profes­
sion can properly express a view. Once one is clear about why the
question is being asked, it does not matter whether one calls it medi­

cal treatment, nursing, care or anything else. There is in my view no
distinction between medical treatment and other kinds of care for the
purposes of deciding the central issue in this case. This brings me to
the second point of concern. The President laid some emphasis upon
the fact that according to professional medical opinion and the
B.M.A.’s statement on ethics, ending artificial feeding would be in ac­
cordance with good medical practice. Some have felt concern at the
suggestion that questions of whether patients should live or die should
be decided according to what was thought to be good practice by the
medical profession. Once again, I sympathise with this concern.


     I do not think that the President was saying that the views of the
medical profession should determine the legal and moral questions
which I have discussed in this judgment. Nor do I think that the
profession would be grateful to the court for leaving the full responsi­
bility for such decisions in its hands. It seems to me that the medical
profession can tell the* court about the patient’s condition and prog­
nosis and about the probable consequences of giving or not giving
certain kinds of treatment or care, including the provision of artificial
feeding. But whether in those circumstances it would be lawful to pro­
vide or withhold the treatment or care is a matter for the law and
must be decided with regard to the general moral considerations of
which I have spoken. As to these matters, the medical profession will
no doubt have views which are entitled to great respect, but I would
expect medical ethics to be formed by the law rather than the reverse.

   I should emphasise that this is not a case in which some past act on
the part of a doctor is being called into question. If the issue was
whether such an act had given rise to civil or criminal liability, the fact
that the doctor has acted in accordance with responsible professional
opinion would usually be determinative. But in this case the plaintiff
hospital trust is seeking the opinion of the court as to whether future
conduct will be lawful. It has invited the court to decide whether, on
medical facts which are not in dispute, the termination of life-support
would be justified as being in the best interests of the patient. This is a
purely legal (or moral) decision which does not require any medical
expertise and is therefore appropriately made by the court.


   I would dismiss the appeal.

SCRUTINY ON THE HILLSBOROUGH STADIUM DISASTER



STATEMENT BY LORD JUSTICE STUART-SMITH



"I have today started work on the scrutiny of possible new evidence
relating to the Hillsborough Stadium disaster. My objective is to establish
whether there is any significant evidence which was not previously
available to Lord Taylor's Inquiry, to the inquests, or to the prosecuting or

disciplinary authorities.


"If there is significant evidence, it will be my aim to see if it would have
affected the outcome of any of the various proceedings.      I will then advise
the Home Secretary whether in my opinion there should be a further public
inquiry, and the prosecuting and disciplinary authorities and the Attorney
General whether the fresh evidence is such that they should reconsider the

decisions they have already taken.


"I will shortly be inviting written representations from those interested and
will then decide whom I wish to see in person. But I can confirm that after
the summer I will go to Liverpool to meet the relatives of those killed and

their legal representatives.


"The meetings I have will be private and I will not be making any public
comments on the evidence or representations which are made to me during

the course of the scrutiny. I hope to report my findings to the Home

Secretary towards the end of the year.


"Anyone who considers that they are able to submit material to me should
contact my secretary via Room 528, Home Office, 50 Queen Anne's Gate,

London SW1H 9AT."
Extract o f letter (not yet sent) from Lord Justice Stuart-Smith to

Hillsborough Family Support Group



I f you know o f evidence which was not available at the Inquiry conducted by

Lord Taylor o f Gosforth or at the Inquests, and which might have affected their

outcome or the decisions o f the authorities in relation to prosecution or police

disciplinary proceedings, it would be helpful if you could let me have the

information below.



      1.    Name o f witness and address if known.

      2.    Briefsummary o f theirfresh evidence.

      3.    Whether they

             a)    gave evidence at Lord Taylor’s Inquiry

             b)    gave evidence at the Inquest

             c)    made a statement to the police.



      4.    I f all the answers to 3 are ‘no ’, please say why, as far as you

             know, this witness did not give evidence to the Inquiry or Inquest,

             or make a statement.




                  IF ANY PART OF THIS FAX IS UNCLEAR
                     PLEASE TELEPHONE: 0171 273 4046
I f the answer to any o f the questions in 3 is ‘yes please say why

(so far as you know) they did not deal with the matter which you

refer to in answer to question 2.



Do you know o f any documentary evidence (including photographs

or video film) which is relevant but was not available to Lord

Taylor’s Inquiry or to the Inquest? I f so, please identify it and say

where it may befound, how you think it is relevant, and why you

believe it was not available.



In what way, if at all, do you think that the evidence that the

witness can give, or the documentary evidence referred to in

answer to question 6, could affect

a)    the outcome o f Lord Taylor’s Inquiry;

b)    the verdict o f thejury at the Inquest;

c)    the decision o f the Director o f Public Prosecutions not to

      take criminal proceedings against any person in connection

      with the disaster; or

d)    the decision not to pursue disciplinary proceedings against

      any police officer?




     IF ANY PART OF THIS FAX IS UNCLEAR
        PLEASE TELEPHONE: 0171 273 4046
    This information will help me during the preliminary stages o f my work,

    and I should be grateful if you would let me have it by 1 September. As

    my scrutiny o f the evidence proceeds I may wish to interview some

    witnesses directly. I am also willing to consider interviewing individual

    witnesses at their request.   These interviews will be private and I am

    sure that it will be possible to arrange for them to take place at a

    convenient location.

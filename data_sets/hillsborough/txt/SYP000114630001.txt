               On Saturday,              15 A p r i l ,     1989       (150489)           I came          on    duty      in u n i f o r m at

               match.

               On arrival           at    H i l l s b o r o u g h my        serial        attended             the     match     briefing         in

               the N o r t h     stand,         and    then went             as     a whole          serial          to W a d s l e y     Bridge

               Station,         arriving           there        at   approximately                  11am       (1100).         I cannot          be

               specific         about       the      time       a s at      that        time    I had          no    significant           reason

               to    remember        it.        I can       remember           thinking             that       given      there      was    only

               one     special       train arriving                  shortly            after       2pm    (1400),         that, our

               deployment           there       so    e a r ly was          perhaps           not    the       b est    use    of    the

               serial.          However         and    perhaps           as w a s        in f a c t       intended         the      serial       was

               able     to    pay a t t e n t i o n        to    fans       on H a l i f a x        R o ad.

I can        recall     the       public       house       adjacent          to    the       station,           (towards       the

town      centre       on    the       same    side    of     the      road)       was       shuttered           up w i t h

boarding         across          the    windows.           I do     not      recall          seeing        anyone,          apart

from      possibly          the    licensees,          formally           entering             or    leaving          the    pub at

the      rear.        This       was    not    the    c a s e at       the     public          house       on    the    opposite

side      of    the H a l i f a x       Road    from       the S t a t i o n       entrance.               At    the    side    of

that      pub a       road was          used    for    the       parking          of    hire        v ans,      some    being

used      by P o l i c e     serials.           I do       not    know       if a n y w e r e         fans'       'buses*.

That      pub w a s     also       boarded          up but       the     licensee            was     admitting          fans.        At

some      time      around        midday       he a s k e d      our     serial,          I do       not     k n o w who

though,         if a    couple          of    bobbies       could        stand with             h i m at        the    rear    of

his      p u b to     help       him    'select*       who       he w a s      going         to a d m i t .       The       pub at

this      time      seemed        quite       full    of    football           supporters,              noisy         but    quite

controllable            by       the    licensee       and       his     staff.           I stayed with                h i m for

about        10 m i n u t e s     but    given       that     there       was      another           serial       at    that    side

of    th e     road,    immediately             outside          the     pub,       dur      serial        and another          by

Wadsley Bridge               Station          I did    not       see     the      point        in a c t i n g     as    a bouncer

for      him and       returned          to m y      serial.           I was       not       aware      until         leaving

th a t    area      immediately              before    3pm       (1500)        that       he    had any          problems       with

drunken         customers          and       also    cannot       say     if      the     licensee           ever      requested

Police         assistance          other       than    that       d e s c r i b e d above.

From      the    time       of    getting       to W a d s l e y       Bridge          S t a t i o n w h i c h was well

before         midday,       there       was a steady             stream          of L i v e r p o o l       fans      heading

towards         the    ground.           However,          a small        number          then       came       back    in the

opposite         direction             heading       away     from       the      ground.            I cannot          give

numbers         but    as    is    usual       w i t h these        duties         my a t t e nt io n           was    drawn more

to    the m o r e      noisy       f a ns.      Before        2pm      (1400)          any     sick     conduct,            given

the      occasion,          was    quite       acceptable           and      only       the     odd     few were            advised

quite        gently     to       save    their       sinking        voices         for       the     match       etc.

I can        recall     during          the    time    spent        at    Wadsley Bridge                   some       fads
                                                                                                                                 PAGE

shouting          towards             others       about     ’s p a r e     t i c k e t s ’ , in       particular             one    tall

thin youth.                 He    went       up and        down Halifax            Road        trying        to      find a ticket

S    or 3    times.

Above       Wadlsey             Bridge       Station        is a s m a l l        industrial              estate        of    shops,

Kilner       Way.           The       first     stop       on ii      is a s u p e r m a r k e t .           Towards          the

Sheffield             side       of    that     road and          outside         the     supermarket                itself      are

grassed          areas.           As     time move d         on t o w a r d       the     start        of    th e     match,        and

certainly             from       1pm     (1300)       onwards         these       areas        were       quite       literally

covered with you ng                      men    sat      drinking          from    cans        and     plastic          bottles.

The    favourite                quantity        seemed       to      be    *4*    packs        of     cans,       although

*6*    packs and                *12*     packs were          not      uncommon.               Nor w e r e       the 2 a n d 3

litre       bottles.              Again        before       2pm      (1400)       they were            not      causing a

public       order          problem.

Their       concern             for    the     litter       l aw s    did     leave       a    lot     to    be      d e s i r e d as     on

emptying          a    can       it w a s      simply       dropped         on    t he    flo o r .         On at       least       one

occasion          both m y se lf             and     other     officers           believed a              can had         been

thrown       at       us,       but w h a t     was      happening          as    time        moved       on w a s      so m a n y

cans    were          rolling          about       and     onto      the    road     vehicles             were       kicking        them

up w h e n       passing          over       them.         In all         fairness        I must          put     down       that    by

far    the       majority             were     simply       enjoying         a drink,            in the         pleasant

weather.              One       thought        did    occur       to me      that        we    do     not    always          have    to

leave       finding             'loopholes'           in    legislation            to     solicitors.                 These      lads

had    found          the       weakness        in the C o n t r o l         of A l c o h o l        - Sporting              Grounds

going       to       be    arrested at/or                    in the       ground.

So,    as       an    opinion,             fans        have       readily        exploited         the w e a k n e s s         and

H«^Kng          outlined             my    thoughts           on    events         prior       to 2 p m      (1 400),      I will       now

 eal       with       events          after        2pm       (1400).

By    this       time          the    grassed areas                 near        to K i l n e r    Way were          completely

full       of    youths          sa t      drinking.               My    lowest         estimate        of    number       would       be

500     in t h a t         area.           Again        generally           good        humoured and            really         only

required monitoring                          by P o l i c e .           Shortly         after    2pm(1400),              the    single

special          train arrived.                        My    feeling,           shared        to a man,         by m y     serial

was    that          these       supporters                 frankly       did      not     need a Poli ce             escort.          There

was    a    broad          range          of a g e s        and    their        conduct        would      not    have      gone       out

of    place          on a       church           outing.           However,         my     serial       and     one      other       were

detailed             to    escort          them        to    the    ground.             Th ey were        held      back       by

Mounted          the       first          outside           the    station           on the      p a v e m e n t , but    the        front

moved       off       l ast      as       th e    last       of    these        fans      came     down       the          station

entrance.

Therefore             the      ones        at     the       front       probably wait ed about                   five      minutes.

The    train,             I believe,              had       run    to    time     and     2.10pm(1410)              to 2 . 1 5pm

(1415)          they       left.

At    this       point         myself,           PC B r i c k l e y       *C*     C o m m u n i t y Liaison,             and PS

Kennedy,             my    serial          sergeant,              remained           on H a l i f a x     Road      by    the

station.              There          was    a     request          made    to        me by P S K e n n e d y               -    I do    not

know      if    he    had       been    instructed             to t h i s       or     not.      I can        recall          noticing

that      once       the    football          train fans             had    been        escorted away               that Ha li fax

Road      suddenly          seemed          rearjy devoid             of P o l i c e .         Two M o u n t e d men

remained.             From 2.15pm<1415)                   until       H . 5 0 p m < 14 50).          The      numbers          of    fans

heading         towards          Hillsborough             did     not      seem        to    diminish.

A t a ll       times       there       seemed       to    be a       steady          stream.

Coaches         were       off    loading          by the       station,             anywhere         they        c o u l d s t op.           I

advised         betwen          4-6    drivers       that       this       was       not      the    off      l o a di n g point

and    to m o v e         further       up H a l i f a x       Road.        The        attitude       of      the      fans     on       the

coach was            that       the    kick-off          was    nearly          upon        them and        they wanted              to

rush      to    the       ground       not    to m i s s       that.            O n e bus,      the       f a n s left       by a

rear      exit       door       while       I was    talking          to        the d r i v e r .

At S . 3 0 p m       (1430)       approximately                S Mounted             officers,        myself,            PC

Brickley         and PS Kennedy                started          to m o v e        on    the y o u t h       sat     near       Kilner

Way and         felt       that       whilst       they       d i d not         argue        about    g o i n g on,      as     you

would      expect          a group          outside       a    nightclub,              there        was    not a       rush     in

t h e m a n d all          moved       slowly       off       towards       the        ground,        leaving          a sea        of

discarded            empty       drink       containers.

Before         this       I can       recall       a number          of m e n        obviously            desperate           for    a

toilet         asking       us w h e r e      there       was    a    public           toilet.            I would        be

surprised            if    that       was    due    to    drinking          a     thermos        f la s k .       There        was       no

obvious         p lac e ,       out    of    sight       of a     police          offier       at    least,         to    go    to

urinate.

As my      serial          had    been       detailed          to m e a l       at     3pm    <1500)        at    Claywheels

L a ne,    myself,          PC    Brickley and PS Kennedy                            went     towards         there at 2 . 55p m

<14 5 5 ) .      E v e n at       this       point       there       were       still        fans    heading           for     the

ground.          Not       just       ones    or    twos       but    still          small     groups.            We     had

anticipated meeting                     up w i t h the          r est      of     our       serial,, w h o m we           f elt

would      leave          the    outside       of    the       ground       fo r       meal    shortly after                  kick-off.

Before         a n y of     us    could meal             we    received           the m e s s a g e       to a t t e n d       the

ground       and       did    so       immediately.                 The    3 of       us    jumped        in t h e       back       of

another        serial's               van and went             to    the       Leppings          Lane     turnstile.

I did       not     know      at       that    point       what       was       happening             inside      the       ground and

my    o b v i o u s jfrirst t h o u g h t s          was       crowd       trouble.

O n arrival,           at    the       ground       it w a s        frankly          impossible           to     find       out what

was    happening.                 Initially          I formed             p art      of a       cordon ou tsi de             t he    gates

on jfne c o r n e r          of       Leppings       Lane       itself          with       other       officers          there.            The

inten tio n was              to       allow    exit       but       not    entry.           That       only      l a s t e d a few

minutes        as      ambulances             began arriving                   and    then       the    fire      service.

Myself       and PC          Brickley          took       it    updn       oursleves             to    direct       ambulances               in

towards        the      road          running       around          the    r ear      of    the       ground.          By    this        t im e

Tl h a d    gathered          that          there    were       a number             of    injuries         from within              the

West       stand       and    I believed             at    that       time        casualties            were      coming          from       out

of    the    back       of    the       st and.

I did       not     know      the       scale       of w h a t       was       happening          inside         the     ground.             As

the    f ire      service             arrived       we    tried       to       'park'       them       so as      to     leave       the

entrance          clear.

As    fans     were         leaving          I can       remember          a number             being     abusive           towards          me

and ot h e r        officers.               However        this       conduct             was    that     born      out      of     fear

andfnot        through            loutish         behaviour.               It w a s        impossible            to a n s w e r      the

m^rty c o m m e n t s ,       including             "You've          killed my mates                   in t h e r e "        "This         is

     1 the     bloody Police's                    fault"            nor    was       it the       time      to    do     so.

  t was      really          only       when      I saw        the    group          of 8 - 1 0       bodies      laid on           the

ground,        behind makeshift                     screens,          that        I knew         the    scale       of      the

disaster          (although             the    first       time       I knew          the       final     numbers           was     some 3

hours       l a t er    via       a    local      radio        broadcast).

One    incident             outside         the     ground was             that       a group          of L i v e r p o o l       f an s

a p p r o a c h e d me,       and       indicating             a man       wearing          a yellow           press        jacket         told

down Vere          Road and          told       him     that      whatever             his    actions        had       b e e n my

advice       was       that    it h a d        obviously          incensed             some    fans a n d         he    should

consider          his    own    safety.              I left       h i m at        the     other       e n d of     V e r e R oa d .

I did       notice       people       on       that     road      opening             their    doors        to L i v e r p o o l      fans.

One    recollection             of    being outside                the       grou nd was            that     I felt

completely             useless.           I realised           that       there         was    a disaster              happening,

the    scale       of w h i c h      I learned             late r,      but       I received           no d i r e c t i o n as            to

anything          I could usefully                   do.     On    talking             with    other        members          of m y

serial       that       went    inside          the     ground,         I will          always        feel     that         I did     not

do    enough       on    that       day and          the    comments             made     in the       press       about

Policemen          stood       about       not       knowing       what          to    do w e r e     not    entirely             untrue.

It    seemed       that       the    radio        system       had      completely             gone     and       no    coherent

instructions             were       coming       ou t      over    the       radio.

I can       reca l l     a    fellow       officer          2910 Cammock                asking        for a       response           on

the    radio       from Contro l               about 3 pm         <1500)          and     receiving          no    reply          from

Control.           I appreciate                the    obvious          difficulties             the     Control             Room     had

and    I would          not    wish       these       comments          to       be    t a k e n as    criticism             of

t h em.      My    feelings          going        h ome     and    for       a    few     days w e r e       as    if       I h ad

been       to a v i o l e n t       pub    fight wit h            my    own       d ut y shift,         stood          on the        s ide

and    let     the      others       get       on w i t h    it.

A    few    f i n al    points.

1.                 I did       not    handle          any    bodies.

2.                 I have       no    comment           to m a k e      regarding             the     stewards,             the

incident          had a l r e a d y       happened          when       I a r r i v e d at       the     ground.

3.                 I have       worked          at S W F C     previously,               although           for    less       o ver

the    last 2 y e a r s         due       to    overtime          cuts.           On    previous        years          at    Semi-

Finals,        duties         have    varied          from     turnstiles               to P a r k s i d e     Road/Wadsley

Bridge       a r ea.

A    common       feature       of m y w o r k i n g         at SWFC             in the       past     is t h a t       we    very

rarely work             inside       t h e g r o u n d at         a ll,      and       usually        only     know         the

                 when    people     ask      for   directions            as    I am     u s u a l l y as   l o st as       they are

                 with Sheffield           never      having       worked        there.

                 Qne    comment     I feel         I must      m a ke,    pro bably again,              is t h a t    Police

                 feeling      I had      outside      Leppings           Lane    was     that      in the     circumstances           we

                 just   had    to   stand and         accept       it.

      GENERAL EXPENSES SUBHEAD

    ^p\s you know G1 Division manages the 'General Expenses’subhead.
      This is used to fund miscellaneous items of expenditure for the
      Fire Department. The total provision (for this financial year is
      £61,000.

      2. A bill in respect of the Hillsborough Inquiry has now
      substantially overcommitted this subhead to the extent that we
      are estimating an overspend of approximately £31,000.

      3. There is a possibility that we may obtain some help with
      Hillsborough but we will not know how much, or if any, until much
      later in the y e a r .

      4. We cannot, therefore, make available any further money from
      General Expenses other than the commitments already made. I
      attach a spreadsheet identifying those items and how much has
      been allocated.

      5. The position will be kept under review and we will let you
      know in due course if there is any change.

 NO,,

 Q‘
  33

 DO YOU HAVE ANY VIEWS OR OBSERVATIONS ON THE WAY THE INCIDENT WAS HANDLED,

 AFTER THE NATCH WAS STOPPED?

 I AT FIRST BELIEVED A PITCH INVASION WAS OCCURRING FROM PENS 3 & 4=         POLICE

 OFFICERS AT FIRST WERE PREVENTING FANS FROM CLIMBING OVER FENCE BUT ON

 REALISING WHAT WAS HAPPENING BEGAN TO PULL PEOPLE OUT ALONG WITH FANS ETC.

           FENCE WAS HAMPERING THE RESCUE ATTEMPTS.   THE EMERGENCY SERVICES SEEMED

 BE DOING THE BEST THEY COULD IN VERY DIFFICULT CIRCUMSTANCES.

 THE POLICE WERE BEING VERBALLY ABUSED AND SPAT AT BY LIVERPOOL FANS WHICH

 AGAIN MADE A DIFFICULT SITUATION EVEN MORE SO.

 054.

 IS THERE ANYTHING THAT YOU WISH TO ADD WHICH YOU FEEL IS VITAL TO THIS

 JUDICIAL INQUIRY?

 j,.       MORE INFORMATION GIVEN ON PA SYSTEM.   THIS WOULD HAVE STOPPED NOTTS

 R5REST FANS FROM CHANTING WHICH CAUSED LIVERPOOL FANS TO RUN LENGTH OF PITCH

 2.        ADEQUATE EMERGENCY MEDICAL EQUIPMENT AND RESCUE EQUIPMENT TO BE KEPT AT

 GROUND.

 3.        FRIENDS AND MYSELF WERE APPROACHED ON NUMEROUS OCCASIONS WHILST WALKING

 THE GROUND.        BY LIVERPOOL FANS WANTING TO BUY OUR TICKETS.   THIS LEADS ME TO

 BELIEVE THAT LARGE NUMBERS OF LIVERPOOL FANS WERE PRESENT WITHOUT TICKETS.

 IS THERE ANYTHING THAT YOU WISH TO ADD WHICH YOU FEEL IS VITAL TO THIS

 BE A MATTER OF TIME BEFORE WE SEE A RE-OCCURRENCE OF THE LUTON V MILLWALL

 MATCH.   WE HAVE GOT TO HAVE MORE ADEQUATE EXIT MEANS MY THOUGHTS ARE THAT THE

 CENTRE BARRIERS SHOULD BE REMOVED,   BUT STILL FENCING IN THE FANS ALONG ONE

 SECTION OF THE GROUND, SO YOU DO NOT GET THE MIDDLE CRUSH.

 DO YOU HAVE ANY VIEWS OR OBSERVATIONS ON THE WAY THE INCIDENT WAS H A N D L E D ,

 AFTER THE MATCH WAS STOPPED?

 OVERALL I THOUGHT THE INCIDENT WAS HANDLED P O O R L Y .                 NO CO ORDINATION OF

 MANPOWER.     VERY POOR.      COMMUNICATIONS.         HAD SOME ONE ANNOUNCED EARLIER THE

 SERIOUS NATURE OF         INCIDENT.   THEN I FEEL THE BAITING OF L'POOL SUPPORTERS BY

 FOREST SUPPORTERS WOULD HAVE CEASED.                  THIS WOULD HAVE MEANT THERE WOULD HAVE

 BEEN NO NEED TO PLACE CORDON ACROSS PITCH.                 AND FREED LARGE NUMBERS OF OFFICERS

 TO ASSIST INJURED.                                               ^               „

 (1) THERE WAS NO NEED AT ALL TO PLACE A CORDON OF POLICE DOGS ACROSS KOP END.
                   ^                       ... ■   i               - .........—       .................. .. .... .   ■ —

 THIS WAS IN MY OPINION A VERY PROVOCATIVE MOVE.                  THE FOREST SUPPORTERS WERE

 CAUSING NO TROUBLE.         THEY HAD CAUSED NONE AND DID NOT DESERVE TO BE TREATED IN

 T^tr MANNER.

 (2) THERE WAS NO APPEAL FOR MEDICAL AID FROM PEOPLE                        IN CROWD.

 (3)    IT WAS OBVIOUS TO ME AFTER TEN MINUTES THAT THE                     MATCH WAS                    OVER. WHY WASN'T

 IT ANNOUNCED THEN AND LET THE SUPPORTERS GET AWAY.                     I WITNESSED SEVERAL FEMALE

 FOREST SUPORTERS BECOME UPSET AND ALMOST HYSTERICAL AS DEAD BODIES WERE LINED

 UP IN FRONT OF THE KOP END.           IT WAS UNNECESSARY.            THEY SHOULD ALL HAVE BEEN

 ALLOWED OUT.          SEVERAL DID ATEMPT TO LEAVE         INCLUDING        FRIENDS OF MINE ONLY TO

 FIND EXIT GATES LOCKED.          HAD A MASS EXADOS TAKEN PLACE.                  THERE                 WOULD HAVE BEEN

 A DISASTER AT BOTH ENDS OF THE GROUND.

        LARGE NUMBERS OF L'POOL SUPPORTERS NOT INVOLVED IN THE DISASTER                                              IE. FROM

 THE SEATING AREA WERE LEFT TO CLIMB ONTO THE PITCH.                          NO ONE TRIED TO KEEP THEM

 OFF.       THEIR NUMBERS ONLY ADDED TO THE CONFUSION ON THE PITCH.

 NO ATTEMPTS WERE MADE TO SHEPHERD THE UNINJURED AWAY TO THE EXITS AGAIN

 ALLOWING CONFUSION TO REIGN.

 (5) THE      ’C O R D O N ’ PLACED ACROSS GROUND HAD MORE HOLES THAN A STRING VEST.                                          IT

 SHOULD EITHER HAVE BEEN DONE CORRECTLY OR REMOVED.

JUDICIAL. INQUIRY?

PROBABLY THE MOST APPALING PIECE OF CROWD HANDLING WAS THE WAY L'POOL

SUPPORTERS WERE ALLOWED TO CROWD INTO THE TWO CENTRE PENS,

WHEN I ENTERED THE GROUND JUST BEFORE 2 PH. THE TWO CENTRE PENS APPEARED FULL

AND CROWDED. WITH SURGES NOTICEABLE THEN.

THE TWO PENS AT EACH END WERE AS NEAR AS DAM IT EMPTY.      AND THEY REMAINED LIKE

 IT ALL AFTERNOON.

THERE APPEARED TO BE NO STEWARDING TAKING PLACE,

 I THINK THE WEMBLEY SYSTEM WILL HAVE TO BE TAKEN UP ON A LARGER SCALE

WERE THE TICKET CONTAINS A PEN NUMBER TO RESTRICT ENTRY.       IF SOMETHING OF THI

 l^Tl
   TURE I S N ’T IMPLIMENTED,   THIS WILL NOT BE THE LAST DISASTER OF THIS NATURE.

 IS       THERE ANYTHING THAT YOU WISH TO ADD WHICH YOU FEEL IS VITAL TO THIS

 J0ICIAL       INQUIRY?

 STADIUMS OUGHT TO BE MOVED OUT OF THE CITY AREAS AND PURPOSE BUILT WITH

 ADEQUATE PARKING AND ACCESS ROUTES.            I FEEL THAT A SITE SUCH AS THE NATIONAL

 EXHIBITION CENTRE WOULD BE IDEAL.           I THINK THERE SHOULD BE STRICTER

 CONTROLS ON UNRULY FANS.

                                     At    this      time        there       were       mounted           officers,          but       I cannot

                                     say what          number.           The       scene        outside          looked          calm

    A                                several         police        officers             under        the       direction          of    Insp.          Sykes

                                     minutes         there        was    a     call       from Police             Control          for    all

                                     from     the      terraces.              It       seemed        s t ill     to    be    a    pitch       invasion

                                     during        which         several          fans        had    sustained          inj u r y .       I went             to

responsiveness.                  When        they       recovered              1 directed            them       to    the

perimeter          track        to     sit    down,          so    t h a t we        could       get      a better

picture         of w h a t      was     happening.                 There         was       so m u c h     confusion.

1 was      to    the      r i g ht     of    the       goal       looking           towards         Leppings

Lane      I could         not     see       much       of w h a t       was      happening           on    the       other

side.        Too       many      people were              rushing           about          several        fans       and

police       officers            started          to    break          the a d v e r t i s i n g        boards

and      using     t h e m as        stretchers.                  They      were       brilliant.               One

middle       aged       man a pproached                 me a n d        stated         he w a s      a Charge

Nurse,       offering            his    services.                 I d i rect e d h i m to               several

people       lying        on the        fie ld.

I approached              one     youth          lying       on    the      field.            His    eyes       were

rolled       into       the      " b a ck    of    his       head"        and       he was        foaming        at

the      mouth.         I spoke         to       him    to a s c e r t a i n          if    he was        OK.

He    said      "Fuck       off,       le a v e    me     alone,          I'm a l r i g h t . "           He

smelled         strongly          of    dri n k .         1 advised              him       regarding           his

position          so    that      he    could          breath          properly.

Following          this       the      Notts       Forest          f a ns      at     the     Spion       end    of

the      ground        started         jeering          at       the    Liverpool             fans      and     this

angered         them and          several          Liverpool              fans        charged        towards          the

K o p.     I gave         c h ase      and       grabbed          hold      of      two     youths        shaking

them      and    saying          "What's          it    going          to a c h i e v e ,        there     are

people       dying."             Fortunately              they         listened            and    returned           to

help      those        injured.

We    were      then      ordered           to    form       a    cordon         on    the       halfway        line.

After      being        there        for     approximately                  two       minutes        it    became

           could       render        assistance.             We    approached        one     man       l y ing     on

           his    back,        it was        obvious        that    he was        dead.      All          — coyuLd

              This       is the     recollection             of a terrible              disaster w i t n e s s e d       by myself,

               I am used to the                feelings        of the         crowd and        consider myself             to be

with    g round e x c l u s i o n          orders.         I was     involved with           the arrest           of a

the use         of Still       P h o t o g r a p h y and Video          equipment        resulted        in the

arrest      of other           offenders.

At 9.45am,          Saturday           15 April         1989,     t o g ether with other            officers,           I

reported         for    duty at H i l l s b o r o u g h Football               S t a d i u m for    the FA        cup

T^emi    final       betw e e n Liverpool               arid N o t t i n g h a m Forest Football              Clubs.

The     briefing        for     that        fixture was         held     in the North S tand             of    the

Ground.          Chief       Superintendent               DuckenfieId          officiated.

At    11.30am,         the     same       date,     I took      up my usual         station on the

perimeter           track at Gate 3 on the S p i o n Kop with Police S e r geant

C h a p m a n and      I n spector          Darling       in command.          Both these          officers         have

duties       in the        players          tunnel      and    from this        time    I had no further

contact w ith           them.

At a p p r o x i m a t e l y    12.00 noon a small                  number      of N o t t i n g h a m Forest

s u pporters         took      up    positions          on the S p i o n Kop and stood                in small

groups.          The a t m o s p h e r e       from these         supp o r t e r s was     excellent.

By    1.30pm,        the     same      date,       more    supporters          had entered         the Kop and

w ere    enjoying          the a t m o s p h e r e      of the a n t i c i p a t e d    football       match.           1

then,      as    p r e v i o u s l y arranged,            o b t a i n e d a meal     from the West Y o r kshire

Mo b i l e C a n t e e n w h i c h was           situated a d j a c e n t       to the east wall              of the

Gymnasium           behind      the North Stand.                  The meal       was    consumed       in the

Gymnasium.             After        finishing my meal               I returned to my a l l o c a t e d duty

at Gate 3 on the S p i o n Kop of the                           stadium.         1 i m m e d i a t e l y became

aware      that      the     number         of supporters           on the S pion Kop end of                  the

ground had           inc r e a s e d and         that     the a t m o s p h e r e was     of an electrical                  and

carnival         nature.            T h r o u g h the     fencing      I conversed with older

appearance         and was          myself     enjoying         the    f r i endly atmosphere.

At a p p r o x i m a t e l y        1 .50pm the same           date asituation arose w h i c h               caused

me some       concern.                I was at my gate and was a p p r o a c h e d                 by a number of

L i verpool       supporters           who a t t e m p t e d    to expl a i n that          they were

frightened           because        they had been           placed         in the wrong        end of      the

stadium.             I ins p e c t e d      their      ticket    stubs and was             surprised       to

discover        that     the        tickets    were      for    that       end of the       ground.        I then,

by radio,         con t a c t e d Police G r o u n d Control                 and was       informed      that      in no

way were        the Li v e r p o o l        s u pporters       to be escorted             to the L e p pings Lane

end of the           ground         because     the      tickets      sold for that           location were             to

the    lawful        limit.          I was    instructed         that an overspill               area had been

allocated         to these            sup po r t e r s    due    to the problem on the S p i o n Hop in

a quadrant           are a     to     the     left and a d j a c e n t to the N o r t h e r n Stand.                I

looked       towards         this     area and saw that 2                  lines    of    police    officers were

in a t t e n d a n c e    in        this area, s e g r e g a t i n g the opposing              supporters.              All

persons at Gate 3 were                      told    to q u i e t l y make their way              to this area

where      they w o u l d       be a l l o c a t e d     standing      space.

This a c t i o n or          i n s t r u c t i o n was    repeated         on at    least     10 occasions          to

Liverpool         Supporters           and from o b s e r v a t i o n s          in the area       of the

oversp ill        area,        I saw no       crowd       behaviour         problems.

At 2. 1 5 p m the         same        date     I was      a p p r o a c h e d by a man whom         I now know          to

be

L iverpool,          who m     I a g a i n d i r e c t e d towards          the overspill          area.         He was

in an exci t e d state                and on       leaving me         traverse       the    lower     terraces

shouting Liv e r p o o l             chants and d i s p l a y i n g a Liverpool                banner.           I took

this as        not     only     stupid       but    d o w nright      dangerous          and ente r e d my gate

to a p p r e h a n d     him.        This    I did with the            help of Chief           Inspector Beal

near     to the        o v erspill       area and after            documentation,                          *>as

ejected        from the F o o tball             S t a d i u m under        the    ground    regulations.            I

must at this             point       request       the    reader      to    remember       the J n c i d e n t
                                                                           PAGE

described.    From this man, I was told that he had attended at the

ground with no ticket and had in fact purchased his ticket outside

the turnstiles in Leppings Lane for the sum of £25 and that he had

expected to be taken to the enclosure containing the Liverpool

supporters after entering the Nottingham Forest enclosure.     This

information about the ticket tout was immediately passed to Ground

Control.     I then returned to my duty position and observed that there

was a holiday atmosphere with inflatable trees, bananas and other

toys being flaunted.     I, at this time was enjoying the atmosphere and

saw no problems whatsoever.     In fact it was a pleasure to be in that

location.    To keep themselves amused, prior to the start of the game,

the fans were knocking a beach ball along the length of the Spion Kop

and eventually it cleared the security fencing and landed between the

advertising hoardings and the goal post netting.     I, contrary to the

proper ways of behaviour for a Police Officer on duties such as

these, picked the ball up and placed it through my gate into the

Spion Kop.    An immediate cheer went up and the game continued.      I

will repeat that the atmosphere was of a holiday nature and I must

admit I was enjoying the duty.

At 3.00 pm the match started and due to the roar of the    crowd and to

the fact that I had not been issued with a radio earpiece, I could

not hear any radio transmissions.    I sat on my foldable seat and

could hear garbled messages which to me was indistinguishable.       No

problems of any nature were felt from my location.     From my position
                                                                                                              PAGE
                                                                                                              R416

I could see             the L e p p i n g s Lane      end of the          ground and        it seemed         that

after Peter             Beardsley      had n a r r o w l y m i s s e d a goal          by glancing        the

crossbar         that L i v e r p o o l    s u pporters        had spilled out           onto     the    playing

area.       Although          I could hear my              radio    transmitting,           I could not

u n d e r s t a n d an y m e s s a g e s   and thought,            as did the N o t t i n g h a m Forest

supporters,             that Liverpool,           s u pporters      had    invaded the         playing

surface.           The     play was        stopped and as           previously         instructed,        when on

the    preimeter           track,    all      officers       stand     in view of the             crowd and face

them.       This        is to m o n i t o r    the    tens i o n and       to attempt        to see where

trouble might              occur.      Fro m      being a h o l i d a y atmos p h e r e        on the Spion

Kop,     the s u p p o r t e r s    became angry,            jeering,       swearing and           booing      to

show their          descent        at what was         taking       place.         On glancing       towards         the

Le p p i n g s    Lane     end of the Stadium,               X could see           people    laid on      the

ground,          people     climbing        the     security       fences a s s i s t e d    by    police

officers          and    other     s u pporters       being     pulled       into the       seated area w hich

overlooked          the     terraced        standing        area    on that        end of the       ground.          I

gl a n c i n g    back     towards     the Kop        saw man y       police       officers       descending         the

aisles      towards         my gate.          Due    to the     noise      of the      crowd      I had not

heard any          instruction         on my        radio.      The    officers were           let onto        the

playing          surface      via my gate and              I was    shor t l y joined        by Chief

Inspector Beal              who    I thought         had taken        control       of the     situation.            He,

having      to shout,            told me that         I must w a t c h the Kop            because       myself,          PC

G r o o m and PC Holmes             were      the    only officers          between the           thousands         of

N o t t i n g h a m Fo r e s t    supporters         and    the Liverpool           supporters.          I,    to

say the          least,     was    f r i g h t e n e d and had a stupid             thought.        I was

thinking,          for     christ    sake will         someone        please       throw the       beach ball

in the air          to     relieve     the a g g r e s i v e    tens i o n of the N o t t i n g h a m

unfolded.            I then       became aware              that     a vast       number        of officers         had

joined the Kop serial                       from what        I believe were               outside       the   ground

and    I was        very     relieved.             The a t m o s p h e r e    was w o rsening           and nearly

mouth.        He was         chased         back     by a police           officer and a p p r e h e n d e d

inside       the Liv e r p o o l        half       of the      field.         This a p p r e h e n s i o n     relieved

somewhat           the    tens i o n    of the Kop and a gain a cheer went                              up.     A

repeat ed          the    same    manoeuvre           but    for     some     reason this was             laughed

at    by the Forest              supporters.

May     I say that,             time at this             stage       time had no meaning              but     I was

This man was              the    sup p o r t e r     I had earlier            ejected from the

Stadium.            Although        concentrating              on the        crowd     in front         of me',      I

did see an A m b u l a n c e            drive        onto    the     playing        surface       and then

became       aware        that    Liverpool           supp o r t e r s were         breaking       up

advertisement               h o a r d i n g s at     the L e p p i n g s     Lane    end of the          ground

and were           g r a d u a l l y moving        towards      the S p i o n Kop.              A number,       well

over     100,       ran the        full      length of the            playing        surface and          I recall

t h i nking        that     they were         breaking         the    hoardings           to use as stretchers.

I informed a press                  camer a - m a n       to move      his      expensive         equ i p m e n t which

was    placed behind               the hoarding at my                 location.            By this       time       the

N o t t i n g h a m Fo r e s t     suppo r t e r s       had become more             calm and         when the        first

of the       casualties            were      being       carried       off     via the      ramp      they clapped.

The    running           supp o r t e r s    by this        time     had     reached our          location and were

obviously           in a state          of shock and             began kicking             f r e n z i e d l y at    the

because      of the       s i t u a t i o n and because          in all        p robability           they would

be used as w e a p o n s         against        us.      Phis we       did and hid           them behind the

N o r t h S tand at       the    rear of the gar d e n e r s             hut.       Once     in this area,                the

scene was       horrendous            wit h    injured and        dead       persons       everywhere.

Although      not    ordered          to help,         I could not         leave      this     area and offered

my    limited    first aid            experiences.

To be quite         honest,          the   period of time             behind that N o r t h S t a n d               is a

blur w hich      I want         to    forget      but    1 can     recall       placing        people        in

vi r i o u s states       of    injury        i n ir.e r t a i n p 1 a c e s , m oving     coughing,          shoe k e d

boys out of way,               against        the G y m n a s i u m and around           the     prison       bus.

Heart mass a g e       and      the    kiss      of    life,    all    to no avail,            and still            the

dead and      injured          kept    coming.          Supporters         were     copying          my ac t i o n and

asking     "are we        doing       it   right".         I kept, shouting             "5 pushes,           one

breath."        Many      officers         were       behind    that     stand and all               were    in no

contact wit h each              other.         I remember        seeing        Inspector        Harvey        in the

same s i t u a t i o n as myself,              also     the St.       J o h n ’s A m b u l a n c e    Personnel.

The    panic and       upset were             u n i m a g i n a b l e and many e x p e r i e n c e d officers

were     in a state        of shock.            Some o n e     whom     I do not        know shouted,               "put,

the dead      in the G y m n a s i u m . "            Attempts    were made           to t r ansport          dead

persons      into    that       hall.         I recall       a young       boy being         carried         by a

supporter w h o m         looked       in a daze.

I p e rs onally was            kicked and         punched whi l s t attem p t i n g             to     resuscitate

believe      that    the v i o lence           offe r e d to me was            only to gain my

attention.          The    situation           became     so bad        that     1 attempted           to

resuscitate         dead       persons myself            just    to appease           the s u p p o r t e r s       who

had    carried      them       in.     The     casualty was           a l r e a d y dead but          the    fans

wa-    te-nding to       s y o u t h who            was bre a t h i n g       s p a s m o d i c a l l y and await i n g

the a t t e n t i o n of a m b u l a n c e personnel.                 I knelt          by her      side to ask

what     he was     like and            suddenly became aware                   that    1 was      getting wet.

We.    all     in that       location were              getting        wet.      Some     in the     stands above us

was      urinating a g a i n s t a c o rrugated wall                    and this was            running      over    us

a nd     the    dead.       M a n y words       of abuse were           said by police             officers at

the scene and,           what        I could describe                 as a waterfall,            stopped.

It is very dif f i c u l t              to express        my feelings and               I feel      very emotional

at     this    stage    of this          report a l t h o u g h        I am norma l l y quite            lucid and

factual        about    the       circu m s t a n c e s    of d e s c r i b e d events.            T h e y may or may

not     be    in order       as    they are        only      r e c o llections         of s o mething w h i c h         I

want     to f o r g e t .     For       thi s I a p o 1og i s e .

I was aware          that     s c u ffles       had broken out and was                    glad     to see a cordon

of     pali re officers            at    the    east      end    of the N orth Stand               and that

Ain bill an ce and Fire            Personnel          were      now    in attendance.

I will        repeat,       time     had    no meaning           and    even      I was     becoming

emotionally         upset         and    in fear        of my own safety.                 I will     be honest,             .C

did not        think    I was        going      to get awa y           from that        location alive,            such

was      the    panic and a n i m o s i t y         of the suppo r t e r s          who were       transporting,

by this         time, dead         bodies         I heard a scream for a driver                       to take a

badly        injured    to hospital             and     I ran for an a m bulance                 door.      At   the

door,        Sergeant Hardy             told me to keep going and that                         he w ould drive              the

vehicle.         This    he did and             I then was a p p r o a c h e d          by someone who           said

he was a doctor.                  He asked me who was                  in charge.           1 was a b s o l u t e l y

stunned        by his       remark       in the mayhem.                I am afraid          that    I was     rude and

told him,         "anyone yo u           can see."           I then      told him,          'walking woun d e d

at this       time    shaking,        sweating         and totally exhausted.                   I couldn't

stand still.             On my way           back    to the area where            the    dead and dying

were    I saw a y o u t h who            I reco g n i s e d as a Special             Cosntable.           He had

and    I must      admit       that      in a kind of          panic.          I grabbed him by the sirt

front and          lifted him         into the         police room where         a blanket        was    placed

around     him.       Together        with PC Hulley,              we    pulled and        carried him to an

a mb u l a n c e and again         left       him    in the    care      of amb u l a n c e    personnel.          All

the    time      I was    sc r e a m i n g    "breathe,       keep      breathing".           Dead were still

being    brought         to the      rear      of the    stand       but thank. God the             carriers

knew that         they were        dead and a l t h o u g h        they were        shocked and          irate,       1 at

this    stage      felt as        though       I was    calming         down and      regaining         some

control       myself.

P r o blems      arose    w ith    the       lack of    space at         the    entrance       to the G y m n a s i u m

door and suppo r t e r s           tempers a g a i n got           frayed.        I can only descibe

t'nat trying          tc get      a body on a s t retcher with 2 0                    people      carrying        the

stretcher         caused m a y h e m and a gain              I felt      fear    for my own safety.                In

my ex h a u s t e d    state      it was all          I could do         but    to help       carry the        dead

inside     the     building.           The     number    of bodies          in s ide was— ho r rendous            and
                                                                           PAGE 10
                                                                           R416

although we know that there were a lot of dead, that sight will haunt

me for the rest of my life.     Interscaped with the carrying of the

dead, first aid was given to the other injured and I gave cigarettes

to deeply affected and shocked supporters and helpers who were sat in

disbelief.     I, by this time was in need of a drink of water and as I

obtained this water which was situated by the side of the prisonxS J5;X        y

saw that the juvenile contingent of the St. Johns Ambulance Brigade

had been placed inside that bus for their own safety.     I was glad

they were there but to mar this, a dead person, covered, was directly

by the door.     I felt upset and deeply regretted that the children had

to see this carnage.    Eventually, and at what time God only knows,

the support services gained control and the total panic of the

situation subsided.    I wanted to throw away my uniform and run away.

I was totally exhausted, although I could not stand still.     When the

last of what I would describe as the walking wounded left by

ambulance, I walked down the ramp towards the playing area and wept a

tear of relief that all the crowd had gone home.    It is hard for me to

admit that whilst the disaster was taking place, I felt fear for myself

and guilt at feeling this fear and to see no crowd was, in some way, a

selfish relief.    I then went into the Gymnasium, not because I wanted

to but to keep busy, possibly helping with identification of someone

but things were in the charge of the major incident group and rather

than pester anyone there, I went outside.    The sight in there was

horrendous.

People, by this time, were asking about persons they had come with

and a table was set up in the North Stand where a long queue had

formed.   This point was manned and we were then told that anyone who
                                                                           PAGE 11
                                                                           R416



 had nothing to do was to sit in the North Stand.

 Some kind of de-briefing took place and myself, together with other

 officers were stood down from the ground and were told to go to

 Niagara Sports Club.    This we did and although I was to be on duty
                             V
 from that time and until     1.00 am the following morning I had 2 stiff

 drinks.     Although these drinks relaxed me somewhat, I sat outside on

 the wall adjacent to the entrance steps and tried to reflect and admit

 just what had happened.     This was impossible so I made a telephone

 message to my daughter to the effect that I wanted her to bring my

 vehicle to Niagara from where I had left it at her boyfriend's home.

, This she did and on her arrival she enquired as to whether I had

 telephoned home.     I had not and felt again guilty and tearful for not

 doing so.

 Whilst sat there, a Liverpool supporter of about 18 years came up to

 us and asked how to get to Colley Road Catholic School where his

 party had left their transport.     I tried to explain the quickest way

 to walk and finally told my daughter and her boyfriend to take him

  there.   This they did and I sat on my own very quiet and taking stock

 of things.

 During this period I was joined by PC Groome and was spoken to by

 Inspector Sykes and Superintendent Greenway.     I could not face going

  inside the Club because I did not want to hear anything about what

 had happened.     I did after some time and on the return of my

 daughter, I continued my tour of duty until 1.00 am with PC Groome

 but in all honesty, I cannot recall what duties I performed.

 This is a true and accurate account of what I recall and I sign it so.

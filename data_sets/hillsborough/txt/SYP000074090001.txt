           At this       location I searched numerous fXns entering the ground.                            I

           removed several            cans of beer from fams from Liverpool who were walking

           Kop were advised to stand to the right of the Kop in the sterile area.

           do so.  Men who were being crushed were waving money at the cashiers

           to let them in.                The man at the front of the queue was shouting                   in

           pain as his legs were                crushed.          I saw a mounted officer outside the

           ground by the turnstile and a W P C .                         They were ordering the fans to

           queue orderly.

            verbal           exchanges              with       the       Liverpool             fans       stood       on       the    Kop.

            Liverpool               fans       were       ripping           the      hoardings             from       in       front       of    the       Kop       and

police         dogs       and     handlers             trying          to     control           them.

Several          more       fans       were       carried            o v er      to    the     area        of     the    pitch        in f r o n t

hoardings             were       removed          by     the       fans       to      be    u s e d as        stretchers.

Penistone             Road       was       at a s t a n d s t i l l         and a          fleet      of        ambulances          were

E5a c k on       the      pitch        I      saw a     large         number          of      officers           forming        a cor cion

At    one      stage        I saw wh at             appeared             to      be a       afcirrriish on             the    p i t c h at    the

ground         in a n       orderly           fashion.

I then         resumed           duties          with       my     original            serial         on P e n i s t o n e      Road     by    the

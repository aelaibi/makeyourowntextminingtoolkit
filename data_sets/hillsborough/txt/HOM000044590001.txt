DRAFT PRESS RELEASE FOR PUBLICATION OF HILLSBOROUGH
REPORT

Mr Howarth has discussed with you the draft press release for the publication
of the Hillsborough report. His comments are as follows:


Fourth Paragraph - main conclusions of the report


1st Bull Point      Replace ‘there is’ with ‘the conclusions of the Taylor
                    Inquiry are still valid and there is therefore no basis for a
                    further public inquiry

3rd Bull Point      Replace ‘nor is there any material which should’ with
                    ‘Unfortunately there is no new material which could’

4th Bull Point      Delete whole paragraph


Final Paragraph


Replace whole quote (“We must at some Point...to draw that line”) with:

“I well understand that those who so tragically lost family and friends in this
disaster will feel disappointed at these conclusions. Their feeling that no
individual or organisation has been held to account for what happened is both
understandable and normal. However, the Taylor report did make a difference
and our response to police discipline and the future conduct of Coroner’s
Inquests should mean that in future police officers will not be able to evade
disciplinary action and that more appropriate proceedings will be available if,
God forbid, anything similar were ever to happen”.

2.     Mr Howarth has also commented that it would be better to have the
section of the press release relating to police disciplinary system and
coroner’s inquests (“Adding that the report...causes of the disaster”) earlier on
in the press release as it emphasises the positive measures that have been
taken in response to the criticisms that have been made as a result of the
handling of the disaster.

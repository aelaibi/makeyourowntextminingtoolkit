In     respect        of m y        duties,              as    I had      carried          out      these    duties        before          and

commenced            pat ro l       shortly              after      11.00am         < 1100).          As PC        3144    Robinson-

junction,             in h i g h       spirits          but     no    disorder          was    apparent.               The    numbers

at    t hi s     stage          outside       the       public        house     numbered approx.                   100.

A    general          patrol          was    made       in the        area    and       no    public        order       situations

At    about         1 .30pm       (1330)          a further           check     was       made      at    the     Horse       and

approx.          300       drinking          outside          the     public       hou s e,        the    majority           were

young         single        men       and    noise       levels        had    escalated.                 There     were       no    signs

of    disorder             but    many       looked       to     be    drinking           very      heavily,           this     was

accompanied                by    the    usual          boisterous           singing          and    chanting.

At    this       stage          match       control       was        informed        of      the    numbers        and.

Other         fans     were       still       walking           up W a d s l e y     Lane      towards          the     public

sheer      drunkeness,                they        began       to       urinate          in     local         residents            gardens,

the      situation          seemed           to    be    getting             out       of    hand,       but       1 must         stress

there      was       no    violence            or a n i m o s i t y          directed             towards          th e     Police        or a n y

towards         the       ground.

At    S,13pm         (1415)       I was           joined          by a n o t h e r          Tango       Mobile,           with Police

Se r g e a nt Jo h n %a n         in      c ha rg e.

Together         we       entered         the      public          house          and       the L a n d l o r d         was     advised           to

close      the       bar,      this       he      agreed          to    do     but      from       his       reactions            that      was

imminent         anyway          as     he     had      sold       out       of    beer.

The      fans    were       moved        away        in g r o u p s          towards           the      ground          and     s o me    were

advised         that       their        d r u n k e ness w o u l d             deny         them       access       to      the    gr o un d.

Match      control          was       advised           of    the       actions             taken       and    that         a p p r o x . 400

p lus     fans       were      being         directed             to    th e      ground,          many       under         the    influence

At    a p p r o x i m a t e i y S . 4 3 pm         (1443)          1 directed                our       serial       to      t r av e l

towards         the       Lappings           Lane       area and             to    escort          the       remaining            fans      to

t ha t    a r ea.

On arrival            in L e p p i ngs L a n e               we    were        met      by     the      s i ght     of      thousands             of

f a ns    outside          the    turnstiles,                 I could             see       Superintendent                  Marshall

stood      on    the       parapet           of    the       bridge          by    the       s id e     of    the       turnstiles,               he

was      requesting            t ha t    the       gates          be    opened          as     there         was    a     large        crush

outside         the       turnstiles              and    that          there       was       a danger          of       people         b e in g

killed       in the         cru sh .           I could            not    see       any       officers          other          than       two

Mounted         officers          who        were       trying          to     get      so me      orde r.          It      seemed        to me

an    impossible            ta sk,       the       f a ns     were       in       no    s o rt     of    o rd e r ,       all     crushing

towards           the     turnstiles,                farts w e r e       climbing        over       the w a l l s .           Radio

traffic           wa s    heavy       and       at    times        I was       unable        to    hear       due    to     the       n o is e

levels        of       the    crowd.            As    Superintendent               Marshall             repeated          his

requests            for      the     gates       to     be    opened       I heard           m at c h control             give        the

order        f or      the    gates        to    foe o p e n e d .

In v i e w        of     this      t he    gates        were       opened       and     the       crowd       rushed        in en

b lo c k .        My     serial       were       debussed           and    initially              tried       to    prevent           a ny

non     ticket           holders          entering           the    ground.

Within        a     few      moments           I heard        a    radio       message        that       the       fans     were

in vading           the      p itch       and    for       all     o f f i c e r s to    enter          the    grou n d .         My

serial        were        immediately                directed            onto    the pitch          at    the       Leppi ng s Lane

end     of    the        ground,           where        1 could see             m a n y fans       on    the       pitch      and many

trying        to       get    over          the      barriers.            At    this stage          I believed              that a

encourage              fans     to    leave          the     playing       area,        but       from    their          reactions

and     the       fact       that     many        seemed          injured        I feared          that       there       were

Superintendent                  Mesbit,

After        a few        minutes          I began           to    see    people        being        carried away                on

s t r e t c h e r s , fa ns          were       pulling           hoardings        from       the       perimeter           track          to

u s©   as     stretchers,                 to    carry what            1 thought          were        injured         f an s      away..

I then a s sisted several                            young        men who       were     having          difficulty              standing

and     breathing             many        were       just     collapsing           on the          pitch,          I w a s n ’t sure

what       had      happened.              Other        youths        wer e s h o u t i n g        o b s c e n i t i es     at    me

calling           me     a murdering             bastard           and    telling        me       it wa s      the       P o l i c e ’s

f au l t ,    cameramen and                    photographers              from     the       media       were       being

threatened               with      violence,            one       youth    tried        to    p u n c h me         but    was     stopped

    by his      friends         who    said       it w a s n ' t     my    f au l t .        I saw    officers             crying

    and    distressed.            Even       at    t hi s     stage       I did       not     realise          the    scale        of

    events.

    I    s a w one    officer         giving        the     kiss     of    life       to a y o u n g       b o y who        ha d

    apparently         stopped         breathing,             the    officer          carried        on    for       some    time,        I

    tried     to     comfort      two       of    his      friends,        and       ascertained           the       young    boy' s

    name,     1 saw       him    being       taken away             on a       stretcher.            1 then          saw    that

    there     were     dozens         of    people         being     taken away              on the       makeshift

    stretchers,           it w a s     then       t h at    1 thought           that     a few       people          may    ha ve       died

    I    remained      for      the m o s t       part      in the        cordon        of    officers          across       the

    pitch     until       it w a s     cl ea r.         I was       then       given     the    order          to    resume       my

    Tango     3 duties.           On       leaving         the    back     of L a p p i n g s     Lane         sta nd ,     X saw

    Inspector        Sykes       and       DC F ont,        I went        to    them and asked                 what    had

    happened,        as    I was       speaking            I saw     some       dosen Liverpool                 supporters

    behi nd a bar r ier           erected          to      screrte      1 hem    f rom view,          they were             a11

    d ead.      I couldn't            believe        t h at      many     were       dead.,    I was       then       told    that

    the re w e r e     almost         eighty       dead       bodies       in    the     gymnasium.                 I was    stunned,

    and    c o u l d n ’t b e l i e v e     what     wa s     said.        I have        little       recollection                 of

    what     I did     after      that       because          my mind          was    in t u r m o i l .        I can       remember

    being     repeatedly          called          a murdering             bastard        by    fans       as    they       left.

    We    remained        on    patrol       until         the    crowds        had     disappeared             and    at    9,30pm

    (2130)      I retired         from       duty.

A number of BR sponsored trains have been arranged and it is
expected that they will be full. It is anticipated that
supporters will also travel by service trains into Midland

On both the inward and outward movements the special train

ground by the South Yorkshire Police.

Nottingham supporters and Liverpool supporters at Midland

special trains from Nottingham and the supporters will leave
by the North gate to buses which will be standing in Sheaf
Street. The entrance/exit ticket barrier will be cordoned off
and Liverpool supporters w.111 be channelled via the South
                                                                ft
Luggage entrance to buses which will be standing on the       I
Station approach road and leave via Cross Turner Street.      1

FA CUP - SEMI FINAL



Liverpool FC v. Nottingham Forest at Hillsborough,            Sheffield.



On Saturday 15th April       1989 the Semi Final   of the FA Cup will be

played between Liverpool FC and Nottingham Forrest.             The kick-off

time   is 1500 hours and a capacity crowd of 54,000 is expected.



In the event of a draw at the end of full time,         thirty minutes of

extra time will    be played.



A number of BR sponsored trains have been arranged and it is expected

that they will    be full.     It is anticipated that supporters will also

travel   by service trains     into Midland Station,   Sheffield.



On both the inward and outward movements         the special train from

Liverpool will    use Wadsley Bridge Station and the trains from

Nottingham will    use Midland Station.       The Liverpool    supporters at

Wadsley Bridge will    be walked to and from the ground by the South

Yorkshire Police.



Nottingham supporters and Liverpool         supporters at Midland Station

will   be segregated and bused to and from the ground under the

supervision of South Yorkshire Police.



'A'

Platform 1 at Midland Station will be used to deal with special

trains from Nottingham and the supporters will         leave by the North

gate to buses which will      be standing    in Sheaf Street.     The entrance/

exit ticket barrier will be cordoned off and Liverpool            supporters
                                                                         PAGE

will    be channelied via the South Luggage entrance to buses which will

be standing on the Station approach road and leave via Cross Turner

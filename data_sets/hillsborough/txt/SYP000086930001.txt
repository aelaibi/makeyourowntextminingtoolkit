               fashion.



               Whilst        supporters               were    entering           the    ground       although         it w a s     obvious

               personally            saw       no     signs       of a l c o h o l     abuse.




               After        the     start        of    the    football           match,      my    duty was        then      somewhere          in

               the      bottom       of    the        West    Stand,        but       in all      honesty        I cannot        remember

               exactly        where,           although           I do    recollect          that     I did      not    see      any    evidenc

               of    people         being        drunk       or    signs        of    crushing       or    danger      to a n y       pe rson.




               After        the     football           match       had    ended my          duty was        to   escort       supporters             t

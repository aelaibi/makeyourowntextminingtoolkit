    Attending a meeting at FA Headquarters at Lancaster Gate

                               )   F. A.


                  wished to be reassured about his position and that

    of the FA in relation to their responsibility for the

    Hillsborough Football disaster                informed.                that

    there were no pending claims for the FA arising out of the

    facts furthermore there was nothing which          -       ‘         might

    say on the facts which would alter this position.              The

    Police might say at the hearing that both the Club and the


X   Police were equally responsible for the disaster.

    Counsel for Sheffield Wednesday
                                                                   The

                                                              ill wish to

    maintain the balance of responsibility which was the result

    of the Taylor report. <          went on to assert that the QC for

    the Police will want to change that position at the trial.

    If       \     ■    statement is believed at the trial it would

    be bad news for Sheffield Wednesday.              was surprised that

         -       'did not make more out of                    statement at

    the inquiry.       The task of Sheffield Wednesday's solicitors
    would be to work out how best to sustainj

    version of the events in particular that the conversation of

    twenty-to-three did not take place and that if it did it did

    not take place in the way that •                     had suggested.



                 isserted that the main point was that at 2.40 on

    the relevant afternoon Mr Kirtcwr asked                    -’1 after a

    discussion concerning the numbers in the crowd and the size

    of the crowd outside the ground whether the Police were


*   going to postpone the match.

    they were not.
                                           In reply .

                         This conversation indicated that

    knew exactly what the position was with the Police.
                                                                   said that




                 asserted that        ‘            would attempt to show

    that Mr Kirton, had some motive for making the story up ie

    that           / had lied about the conversation ever taking

    place.   His motive      for doing this would be in order to

    protect the FA               __   in particular would probably

    question ■    s' ‘     about his phone call to ■ ■ ■'           '     on

    the Monday after the disaster.              During this phone call

t            : had asked                        whether he had heard whether

    anybody in the FA in a responsible position had been asked

    if the match should be postponed.                        said that the

    reason behind the call was that a rumour had been circulated

    that was not in the interests of the Football Association ie

    that they had indeed been consulted at that time and he

    wished to know whether                        had heard the rumour.

    The question that i      ■ .
                               ■ would want to as!                  1 1 at

the hearing next week was why had he not mentioned that he

was going to make a statement about the conversation between

himself and                  t twenty-to-three on the day of the

disaster at the same time as he broached the other matter on

the telephone.           '    asserted that the reason that he

had not brought the matter up during the telephone call was

that he had not wished to worry                   about the matter

at the time.     Confirmation for this version of events he

asserted could be found with             ‘    who he had

telephoned immediately before the telephone call to

               to check with her whether he should broach this

matter to -         ■'*«; ' ' Furthermore ftSW&iiHftiad not

originally attached any great weight to the conversation

that took place between himself and                   at

twenty-to-three on the day of the disaster and he asserted

it was only when that conversation was mentioned that it

struck him that it would be of some significance.          He also

asserted that the conversation took place in a very casual

fashion.



In addition it had originally been understood that when the

conversation was taking place both                ind 1       had

been looking towards the Leppings Lane end of the ground

Mr Kirt    at the meeting asserted that in fact they had both

been looking at the Kop at this time.        If this version of

events is true the importance and significance of the

conversation at twenty-to-three is substantially reduced




                                -   3-
 because the disaster took place at the Leppings Lane end of

 the ground and not at the Kop.



 In his witness statement                    recalled a conversation

 at ten-to--three.             ^claimed not to remember the

 substance of his conversation at 2.15.         The conversation at

ten-to-three was ten minutes later than their conversation
at twenty-to-three and at that time the gate had already

been opened.      The evidence against              and therefore

Sheffield Wednesday may be quite damning.          He must have

known that 20,000 was a large number get in within the

remaining time and he should have done something to delay

the match.      Secondly he had a portaphone and could easily

have phoned the control room to suggest that too many people

were already in the ground.          Thirdly the alleged

conversation between himself and 1                     at

twenty-to-three should have brought it to his attention that

there were indeed too many people in the ground.



In     :i r ’           coss examination on '*       ■* ' ’a

photographer was described as overhearing a conversation

between two individuals one of whom was wearing a dark

blazer with a badge.      The conversation concerned 15-20,000

people being outside the Club grounds and one individual

asked the other whether the kick-off should be delayed.

                  can recall only a conversation with

                about this.

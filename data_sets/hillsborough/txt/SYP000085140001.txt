            I am a Police Constable              in the South Yorkshire Police at present

            stationed at Maltby.



            At Sam    (0800) on Saturday 15 April              1989 (150489),        I commenced duty at

            Maltby Police Station,              from where I was transported to Hillsborough

            Football Ground,          Sheffield.

            At    10am (1000) a briefing was held in the main stand, which 1 attended,

            My detail was serial No 54, whi ch entailed the supervision of

            Nott i rtgham Forest supporters and traffic on Herries Road South ■                      I
                                                                           PAGE
                                                                           S2940

took up these duties at 11.15am (1115).

At 3 . 0 0 pm (1500) Phase   1 of this detai1 was completed and it was our

intention to attend Claywheels Lane for a meal,          however, we were

instructed to stand b y at the junction of Herries Road South and

Penistone Road.



At g.OSpm   (1505) we were directed into the ground and upon reaching

the main stand at it's junction with the Hop,          further directed to go

onto the pitch and form a cordon across the pitch near to the goal at

the Leppings Lane end of the ground.



Upon arrival at this     point   1 saw that many of the supporters from this

section of the stand were on the pitch and many of them appeared dazed

and distressed.



It appeared that there was some major problem          inside the stand, and

more and more people were trying to get through the gaps in the wire

fencing and onto the pitch.       General   control was maintained of the

c rowd coming onto the playing area.        This   cont rol was kept unt i1 all

the crowd had left the stand.



At   45pm (1645) we left the ground to perform by stand by duties on

Penistone Road, at i t ’s junction with Herries Road South.



At 5.20pm (1720) we returned to the main stand where an appraisal             of

the day *s events was given by a senior officer.          We we re stood down at

5.45pm   (1745)   returning to Maltby at 7.30pm      (1930), where after a

further de-briefing,    we retired from duty at 8.00pm        (J& Q Q ).

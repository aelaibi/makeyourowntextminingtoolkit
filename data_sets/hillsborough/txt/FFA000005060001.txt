     FA/HILLSBOROUGH



     Attending John Dyson on his telephoning. He said that
    â– .Julian had had a number of chats with Jackson at the FSA.
     Julian thought that it might be useful to soften up the FSA
    but offering some liaison but accepted that this could not
    be done until the FA had made a decision on it.       Julian was
    very keen that as soon as the FA made its mind up we should
    communicate it to Jackson*      John also mentioned that it
    would be useful to have a copy of the bill which deals with
    the identity card issue.


    Attending ________________ on his telephoning when he said
    that there were two issues developing at Sheffield namely
    the first was that at a late stage the FA cancelled the
    pre-match entertainment which is called special skills in
    the blue programme and the second was that the FA allocate
    ends of grounds after consulting the police.

}   It was agreed that 1 would speak to        ______ and phone him
    back.


    Telephoning!       land putting the points to her.   She said
    that she would look into them immediately and come back to
    me.


    Attending ]__________on her telephoning.     She said that if
    one looked at the booklet it refers to a soccer star scheme.
    This apparently was the super skills competition that took
    place last year.     The competition had not taken place this




                                    -   6-
    year. She had spoken to Glen Kirton and Steve Clark and
    ascertained that there was no correspondence about the
    cancellation of this.        The only reference to it is in the
    blue circular.    She had found out that 7-10 days prior to
    the semi-final, fetlterell of Sheffield Wednesday had phoned


    FA and was told that the competition would not be going
    ahead. McCrcll had seemed relieved about this. The
    competition is apparently a coaching competition for
    youngsters done in conjunction with schools and was a
    knock-out one.


    With regard to the second point, Clark said that the FA has
    never allocated ends.        This has always been a decision that
    the club has taken in conjunction with the police.         If one
    looks in the blue booklet one will see that the only matter
    dealing with ticketing is the price of them.


    Telephoning^           [back and giving him that information.


    Attending_________ |on her telephoning again when she said
    that there was some correspondence relating to the
    cancellation of this competition in January and she would be
    faxing it across to us.

           I am a single man and               reside at the above address wi t h my parents and

           one sister and my brother*

           I have     been a Liverpool           su pporter    for the    past twelve years and hold

           a current      season ticket          for the Liverpool Hop,            I go to all        the horns

           games    and all FA Cup away or home games*                        I tend not to travel       to

           many aw a y games as          I work on Saturdays.

           For    the H i l l s b o r o u g h FA Cup m a t c h Liverpool      and N o t t i n g h a m Forest,     I

           ob tained my ticket           from A nf i e ld    by producing my Vo uch er 7 out of my

           season ticket        book.      The ticket        I purchased       cost me £6 and stated

           that    I enter at Leppings Ln st anding area.                      There were no other

           details     on the ticket           stating where     I should stand or            in which

           block.      I am not a member           of the     official    Liverpool       su pporters    club

         and      in order to get         to the m a t c h my friend                          who   lives at

                                        went    to Amber line    c o a c h ’s at Speke and booked

           three    seats    on a coach and o b t a i n ed the details             of where we had to

           get the     coach from to get to Sheffield.                   We   paid £9 each for         our

           tickets,      The other friend who               came with us was                  that's all      I

         know him as,         as    I only see him whe n we go to the match's.

  At about      10*00 am       (1000)      we went    to Ambe rl ine        coaches     to get our

  coach w hi ch should have             left at      10.15 am        (1015)    but we d i d n ’t leave

  until      about    1/4 to 11 due to all            the    c o a c h ’s leaving together.             When

  we   left Speke       coach station we had to                pick up some more             people from

  B r o o d - g r e e n and when we had done          that     the    coach was       totally full          and

  we made      our way to Sheffield.              In order       to get to Sh e f f ie ld we

  t r a ve ll ed along       the mot o r wa y and d i d n ’t stop at all              until we got

  stopp ed by the Police             just    before we got           into Sheffield,          this was

  about      10 to    1 to    1 pm (1300)*        All    the    people on the          coach were       in

  good spirits        and looking          forwar d to the game,              There were a few

  people w i t h beer         cans and      lager and several with              cans of soft          drink,

  nothing      ex cessive and        certainly nobody was              drunk.     By the time we got

  to S h e f f i e l d all    the   cans that     there was          had been    consumed as when

  the Police         stopped us no         cans were    taken off our           coach.        I saw that

  the Police w e r e n ’t stopping            every     coach,       just stopping          them at random*

  We got to the ground at H i l l s b o r o u g h and the                  coach was        parked by a

  brewe ry off La ppi ng s Ln at about                1/4 past        1.   We all      got    off and we

  went      to see    if we    could get a drink at a nearby                   pub.     The    pub was

  shut      so we went       to get something         to eat.         I believe       the    pub was

  called the Travellers Arms                 or something        similar.        We found a shop and

  bought some thi ng          to eat and we went            down the       road a bit further           and

  found a Ga t e wa y Supe rma rk et          open,     there was a lot of             people    (fans)

  sitting      on the grass         bank outside        the shop drinking             cans of beer,          so

  we bought a         couple of      cans    each and sat        on the grass          drinking       them.

  This was      at about a 1/4 to 2*              At about 2 pm (1400)                two    police

  officers      on ho rseback        came and began to move everyone                    down towards

  the ground*          There was      no trouble and the ma jo ri ty m ov ed off,                     the

  Poli ce were OK an d we m ov ed towards                   the ground.         We ar ri v e d at the

   ground at about           1/4 past to 20 past 2*              There was       a lot of       people

 (supporters)         outside       the ground as we wa l ke d down but not a crush.                      As

 we got      to the turnstile area B and C the                   crowd t h i ck en ed and as       it

 was a strange            ground    I asked a mo un te d       Police Of fic er whi ch turnstile

 to go to,        he told me        * B ’ after he saw my ticket.              We were act ually

 standing at         *C     and whilst     trying      to get to       ’B ’ I lost both my

 friends.         It was a mass of         people and we were all              crushed together.

 I was      sq uashed up against the            *C* &    ’B*    turnstile      dividing wall       and

 had to help three men by giving                   them a      leg up to get over the wall

 into the      *C*    secti on where       they had to         be to get into the ground.                It

 was   totally       impossible to get          out    of the    crush;    at this   stage    I only

 saw two m ou nt ed Police            horses    having       seen six officers       earlier when

 we wal ke d down just             standing    in a huddle       talking near the Gateway

 su pe rm ar ke t    island.

 Bot h these m ou nte d officers were                 having    trouble    controlling      the    crowd

 because      ev eryone just want ed to get              into the ground.          I come to the

 semi-final         last year at H i l l s b o r o u g h wi t h the same teams         playing and

 can state        that    then the Pol ic e      o r g an is ed everyone       into queues    to get

 into the tu rnstile and this                 problem of crushing          never occurred.          I was

 still      crushed against          the di viding wall and facing              the first

 tu rnstile w h i ch        is on the     left as you go through the gates.                   I got to

 the turn st il e e ven tua ll y and handed my ticket                    in,   got my stub back

 and wa l k e d     in.     At no time was        I se ar ch ed nor did I see any P o l ic em en

 or Stewards         inside the ground at             this    point.     I went   to the toilet

 wh i c h   is di rectly opposite          the turnstile         I entered through.           I saw no

 signs      dire ct in g me to where          I had to stand so I a p p r o a c h e d two

 Po l i c e m e n and a S te wa rd who were           standing    at the gates       to the

 Leppings      Ln seated stand.            I a s k e d the S te wa rd     if I could go to the

 seating area above            the standing        area with the stub           I had but he told

 me no.       I as ked where         I had to go and he dir ected me down the tunnel.

       he did not         tell me      I could go to the                 left or the right             of the tunnel t

           stand on the       end pens.            I w a l k e d towards     the tunnel        and was able to

       walk        straight    through and           into Pen 3 with no trouble at all                           (refer to

           diagram.)      1 still      d i d n ’t see a steward or a Police Officer.                                   I went

           into the standing area              and stood about a 1/3rd of the way down                                 Pen

           3.     Sh o rt ly before    the     players       came onto the          pitch there was a                   surge

           behind me and       I was     pushed down the steps                a short way,              I took no

           notice    really because           that surging          happens    all    the time,             only this

           time    it d i d n ’t go back       up again.           Things after this           became a bit

           confusing     to me.       I remember           the    players coming onto the                   pitch       and

           singing     up to Steve McMahon.                 I remember       being    pushed towards another

           barrier     further down but             I ma nag ed     somehow to duck under                   it and was

           then    pushed down onto another                 barrier       nearer the front and near to

           pen 2 dividing wall.               I was      behind another        lad who         I was        un av oidingly

           pushing against        onto    this       barrier,       he somehow m a n a g e d to get one                      leg

           around the     barrier      goal        side and then due to the force                      of all          the

           crus hi ng got     stuck and I got              pus hed onto his         r ight     knee totally

           crushing     it against       the barrier.              I heard    it crack         (his knee)              and the

           lad who was      only about         15 or       16 years       old began sc reaming               but there

           was    nothing we     could do,          we   c o u l d n ’t push back or get him out or

           anything.      We were      just        being    crushed more than ever.                    I remember

           people shouting to the Police                    at the front of the stand to open the

           gates    because    people were dying                 in here.     I d o n ’t know what               happened

           I just heard them shouting.                     This    all    happened before              the kick-off

           because     I remember      glancing          up and seeing        the    players           lined up on the

           pitch.      At this    point       someone       shout ed      "the barriers         going,           the

           barriers     going."       I was about a foot away from the bar of the barrier

           and the     lad whose      knee had just              crushed was ac tu al ly on the bar and

           the angle     support ing      bar on the             corner    of the barrier.               At this         stage

I was     in a complete state of          panic,       I found    it difficult           to breathe

and my heart was        pounding*        All    of a sudden       I found myself on the

floor and my        right    foot tr app ed     in the broken barrier and under

bodies of     people    lying across       both my       legs.      I was     lying on my

stomac h facing       the concrete steps.              I m a n a g e d after some time to get

myself     onto my    right    side but was       unable     to move my        right      leg at all

as a youth     in his teens was          lying on me and he wasn't                 moving at all.

I would describe        him as having          short    brown or black         hair of a medi um

build.      I was    unable    to describe       his    face or how tall           he was as he

was    lying face     down across my       legs with his stomach over my legs.                            He

was weari ng a dark          coloured track       suit    type top and t h a t ’s all             I can

say.      I believe that this man was             dead as he d i d n ’t move at all.                  I

eve nt u a l l y m an ag ed to wriggle my left           leg out and got           it free    loosing

my trainer     in the       process.     I really began to            panic when         I felt

someone     standing on my back.           I gr abb ed     his   leg but       he still      stood

there,     he eventua ll y got off and           I could see some           light    coming

through the darkness           on the floor.           I d o n ’t know how        long    I ’d been

there    but after what        seemed    like an ete rni ty the            pushing seem to ease

sightly and     people moved back up the steps.                     Two    lads   then grabbe d my

arms     in Pen 3 and began to          pull me backwards.             I screamed at them

that my foot was        stuck under       the    lad and under         the metal         barrier.

S o m e h o w they manag ed to get the          lad off my       legs and free me from the

broken barrier and they           caried me out          of Pen 3 over         the fence and

into Pen 2 handing me over              to two other men who              carried me onto the

pitch and     into    the   corner     by number       1 pen.    At    this    stage there were

no football     players on the          pitch at this       time.         The St Johns

Am b ul an ce men    came and as ke d me what          hap pen ed     to me.      I ’d alrea dy

taken my sock off and had a look at my ankle that saw two cuts on it,

they were     just about       to bandage       it up when someone            ran over and

          said,     "Quick,         t h e y ’res someone    dying*"       They went and       left me the

          bandage and           I st rap pe d my a nk le as best          I could.       I remember walking

          back towards Pens 3 and 4 in a dase and seeing                            people    lying   covered

          by blankets and being                carried a w a y on boards.           I was a m az e d at the

          time    it ha pp ene d       I thought     it was       just    isolated to Pen 3 but when              I

          saw it all across              I was staggered.           The   next   thing    I remember    is

          sitting       on the       pitch by the S o ut h Stand and two P o l i c e m e n asking me

         what     hap pe ned to me and            if I was alright.          They    carried me to the St

          John Ambul an ce           people




         Un f o r t u n a t e l y   in my honest     o p ini on    I would like to say that           it was          so

          badly orga ni se d or should I say                 lack of o r gan is ati on       by the Police

         and     the Stewards.            Pens 3 & 4 were          packed by 2 pm (140Q)        and    if

         someone        did open the gates           to    let the fans      in they should have shut

         the tunnel and made               the fans       go to the wings        of the   stand where        it

         was     quite empty.            I would also       like to add that         I saw that no-one was

         drinking         in the stadium or pens 3 or 4 nor was                     there any fighting.                I

         d i d n ’t see a n yb od y who was          drunk    at all.

P u r p o s e s Panel when I have more d e t a i l e d i n f o r m a t i o n .

Lord J u s t i c e T aylor makes no recommendation to remove the
c e r t i f i c a t i o n f u n c t i o n away from l o c a l a u t h o r i t i e s ; i t must

a u t h o r i t y under the 1975 Act f o r the f o r e s e e a b l e f u t u r e .

C e r t a i n o f the recommendations do however s u g g e s t a g r e a t e r i n p u t
from th e Government than has h i t h e r to been the c a s e . As and when
R e g u l a t i o n s are made a p p r o p r i a t e r e p o r t s w i l l be put b e f o r e the

Offences and Penalties
 70. Consideration should be given to creating an offence of selling tickets for and on the day of a football
match without authority from the home club to do so.

    i.    throwing a missile;

    ii.   chanting obscene or racialist abuse;

    iii. going on the pitch without reasonable excuse.

  72. Consideration should be given to extending the courtsâ powers to make attendance centre orders for
football related offences on occasions of designated football matches. The provision should be capable of
imposition on an offender aged 21 or over and subject to a maximum of 72 hours in the case of an offender aged
17 or over.

  73. Consideration should be given to the use of electronic monitoring (tagging) in the sentencing of offenders
convicted of football related offences.


Green Guide
  74.     As a matter of urgency, the Home Office should set up a body to revise the Green Guide in accordance
with this Report, these Recommendations and the Report of the Technical Working Party (Appendix 3).

  15.      In any revision of the Green Guide, the values to be achieved by way of percentage recovery after the
required loading tests on crush barriers should be specified. Acceptable values for various materials should be
specified.

  76. When the Green Guide is revised, the need to inspect crush barriers for possible corrosion should be
specifically mentioned and emphasised.

   Dear Sir/Madam

   HOME OFFICE CIRCULAR 11/1990
   FINAL REPORT OF THE HILLSBOROUGH INQUIRY

  .Introduction

   The Final Report of the Inquiry set up by the Home Secretary
   following the disaster at the Hillsborough football ground was
   published on 29 January. A copy of the Report is attached.

   2.   The purpose of this circular is first, to apprise recipients
   of the Report's recommendations and the Governmentâs response to
   them; and second to give guidance to local authorities with
   safety certification responsibilities on compliance with the
   recommendations.

   The Report

   3.   The Report contains 76 recommendations, 43 of which are
   repeated in substance (see also paragraph 6     below) from the
   Interim Report circulated with HOC 68/1989*. Attached at Annex A
   is a copy of the Home Secretary's oral statement to the House
   of Commons on 29 January responding to the final Report.      At
   Annex B is a copy of the schedule referred to in the statement
   setting out the Government1s initial response to the individual
   recommendations in the report.

   4. '-Local authorities may wish to note, in      particular, the
   response to recommendations 1-4 (all seated accommodation) and
   recommendation 6 (National Review Body). The intention is to
   bring into force the relevant sections of Part I ox the Football
   Spectators Act 1989 in order to implement these recommendations
as regards football grounds as soon as practicable.             Safety
certificates should not be amended for this purpose.

Scope

5.   Paragraphs 238-239 of the Report indicate that in directing
the recommendations "essentially" to sports grounds designated
under the Safety of Sports Grounds Act 1975 the/flexibility of
approach referred to in paragraph 5 of the Guide to Safety at
Sports Grounds (the Green Guide) should apply*;|||faragraph 14 of
the Report makes clear that its emphasis is on football, with its
special problems such as overcrowding and misbehaviour, which
are not experienced to the same extent elsewhere.      The Report
states that "crowd problems are directly related to the nature
of the event and the numbers attending it". It.would therefore
be consistent with the Report's findings for local authorities
totake proper account of these factors when applying the
recommendations to individual grounds;     for example a careful
appraisal, of the value of such matters as the installation of
sophisticated, communications systems and CCTV may be necessary
where spectator attendances are numbered in hundreds rather than
thousands and where the police presence at the ground is minimal.

Interim Report Recommendations Adjusted

6.   The   attention   of  local   authorities   is  drawn   to
recommendations 8, 11, 12(b), 19, 20, 31, 33, 58, 66 and 67 all
of which were contained in the Interim Report but have been
modified as follows:

        recommendation 8 -   revised maximum figure

        recommendation 11 - "agreement" between club and police is
                            replaced by "statement of intent"

        recommendation 12 - qualification introduced by 1 2 (b)

        recommendation 19 - discretion as regards opening of pitch
                            perimeter gates

        recommendation 20 - manning by police or steward

        recommendation 31 â revised   composition   of   the   Advisory
                            Group

        recommendation   33- reference to 1975 Act provision

        recommendation   58 - hand-signals not recommended

        recommendation   66 - recommended threshold figure of2000

        recommendation   67 - ambulance may be     approved'   by   the
                              ambulance authorities.
New Safety Recommendations

7.   New   recommendations are summarised below and               local
authorities are urged to take the action indicated                where
appropriate.

        Turnstiles (recommendation 10) - to note the revised
        maximum flow-rate to be used in place of the. figure of
        750 quoted in the Green Guide which will be.amended as
        soon as possible;

        Gar.crvavs (recommendation 13) - to include appropriate
        conditions in safety certificates;

        Perimeter Fences (recommendations 14, 15, 17) - to
        secure   action  by  clubs  to  comply with    these
        recommendations and to amend safety certificates, as
        necessary;

        Safety Certificates (recommendations 24, 25, 26) - to
        consider   any   necessary   adjustment   to   safety
        certificates and note Home Office       intention to
        implement recommendation 24;

        Duties of Clubs (recommendations 39, 40, 42, 43) - t o
        consider appropriate amendment to safety certificates,
        as necessary;

        Police Planning (recommendations 47, 48, 50, 52, 53),
        Communications (55) and Co-ordination (61) - to note
        the recommendations and the Government's response;

        First Aid (recommendation 69) and Offences/Penalties
        (recommendations  70-73)  - to    note  Government's
        response;

        Green Guide (recommendations 74-76 and Appendix 3) -
        to note the Government response and to adopt the
        revised criteria/requirements which will be included
        in a revised guide as soon as possible.

Resource Implications

8.   Action to consider, revise and enforce the provisions of
safety certificates in the light of the Report may have short
term resource implications but is not expected to give rise to
significant long-term resource implications above existing
commitments.

Initial response by the Government to the recommendations in the
final report of Lord Justice Taylor's Inquiry into the
Hillsborough stadium diaster.


In his statement on 29 January, the Home Secretary indicated that
he would place in the Library a schedule setting out the
Government's initial response to the recommendations of Lord
Justice Taylor's final report.   The schedule is annexed.




29 January 1990
'Initial response by the Government to recommendations contained
 in the Taylor report.


ALL SEATED ACCOMMODATION (Recommendation 1-4)

1.    General recommendation in respect of all sports grounds
      designated under the Safety of Sports Grounds Act 1975.

2.    To apply to all UEFA ''high risk" matches from Autumn 1993.

 3.   To apply by 20% stages between now and Autumn 1994 to
           Football league, Divisions l and 2
           Scottish football league, Premier Division
           National stadia.

4.    To apply by 10% stages between now and Autumn 1999 to all
      other matches played at designated grounds.

The Government accepts this recommendation in principle and
expects to apply it in the case of UEFA high risk matches, the
4 Divisions of the football league, and the national stadia as
recommended.


 The application of the recommendation to Scotland and to other
 sports cannot be achieved under the Football Spectators Act 1989
-but the Government will in any case wish to discuss it with the
 sporting authorities concerned. Designated sports grounds under
 the 1975 Act include cricket, rugby union and rugby league
 grounds which are not all enclosed grounds and which it may not
 be practicable to deal with in this way.



ADVISORY DESIGN COUNCIL (Recommendation 5)

The Government supports Lord Justice Taylorâs recommendation
that the football league and Football Association should
establish an Advisory Design Council on stadium design.




NATIONAL INSPECTORATE AND REVIEW BODY (Recommendation 6)

      (a)   The Football Licensing Authority should be created to
            review the discharge of functions by local authorities.

      (b)   The powers of the Authority should be extended to other
            sports and other sports venues.

 The   Government   supports  the   recommendation   that   safety
 certification of designated grounds should be centrally reviewed
 and proposes to bring into force Relevant provisions of Part I
 of the Football Spectators Act to create and empower the Football
Licensing Authority to carry out these responsibilities in
England and Wales in relation to grounds used by football league
clubs and the international football grounds. Consideration will
be given to introduction of legislation extending the role of the
new authority to Scotland and in relation to other sports grounds
and sporting venues after consultation with the representative
sporting organisations, the local authority associations and
other interested bodies.    Consideration will also be given to
extending the Authority's responsibilities in the meantime on a
voluntary basis.

MAXIMUM CAPACITIES FOR TERRACES (Recommendations 7-10)

7.    Safety certificates to specify maximum number of spectators

9.    Arrangements to prevent further access to pens      (interim
      recommendation 3).

10.   Turnstile flow rates.

The Government supports these recommendations. Local authorities
with responsibilities under the Safety of Sports Grounds Act 1975
(the 1975 Act) have already been urged to review and amend safety
certificates to reflect reductions in terrace capacities
recommended in the Interim Report.      The adjusted figures in
recommendations 8 and 10 will be drawn to local authorities'
attention.   The next edition of the 'Green Guide' will reflect
the new figures.

11.   Statements of intent (interim recommendation 4, revised.

12.   Stewarding or policing of pens (interim recommendation 5).

The Government have already urged police and clubs to enter into
non-contractual statements of intent with the aim of ensuring
that no doubt exists as to the respective responsibilities of
each; and to provide monitoring of terraces accordingly.       The
relaxation in recommendation 12 (b) will be drawn to the attention
of local authorities and clubs.

GANGWAYS (Recommendation 13}

Local authorities will be urged to include in safety certificates
terms and conditions to give effect to this recommendation.

FENCES AND GATES (Recommendations 14-21)

14.   Removal of spikes.

21.    Cutting equipment (interim recommendation 10).

The Government supports the recommendations on perimeter fencing.
Local authorities will be urgecl to amend safety certificates to
include requirements so as to implement recommendations 14, 15,
17   and to   note recommendation 19 which varies         interim
recommendation 8.   The revised recommendations on closure and
manning of gates in perimeter fences at football grounds will be
drawn to the attention of local authorities, clubs and police.

       recommendation 16).

31.    Local authority advisory groups (interim recommendation 17,
       revised).

The Government agrees with the aims of these recommendations.
An order under S.15A of the 1975 Act will be made to implement
recommendation 24. Consideration will also be given to including
within the scope of such an Order provisions which will require
terms and conditions addressing other aspects of safety to be
included in safety certificates.           â
Local authorities will be urged to ensure the terms/conditions
in safety certificates are clear and unequivocal: they will be
reminded of the need to have an effective review system, the
desirability of a properly constituted team approach to
certification and the desirability of consulting club and
supporters association representatives.

Annual review of safety certificates already exists in effect
because annual inspections of designated grounds in connection
with safety certificates is already required" by law.      The
Government will consider whether any change in the law should
be made to make annual renewal of certificates compulsory.

BH44/JD22
                              PART V - FINAL RECOMMENDATIONS

All-Seated Accommodation
  1. The Secretary of State should ensure that spectators are admitted only to seated accommodation at
matches played at sports grounds designated under the Safety of Sports Grounds Act 1975 in accordance with
the timing set out in Recommendations 2 to 4 below.                                        m
  2. Recommendation 1 should apply with effect from the start of the 1993/4 season at high-risk matches as
defined under the UEFA Regulations set out in paragraph 82 above.

  3. Subject to Recommendation 2 above. Recommendation 1 abQve should apply with effect from the start of
the 1994/5 season to all matches at grounds in the first and second divisions of the Football League, the
Premier Division of the Scottish Football League, and at national stadia, subject to a reasonable extension of
time in the case of a club promoted to the second division of the Football League or the Premier Division of the
Scottish Football League. Standing accommodation at these grounds should be reduced annually by 20% of the
present standing capacity (such present standing capacity to be calculated according to Recommendation 8
below), the first 20% deduction being effective from August 1990 so as to eliminate standing by August 1994.

  4. Subject to Recommendation 2 above. Recommendation 1 should apply with effect from the start of the
1999/2000 season to all matches at all other grounds designated under the Safety of Sports Grounds Act 1975.
Standing accommodation at these grounds should be reduced annually by 10% of the present standing capacity
(such present standing capacity to be calculated according to Recommendation 8 below), the first 10%
deduction being effective from August 1990 so as to eliminate standing by August 1999.

Advisory Design Council                                ,
  5. The Football Association and the Football League should establish an Advisory Design Council whose
functions should be:

    (a) to conduct and marshal research into the improvement and design of football stadia;

    (b) to disseminate regularly such information and expertise as they acquire in this field to members of the
        Football League and, on request, to other football and sports clubs in England, Wales and Scotland.

National Inspectorate and Review Body
  6. (a) If Part I of the Football Spectators Act 1989 is implemented, section 13 should be brought into force
giving the Football Licensing Authority the functions and powers therein specified (power to review the
discharge of functions by local authorities). If Part I of the Act is not implemented or is substantially delayed,
other arrangements should be made for the discharge of the functions and powers in section 13 of the Act by the
appointment of a body to exercise them.

      (b)       In either event, the body exercising those functions and powers in relation to association football
should also be entrusted withvsimilar functions and powers regarding the discharge by local authorities of their
certifying and licensing functions in relation to other sports grounds and sports entertainments pursuant to the
Safety of Sports Grounds Act 1975 and Parts III and IV of the Fire Safety and Safetv of Places of Sport Act
1987.

Maximum Capacities for Terraces
  7. Where a viewing terrace is divided into pens or areas which are self-contained, the Safety Certificate
should specify the maximum number of spectators to be admitted to each such pen or area.

A pen or area is to be deemed â'self-contained" notwithstanding that it has a gate or gates affording access to
another pen or area and whether such gate or gates be open or shut.

   8. Each figure for maximum capacity should be assessed in accordance with Chapter 16 of the Green Guide
(âthe Green Guide figure**) subject to the follow ing qualifications:-

    (a) the maximum density permitted under paragraphs 221 and 222 of the Green Guide (when the terrace
        or viewing slope is in good condition) should be 47 not 54;
    (b) the minimum figure specified in paragraphs 221 and 222 (when the terrace or viewing slope materially
        deviates from the recommended guidelines, so as to constitute a possible hazard to individuals closely
        packed) should be 0 not 27;
    (c) in arriving at âthe Green Guide figure**, proper and realistic allowance must be made for all factors
        which should reduce the permissible density including those specified in paragraphs 220 to 224
        inclusive of the Green Guide.
  9. Arrangements should be made:-
    (a) to limit the number of spectators entering each self-contained pen or area to the maximum capacity
        figure assessed in accordance with Recommendation 8 above either electronically, mechanically, by a
        ticketing arrangement by counting or otherwise, and
    (b) to close off further access to such pen or area when its maximum capacity is about to be reached.
   10. The maximum notional rate at which spectators can pass through a turnstile should be 660 persons per
hour, not 750 per hour as stated in paragraph 47 of the Green Guide. The maximum rate for any particular
turnstile must take full account of all circumstances including those given as examples in paragraph 47.

Filling and M onitoring Terraces
   11. There should be a written statement of intent agreed between the club and the police, setting out their
respective functions as to crowd safety and control and in particular as to the filling of each self-contained pen or
other standing area and the monitoring of spectators in each such pen or area to avoid overcrowding. Any
variation of the document in respect of an individual match should be agreed in writing in advance.
   12. (a) At each match, there should be on the perimeter track, for each self-contained pen or other standing
area (subject to (b) below), a steward (if the dub is monitoring that area) or a police officer (if the police are
monitoring it) whose sole duty is to check crowd conditions in that area for possible overcrowding or distress
throughout the period the area is occupied by spectators. Whoever is so appointed should be in addition to any
other steward or police presence. He should have ready access to a police officer who can authorise access
through gates to the pitch under Recommendation 20 below.
      (b)       This Recommendation need not be applied to any self-contained pen or other standing area where the
spectators present or reasonably to be expected, during a particular match do not exceed one third of the areaâs
maximum permitted capacity, or 2,000, whichever is the-lower.

Gangways
  13. Gangways should be kept dear, in accordance -with paragraphs 97 to 99 of the Green Guide. Gangways
should be painted in a conspicuous colour whether they are sunk or not The Safety Certificate should require
that no standing is allowed in gangways and that they be painted.

Fences and Gates
   14. All spikes or similar constructions on perimeter or radial fences, and any sections overhanging or
returning inwards towards spectators, should be removed.
  15. Perimeter fendng should be no higher than 2.2 metres, measured from the top of the fence to the lowest
point at which spectators may stand, and including any wall or other foundations forming part of the perimeter
boundary.
   16. All police officers and stewards with duties in relation to the standing areas and especially those with
duties under Recommendation 12 above, should be fully briefed and trained with regard to the recognition of
crowd densities, to the recognition of signs of distress and to crowd dynamics. Training should include
demonstrations at the ground and photographs, designed to enable stewards and officers to recognise different
crowd densities.
  17. There must be provided in any perimeter fence of a pen or other self-contained area sufficient gates of a
minimum width of 1.1 metres to enable that pen or area to be evacuated onto the pitch in the time prescribed for
an emergency evacuation of that pen or area.

                                                         77
   18. All gates in radial or perimeter fences of pens or other self-contained areas should be painted in a
different colour from the rest of the fence and marked âEmergency Exitâ.

   19. Where there is a perimeter fence in front of a pen or enclosure, all gates to the pitch should be kept folly
open during the period when spectators are in the pen or enclosure, wherever those in command feel that this
can safely be done. Whether they be fully open, partially open or dosed, they should be kept unlocked
throughout the period when the pen or enclosure is occupied.                                     â¢

   20. Each gate in a perimeter fence affording access to the pitch from a pen or endosure should be manned by
a steward or by a police officer when the pen or endosure is occupied. Whether such manning should be by a
police officer or by a steward should be dedded by the Police Commander. In either event, the Police
Commander should appoint one or more police officers with power to authorise access through gates to the
pitch immediately in the event of an emergency.

  21. Suitable and sufficient cutting equipment should be provided by the club at each ground where there are
perimeter fences to permit the immediate removal of enough fencing to release numbers of spectators if
necessary. Agreement should be reached as to whether the equipment should be used by police, the fire brigade
or stewards. Whoever is to use it should be trained to do so. Whether to use it should be a decision of a
nominated senior police officer at the ground.


Crush Barriers
   22. All crush barriers should be visually inspected each year for signs of corrosion. Any barrier found to be
affected by a significant degree of corrosion should be repaired or replaced.

   23. The layout of barriers in each pen or terraced aria should be reviewed immediately (if this has not
already been done following the Interim Report) to ensure that it complies with the criteria contained in
Chapter 9 of the Green Guide. If it does not. the assessment of the maximum capacity figure for that pen or
terraced area, in accordance with Recommendation 8 above, should reflect the fact

Safety Certificates
   24. The Secretary of State should exercise his powers under either section 6(2) or section 15(A) of the Safety
of Sports Grounds Act 1975 so as to make mandatory in Safety Certificates those conditions specified in the
original section 2(2) of the 1975 Act. So far as the original section 2(2)(b) is concerned âshallâ should be
substituted for âmayâ.

  25. In assessing these mandatory requirements in the Certificate for a particular ground, the local authority
should follow the Green Guide criteria. Once that is done, the resultant figures and terms for that ground
should be specified in the Safety Certificate and no variation from them should be permitted other than by
formal revision.

  26. Where a local authority* incorporates any provision of the Green Guide into the Safety Certificate, other
than one within the scope of Recommendation 25 above, it should make dear whether that provision is to be
complied with absolutely or with discretionary' flexibility.

   27. There should be an immediate review of each Safety Certificate (if this has not already been done
following the Interim Report) by the responsible local authority, which should consult the dub in respect of
which the Certificate is issued, the police, the fire service, the ambulance service and the building authority.
Such a review should include an inspection of the stadium. Its object should be to ensure that the operative
conditions of the Certificate are complied with and to add or substitute any condition shown to be necessary as a
matter of urgency following the findings and Recommendations in this Report.

 28. Any locaf authority within whose area there exists a sports ground designated under the 1975 Act for
which no Safety Certificate has yet been issued should proceed forthwith to remedy the situation.

  29. Every Safety Certificate should be reviewed by the local authority at least once annually and each
Certificate should require to be renewed annually.

  30. Each local authority should review its arrangements for issuing, monitoring, enforcing, reviewing,
amending and renewing Safety Certificates (if this has not already been done following the Interim

                                                       78
Report). Such review should require that there exists or is provided an accountable administrative structure
whereby the functions of the local authority are regularly and effectively supervised by senior officers and
elected members and decisions are properly taken in accordance with the local authority's rales.
   31. To assist the local authority in exercising its functions, it should set up an Advisory Group (if this has not
already been done) consisting of appropriate members of its own staff, representatives of the police, of the fire
and ambulance services and of the building authority. The Advisory Group should consult representatives of the
club and of a recognised supportersâ organisation on a regular basis. The Advisory Group's terms of reference
should encompass all matters concerned with crowd safety and should require regular visits to the ground and
attendance at matches. The Advisory Group should have a chairman from the local authority, and an effective
procedure. Its resolutions should be recorded and it should be required to produce regular written reports for
consideration by the local authority.

Duties of Each Football Gub
  32. Each turnstile should be inspected and its potential rate of flow measured (if this has not already been
done following the Interim Report). Thereafter, regular inspections should be made to ensure that each turnstile
remains capable of admitting spectators at the rate anticipated.
  33. The correlation between each viewing area in the stadium and the turnstiles serving it should be such as
to ensure that all the spectators intended to be admitted to that viewing area can pass through the turnstiles
within one hour. If that cannot be done, the capacity of that viewing area should be reduced accordingly. Since
this Recommendation includes terms and conditions within the scope of the original section 2(2)(c)(i) of the
Safety of Sports Grounds Act 1975 it should be given effect in the Safety Certificate (see Recommendation 24
above).
  34. Turnstiles sliould be closed when the permitted capacity of the area served by them is about to be readied
and arrangements should be made to ensure quick and effective communication with turnstile operators for this
purpose.
  35. Closed circuit television should be so installed as to enable crowd densities outside the ground, within
concourse areas and in pens and other standing areas, to be monitored before, throughout and at the end of a
match.
  36. All signposting for spectators both outside and inside the ground should be comprehensively reviewed (if
this has not already been done following the Interim Report). It should, in relation to the arrangements for each
match, be unambiguous, eye-catching, simple and dear and should be designed to ensure the rapid movement of
spectators to their appropriate viewing areas. Any redundant signs should be removed.
  37. Information on tickets should be unambiguous, simple and clear and should correlate absolutely with the
information provided in respect of each match both outside and inside the ground. Retained ticket stubs should
contain information necessary to guide spectators once inside the ground.
  38. Information on tickets requesting spectators to be in position by a particular time should be reviewed (if
this has not already been done following the Interim Report) by clubs in conjunction with the police to ensure
that it corresponds with the planned arrangements for admitting spectators to the ground.
  39. Clubs should consider maintaining a record on computer of ticket sales before the day of the match, for
season tickets and tickets for all-ticket matches for seated areas, containing the names and addresses of those
purchasing tickets.                                              ^
  40. AH-ticket matches should be confined to those at which a capacity or near capacity crowd is expected.
When a match has been designated all-ticket, clubs should not sell tickets at the match and should take steps to
advise the spectators of both clubs accordingly.
                                                 %
  41. Each club should consult with a recognised supportersâ club as to the provision of pre-match
entertainment aimed at attracting spectators to the ground in good time.

   42. Clubs should recruit and retain sufficient competent stewards. They should be fit active and robust and
preferably between the ages of 18 and 55. Clubs should ensure that stewards are fully trained, aware of their
duties under Annex B of the Green Guide and under the statement of intent (see Recommendation 11) and able
to perform them.

                                                         79
  43. The dab should proride a police control room which is:-

    (a) Â«e0 placed, so as to command a good view of the whole pitch and of the spectator are* surrounding it;

    (b) of ssffiaent size for the commander, his deputy and enough officers to operate the radios, telephones
        and CCTV screens. There should be space for others who may need from time to time to visit the room
        eg other senior officers, dub management or a member of the emergency services;

    (c) well equipped with CCTV, radio and telephone fadlities and, where necessary, sound-proofed against
        excessive crowd noise.
                                                             %
  It should be the duty of the club to provide a room and equipment to the satisfaction of the chief officer
nominated under Recommendation 44 below.


Police Planning                                    v
  44. The Chief Constable of each police force in whose area there is one designated sports ground or more
shonld nominate a chief officer to liaise with the management of each football dub and local authority
concerned in respect of the safety and control of crowds.

  45. The Operational Order for each match at a designated sports ground, and the pre-match briefing of all
officers on duty there, should alert such officers to the importance of preventing any overcrowding and, if any is
detected, of taking appropriate steps to remedy i t

  46. The Operational Order for each match at a designated sports ground should enable the police to cope
with any foreseeable pattern in the arrival of spectators at a match and in their departure. It should provide for
snffident.reserves to enable rapid deployment of officers to be made at any point inside or outside the ground.

  47. Police planning should provide that ticketless fans should not be allowed to enter a designated sports
ground except in an emergency.

  48. Arrest procedures inside and outside designated sports grounds should be reviewed so as to keep to the
minimum the period during which an arresting officer is away from his post

  49. The option to postpone kick-off should be in the discretion of the officer in command at the ground.
Crowd safety should be the paramount consideration in deciding whether to exercise it

  50. Consideration in consultation with the dub should be given, espedally for high-risk matches, to the
possibility of an early kick-off or a Sunday fixture.

  51. There should be available in the police control room the results of all closed drcuit television monitoring
outside and inside the ground and the record of any electronic or mechanical counting of numbers at turnstiles
or of numbers admitted to any area of the ground. Officers in the control room should be skilled in the
interpretation and use of these data.

   52. Consideration should be given to the provision of a specific training course for senior officers presently
acting as Police Commanders and those in line to do so. Such a course should include training in the basic
strategy of polidng football matches.

  53. Police authorities should review the charges they make to clubs for the costs of policing inside grounds so
as to ensure that realistic charges are made. The Home Office should take steps to ensure consistency of
practice, subject to local discretion and the need to have regard to local circumstances.


Communications
  54.     There should be sufficient operators in the police control room to enable all radio transmissions to be
received, evaluated and answered. The radio system should be such as to give operators in the control room
priority over, and the capacity to override, others using the same channel. Additional channels should be used,
where necessary, to prevent overcrowding of the airwaves.

                                                       80
  55. There should always be a command channel reserved solely for the Police Commander to communicate
with his senior officers round the ground.

   56. To complement radio communications, there should be a completely separate system of land lines with
telephone links between the control room and key points at the ground.
  57. Within the control room, there should be a public address system to communicate with individual areas
outside and inside the ground, with groups of areas or with the whole ground. Important announcements should
be preceded by a loud signal to catch the attention of the crowd despite a high level of noise in the ground. This
arrangement should be prominently advertised on every programme sold for even' match.
  58. Use should be made where possible of illuminated advertising boards to address the crowd.

Co-ordination o f Emergency Services
   59. The police, fire and ambulance services should maintain through senior nominated officers regular
liaison concerning crowd safety at each designated sports ground.

  60. Before each match at a designated sports ground the police should ensure that the fire service and
ambulance service are given full details about the event, including its venue, its timing, the number of spectators
expected, their likely routes of entry and exit, and any anticipated or potential difficulties concerning the
control or movement of the crowd. Such details should be readily available in the control rooms of each of the
emergency services.

  61. Lines of communication, whether by telephone or by radio, from the police control room to the local
headquarters of all emergency services should be maintained at all times so that emergency calls can be made
instantly:

  62. Contingency plans for the arrival at each designated sports ground of emergency vehicles from all three
services should be reviewed. They should include routes of access, rendezvous points, and accessibility within
the ground itself.

  63. Police officers posted at the entrances to the ground should be briefed as to the contingency plans for the
arrival of emergency services and should be informed when such services are called as to where and why they are
required.

First Aid, M edical Facilities and Ambulances
  64. There should be at each sports ground at each match at least one trained first aider per 1,000 spectators.
The club should have the responsibility for securing such attendance.
                                                    a'

  65. There should be at each designated sports ground one or more first aid rooms. The number of such rooms
and the equipment to be maintained within them should be specified by the local authority after taking
professional medical advice and should be made a requirement of every Safety Certificate.
   66. (a) At every match where the number of spectators is expected to exceed 2,000, the club should employ a
medical practitioner to be present and available to deal with any medical exigency at the ground. He should be
trained and competent in advanced first aid. He should be present at the ground at least an hour before kick-off
and should remain until half an hour after the end of the match. His whereabouts should be known to those in
the police control room and he should be immediately contac^able.

       (b)        At any match where the number of spectators is not expected to exceed 2,000, the club should make
arrangements to enable a medical practitioner to be summoned immediately to deal with any medical exigency
at the ground. He should be trained and competent in advanced first aid. The arrangements made should be
known to those in the police control room. -

  67. At least one fully equipped ambulance from or approved by the appropriate ambulance authority should
be in attendance at all matches with an expected crowd of 5,000 or more.

  68. The number of ambulances to be in attendance for matches where larger crowds are expected should be
specified by the local authority after consultation with the ambulance service and should be made a requirement
of the Safety Certificate.
  69.     A âmajor incident equipment â¼chideâ, designed and equipped to deal with op to 50 casualties, should be
deployed in addition to other ambulance attendance at a match where a crowd in excess of25,000 & expected.


Offences and Penalties â¢
 70. Consideration should be given to creating an offence of selling tickets for and on the day of a football
match without authority from the home dub to do so.

  71. Each of the following activities at a designated sports ground should be made a spedfic offence:-

    i.   throwing a missile;

    iiâ chanting obscene or racialist abuse;

    iii. going on the pitch without reasonable excuse.

  72. Consideration should be given to extending the courts' powers to make attendance centre orders for
football related offences on occasions of designated football matches. The provision should be capable of
imposition on an offender aged 21 or over and subject to a maximum of 72 hours in the case of an offender aged
17 or over.

  73. Consideration should be given to the use of electronic monitoring (tagging) in the sentendng of offenders
convicted of football related offences.


Green Guide                                             '
  74. As a matter of urgency, the Home Office should set up a body to revise the Green Guide in accordance
with this Report, these Recommendations and the Report of the Technical Working Party (Appendix 3).

  75. In any revision of the Green Guide, the values to be achieved by way of percentage recovery after the
required loading tests on crush barriers should be specified. Acceptable values for various materials should be
spedfled.

  76. When the Green Guide is revised, the need to inspect crush barriers for possible corrosion should be
specifically mentioned and emphasised.

PS/Secretary of State
HILLSBOROUGH: COST OF INVESTIGATION BY WEST MIDLANDS POLICE

1.   In his letter (Flag A) of 15 June the Home Secretary seeks
the Chief Secretary's agreement to making a special payment to
help the South Yorkshire police authority meet the policing costs
of the Hillsborough investigation by the West Midlands police.
The Chief Secretary (Flag B) has now agreed this proposal, which
follows past precedents.    There are no implications for this
Department and no action is currently required.

2.   Lord Ferrers is due to offer this proposal to South
Yorkshire at a meeting this morning.  It is possible that South
Yorkshire will not accept the offer and that the Home Secretary
may then wish to put forward a more generous scheme.    We have
asked Home Office officials to keep us in touch and we' shall
report any developments of interest.

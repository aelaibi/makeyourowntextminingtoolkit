     Dear Mr. Hurd,
                                                                                           'a
     I am writing to draw your attention to the way in which the Police Federation
     was treated over the publication of the Taylor Report on Hillsborough.

      Well aware that the media will require an immediate response from the Police
      Federation, I asked Mr. Chilcott last Thursday if I could see an advance copy in
      order that our comments could be based on knowledge of the contents of the
      Report. However, I was assured that there was no way in which this could be
      done and that the press would not be seeing copies until 11.00 a.m. on Friday.
      The only people who would see copies in advance, I was told, were those who had
      been specifically criticised in the Report. It became clear to me early on
      Friday morning that the media had received the Report before 11.00 a.m. and I
      was told that it had been released to them at 9.30 a.m. This put me in a
      position of having to react to what I was told was in the Report rather than
      what I had read.

      I have in the past, as have my predecessors, complained about the way in which
      the Police Federation is overlooked on such occasions.   On matters of this kind
      it is important that the Federation speaks with knowledge of the facts, but when
      the facts are witheld, as they were in this case, we are placed in an impossible
      position.

      I hope you will do what you can to ensure that this does not happen in the
      future.

      Yours sincerely,




      ALAN EASTWOOD,
      Chairman.

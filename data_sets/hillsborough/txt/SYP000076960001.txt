    I did        not       see      any          fights         or    any    disorder.

          Once       inside          the    ground       I did     not       see    any      signs      saying        where      to     go    to

If     I h ad      seen       such       signs       I think          I would        have         gone    to    the      terracing

instead         because            I prefer          to    stand.

Me     and                    bought       a    programme             each     for     £1     each and          then     walked         to

Once     through             the    turnstiles             there       were       not, m a n y      supporters            about.

I only        recall          suddenly          seeing          a tunnel          entrance          which       was      not   lit      but

                              walked       down       the       tunnel       whi c:h was           about       25--30 y a r d s      long.

I wa s       in P e n         3    in my          position             for a b o u t        an      hour     and      during           this    time

more     and        more          people          were       coming           into       the        Leppings          Lane       terracing         but

I expected               this          for    a    Di g      game.

There        was     singing                and    c h a n t i ng          in our        terraci n g b u t no t a s m u ch a s

No-one         appeared                to    be    in       distress             and     people           where       I stood          generally

appeared            to       be    enjoying             themselves.

During         this          hour,          four    or       five          ti m e s ,    I wa s       pushed          forward          due    to

I'd     go     forward             a    couple          of       yards        each       time        and     then      I ’d go         back    a

couple         of    yards.

This     would           have          happened             to most,          people           in the        terracing.

I do     not        believe             there       wa s         any       organised            pushing          from       behind       it was

I saw        no-one           drinking             or        carrying alcohol                       in the       terracing.

                                During        the     time          I was       in the        terracing           nothing          happened          to    scare       me        or

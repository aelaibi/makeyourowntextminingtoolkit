         The     p o liceman then tried to                 push the       crowd back,           but there was          ticket

         get them            clear   of my door.           I then       closed    it and        locked     it.       I counted

                  M s all       the t urnstiles          had been       closed.         There was a surge              of

         about      500       people mos t l y Notts Forres/               supporters,           they also went             up

         opened for about 2— 3 minu t e s                   at tlYe most.

         The    crowd outside were               s h o u t i n g j We've    got      t i c k e t s 11 and banging          the

         in .

         The    official         then    came    round      looked at       the      figure      on the       turnstile

         wrote      it down on a piece              of     paper.       I had     counted my tickets and                    had

         about      1400.

         We then made            our way to the            room at the          back    of the      south stand.

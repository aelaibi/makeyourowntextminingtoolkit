   Secretary to the Inquiry                               Date    10 January 1990
   Inquiry into the Hillsborough
     Stadium Disaster
   50 Queen Anne's Gate

   SW1H 9AT


^^^Dear Mr Whalley

  Thank you for your letter of 27 November 1989 to the Chairman of this Authority's
  General Purposes Committee.  Councillor Fallon has asked me to respond on the
  following points of general principle, considered important.

   1.   Responsibility for Certification

        It is considered that many local influences play on the creation of a
        safer environment at sports grounds, the position of ground, conditions
        of facilities, policing policy, stewarding and attitude of ground managers
        being but a few.

        While it is accepted that more guidance is required and possibly some
        degree of standardisation of format for certificates, the Local Authority
        along with representatives of the Police, Fire Brigade, Ambulance Service
        and Building Control Authority are in the best position to weight the
        various factors and determine conditions to be applied.

  2.    Annual Certification

        While it is accepted that annual certification may increase the workload
        on local authorities and those concerned with the certification process,
        it gives clear definition to the period of validity of a certificate and
        forces regular reviewing of all conditions.  Certificate Holders have
        clear timescales in which to achieve the various objectives in relation
        to safety matters.

        If concern remains regarding the pressures imposed by annual certification,
        then a satisfactory solution may be to allow the certifying authority to
        decide the life of a certificate but, as an upper limit, this should
        probably be no more than five years.

REPORT TO THE GENERAL PURPOSES COMMITTEE BY THE DIRECTOR OF
ARCHITECTURAL SERVICES


HILLSBOROUGH STADIUM DISASTER
INQUIRY BY LORD JUSTICE TAYLOR
INTERIM REPORT


INTRODUCTION.

The purpose of this report is to bring to Committee's attention
actions taken and proposed following the recommendations of Lord
Justice Taylor in his Interim Report.

SUMMARY

^^e   Interim Report makes &3 recommendations in section U.

The aim of these recommendations is limited and they are Judged
( by His Honour ) to be capable of immediate or early implementation.

The main thrust of the recommendations, as a holding exercise, is to
reduce numbers on the terraces, to increase vigilance and to achieve a
proper balance in crowd control between prevention of disorder and
maintenance of safety.

Lord Justice Taylor contends that the Safety Certificate procedure
should, if it is properly administered and enforced, go far towards
achieving crowd safety.  Recommendations are therefore also concerned
with arrangements for issuing, monitoring, enforcing, reviewing,
amending and renewing General Safety Certificates.

The Secretary of State believes that the appropriate bodies should act
without delay on the Interim Report's r e c o m m e n d a t i o n s ^

The recommendations are in two categories: the 28 asterisked are for
implementation before the start of the season or immediately
thereafter; the remaining 15 will take longer to put into effect.

A further report will be produced in relation to the certification
processes adopted in Lothian.

A more detailed commentary on the recommendations of the Report
will be presented to the next meeting of Committee.

RECOMMENDATION

Committee is requested to note this report.




                                                              PAGE 1
 RECOMMENDATIONS FROM THE INTERIM 'REPORT ON THE HXLLSBOROUGH
 STADIUM DISASTER INQUIRY AND COMMENTS

 t headings and numbering are from Chapter 2*l-The Recommendations ]

MAXIMUM CAPACITIES FOR TERRACES

 *1.  Where a viewing terrace is divided into pens or areas which are
•self-contained, the Safety Certificate should specify the maximum
 number of spectators to be admitted to each such pen or area.

 A pen or area is to be deemed ’’self contained" notwithstanding that it
 has a gate or gates affording access to another pen or area and whether
 such gate or .gates be open or shut.

*2.   Each figure for maximum capacity should be assessed in accordance
 ith Chapter 16 of the Green Guide (’’the Green Guide figure” ) subject
#b the following qualifications: -

(a) In arriving at ’’the Green Guide figure” , proper and realistic
allowance must be made for all factors which should reduce the
permissible density in accordance with the range of maximum figures
specified in paragraphs 221 and 222 of the Green Guide:

(b)  after assessing "the Green Guide figure",   a deduction of 15 %
should be made to improve the safety margin.

Comment

      Clause (a) is already applied in Designated Grounds
      in Lothian

      Clause (b) was applied immediately prior to
      commencement of the 1989/90 season in accordance
      with the requirement of the Interim Report and
      accompanying Scottish Office Directive.

*3.   Arrangements should be made:-

(a)  to limit the number of spectators entering each self-contained pen
or area to the maximum capacity figure assessed in accordance with
Recommendation 2 above either electronically, mechanically, by a
ticketing arrangement, by counting or otherwise, and

(b)  to close off further access to such pen or area when its maximum
capacity is about to be reached.

 Comment

      Grounds within Lothian do not have pens or sub
      divided terraces.  Terracings in themselves are
      however self contained areas and enclosures in
      front of some stands could be considered as pens.

      Enc/

                                                                PAGE 2
                /*V '
 •'    t*   "    .
                        Enclosures and terraced areas already have
                        capacities stated in the Safety Certificate and
                        turnstile arrangements for monitoring numbers.
                        Related control systems will be continually
                        monitored.


      FILLING AND MONITORING TERRACES

      *H.    There should be a written agreement between the club and the
      police setting out their respective responsibilities for crowd safety
      and control and in particular for the filling of each self-contained
      pen or other terraced area and the monitoring of spectators in each
      such pen or area to avoid overcrowding.   Any variation of the agreement
      in respect of an individual match should be agreed in writing in
      advance.


         At each match, there should be on the perimeter track, for each
/-^sSHf-contained pen or other terraced area, a steward (if the club is
^-monitoring that area) or a police offer (if the police are monitoring
  it) whose sole duty is to check crowd conditions in that area for
  possible overcrowding or distress throughout the period the area is
  occupied by spectators.   Whoever is b o appointed should be in addition
  to any other steward or police presence.    He should have ready access
  to the police officer authorised under Recommendation 9 below, and by
  radio to the control room.

      Comment

                            The Chief Constable and the Certificate
                            Holders are in the process of formalising
                            these arrangements.  They may require
                            amendment in the light of experience but in
                            the main reflect current practice and
                            procedure.

                             Additional officers are being deployed in
(~                          carrying out these requirements and other
^                           recommendations.   This will be evaluated, with
                             a likely increase in the charges to the clubs
                             for the policing of some matches.


      FENCES AND GATES

      6.   All police offers and stewards with duties in relation to the
      terraced areas and especially those with duties under Recommendation 5
      above, should be fully briefed and trained with regard to the
      recognition of crowd densities, to the recognition of signs of distress
      and to crowd dynamics.  Training should include demonstrations at the
      ground and photographs, designed to enable stewards and officers to
      recognise different crowd densities.



                                                                              PAGE 3
 Comment

           Stewards are currently trained by the Lothian
           and Borders Fire B r i g a d e on evacuation and
           fire fighting.  The Clubs are responsible for
           other training.  Standards and increased scope
           of training is being reviewed by the Police
           and Fire Service who will bring forward
           recommendations to the Safety Team.        The
           Scottish Ambulance Service have indicated
           their willingness to incorporate emergency
           first aid for stewards as part of their
           ongoing training programme

 *7.  All gates in radial or perimeter fences of pens or other
 self-contained areas should be painted in a different colour from the
^pest of the fence and marked "Emergency Exit".

 Comment

           Certificate Holders have been instructed to
           comply.


 *8.  Where there are perimeter fences, all gates to the pitch should be
 kept fully open during the period when spectators are on the terrace.

 Comment

           Certificate Holders have been instructed to
           comply.


 *9.  There should be in respect of each gate in a perimeter fence (or
 group of gates if they are close together) a police officer authorised
 to decide whether or not to allow spectators through a gate to relieve
 overcrowding.  The officer so authorised in respect of each gate should
 be identified for each match and known to be so by all stewards and
 police officers in that vicinity.  He should be able to make radio
 contact with the control room either himself or via an officer close at
 hand.

 Comment

           The Police have incorporated this requirement
           as part of their operations.


♦10. Suitable and sufficient cutting equipment should be provided by
the club at each ground where there are perimeter fences to permit the
immediate removal of enough fencing to release numbers of spectators if
necessary.  Agreement should be reached as to whether the equipment
should be used by police, the fire brigade or stewards.  Whoever is to
use it should be trained to do so.  Whether to use it should be a
decision of a nominated senior police officer at the ground.

                                                              PAGE U
Comment

          Certificate Holders have been instructed to
          comply with this recommendation.


CRUSH BARRIERS

*11. All crush barriers should be visually inspected immediately for
signs of corrosion.     Any barrier found to be affected by a significant
decree of corrosion should be repaired    or replaced.

Comment

          This is a requirement of current Certificates
          along with mechanical testing of 25% of the
^         barriers.   All Certificate Holders have
■         complied.


*12. The layout of barriers in each pen or terraced area should be
reviewed immediately to ensure that it complies with the criteria
contained in Chapter 9 of the Green Guide.  If it does not, the
assessment of the maximum capacity figure for the pen or terraced
area, in accordance with Recommendation 2 above, should reflect the
fa c t .

Comment

          This review is ongoing.


SAFETY CERTIFICATES

13.  There should be an immediate review of each Safety Certificate
by the responsible local authority, which should consult
the club in respect of which the Certificate is issued, the police, the
fire service, the ambulance service and the building authority.    Such a
review should include   an inspection of the stadium.  Its object
should be to ensure that the operative conditions of the Certificate
are complied with and   to add or substitute any condition shown to be
necessary as a matter   of urgency following the findings and
recommendations in this report.

Comment

          The Safety Team method of operation adopted by
          Lothian ensures consultation between Officers
          of the Region, District, Police and Fire
          Service . The Ambulance Service has recently
          been integrated into the system and a meeting
          of the enlarged Safety Team has been arranged.

          Regular visite to groundB «are :part of the

          frequent contact is maintained between members
          of the Safety Team and the Certificate
          Holders.

          Annual inspections are carried out and follow
          up inspections take place to check on
          compliance.

          All General Safety Certificates will be
          reviewed in the light of the Interim Report.


lft. Any local authority within whose area there exists a sports
stadium designated under the 1975 Act for which no Safety Certificate
   s yet been issued should proceed forthwith to remedy the situation.
#
Comment

     All designated grounds within Lothian have Safety
     Certificates.


15.  Every Safety Certificate should be reviewed by the local authority
at least once annually and each Certificate should require to be
renewed annually.

Comment

          Lothian has pressed for annual certification
          at every opportunity including the response to
          Popplewell and consultation on the 1987 Act.
          The Government rejected this proposal in the
          past and will require to take action within
          the 1975 Act to formally allow Authorities to
          operate Annual Certificates.


16.  Each local authority should review its arrangements for issuing,
monitoring, enforcing, reviewing, amending and renewing Safety
Certificates.  Such review should require that there exists or is
provided an accountable administrative structure whereby the functions
of the local authority are regularly and effectively supervised by
senior officers and elected members and decisions are properly taken in
accordance with the local authority's rules.

Comment

          This recommendation will be the subject of a
          separate r e p o r t .

17.   To assist the local authority in texerciisine its functions, it
should set up an Advisory Group consisting of appropriate members of
its own staff, representatives of the police, of the fire and ambulance
services, of the building authority, of the club and of a recognised
supporters' club.   The Advisory Group's terms of reference should
encompass all matters concerned with crowd safety and should require
regular visits to the ground and attendance at matches.     The Advisory
Group should have a chairman from the local authority, and an effective
procedure;.  Its resolutions should be recorded and it should be
required to produce regular written reports for consideration by the
local authority.

Comment

          This recommendation will be the subject of a
          separate report.


DUTIES OF EACH FOOTBALL CLUB.

*18. Each turnstile should be inspected and its potential rate of flow
measured.  Thereafter, regular inspections should be made to ensure
that each turnstile remains capable of admitting spectators at the rate
anticipated.

*19- The correlation between each viewing area in the stadium and the
turnstiles serving it should be such as to ensure that all the
spectators intended to be admitted to that viewing area can pass
through the turnstiles within one hour.  If that cannot be done, the
capacity of that viewing area should be reduced accordingly.

Comment

     These assessments are being carried out by the
     Safety Team and the Certificate Holders.


*20. Turnstiles should be closed when the permitted capacity of the
area served by them is about to be reached and arrangements should be
made to ensure quick and effective communication with turnstile
operators for this purpose.

Comment

          Within Lothian Region where a capacity crowd
          is anticipated these matches are all ticket
          events.  A Junior FIFA match at Tynecastle
          showed that at times public demand can exceed
          expectation.

          Colour coding of tickets can help to avoid
          this problem.  Computerised turnstile entry
          systems also assist.



                                                           PAGE 7
21.   Closed circuit television 'should be *b o installed jae t o enable
crowd densities outside the ground, within concourse areas and in pens
and other standing areas, to be monitored before and throughout a
match.

Comment

          Within Lothian these facilities are provided
          by the Football Trust and operated by the
          police.  These arrangements will be reviewed
          in terms of facilities.


*22. All signposting for spectators both outside and inside the ground
should be comprehensively reviewed.  It should, in relation to the
arrangements for each match, be unambiguous, eye-catching, simple and
 lear and should be designed to ensure the rapid movement of spectators
#b their appropriate viewing area.

*23. Information on tickets should be unambiguous, simple and clear and
should correlate absolutely with the information provided in respect of
each match both outside and inside the ground.  Retained ticket stubs
should contain information necessary to guide spectators once inside
the ground.

*2 l l . Information on tickets requesting spectators to be in position by
a particular time should be reviewed by clubs in conjunction with the
police to ensure that it corresponds with planned arrangements for
admitting spectators to the ground.

Comment

          Clubs have been instructed to comply.


25.  Each club should consult with a recognised supporters' club as to
the provision of pre-match entertainment aimed at attracting spectators
to the ground in good time.

Comment

          This is for Certificate Holders to consider.


POLICE PLANNING

*26. The Chief Constable of each police force in whose area there is
one designated stadium or more should nominate a chief officer to
liaise with the management of each football club and local authority
concerned in respect of the safety and control of crowds.

Comment

          This was already in operation in Lothian where
          the Assistant Chief Constable Operations is
          the nominated officer.
                                                             PAGE 8
*27. The Operational Order for each match at a designated stadium and
the pre-match briefing of all officers on duty there should alert such
officers to the importance of preventing any overcrowding and, if any
is detected, of taking appropriate steps to remedy it.

*28. The Operational Order for each match at a designated stadium
should enable the police to cope with any foreseeable pattern in the
arrival of spectators at a match and in their departure.  It should
provide for sufficient reserves to enable rapid deployment of officers
to be made at any point inside or outside the ground.

Comment

           These requirements relate to police
^         operational orders and, while substantially
W         already in effect, are being reinforced.


*29. The option to postpone kick-off should be in the discretion of the
officer in command at the ground.  Crowd safety should be the paramount
consideration in deciding whether to exercise it.

Comment

     This clarifies the current position where the Referee's
     assistance is sought as the responsible person.  It is
     the police judgement upon which he relies and in some
     cases the police have historically assumed this
     responsibility.

     Within Lothian no problems have been experienced
     when the officer in charge has approached the
     referee to have kick-off delayed.


30.  There should be available in the police control room the results
of all closed circuit television monitoring outside and inside the
ground and the record of any electronic or mechanical counting of
numbers at turnstiles or of numbers admitted to any area of the ground.
Officers in the control room should be skilled in the interpretation
and use of these data.

Comment

          Closed circuit television is already utilised
          at major grounds.   Spectator entry numbers are
          only available via radio and voice
          communication.   It will be a requirement of
          new Certificates to provide electronic
          readouts and recording facilities in police
          control rooms.



                                                            PAGE 9
 COMMUNICATIONS.

 31.    There should be sufficient operators in the police control room to
 -enable all radio transmissions to be received, evaluated and answered.
 The radio system should be such as to give operators in the control
 room priority and, the capacity to override, others using the same
 channel.    Additional channels should be used, where necessary, to
 prevent overcrowding of the airwaves.    Consideration should be given to
 sound-proofing the control room against excessive crowd noise.

 Comment

           Although these requirements are considered to
           be effective within Lothian, they have been
           reviewed and minor improvements instigated.

^^2.   To complement radio communications, there should be a completely
  separate system of land lines with telephone links between the control
  room and key points at the ground.

 Comment

           This requirement will be considered by the
           Chief Constable.

 33*  Within the control room, there should be a public address system
 to communicate with individual areas outside and inside the ground,
 with groups of areas or with the whole ground.   Important announcements
 should be preceded by a loud signal to catch the attention of the crowd
 despite a high level of noise in the ground.   This arrangement should
 be prominently advertised on every programme sold for every match.

 Comment

           Clubs have already been requested to provide
           acousticians’ reports on their systems.  All
           systems currently required to have back-up and
           override facilities.


 3^.  Use should be made where possible of illuminated advertising
 boards to address the crowd.  Consideration should also be given to the
 use by police officers of a simple code of hand signals to indicate to
 the control room the existence of certain emergencies or requirements.

 Comment

           The first part of this requirement is
           dependent upon what facilities exist and are
           generally acceptable.  The operational methods
           adopted by the police are matters for the
           Chief Constable who is considering the
           recommendation.


                                                             PAGE 10
CO-ORDINATION OF EMERGENCY SERVICES

*35. The police, fire and ambulance services should maintain through
senior nominated officers regular liaison concerning crowd safety at
each stadium.

*36. Before each match at a designated stadium, the police should
ensure that the fire service and ambulance service are given full
details about the event, including its venue, its timing, the number of
spectators expected, their likely routes of entry and exit, and any
anticipated or potential difficulties concerning the control or
movement of the crowd.  Such details should be readily available in the
control rooms of each of the emergency services.

*37. Contingency plans for the arrival at each designated stadium of
emergency vehicles from all three services should be reviewed.  They
 hould include routes of access, rendezvous points, and accessibility
«ithin the ground itself.

*38. Police officers posted at the entrances to the ground should be
briefed as to the contingency plans for the arrival of emergency
services and should be informed when such services are called as to
where and why they are required.

REPORT T O THE GENERAL "PURPOSES COMMITTEE BY THE DIRECTOR OF
ARCHITECTURAL SERVICES


COMMENTS ON THE RECOMMENDATIONS OF THE
HILLSBOROUGH STADIUM DISASTER
INTERIM REPORT


INTRODUCTION.

The report to Committee on the 2 k August 1989 identified the
actions taken and to be taken to implement Lord Justice Taylor's
( L J T ’s) recommendations.

The purpose of this report is to comment in more depth on the
j p c o m m e n d a t i o n s of the Interim Report.

SUMMARY

The 43 recommendations are contained in section k of the Interim Report
and are in two categories: 28 were asterisked for
implementation before the start of the season or immediately
thereafter, the remaining 15 will take longer to put into effect.

In general the report is welcomed as a reminder that permanent
vigilance is required and improvements can always be made.   In the
final analysis, however, the greatest burden will always fall on those
in control in the event of an incident.  No matter how good the
infrastructure there is always the potential for. disaster when large
numbers of people gather together.  The certification process is
primarily concerned with establishing reasonable levels of safety.    The
quality of decisions made and the actions taken by those in charge on
the day will always be crucial in the event of a maj or incident.

COMMENTS ON THE RECOMMENDATIONS OF THE INTERIM REPORT ON THE
HILLSBOROUGH STADIUM DISASTER INQUIRY AND COMMENTS

t headings        an d   numbering        ar e   from     Chapter     2il-The R e c o m m e n d a t i o n s   ]

MAXIMUM      CAPACITIES         FO R T E R R A C E S

*1.  Where a viewing terrace is divided into pens or areas which are
self-contained, the Safety Certificate should specify the maximum
number of spectators to be admitted to each such pen or area.

A pen or area is to be deemed "self contained" notwithstanding that it
has a gate or gates affording access to another pen or area and whether
such gate or gates be open or shut.

Comment

                 The 1975 Safety of Sports Grounds Act clause
                 2 ( 2 ) (a) states in relation to the content of a
                 safety certificate that it "may specify the maximum
                 number to be admitted to different p a r t s ” .

                 L J T ’s recommendation uses ’’sho ul d” in lieu of ’’m a y ”
                 but "shall” is probably the most appropriate form
                 (used elsewhere in the 1975 Act) to ensure that
                 each self contained area has a capacity specified
                 in the General Safety Certificate (GSC).

                 To some degree crowds will find their own level of
                 comfort and move away from problems given the
                 opportunity to spread out.  It is therefore
                 imperative that where the ability to spread is
                 physically restricted, particularly over smaller
                 areas, the maximum capacity of an area is clearly
                 indicated to allow control.
              All -self contained areas at ^grounds within Lothian
              already have capacities stated i n the G S C b and
              turnstile arrangements for monitoring numbers.

    *2.   Each figure for maximu m capacity should be assessed in accordance
    with Chapter 16 of the Green Guide (’’the Green Guide figur e” ) subject
    to the following q u a l i f i c a t i o n s :-

    (a) In arriving at ’’the Green Guide figure’’, proper and realistic
’   allowance must be made for all factors which should reduce the
    permissible density in accordance with the range of maximum figures
    specified in paragraphs 221 and 222 of the Green Guide;

    (b)  after assessing ’’the Green Guide fig ure ” , a deduction of 15%
    should be made to improve the safety margin.

    Comment

    ^         The Green Guide has no statutory force and although
              revised following the Bradford disaster its
              position remained unchanged.

              LJT considers that the Guide should not be
              Interpreted too liberally particularly in regard to
              basic requirements such as density of spectator
              packing, access gates, crush barriers, etc.

              The standing of the guide and its contents will be
              considered in stage two of the inquiry.

              Clause (a) highlights the need to work back from
              the maximum densities making due allowance for
              conditions found.   The maximum figures are for
              perfect conditions and LJT was concerned that
              realistic reductions reflecting actual conditions
              were not being made.

              There is, however, no objective method for
              calculating the reduction for some factors such as
              condition of terracing and some level of
              "negotiation” is possible within the perameters
              established by the Green Guide.

              Clause (b) effectively reduces the Green Guide
              scale of density from between 5& and 27 persons per
              10 square metres to between l i 6 and 23 persons per
              10 square metres.  Although the reduction is to
              some degree arbitrary, the original guideline
              figures may be considered to have been arrived at,
              to some degree, in a similar manner.

              It follows that where terracing capacities were
              limited by assessment in line with the Green Guide,
              a subsequent reduction is inevitable by the
              application of this recommendation.

                                                                  page   2
*3.   Arrangements should be made:-

 (a) to limit the number of spectators entering each self-contained
pen or area to the maximum capacity figure assessed in accordance with
Recommendation 2 above either electronically, mechanically, by a
ticketing arrangement, by counting or otherwise, and

(b) to close off further access to such pen or area when its
maximum capacity is about to be reached.

Comment

          Clause (a) requires systems to be established to
          ensure that areas do not exceed their certified
          capacities.  To allow prompt action the necessary
          information must be available to those in control
          on an Instantaneous basis.  Experience indicates
          that only by use of a computer system, with details
™         immediately available to the Police Offic er in
          charge in the Police control room, can prompt
          action be taken.

          It is intended to require all designated grounds    in
          Lothian to be provided with computerised entry
          systems by the start of the 1990/91 season.

          Clause (b) effectively prohibits further admittance
          to areas that have reached capacity.  While as a
          basic premise and in the light of Hillsborough this
          may appear to be unquestionable, strict adherence
          to such statements could create problems.

          The requirement is inflexible and does not
          recognise the situations where the lesser risk may
          be to allow some level of over- packing in a
          managed situation.   Such explicit requirements will
          restrict the course of options available in the
          event of an incident.

FILLING AND MONITORING TERRACES

*4.  There should be a written agreement between the club and the
police setting out their respective responsibilities for crowd safety
and control and in particular for the filling of each self-contained
pen or   other terraced area and the monitoring of spectators in each
such pen or area to avoid overcrowding.    Any variation of the agreement
in respect of an individual match should be agreed in writing in
advance.

Comment

          Thi3 clause al a s to minimise ambiguity in
          operational responsibilities f o r crowd control and
          safety.  The formality of the new arrangement
          should assist in checking that all responsibilities
          are allocated.
                                                              PAGH &
*5•   At each match, there should be on the p e rime ter track, for
each self-contained pen or other terraced area, a steward (If the club
is monitoring: that area) or a police officer (if the police are
mo nitoring it) whose sole duty is to check crowd conditions in that
area for possible overcrowding or distress throughout the period the
area is occupied by spectators,   Whoe ver is so appointed should be in
addition to any other steward or police presence.      He should have ready
access to the police officer authorised under Recommendation 9 below,
and by radio to the control room.

Comment

          Although recognising the need for this duty at
          events with capacity or anticipated near capacity
          crowds, at other times it could be a waste of
          valuable resources both financially and in manpower
•         terms.  Some cognisance should be taken of the
          actual attendance compared with the allowable
          capacity when deciding the need for this degree of
          monitoring.

FENCES AND GATES

6.    All police officers and stewards with duties in relation to the
terraced areas and especially those with duties under Recommendation 5
above, should be fully briefed and trained with regard to the
recognition of crowd densities, to the recognition of signs of distress
and to crowd dynamics.   Training should include demonstrations at the
ground and photographs, designed to enable stewards and officers to
recognise different crowd densities.

Comment

          This clause appears misplaced and fits more
          comfortably in the previous section.

          Training for police officers and stewards in this
          area is essential to minimise reliance on
          subjective judgement.

          The standard and increased scope of training to
          include this requirement are being reviewed by the
          Police, Fire Brigade and Scottish Ambulance
          Service.  Increased duties of stewards along with a
          higher standard of training will require a more
          professional approach to their duties.   The                 v
          difficulty of holding live exercises for stewards
          must be overcome, as some practical test of theory
          is always desirable prior to "the real t h i ng” .

*7.  All gates in radial or perimeter fences o f pens or other
self-contained areas should be painted in a different colour from the
rest of the fence and marked "Emergency Exit".
Comment

          This is a reasonable requirement to help identify
          emergency escape facilities.  Further
          consideration, however, will have to be i i v e n to
          marking. for when the gates are open the signs are
          not visible.  Some form of high level indication
          that does not obstruct viewing is one answer.

* 8 . Where there are perimeter fences, all gates to the pitch should be
kept fully open during the period when spectators are on the terrace.

Comment

          LJT was unable to decide in the time available
          whether to recommend the removal or retention of
          perimeter fences and opted for the status quo but
          with gates being left open.

          While recognising the problems associated with
          perimeter fences, those used in Lothian are not of
          the scale utilised at Hillsborough and operate as a
          deterrent without creating necessarily the dangers
          of the more substantial structures.   If fences were
          to be removed, considerably more manp owe r (police
          and stewards) would have to be deployed and
          officials and police may be subjected to greater
          risks of injury in the event of an incident.

          It is generally considered at this time that the
          retention of perimeter fences along with the
          provision of suitable emergency egress gates onto
          the pitch is the most appropriate method of control
          for terraced areas.

*9.  There should be in respect of each gate in a perimeter fence
(or group of gates if they are close together) a police officer
authorised to decide whether or not to allow spectators through a gate
to relieve overcrowding.  The officer so authorised in respect of each
gate should be identified for each match and known to be so by all
stewards and police officers in that vicinity.  He should be able to
make radio contact with the control room either himself or via an
officer close at hand.

Comment

          This clause again requires clear allocation of
          responsibility.  It must be assumed that the
          responsibility relates not only to overcrow ding -
          for if the other recommendations are followed this
          should not happen - but to distress in the crowd
          for whatever reason.      T h e responsibility to close
          the zates in the e v e n t of an incident must also be
          clearly allocated otherwise the retention of gates
          becomes an anachromism.

                                                                PAGE 5

 * 1 0 . Suitable and sufficient cuttine equipment (Should be provided by
 the club at each ground where there are perimeter fences to permit the
 immediate removal of enough fencing to release numbers of spectators if
 necessary.     Agreement should be reached as to whet her the equipment
 should be used by police, the fire brigade or stewards.      Whoever is to
 use it should be trained to do so-     Whether to use it should be a
 decision of a nominated senior police officer at the ground.

 Comment

           This equipment will be required to be used with
           caution.  It is possible that the resulting
           conditions may present a greater hazard than that
           which previously existed.

 CRUSH BARRIERS

j^.1. All crush barriers should be visually inspected immediately for
^ R g n s of corrosion. Any barrier found to be affected by a significant
 degree of corrosion should be repaired or replaced.

Comment

           The Green Guide [currently followed in Lothian]
           recommends that   Certificate Holders arrange for
           inspection and testing of crush barriers on an
           annual basis.   As well as a visual inspection of
           all barriers, 25% are subjected to mechanical
           testing on a rotating basis.

           The 1987 Act stipulates that inspections of
           designated sports grounds be in accordance with
           guidance set by the Secretary of State.  Current
           requirements in relation to crush barriers are that
           10% of barriers are visually inspected by a member
           of the safety team as part of an annual inspection
           process.

*12. The layout of barriers in each pen or terraced area should be
reviewed immediately to ensure that it complies with the criteria
contained   in Chapter 9 of the Green Guide.  If it does not, the
assessment of the maximum   capacity figure for the pen or terraced
area, in accordance with Recommendation 2 above, should reflect the
fact.

Comment

           This review is ongoing but should it appear that a
           further lowering of the capacity limits is
           necessary discussions will take place with the
           affected Certificate Holder prior to
           implementation.

SAFETY CERTIFICATES

13.  There should be an immediate review of each Safety Certificate
by the responsible local authority, which should consult
the club in respect of which the Certificate is issued, the police, the
fire service, the ambulance service and the building authority.     Such a
review should include   an inspection of the stadium.  Its object
should be to ensure that the operative conditions of the        Certificate
are complied with and   to add or substitute any condition shown to be
necessary as a matter   of urgency following the findings and
recommendations in this report.

Comment

                It is considered that within Lothian, because of
                the regular interface between the Certificate
                Holders and the Safety Team, there is a continual
                ongoing review of the Safety Certificates.

                The Safety Team method of operation adopted by
                Lothian ensures consultation between Officers of
                the Region, District, Police and Fire Service.   The
                Ambulance Service has recently been integrated into
                the system.

                Members of the Safety Team now attend capacity
                events, and lesser events as c onsidered necessary.

                A Safety Register is provided for each ground,
                which incorporates forms for completion in relation
                to the various checks and inspections that are
                required to comply with the GSC.

                Improvements in procedures are possible however and
                certificates do require updating to reflect current
                agreements on various aspects.

Comment

          All designated grounds within Lothian have Safety
          Cert i f i c a t e s .


15.  Every Safety Certificate should be reviewed by the local authority
at least once annually and each Certificate should require to be
renewed annually.

Comment

          This is one of the most important recommendations
          and should be of considerable assistance to the
          certifying authority in gaining compliance with
          General Safety Certificates.

          Lothian has pressed for annual certification at
          every opportunity including the response to
          Popplewell and consultation on the 1987 Act.  The
          Government rejected this proposal in the past and
          may require to take action within the 1975 Act to
          regularise the operation of Annual Certificates.

          To allow the Certificate Holders to comply with the
          conditions of new certificates, it will be
          necessary to indicate likely requirements
          at an early stage.  It is intended that draft
          certificates be available for discussion with the
          clubs before the new year.


1 6 . Each local authority should review its arrangements for issuing,
monitoring, enforcing, reviewing, amending and renewing Safety
Certificates.   Such a review should require that there exists or is
provided an accountable administrative structure whereby the functions
of the local authority are regularly and effectively supervised by
senior officers and elected members and decisions are properly taken in
accordance with the local authority's rules.

17.  To assist the local authority in exercising its functions, it
should set up an Advisory Group consisting of appropriate members of
its own staff, representatives of the police, of the fire and ambulance
services, of the building authority, of the club and of a recognised
supporters' club.  The Advisory Group's terms of reference should
encompass all matters concerned with crowd safety and should require
regular visits to the ground and attendance at matches.  The Advisory
Group should have a chairman from the local authority, and an effective
procedure.  Its resolutions should be recorded and it should be
required to produce regular written reports for consideration by the
local authority.




                                                              ?AGi, 5
Comment

          Recommendations 16 and 17 will be the subject
          of a separate report following consultation
          with members of the Safety Team and
          Certificate Holders.

DUTIES OF EACH FOOTBALL CLUB.

*18. Each turnstile should be inspected and its potential rate of flow
measured.   Thereafter, regular inspections should be made to ensure
that each turnstile remains capable of admitting spectators at the rate
anticipated.

Comment

          Other than ensuring mechanical effectiveness and
          operator performance, the potential rate of flow
          can only be judged by empirical methods.  This has
          been carried out by members of the safety team at
          various events.

          The maintenance and management of equipment to
          ensure that it operates as expected is clearly the
          responsibility of the Certificate Holder and is
          covered within current certificates.

*19. The correlation between each viewing area in the stadium and the
turnstiles serving it should be such as to ensure that all the
spectators intended to be admitted to that viewing area can pass
through the turnstiles within one hour.  If that cannot be done, the
capacity of that viewing area should be reduced accordingly.

Comment

          These assessments are the responsibility of the
          certifying authority and have been carried out.   It
          is considered that all grounds are provided with
          suitable numbers of turnstiles to meet the above
          requirements based on current capacities.   Data
          from operational situations were considered along
          with Green Guide information.  It must however be
          borne in mind that if spectators do not arrive
          timeously or the turnstiles are not operated
          effectively then congestion is inevitable.   Some
          grounds could be improved further by increasing the
          number of turnstiles and providing greater
          capability to cope with late arrivals.   At other
          grounds improvement would be very difficul't due to
          physical constraints outwith the control of the
          Cl-ufc.

*20. Turnstiles 3houid be closed when the permitted capacity of the
area served by them is about to be reached and arrangements should be
made to ensure quick and effective communication with turnstile
operators for this purpose.

Comment

          Within Lothian Region where a capacity crowd is
          anticipated these matches are all-ticket events in
          an attempt to avoid lockout situations developing,
          as these have the potential for causing
          considerable problems outwith the ground.   Colour
          coding of tickets is also used to avoid the problem
          of overcrowding in individual areas and assist with
          spectator segregation.   Communication of
          information from turnstiles to the Police Command
          Post is capable of improvement and will be covered
          in the new certificates.   [See comment on clause
          30].

^1.   Closed circuit television should be so installed as to enable
(®*owd densities outside the ground, within concourse areas and in pens
 and other standing areas, to be monitored before and throughout a
 match.

Comment

          Within Lothian this equipment was provided by the
          Football Trust and operated and maintained by the
          police.  These arrangements have been reviewed, but
          only minor improvements were considered necessary

          These facilities are not utilised for minor events.
          The clause is unclear as to whether or not it is
          intended that it should apply at all grounds at all
          events.  If provision at all grounds is intended
          then costs may be substantial.

*22. All signposting for spectators both outside and inside the ground
should be comprehensively reviewed.  It should, in relation to the
arrangements for each match, be unambiguous, eye-catching, simple and
clear and should be designed to ensure the rapid movement of spectators
to their appropriate viewing area.

*23. Information on tickets should be unambiguous, simple and clear and
should correlate absolutely with the information provided in respect of
each match both outside and inside the ground.  Retained ticket stubs
should contain information necessary to guide spectators once inside
the ground.

*2H.   Information on tickets requesting spectators to be in position by
a particular* time should be reviewed by clubs in conjunction with the
police to ensure that it corresponds with planned arrangements for
admit'l n z s p e c t a t o r s to the sround.




                                                            PAGE
Comment

          Recommendations 22 to ZU are relatively simple
          matters and it is accepted that there is scope for
          improvement.  Clubs have been instructed to comply
          and the Safety Team will be considering their
          proposals.

25.  Each club should consult with a recognised supporters* club as to
the provision of pre-match entertainment aimed at attracting spectators
to the ground in good time.

Comment

          It is a matter of some conjecture if fans will come
          early for supporting entertainment - unless, of
          course, it is of a professional quality, in which
          case the cost is likely to be reflected in
•         admission charges.  This is a mat t e r for
          Certificate Holders and s u p p o r t e r s ’ clubs to
          consider.

POLICE PLANNING

*26. The Chief Constable of each police force in whose area there is
one designated stadium or more should nominate a chief officer to
liaise with the management of each football club and local authority
concerned in respect of the safety and control of crowds.

Comment

          The aim of this is to clearly identify
          responsibility.  This was already in operation in
          Lothian where the Assistant Chief Constable
          Operations is the nominated officer.


*27. The Operational Order for each match at a designated stadium and
the pre-match briefing of all officers on duty there should alert such
officers to the importance of preventing any overcrowding and, if any
is detected, of taking appropriate steps to remedy it.

*28. The Operational Order for each match at a designated stadium
should enable the police to cope with any foreseeable pattern in the
arrival of spectators at a match and in their departure.  It should
provide for sufficient reserves to enable rapid deployment of officers
to be made at any point inside or outside the ground.




Comment

          These requirements relate to police operational
          orders.  Within Lothian, while substantially
          already in effect, they are being reinforced.
                                                              PAGE 12
*29. The option to postpone kick-off "should be in the d iscretion of the
officer in command at the ground.  Crowd safety should be the paramount
consideration in deciding whether to exercise it.

Comment

          This clarifies the previous position where the
          Referee's assistance was sought as the responsible
          person.  It is clearly now the command officer's
          responsibility as to whether the kick-off should be
          delayed.


30.  There should be available in the police control room the results
of all closed circuit television monitoring outside and inside the
ground and the record of any electronic or mechanical counting of
  mbers at turnstiles or of numbers admitted to any area of the ground,
• ficers in the control room should be skilled in the interpretation
  and use of these data.

Comment

          Closed circuit television is already utilised at
          major grounds.  Spectat or entry numbers are only
          available via radio and voice communication and
          this ie an area that can be improved.   It will be a
          requirement of new Certificates to provide
          electronic readouts and recording facilities from
          all turnstiles in police control rooms.

COMMUNICATIONS.

31.  There should be sufficient operators in the police control room to
enable all radio transmissions to be received, evaluated and answered.
The radio system should be such as to give operators in the control
room priority and the capacity to override others using the same
channel.  Additional channels should be used, where necessary, to
prevent overcrowding of the airwaves.  Consideration should be given to
sound-proofing the control room against excessive crowd noise.

Comment

          Although these requirements are considered to be
          effective within Lothian, they have been reviewed
          and minor improvements instigated.  With the
          attendance of ambulance personnel with their own
          radios some problems have been experienced.  The
          relevant communications officers are attempting to
          resolve the problems.

          While most control rooms are satisfactory, that at
          Tynecastle Park requires to be replaced to the
          latest standards.  Heart of Midlothian FC have
          given an undertaking to provide the new facilities
          during the current season.
                                                           PAGE 12
'32. To complement radio communications, there should be a completely
separate system of land lines with telephone links between the control
room and key points at the ground.

Comment

             This requirement will be considered by the Chief
             Constable.  While the need at major grounds and in
             ideal circumstances is accepted, the all-embracing
             requirement at all grounds is questionable.

33.   Within the control room, there should be a public address system
to communicate with individual areas outside and inside the ground,
with groups of areas or with the whole ground.   Important announcements
should be preceded by a loud signal to catch the attention of the crowd
despite a high level of noise in the ground.   This arrangement should
    prominently advertised on every programme sold for every match.

Comment

             The need for a PA system that covers all areas of
             the ground as well as outside the ground is
             accepted.  It is suggested however that a separate
             system operated from the control room is not
             required.  Total override of all systems from the
             control room is required and the speech clarity as
             well as volume are important factors.

34. Use should be made where possible of illuminated advertising
boards to address the crowd.  Consideration should also be given to the
use by police officers of a simple code of hand signals to indicate to
the control room the existence of certain emergencies or requirements.

Comment

            The better the quality of information available to
            spectators, the greater chance there is of them
            responding in the required manner.The first part of
            this requirement is dependent upon what facilities
            exist.  At this stage no decision has been made to
            make the provision of visual information systems a
            certificate condition.

CO-ORDINATION OF EMERGENCY SERVICES

*35- The police, fire and ambulance services should maintain through
senior nominated officers regular liaison concerning crowd safety at
each stadium.


* 3 6 . Before   each m a t c h at a designated s t a d i u m , t h e p o l i c e should
ensure that      the fire service and ambulance service a r e given fu ll
details about the event, including its venue, its timing, the number of
spectators expected, their likely routes of entry and exit, and any
anticipated or potential difficulties concerning the control or
                                                           PAGE 1-
movement of the crowd.  Such details should be readily available in the
control rooms of each of the emergency services.

*37. Contingency plans for the arrival at each designated stadium of
emergency vehicles from all three services should be reviewed.  They
should include routes of access, rendezvous points, and accessibility
within the ground itself.

*38. Police officers posted at the entrances to the ground should be
briefed as to the contingency plans for the arrival of emergency
services and should be informed when such services are called as to
where and why they are required.

FIRST AID,    MEDICAL FACILITIES AND AMBULANCES

*39. There should be at each stadium at each match at least one trained
first aider per 1,000 spectators.  The club should have the
responsibility for securinj such attendance.

Comment

             While guidance on basic provision is of assistance,
             the quality of the provision is equally important.

             Within Lothian the Scottish Ambulance Service
             advises the Safety Team and the St Andrews
             Ambulance Service generally supplies first aid
             facilities at most events.  Both are being
             consulted regarding requirements for new
             certificates.

40.  There should be at each stadium one or more first aid rooms.   The
number of such rooms and the equipment to be maintained within them
should be specified by the local authority after taking professional
medical advice and should be made a requirement of any Safety
Certificate.


*41. The club should employ a aedicai prac'i'ionar to beprssent a;
each match and available to deal with any medical, exigency at the
ground.   H e should. be- trained and competent in advanced firs* aid.  He
should be present- at the ground at least- an' hour before kick-off and
3 Aould remain until half an hour- after the- and of the match..  His
whereabouts should be known to those in the police' control room and he
should be immediately contactable.
*4.2. At l«ast one fully ^equipped ^ambulance from the ^appropriate
ambulance authority should be in attendance ;at all matches with an
expected crowd of 5.000 or more.

i»3. The number of ambulances to be in attendance for matches where
larger crowds are expected should be specified by the local author!
after consultation with the ambulance service and should be made a
requirement of the Safety Certificate.

Comment

          There is general agreement with the clauses in this
          section.  The tenor is more in line with previous
          legislation and guidance than other sections of the
          report and allows local conditions to be taken into
          account.

          The ambulance service have advised that the
          guidelines for emergency units at matches are:

          Crowd    5000 - 25000   1 accident   & emergency   unit
                  25000 - 45000   2 accident   & emergency   units
                  45000+          3 accident   & emergency   units

          New Certificates will specify these requirements
          and Clubs are currently complying with this
          requirement although in some instances the wider
          benefits of the Ambulance Service being available
          are having to be emphasised.

RECOMMENDATION

Committee is requested to note this report.

REPORT TO THE GENERAL PURPOSES COMMITTEE BY THE DIRECTOR OF
ARCHITECTURAL SERVICES


INTERIM REPORT BY LORD JUSTICE TAYLOR ON THE HILLSBOROUGH
DISASTER
Safety Certificates - Review of Administrative Procedures



INTRODUCTION.

Recommendation 16 of the Interim Report states

     "Each local authority should review its arrangements for
     issuing, monitoring, enforcing, reviewing, amending and
     renewing Safety Certificates.  Such review should
     require that there exists or is provided an accountable
     administrative structure whereby the functions of the
     local authority are regularly and effectively supervised
     by senior officers and elected members and decisions are
     properly taken in accordance with the local authority's
     rules."


OUTLINE OF CURRENT PRACTICES

The authority of the Committee is delegated to the Director of
Architectural Services in accordance with the General Purposes
Committee decision of November 1976.

Current General Safety Certificates have an indeterminate life.

A Safety Team, comprising representatives of Police, Fire
Brigade, Ambulance Service, and Building Control Departments of
the District Councils as well as DAS technical staff, meets
regularly and formally under the Chairmanship of the Department
of Architectural Services to consider all matters in relation to
Safety at Sports Grounds.

Annual inspections of all designated grounds are carried out by
the Safety Team and Certificate Holders are required to provide
test certificates and reports relating to crush barriers,
electrical installation, fire extinguishers etc.

Meetings are held with Certificate Holders to consider their
response to the annual inspection reports 'findings and
recommendations.

Ad hoc meetings are held with Certificate Holders as necessary
to consider alterations to stadia, stewarding etc.
 Pre-season inspections are carried out to ensure that any major
 items requiring action by the Certificate Holders have been
 attended to.

 To assist Certificate Holders in complying with the requirements
 of the General Safety Certificate, Safety Registers have been
 provided for each ground.  A copy has been placed in the
 Members' library for information.

 In addition to the normal operational presence of the Police at
 all events, members of the Safety Team attend anticipated
 capacity crowd events.  Any follow up action is pursued with
^j^rtificate Holders as appropriate.

Applications for Special Safety Certificates for pop concerts,
fireworks displays, etc, are considered by the Safety Team, and
consultation with technical officers of the District Council's
Entertainments Licences Section is normally required to ensure
consistency.  Any special requirements for a particular event
are incorporated into a Special Safety Certificate.

Reporting to Committee is currently on an ad hoc basis.


PROPOSALS

While it is considered that current practices are generally
effective, improvements are always possible.

The following would improve effectiveness and assist in keeping
Committee advised of matters in relation to Safety of Sports
Grounds.

1) The Director of Architectural Services should report annually
   to Committee on any major outstanding matters and review
   events of the previous year.

2) Annual Certification in line with recommendation 15 of Lord
   Justice Taylor's Interim Report should be adopted.

9) Committee should be appraised of the content of all new
   General Safety certificates prior to issue.

4) Committee should be advised of any substantive amendments
   made to General safety certificates including changes to
   spectator capacities.

5)   A programme of bi-annual visits by members to designated
     grounds should be instigated.
 RECOMMENDATIONS

 It   is recommended that

 1)   Current practices are noted.

 2)   The proposals contained in this report are approved.

 3)    The authority of Committee in terms of the Safety of
      Sports Grounds Act 1975 and subsequent amendments including
      the Fire Safety and Safety of Places of Sports Act 1986
      continue to be delegated to the Director of Architectural
       Services, his duties to be performed in consultation with the
■P     Director of Highways and Regional Solicitor as necessary and
      along with the Chief Constable, the Firemaster, the Building
      Control Department of the District Councils, and the Scottish
      Ambulance Service.

REPORT TO THE GENERAL PURPOSES COMMITTEE BY THE        ] 3 DEC   ^9
DIRECTOR OF ARCHITECTURAL SERVICES

INTERIM REPORT BY LORD JUSTICE TAYLOR ON THE HILLSBOROUGH DISASTER
Formation of Advisory Groups
Recommendations

INTRODUCTION
Recommendation 17 of the Interim Report states


     To assist the local authority in exercising its
     functions, it should set up an Advisory Group consisting of
     appropriate members of its own staff, representatives of the
     police, of the fire and ambulance services, of the building
     authority, of the club and of a recognised supporters' club.
     The Advisory Group's terms of reference should encompass all
     matters concerned with crowd safety and should require regular
     visits to the ground and attendance at matches.   The Advisory
     Group should have a chairman from the local authority, and an
     effective procedure.   Its resolutions should be recorded and
     it should be required to produce regular written reports for
     consideration by the local authority.

BACKGROUND
If the Council is to apply this recommendation it has to have an
understanding of the circumstances within which the recommendation
was developed.

It would appear from the report that the purpose of the Advisory
Group is to assist the local authority in all aspects of its
function relative to the Safety Certificate procedure.

It is not clear whether or not this Advisory Group is intended to
replace the Officers' Working Group (in Lothian the "Safety Team").
It would appear from the Interim Report that there was an Advisory
Group in Sheffield which, Justice Taylor states, was nothing other
than the South Yorkshire County Council's Officers' Working Group
under another name, with a procedure and working arrangements which
were both casual and unbusinesslike.   It had some sort of
accountability to a General Purposes "Panel" which was ill-defined.
This Panel appears to have had a general responsibility for
licensing a considerable number of diverse premises.   All of this
produced a performance in relation to the Council's duties in
respect of the Safety Certificate which the report describes as
inefficient and dilatory.   Recommendation 17 therefore attempts to
redress this situation.

ARRANGEMENTS IN LOTHIAN
There are basic differences between the local authority functions
and responsibilities in Lothian and those which applied in
                                         - 2 -


      '   Sheffield.   In Lothian the licensing of sports grounds is separate
          from any other licensing responsibilities and the administration of
          the Safety Certificate procedure goes far beyond the Sheffield
          approach with regular meetings of the Safety Team being formally
          minuted and regular ground inspections.

          Architectural Services, Police, Fire, Edinburgh District Building
          Control and the Ambulance authorities are integrated into a well
          co-ordinated team in Lothian.    It would be unfortunate if this
          were to be jeopardised by replacing this team with an Advisory
          Group.   The relationship with the Clubs was, and continues to be,
          one of pressurised consultation.    The balances established by the
          parties involved are fairly delicate, the individual attitudes
          expressed are extremely robust.    If this situation had pertained
          at Sheffield, Recommendation 17 of the Report may have been couched
          somewhat differently.   It has always been the role of the Director
          of Architectural Services to establish the eventual decision where
          complex issues existed and in so doing be accountable to the
          General Purposes Committee.   The respective members of the team
          have always vigorously promoted their individual view points.

          ADVISORY GROUP PROPOSAL
          The recommendation introduces the proposal that there should be,
          within the Advisory Group, a member of a recognised Supporters’
          Club.   This would be an innovation which would seem to be
          worthwhile.

          The views and interests of the end user have, as in so many other
          areas, been proferred by others who would claim to know what the
          supporters want, expect, would put up with, and therefore need.
          It would be interesting to have such views tested.

          SUGGESTED APPROACH
          If, as the Safety Team would recommend, it should continue to
          operate independently as before the question arises as to their
          role within the Advisory Group.    Although it might appear
          cumbersome it would  be reasonable to consider that the Safety Team
          be co-opted members   of the Advisory Group, on the basis that this
\ j       Group is largely a "Users" group, the Users being in the Interim
          Report's terms, the Club and Supporters who, possibly augmented by
          other interests, would consider among other things the intentions
          and representations  of the Safety Team.    The Advisory Group should
          be chaired by a local authority chairperson as recommended by the
          Interim Report.   Their advice, reactions to events and considered
          opinions etc. would be offered to the General purposes Committee in
          the form required by the Interim Report.

          The Safety Team's operations would not, in such circumstances, be
          compromised by their being executive members of the Advisory Group.
          The General Purposes Committee would receive reports from the
          Director of Architectural Services and from the Advisory Group.
          It is anticipated that in most cases the views would not widely
          diverge.  Preliminary discussions have taken place with
          representatives of Heart of Midlothian Football Club and Hibernian
                                 - 3 -

 Football Club who indicated their willingness to be represented on
 the Advisory Groups.

 RECOMMENDATIONS
 It is recommended:

 1.   That the General Purposes Committee adopt Recommendation 17 of
 the Interim Report by Lord Justice Taylor on the Hillsborough
 Disaster and form Advisory Groups along the lines indicated in this
 Report.

 2. That in addition to the responsibilities already allocated to
 the Safety Team they further provide support to the Advisory
 Groups.

 3.   That the Committee nominate a chairperson for the Groups with
 the necessary administrative support to ensure that the
 administrative procedures of the Group coincide with the procedures
 of the Committee.

 4.   That meantime two Advisory Groups be formed as follows:

Hibernian Football Club:         Easter Road Stadium
Hearts Football Club:            Tynecastle Park

5.   That Hibernian Football Club and Heart of Midlothian Football
Club be invited to nominate representatives to the Advisory Groups.

6.   That the Hibernian Football Supporters Association and
Federation of Hearts Supporters Clubs be invited to nominate
representatives to the Advisory Groups.

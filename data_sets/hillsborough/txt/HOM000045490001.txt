To:     Lord Justice Stuart-Smith




I attach

                rival versions of Chapter Three of your report (inquest and rescue operation).
                I have marked the changes to your original in pencil. As with Chapters One
                and Two I have suggested a revised opening section to give a bit more context
                The other changes are, I hope you will agree, fairly minor ones;




                 a letter from South Yorkshire police about the height of the barriers issue. As
                 I said when you rang this morning I now have Noel Bume s engineering
                 report for the police, along with those commissioned from other experts by the
                 club and Eastwood’s. This is a big pile of paper, and if time allows I will
                 try to skim it so as to be able to show you the relevant parts when you are back
                 here on January 7;

                  a letter from Superintendent Foster about the changes to statements,

                  a letter from Superintendent Foster following your interviews with him and

                 with Appleton & McCombie. There is an attached further statement by Mr
                 McCombie which you should also see. Mr Foster has some worthwhile
                 things to say about the West Midlands police investigation as a whole on the
                 second page of his letter, which it occurred to me might fit rather well into
                 your report. I have written to him asking whether we can quote it, if you wish
                 to do that; and

                a letter from Dr Slater, commenting on Dr West’s comments about his
                examination of Kevin Williams (also attached).

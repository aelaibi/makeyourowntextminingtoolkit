                             I am a married man and I live at the above address with rny wife and

                             have   lived here for five and a half years -

                             I work as a                      in a                                                I also work as

                             turnstile operator at Hillsborough f o o t b a l 1 ground and have worked at

                             the club since        1967(000067).

                             On gaturday 15th April               1989(150489),               I was working at the ground and

                             came to the ground in my c a r .                   Thj/s woul d be about         11 p r c l ock in the

                             morning.       I came past T he Crown /pub                        house    in Peni/stoi   Rgac 'and I

                             could see about a dozen young                                aring    red scarves stood outside

                             the p u b , it looked like they were/wating for                            it to open.    I was

                             travelling     past quite slowly due to heavy traffic and I saw the front

                             door open and a man who               I presume to be the licensee                  coming out to pu

                             barriers up against the window.
                                                                                          PAGE       2
                                                                                          32911

            Almost simultaneously the young men started to enter the p u b , I d o n ’t

            think they all got    in, and almost as soon as they had got          inside they

            were rejected I carried on through with the flow of traffic,                 parked my

            car an a went   into the Hil ls borough ground.     Later that day whilst
v
              rki/ifc on turnstile number       I was approached by a young man who

             tad/a val-rd' ticket and a ten pound note and what appeared to be

            another ticket and he asked me if that was any good and I told him

            that he had no chance,    at which the man went away.

            The man working opposite my turnstile told me later on that he had

            also been offered money to let people       in, but he had r e f u s e d .

            I d i d n ’t see any of the disaster,   and once I had been relieved from my

            turnstile and I    had handed my tickets    in,   I came horn.

                                                                                         SIGNED

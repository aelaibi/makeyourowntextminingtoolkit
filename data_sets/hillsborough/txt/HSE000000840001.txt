COMMENTS ON THE REVISED GREEN GUIDE - ANNEX DEALING WITH TESTING AND INSPECTION
OF CRUSH BARRIERS AND HANDRAILS

This version appears to be a combination of the Dickson/HSE version and
the Structures Committee version (dated 10/4/90) and, as such, some of the
previous comments on the Structures Committee version no longer apply.

Comments on the latest version of the Annex are as follows:

Obi ective

What is meant by 'established safety factor'? Can this be quantified?

Personnel & Equipment

Reference is made to direct supervision by a qualified engineer. Is
it proposed that a qualified engineer should be present on site during
the tests?

The accuracy required of the force measuring equipment is unrealistic
for site work. Why should the force capacity be twice the maximum test
force? On a 5m barrier the force capacity would have to be 60kN and the
accuracy would have to be 0.1/60 = 0,16%! This is ridiculous.
Have manufacturers and users been contacted to ascertain the accuracy of
the equipment available?

No mention is made of the accuracy required of the deflection measuring
equipment, HSE suggested + 0,5mm and the Structures Committee altered
this to +0.1mm. We remain convinced that the HSE value is preferable.

Testing

There appears to have been a change in philosophy here. It seems that
any test method can be used by agreement. Surely this is a
retrograde step which will introduce even more confusion and, in our
view, weaken the Guide,

Neither of the methods recommended stipulate that the test force should be
horizontal. It is not sufficient to state that the test force should be
applied 'at right angles to the longitudinal axis'.

Test method A

The only alteration, compared with the existing Guide, appears to be
clarification of the datum for measurement of deflection. We do not
accept that 75% recovery after the third application of force is a
sufficiently sensitive measure of acceptability. The re-test procedure is
unclear (how many loadings?) and alteration of the datum before re-test is
unjustifiable. However, this test procedure is less elaborate than test
method B and, if included in the Guide, it is likely to be selected by
most barrier testing organisations. Hence there would be little
improvement over the existing Guide. This is contrary to the
recommendations of the Technical Working Party, set up by Lord Justice
Taylor, which called for a test procedure which incorporated a
bedding-in cycle and a single cycle of proof testing (see Hillsborough
Inquiry Report Appendix 3, paragraph 26). Perhaps the Home Office should
be reminded of this.



                                     -   1   -
For these reasons we believe that this method should be deleted from the
new version of the Guide,

Note: the alteration from 4,3 kN/m in the existing Guide to 4.1 kN/m
(for barriers with spacing B) is correct when the 1.2 x design force
rule is applied.

Test method B

The section dealing with the bedding-in cycle is reasonably consistent
with the HSE/Dickson version. It is gratifying to see that now the
bedding-in force = the design service load, rather than 75% of the
design service load, recommended by the Structures Committee,

There is an inconsistency in the name of the second part of this method
since it is called variously 'proof test', 'proof cycle' and 'the test'.
We would prefer 'proof cycle' throughout.

The proof cycle is to be applied twice (pl04 para 4), Why?
This is a new requirement not included in either previous version.

The use of the 75% recovery criterion (pl04 para 5) is unacceptable.
This allows for upto 15% permanent deflection during the proof cycle.
The whole idea of using a bedding-cycle before the proof cycle is to
minimize the amount of permanent deflection during the proof cycle.
Originally HSE recommended 95% recovery after the proof cycle (using a
datum established after bedding-in) and we strongly support this as
an acceptance criterion.

General comments

There are a number of features of the HSE/Dickson version of the Annex
which were accepted by RLSD as a compromise and which it may now be
appropriate to change :

i) The use of ten increments during the proof cycle - this is
unnecessary and a deterrent to the use this test procedure,

ii) Acceptance criteria expressed in percentage terms only - we would
like to see absolute values included as well, eg no permanent deflection
in excess of 25mm,

iii) Deflections measured in two directions at right angles - whilst
this good idea in principle, it makes the test more complicated and
provides a further deterrent for potential users.

The symbol for kilonewtons is 'kN' not 'KN'!

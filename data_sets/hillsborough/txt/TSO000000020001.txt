  AND BY FAX:

  Dear Sir,

  Hillsborough Enquiry

  We refer to our several telephone conversations in relation to the above
  in connection with which you have asked us to act as your agents,
  primarily with a view to collecting available evidence. We believe it
  would be helpful at the outset to record our understanding of what is
  required.

  Collection of Evidence:

  1.      Broadly, you want us to obtain statements from two categories of
          witnesses -

          (a)         Those who wish to give evidence, but have not to date done so,
                      either because they are unwilling to discuss the matter with the
                      Police or for some other reason;

           (b)        Those whose evidence has already been submitted in some form,
                      but from whom more detailed information is required.

  2.      It is first essential to compile an alphabetical list of the names
          and addresses of all potential witnesses. To that end -

           (a)        You agreed to obtain and let us have a list of those from whom
                      the Police have already obtained statements;

           (b)        We are seeking to obtain a list of those from whom the
                      Hillsborough group of solicitors in Liverpool have obtained
                      statements or unsolicited communications, copies of which we
                      believe have been sent to the Home Office;

       The Treasury Solicitor.

       5th May 1989




            (c)   We are seeking to obtain a list of those from whom the
                  solicitors acting for the Football Supporters' Association have
                  obtained statements, copies of which we again believe have been
                   sent to the Home Office;

            (d)   We are seeking to obtain a list of those from whom the Social
                  Services Department at the University of Liverpool have obtained
                  statements, copies of which we believe have been sent direct to
                  the Home Office;

            (e)   Obviously, it will be necessary to update the list as further
                  witnesses are identified, whether through one of the above
                   sources or otherwise.

       3.   It may be appropriate for us to compile a complete set of all
             statements which have been given to any of the above sources.Please
             let us know if you agree.  If so, please arrange to let us have
            copies of those statements obtained by the Police, together with
            copies of those statements lodged with the Home Office.   We shall
            then seek to obtain locally copies of statements from other witnesses
            falling within 2(b), (c) or (d) above.

       4.   Unless you advise us that a more detailed statement is required, we
            shall assume that there is no need for us to interview those
            witnesses who have already been seen by the Police. We shall also
            assume that there is no need for us to interview those persons
            falling within 2(b), (c) or (d) above, whose statements have been
            submitted to the Home Office.

       5.   We suggest that initially we should seek to interview -

            (a)   those persons falling within 2(b), (c) or (d) above, whose
                  statements have not been submitted to the Home Office, and

            (b)   those persons falling within 2(a), (b), (c) or (d) above, in
                  respect of whom you advise us that a more detailed statement is
                  requ ired,

            (c)   any other persons who have relevant information to impart.

       6.   We find it difficult to decide how best we might identify the other
            persons falling within 5(c) above.  It may be appropriate to make
            some public announcement as to our involvement on your behalf, and to
            invite those concerned to contact us. We have in mind announcements
            in the Local Press, on Local Radio, and perhaps in the programme for
            Liverpool Football Club's next game(s). The wording of any such

            announcement would obviously require careful thought and may require
            the sanction of the Law Society.  If you wish to adopt this
            suggestion, we shall give the matter further thought.

       Other assistance:

       1.   If a conference with Counsel is arranged to discuss the evidence to
             be presented to the Enquiry, we would be pleased to attend that
             conference if this will assist.  In this connection, you may care to
             note that the writer will be in London from late Wednesday afternoon
             until Friday of next week, although obviously we could arrange to
             attend at any other time, should this be necessary.

       2. We understand that you may also require our assistance in connection
           with the Enquiry itself, which is to resume at 10.30 a.m. on 15th May
           at Sheffield Town Hall.  You suggested that you may wish us to make
           arrangements for the attendance of witnesses, for which purpose we
           shall need to know which witnesses Counsel wishes to call. You also
           mentioned that you may wish us to attend with Counsel at the
           hearing.  As you will appreciate, we should welcome your early
           instructions in relation to these matters, so that we can make the
           appropriate arrangements.

TAYLOR REPORT:   ATTENDANCE CENTRES

I am sorry I have not responded before now to your note   of 22 May.

2.     I agree with your reservations about the recommendations in
the Taylor Report, especially the proposal to extend attendance
centres to those over 21.

3.     I also agree that we need to improve the regimes in the
centres, regardless of the recommendations in the Taylor Report.

4.     I think the response to the Taylor Report should recommend
reminding the courts of their existing powers.   We should rule out
any extension to over 21s and point to the risks of using
attendance centre orders for the persistent football hooligans,
and the possible disruption of the work being done with other
offenders.   We should also point out that considerable additional
resources would be needed, both to alter the arrangements in the
present centres to cope with an influx of football hooligans and
to extend the network.   At this stage, I would not wish to float
the possibility of pilot projects, which are unlikely to have any
useful purpose.   However, we can fall back on them, if necessary.

       Mr


       HILLSBOROUGH AND SAFETY OF SPORTSGROUNDS

(. J   In pursuit of the request contained in your note of 22nd August
       1989, I spoke this morning with Mr David Wilmot, Deputy Chief
       Constable of Greater Manchester (in the absence of Mr James
       Anderton, Chairman of the relevant ACPO Committee) about the
       collection of the information requested by the Home Secretary.
       Mr Wilmot expressed willingness to obtain the information from
       forces through ACPO Regional Secretaries as there were some
       advantages to the ACPO Committee by so doing. Accordingly I
       asked him to discuss with you as a matter of urgency the form of
       words to be used in the request to forces. It is hoped that the
       information will be returned by midday on Thursday 24th August
       1989.

       If I can be of further assistance please let me know.

a ssess      the behaviour             of      the    fans    inside.       The    pub was c o m p l e t e l y full

of Notts           fans and      it    issafe to say that               the m a j o r i t y       of them were              the

worse      for drink.            One y o u t h was a c t u a l l y        standing         on a table          in

the     pub leading           the fans         singing.         There was        not however an y signs                     of

outside and v ol u n t e e r e d our services                      should the        pub need           re-visiting.

We    then     continued our             foot      patrol     along P e n i s t o n e Road towards                  the

f o otpaths         leading      up    to    the ground were           heavijry congested w i t h fans

and     from speaking            to    them a         large    n u mber^Je re in f a c t "ticket

we    identified           ourselves         to him,       he said he was           from L i v e r p o o l and

'touted'           on a regular          basis.        He said he o b t ained his tickets                       from

players       of the C l u b and also held a                      large    number         of    'Hop'    season

to buy tickets,               and the high volume             of them even at that                time

s u g ge s t e d that m a n y were            t r avelling    to the game with o u t            tickets.                Thi

m e n t i o ne d wit h i n the grou nd when we a t t e n d e d there                   for    our meal             break

was at a ro u n d         1.30    pm.

At Z pm DC B a gg ul ey and                I returned to our            patrol       as m e n t i o n e d above.

In the short            space     of time we had been away,                   the volume        of s upporters

outside        the ground had            risen dratically.              1' should       point out however

that the          number      of fans a c t u a l l y entering          the    ground was minimal.                       Th

turns t i l e s at the Kop              end showed       no signs       of    c o n g e s t i o n and    the       road

at that        end of the ground was                clear.       Traffic       was mo v i n g     easily           for a

m a t c h of the s t a n da rd that was                taking    place.        At    the Cit y end of the

entrances            to the S p i on Kop        is a gate w a y      leading        to the S o u t h S tand

entrances.             That    g at e w a y an d also a bridge           on the       far side          of    it was

c ompl e t e l y      congested.         It was     noted that         this    blockage was             caused by-

fans asking            for and also           offering    for    sale m a t c h t i c k e t s .         There we re

Police Officers               in unif o r m     present at that          locat i o n and despite                   the

fact     that        it did not       fall     under    our   brief,     we    took     it upon ourselves

to move        these     persons        on.

We    cont inued along P en is t o n e Road towards O w l e r t o n Stadium.

T hr o u g h o u t    that    patrol     we saw two u n i f o r m officers             only who were

standing at            the j u n c ti on with P a r k s i d e Road.            The    lack of officers

visi b l y     present was           c o m mented upon.         Fans    present were a r r i v i n g               in

numbers,          a large      number      of w hi c h were      drinking        beer from        cans.

At a p p r o x i m a t e l y 2.4 5      pm DC B a g g u l e y and      I had     returned to the bridge

area     im medi a t e l y     before      the S pi o n Kop entrances.                That are a was

c o mpletely blocked and                 fans were       spilling       into the       roadway.              A group

of 20      plus       fans    came    running     down the       road way from the              site         of

t he gates           I mmediately     prior     to theyS p i o n Kop,           those      gates       leading      to

the    rear      of the S o u t h Stand.           T b m ir was no u n i f o r m e d officers                 in view.

The m o od of the youths                was    ra/tless,       and    it was         obvious      that       they   did

not hold tickets             for     the game.        From     comments we            overhead         they were

speaking        of     rushing      the gates      to gain entry.               At this time we

withdrew         to the     central      ca r r i a g e w a y of P e n i s t o n e    Road because            we were

both     of the        opinion that we were             isolated        from other          officers and

would      neither have          been able         to stop the youths,                or defend o u rselves

if the        si t u a t i o n became    ugly.       Without w a r n i n g       the youths            suddenly

neither        pass     or receive m e s s a g e s      on the CID Channel.

inside      the ground to the ann o y a n c e              of the N o t t i n g h a m fans who were

 'booing'1 strongly.               We went      to a turnstile         nearby where we             saw PC     1302

Pitt     inside.          He told us      that     there    had been a pitch             invasion at        the

Le p p i n g s    Lane    end.     I climbed over          the turnstile         and ente r e d a gangway

betw e e n the S o u t h stand and S pion Kop.                    I could see          persons     on the

pitch at the Liverpool                  end and others         climbing        from the West         stand

time after             this we saw Po l i c e      vehicles     a r r i v i n g at the      ground a n d      it

was obvious             that   s o mething    serious      had occurred.             We deci d e d to     return

                     were also         entering      the gyrn looking             For each other.                   The moo d of some

                     of them was          violent     but     obvious        under     the     circumstances.

                     At that time          I ran over         to the Gym entrance where                        I took       hold of a

                     u n i fo r m e d officer.        That     officer a p p e a r e d         in a state            of helpless

                     shock.       I grabbed hold of him as p r e v i o u s l y stated and                              iden t i f i e d

                     m yself     to him.         I told him not to move                  from the doorway and                  to    inform

                     all    entering       to take      dead bodies            to the      nearest        section and          injured to

                     the middle.           The   officer       seemed        relieved to have                 been given a

                     particular         task to do.           I o b vi ou sl y had no a u t h o r i t y to do                 so,    but

                     told him that          if he m o v ed he had me to                  answer         to.     Persons in the gym

                     were    then      likewise     o rg an i s e d by Senior Officers.

                     At that      stage     I assisted         to try and           resuscitate           two       persons    lying       on

                     seeing.        The    pitch was         full    of fans,         dead and          injured       lying    on the

                     pitch.       One     fan was     o b v io us l y dead,         a coat over           his       head,   was     lying

now had obviously               u nd er st oo d the     seriou s n e s s       of the     incident.            I

returned       to the Gym.

The    flow of bodies            brough t       into the     gym cprftirmed and the dead were

laid out       in rows.          I saw PC Earnon Larjgan standing                      near the      gym

entra n c e and noti c e d          thatj the or g^i/ftal officer                I had    ’posted'        there          had

gone.       I a sked PC L a rk in ^ o o r f r r y         out     the    same duty and he agreed.                         I

later     saw that       officer         collaps/as an           a r g u m e n t took place      wit h a man

entering       the    gym d em an d i n g       to find a        relative who was missing.

I perso nally         then became           involved      in a heated a r g ument w i t h two

persons      trying     to gain entry to                     Gym.        One    said his      relative was

dead    inside and the other                 sai/r and      ident i f i e d himself as            being a

reporte r Tronf t e Pe o p l e Newspaper.                        The    reporter       stated    he w a n t e d          to

get    into the Gym          but    ll/refused him access.                    I e x p l a i n e d that    his

acti o n s were m i s g u i d e d and he a g r e e d             to    leave,     apologising       to me           for

his    unpr ofe s s i o n a l    approach.         He did not           return.

Things     then began to slow down,                   and    later a room was              set   up where

bodies were          to be      ident i f i e d by^fi'hotographs.               My duty was        to meet

relatives and e xp l a i n the               pp'Sition.          I did so then brought              them           into

and then       in person,          as    the body was        brought          up from the Gym.             I

con t i n u e d to    carry out          this duty until              4 am.      I can describe           the

events     of this      time       in more      detail      if    required to do so but                  I do not

gaining        entry to big         games without          tickets.          The    lengths        I have     seen

them go to are             unbelivable.           One    particular m a t c h that springs                  to mind

Outside        that ground that            day were many          t h o usands      of fans with o u t

w hen    I saw a group of over               100 rush a folding                gate.       The     gate w h i c h

was     shut and used for exit               purposes        had small         runners       on the       bottom

which     ran in a small            channel       in the ground.             As the fans           rushed this

gate     the    runners      came a w a y from their             channel       and the       base of the           gats?

pushed forward.             This     resulted        in the      gate     turning      sideways at about

head height.           Pers o n s    who    had been standing               near    to the gate were

crushed by the mob who                had no sense           of safety.            They were        going     to

enter     the ground         no ma t t e r what.          Many    got under         the gate        before       order

was     restored,      however,       I could not believe                 that     this was with o u t

serious        injury to those who               had been       inno c e n t l y standing          nearby at        the

time     of their      stampede.

Other     like      ’mass    r u s h e s ’ took    place that         day    but o b v iously         I d o n ’t

know whether any             injuries      were     sustained.

I feel     that the events            of that day show the                  problems       w h i c h these

suppo r t e r s     have    caused    in the       past    by their         org a n i s e d meth o d s     and

w h i c h may have         led up to the tragic              events       of Hillsborough.

I have w orked at H i l l s b o r o u g h on football                   duties      since        1977.     I have

th erefore wo r k e d at         numerous         big m at c h e s    that     have taken          place    there.

I have always          felt    that     too many fans were a d m i t t e d on those                       o c c asions

in the Leppings Lane                end.

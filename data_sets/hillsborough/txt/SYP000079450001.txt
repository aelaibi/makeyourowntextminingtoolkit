               I am a supporter of Liverpool Football Club and have been a season

               ticket holder since I was a child.               On Saturday 15 April       1989 150489 I

               went to the Semi Final Cup Match a t ^ l l s b o r o u g h between Liverpool

                nde Nottingham Forest.        Five of us went together by car to Sheffield,

                he others are                        'TiTsfarothe r                  and two chaps

               whose first name a*z~kr know ; /            arid              i abnt know the addresses

               of any of them,             a net"           live in                  and the other two

               live in Liverpool.       We left                     from                           , our

               usual meeting point around 10.30am 1030 to go to the match.                       We went

               directly to Sheffield and were not held up unduly anywhere en route.

               We ^arrived at about     12.30pm 1230 to 1pm 13Q0 a nd were stopped by ,

               Police and directed to a parking position.                   It was in a side room

  ^            about 20 minutes walk from the ground.                 We sat in the car for a few
                                                                         PAGE
                                                                         S2371

minutes and at about        1.10pm 1310 we all had a stroll down to the

ground.      I had a ticket for the North Stand which had cost £14 and

which I had obtained from the ticket office at Anfield.

didnt have a ticket and the other three had tickets for the Leppings

Lane Te rr a c e s .   There were Police Officers standing in twos and

threes between the car parking position and the ground but there was

no need at that time for them to provide any escort for fans.

As we strolled to the ground              was asking other supporters    if they

had a spare ticket but without success.         W e .arrived at the ground at

about 1.30pm 1330.         There were crowds outside the turnstiles at that

time but the situation was calm.        Several of the supporters were going H

round trying to get a ticket which is common practice at Cup Matches.

        decided to s^-ay at the ground to try and buy a ticket and the

rest of us went to get a dr i n k .     We walked along the main road under

the railway station and to a pub on a bend on the right hand side of

the road.

The pub appeared to be closed but there were a number of fans outside

the pub drinking from cans.         We went to an off licence on the other

side of the road and bought two cans of beer each and went back over

to the pub car park and sat on the wall to drink them.

There were two Police Officers outside the pub who spoke to us.            They

told us that the pub was open if we knocked the door but we told them

that we had cans of beer from the off licence.         They then said that we

might as well stay outside the pub with them and get sun burnt.

Everything was very friendly and all the fans and the Police were in a

happy and excited mood.         We started to go back to the ground at about

2 . 15pm 1415 and arrived there at 2.30pm 1430.       We didnt see

there and I then split up from the other three as I was going           into

the North Stand.         The situation outside the ground was bad but no

worse than I have seen it on previous occasions at Cup Matches.
                                                                           PAGE         3
                                                                           S2371

There was a large crowd outside t41e turnstiles and there was some
                ‘      :               7*
pushing and shoving.           There w/re some mounted police outside the

forecourt area in front oj/the turnstiles and one policewoman with her

back to the wall,          outs Lae the turnstile facing towards the crowd.

I joined the crowd a/fd after about f> minutes went through the

turnstiles into the ground (about the third turnstile from the left

hand side).         I h&d arranged to meet my sister and her husband and son

in the North S$and - we had four seats together.              I know where to go

as I have beJn to the ground on several previous occasions and in fact

went to thtj/same match between Liverpool and Nottingham last y e a r .

I cant rec/all seeing any signs for the North Stand but I had no
            I
difficult^ in finding my way to my seat,           I cant remember if my ticket

was checked by stewards as I went into the stand or if there were any

Police present inside the turnstiles.           I got to my seat at around

2.40pm 1440.        My sister and/her husband were already there with her

son.

I had seen no sign ofy^ny disorder or drunkenness at any point either

outside the ground Jar inside.          Everyone was    in very good spirits,

excited about th^f match and well behaved.             After a couple of minutes    I

had a look araand the ground and saw that          in the central area of

normal   leyel one would expect.         The pens appeared to be packed to more

than nonmal     capacity and there were still more coming in through the

tunnel/towards the West Stand.           There were a couple of police between

the g-oVls and the terrace fencing facing the crowd who must have been

able to see how bad the situation was becoming.

We commented on this ourselves and thought that someone should be

stopping more people from going into those pens through the tunnel.

The    pens at the sides had loads of room.        You could see people sitting

on the steps and there were spaces between them.              This continued with
                                                                                  PAGE

        more people   continually entering the pen at a steady rate from the

        tunnel.

        The glayers came onto the pitch and s-fcCrted to warm up.         At about

        2 . 5 5 pm 1455 the situation sudd^iffy changed.      It was as though a tap

        had been turned on and people seemed to pour out of the tunnel            into

        the already overcrowded pens, pushing those ahead of them fowards and

        sideways.                                 /

        The people at the front had n o w h ^ e   to go and were getting crushed

        badly up against thy fencimyir     I saw people    climbing up the fence at


9^      the front of the pensMfo get out of the crush.           Initially the Police

        prevented the fans from going over the fence onto the pitch - I dont

        know if they actually pushed them back or just told them.

        Everyone was watching this area of the ground and I only had an

        occasional glance towards the pitch and the players.           I didn't see the

        kick off but noticed that the game had started.          After about three or

        four minutes of the game being played the Police seemed to realise the

        seriousness of what was taking place and started to change their

        policy of restraining/the fans     in the pens.       They then started to help

        the fans over the p e n c i ng and onto the pitch.

        At about five p^fet three   1505 the small gate       in the front fencing was    j

        opened ar^L^d^ople started to come out of it,          I think it had also        j

        opened briefly a couple of minutes before but          had been closed again.

        At about this time I saw a pol i ce^Of f i ce r run

        the referee who immediately s■Lopped the game.

        went off the pitch almost j^riSrnedlately.
                                                               onto the pitch a nd go to .

                                                                The players all

                                                      As more people came onto the

        pitch through the open gate and over the fence some of the Police

        further away from where the incident was occurring seemed to think

        there had been a pitch invation as did the fans at the Nottingham

        Forest end of the ground.

        There appeared to be no communication to the police as to what had
                                                                                       PAGE      5.
                                                                                       S2371

         taken place.     Nottingham fans started chanting which I suppose was

         unde rstandable as they didnt know what had happened.

         The Police formed a cordon across the pitch w h ich I thought was also



y        understandable at that time.         I saw people being placed on the ground

         who appeared to have fainted but I then saw people starting to give

         the kiss of life to some of those lying on the pitch.

         One that sticks    in my mind particularly was when a Police Officer near „

         to our side of the pitch giving mouth to mouth resuscitation with fans

         helping with heart massage,       suddenly gave up and covered the persons

         face.   I think with his own coat.

         It became obvious then just how serious the situation was becoming.                   I ,,

         saw fans start to tear down the metal fencing at the front of the

         terracing to try and get the trapped fans out more quickly.                They also ,

         took down the goal nets to assist the flow of people onto the

         pitch more easily.     In both of these instances         it was t h e .fans w h o

         took the initiative before the Pol i ce(,'also started to help them.

         There seemed no co-ordination apefngst the Police at a l l .           They all

         seemed to be acting    indi vij^rfal l y .   Some we re do ing the i r utmost to

         help the i n juredk butofcfTers were just standing around doing nothing.

         At some stage an ambulance came onto the pitch from the Nottingham end

     v M ^ a n d was driven towards the Leppings Ln end - this was quite a

         considerable time after the incident had started to take place.                 After

    ' taj^fl^his I saw firemen come onto the pitch but I am not sure if they were
         using cutting equipment to get the fencing down or if they had brought

         breathing equipment for the injured,

         While all the incident was taking                 there was a great deal of

         confusion.     The use of the tannos^^Tystem was totally inadequate.

         There should have been isessao^s to inform the crowd of the situation.

         It would have been used to co— ordinate stewards and also the Police

         Officers actions as it was obvious that many had no radio contact.

There would have been appeals for people wi,th first aid training to

contact stewards etc etc.

As events unfolded it became clear to everyone that there had not been

a disorder situation.         The Police cordon across the pitch was

maintained for a considerable time when it was obvious that there was

no need for it.         The Officers   could have been far (Ti£wB«^'effectively

used if they had given leadership to the avjsw<age fans and organised

the help to the injured.

Further to what I previously staj^d regarding the friends                   I went to

the game with,     the address p'f                       is

           Finally I feel/that there should be a system of having

supporters     r^presewtation on the boards of football            clubs.    The

present boards are totally out of touch with the wishes of the

supporters.     They dont even consider the supporter when they make

their decisions,        such as the policing requirements for particular

matches   including the stewarding r e q u i r e m e n t s .   The supporters      can

predict on a game to game basis,           the problems that they may encounter.

Until the voice of the supporter is listened to the game will                   continue

to go from one disaster to another.             My sister and her husband are Mr

and Mrs            of                                                   Their son is

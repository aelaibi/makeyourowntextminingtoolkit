                 I. initially had a Lepping s Ln standing                   ticket,     which     I got from the

                 We   left Liverpool      at about 9 am        {0900)       and t r a velled straight           to

about      10 minutes         from the ground.

We all      then went        for a drink          in a q                    "i’t remember          its       name

There were a number                of Liverpool          suppow'tef s p h e r e         drinking         but no

drunkeness.

I left the         pub at about 2 .3 0 p m           <1430)     and wa l k e d        down to the             ground.

I received no Police                   d i re ction or escort          down       to the ground and                 1' saw

where     to go so        I had to ask w hich gates                   to go through.               At    first       ther

of minutes         the    crush got worse and you                    couldn't m^ve/bM-t              nothing

u n b e a r a b l e . T h e r e were    no officers       or stewards             giving       directions at my

turnstiles.           We were          in that    crush up until            about      kick off time.

I saw some         people      being         pulled up over a wall                on our       right     by the

Police and others              climbing         up and    I a s s u m e d the Police were a llow i n g

them to.

N o b o d y seemed to go througn 'Che lurnsX i lesyac all.

Eventually         the    1 a r g e b I u e c o n c e r t i na d m            t h e left       of the

turnstiles was            opened,, and everyone w e nt t h r o u g h it                    including my mate,

stand but got s t u ck/in our q u e u e .

As we went         throuq/f there was a large                 line      of Police Officers aii

linking arms aj/ong the                  right hand side.              I o b v iously did not hand my

ticket      in b^V^ I have             now    returned my ticket             to A n f i e i d for the             refund,

I had some diffi c u l t y finding my seat so I just                                 sat   in the first seat

I could as         the game        had already kicked off.

I saw no consumption of alcohol                       in the ground.

The    first     thing      I saw       in relation to the             incident were             people        climbing

out     of    the      area         behind          the     goal          onto           the    perimeter           fence       and

eventually             onto         the       pitch,            but I c o u l d n ' t e x a c t l y seew h a t                    wasgoing

1    first     realised              that          something              had        gone       seriously           wrong       when    I saw a

man     walk     in     front            of    our       stand        with           a    badly       broken        arm.

i. t h e n    went      down         to       the    front           on    the           half    way    line        and     1 saw      people

being        carried         along            the    pitch.

The     Police         by    this          time      had        formed           a       line    in    front        of    the    stand       and     we

shouted        at      them         to    go       and    help        and        some          people     were       in    obvious

distress         but        they         just       ignored           us    and           then     other      than        to    tell    us    to

else was        going.

ye then went                back and got another                             injured man.                   A doctor            came up to us

and told us to move                           hirn as           his neck or back was                       broken,             but to get          as

many as        possible              to do          it.          So a large number                      of us       lifted onto a

hoarding and we a gain                             carried him up to the far end.

Whilst        dealing with this man                              I    saw one being                    carried who was                 clearly

dead,        he was all              blue.           He         was being                carried away from the fencing on

this      right        hand side               of the goais as you                              looked at them.

He was a white male,                           about E4 years                        old,       fattish build,                 he had ginger

hair,        curly,         he a p p e a r e d           clean shaven.                         He was wearing              jeans and a             ?

Shirt        I c a n ’t remember                    the     colour.                  He was        carried away to the other

            I was     then asked to           leave and       returned to the                pitch.        I remember a

            little         lad of about 9 kicking a couple                     of Police Officers              and   1 got

            hold of him and sent Him on his way.                            The    iad was       quite       distressed.

            Whilst         doing   so    1 met     H ogan TAYLOR,        the    chairman of the football

            supporters association.                    I told him about            the       rumours       of the gates

            being     broken down.            So we went         to the gate          I ’d gone through and

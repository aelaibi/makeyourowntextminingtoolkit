                Nett in g Forest F C .         I support Liverpool                           Football      Club.      1 p urchased my

                ticket     from the L iv erpool           ticket              office and             paicj £6 for the L ep pings

                Ln standing area-            I travel          to the m a t e h with a



                My mode     of travel       was     by car.           On          route to the ground we did not                   stop
                                                             OVT~                                 „
                for any      purpose,     but were        s ubjected to a delay aro un d tne end ot t h e

                M63    of about     forty five minutes,                       this was             due to the buxld up of

                traffic.       About     four miles        further                    on we a ga in met a heavy volume               of

                traffic and        I d iv erted th rough G l os so p to Sheffield.

                We a rr i ve d at the ground at about                             1320 hours and            parked my vefucie

                about    quarter mile         from the Liverpool                            side    of the ground.
                                                                                                         P AGE       2
                                                                                                         S 237S

         On arrival       at the ground we had to walk                round the ground to the

         W o tt in g Forest      aide      to purchase a programme and arrived back at the

         en trance      to the ground ar ou nd         1413 hours.
s.o.e.
         At the turnstiles            the queues were        very minimal and had no             problem

         gaining access          into t-hj/ground.          Prior    to going    into the ground             I was

         se arched by a P o 1 i c/ Officer ana was asked                 if we were Liverpool

         s upporters      to rfiSfie sure we were         entering     the    correct side       of the

         ground.        On entering        the   ground my ticket was          checked and than          ripped

         in half and one half              returned back to me
                                                       C-y'V'T        iJZj£jZT^Q2h>f S i Q M S          W S i Di£_
         Once    inside     the ground        I did not     see a n y signs     directing      us to our

         viewing      point,     but having      viewed t he ra/before         I knew where       I was

         going.       I did not       pass along     the tunnel       leading    into the      pens at the

         rear of the goals.                                 and   i stood     in pen 7 of the        rear of

         the West Stand as            indicated on my plan of S he f fi e ld W ed n es d ay FC

         H i l l s b o r o u g h Ground.    Identifying mark                 Exhibit No

         Wh il st   standing      in pen 7 I could see that the                pens behind the goal

         were    tightly     packed with Liverpool            supporters       but the    pens at      each

         end of the enclosure              there was   plenty of       room.     At a p p r ox i ma t le y    1615

         houi79v a loud speaker a n no un ce me nt was made,                 informing us that         the

         matich Ahd been abandoned.

         We    left the     ground and t r a v e l ! ^ ■st><aight home.           My only o bs e rv a ti o n

         on the way the          incident was       handeld a|ter       the m atch was stopped was

         that    nobody seemed to know what               to d ef.   The only other         thing w hi ch       I

         feel    may be of       importance       is that    due to the       large   number    of Liverpool

         fans arriving          late at the ground may be the m atch should have                       kicked

         off    later    than    1300 hours.

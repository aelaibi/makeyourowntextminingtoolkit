EVIDENCE OF DETECTIVE SERGEANT GRAHAM McCOMBIE
 1   LORD JUSTICE STUART-SMITH: Mr. McCombie, you are still a
 2        serving officer, are you?
 3   A   I am, sir, yes.
 4   Q   What is your rank?
 5   A   I am a Detective Sergeant, and I   was at the time as well,
 6       sir.
 7   Q   You have had a chance just to look briefly through this
 8        statement of Paul Taylor's?
 9   A   Yes, sir.
10   Q   As I understand it, at the time you were the liaison, if
11        that is the correct word, for the Hicks family.   Is that
12        right?
13   A   We were actually part of the deceased inquiry team, sir.
14        Our remit was to collect evidence on behalf of the Coroner
15        to establish exactly how and where people were when they
16        died, and all the continuity which went along with it.
17        Obviously, when we went and saw families we became their
18        contact, and we were referred to as liaison officers
19        although that was not our only job. In fact, I did act as
20        liaison officer with Mr. & Mrs. Hicks.
21   Q   Can you tell me in your own words what you recall about
22        going to see Mr. Taylor, if indeed you recall anything
23        about it at all.
24   A   May be I should just say before I answer that, that after
25        seeing Mr. & Mrs. Hicks I was very, very keen to answer
26        every single question that they were wanting to put to me.
27        We did an awful lot of digging on their behalf to answer
28        their questions. I went and saw this Paul Taylor as a
29        result of a message coming up to Sheffield asking me to go
30        and see him.
31             Apparently, Liverpool Social Services had been in
32        contact with our incident room stating that Paul Taylor
33        had been to see them. He was extremely upset and
34        depressed about what had gone on on the day, and they were
35        counselling him. They thought, somehow, that it would
36        help his situation if he was introduced to the Hicks as
37        part of his therapy for getting better. Obviously, there
 1       were implications in this. First of all, did Mr. & Mrs.
 2       Hicks want to see him? But this had already been done by
 3       Liverpool Social Services; they had already made contact
 4       with the Hicks and introduced the pair of them.
 5            Previous to me going to see Mr. Taylor, two other
 6       officers had been and taken a statement, and also filled
 7       in a questionnaire which had been filled in on the day by
 8        him.
 9   LORD JUSTICE STUART-SMITH:   That is the statement dated 8th
10       May?
11   A   Yes, I have got a copy of that. There was that statement
12       there. There was a questionnaire, and also his typed
13       recollection which I understand was handed to the officers
14        at the same time. In fact, it is mentioned at the end of
15       the statement that he did hand it to them on the day.
16       When I was asked to go and see him, I obviously researched
17       those statements. I read the statements, the recollection
18        and the questionnaire before I went, and I went to see
19        him.
20            What I do remember is the fact that he was still
21       extremely upset and blaming himself: could he have done
22       more? Could he have done this? Could he have done that?
23       I went there and listened to his story. What he was
24       telling me on the day, it was not possible at that stage
25       to put straight into statement form as it needed
26       researching.  I mean, he was describing where he was in
27        the crowd, what he did, what he was wearing and as a
28        result of going to see him, I went back to Sheffield and
29        made an action out stating that I had seen him and asking
30        for three specific things to be done to corroborate - to
31        either prove or disprove his story really. I have got a
32        copy of that actually if you would like to see it, sir.
33   Q   Yes, I would like to see that.   (Produced)
34   A   It might help if I read that out to you first, sir?
35   Q   Yes.
36   A   This is from   me back into the incident room:



                                     3
 1            "Paul John Taylor, born 11.8.59, made a statement on
 2           8th May, and also a copy of his original notes
 3           (attached). The female mentioned on page 4 of his
 4           statement appears to be Victoria Hicks, body number
 5           89.    Taylor has been put in touch with the Hicks
 6           family via Liverpool Social Services. He has spoken
 7           to Mrs. Hicks and said something along the lines that
 8           he got Victoria out of the pens, 'I was giving her a
 9           kiss of life and then a policeman said "Leave her
10           alone, she's gone" without feeling for a pulse etc.'
11           This obviously caused great upset to the Hicks"
12       - which it did at the time. I mean, we are talking just a
13       few weeks after the incident and they were still very
14       emotional and upset -
15            "Taylor has been re-interviewed on 31.5.89 and has
16            retracted what he told Mrs. Hicks, and went on to
17            claim that he was under stress and he was upset and
18            emotional."
19       I have then gone on to describe Taylor.
20            "Taylor is a white male, 5'10", heavy built, red
21            hair, ruddy complexion with a moustache. On the day
22           he was wearing a bright green, long sleeved shirt
23           with round neck and jeans. Photograph of Taylor
24            attached."
25       I obviously took a photograph of him.
26            "The Hicks family have been temporarily placated. Can
27            the following be done?"
28       Then I asked for three actions to be raised and
29       investigated:
30            "Can we identify Taylor in the crowd? Can we assess
31            his involvement? Can we establish any continuity re
32            Victoria Hicks?   Please report findings to DS
33            McCombie in order that Mr. & Mrs. Hicks can be seen
34            and advised regarding Paul Taylor's actions."
35   Q   Was there any mention to you when you went to see him of a
36       police officer who he has supposed to have dealt with
37       wearing gloves?


                                   4
 1   A   No, sir, not to my knowledge.   It is so difficult to
 2        remember this. But, you see, he hadn't put that in his
 3        statement, and it was not in his recollection either.
 4   Q   What you record there is that he didn't take a pulse at
 5        all?
 6   A   Exactly.
 7   Q    You made that action out shortly after you had interviewed
 8       him, did you?
 9   A   Yes, sir.
10   Q   Can you remember how long?
11   A   I can't recall offhand thedate that I actually   went and
12        saw him, although it says here he was seen on 31st, I
13       believe. I have got it in the text here. That is the
14       message of my message. 31st of the fifth was when I saw
15        him.
16   Q   And what is the date of your action?
17   A   The 1st June.
18   Q   The next day.
19   A   So it was the day after. I put this into the incident
20        room with those three actions tobe raised and
21        investigated, and I have a reply which has gone to
22        Inspector Leyton in the video identification part. The
23       result of the action is:
24            "Man believed to be Paul Taylor is on video  [the
25            tape reference number is mentioned] in pen 3 in
26            bottom right hand corner of screen. He goes from
27            view at [I can't read the actual time on here] Seen
28            again at 15:28:40. In the first instance he appears
29            to be standing by the barrier observing removal of
30            bodies through the gate. No visual evidence
31            available. Photograph and copy statement retained in
32            video section.      DS McCombie is aware of above."
33       In fact, the things I asked them to do they did do but
34       couldn't come up with a definite, positive reply. They
35       could not find him helping Victoria.
36   Q   So what happened next?



                                       5
 1   A   I don't know if I actually physically went back and saw
 2       Mr. Taylor, or whether I rang him and spoke to him, or
 3       contacted him through Liverpool Social Services;  I really
 4       cannot remember at this stage.  It was obvious that he
 5       could not add anything further regarding Victoria's
 6       treatment. He had already made a very comprehensive
 7       statement in the first instance, and there was nothing
 8       further that he could add or that could be corroborated.
 9   Q   You didn't think it was worth adding to his statement that
10        a police officer had said that he was dead?
11   A   If he had told me something that would have helped the
12        Coroner's Inquiry, or the Hicks, believe me, I would have
13        taken a statement and recorded it, sir. To my knowledge,
14       he didn't tell me anything that we didn't already know.
15       He was very confused, very upset, very emotional; he was
16       leaning on the Hicks to give him support which was a
17        difficult thing in itself.
18   Q   Would there have been any objection simply to putting in
19       the statement - there doesn't seem to be much doubt from
20       his recollection immediately afterwards that he attended a
21        girl?
22   A   Absolutely.
23   Q   And the Hicks were clearly convinced,  I think, from the
24        description of the clothing and so on that that was
25        Victoria Hicks. That is right, isn't it?
26   A   The blue cardigan was mentioned which  went missing, and it
27       has never been recovered to this day. I am quite
28       satisfied that it was Victoria Hicks.What I am saying
29       is, sir, if Paul Taylor had said to me   at the time "A
30       policeman came along and told me this,   that and the
31       other", I would have taken a statement   off him anyway.   I
32       really don't believe that he said that   to me, and the
33       mention of perjury is absolute nonsense; they are
34       certainly not my words. I was very, very keen to please
35       Mr. & Mrs. Hicks, and to get to the bottom of it. I told
36       them everything I could.



                                    6
     V




 1       Q    I still don't quite follow why you couldn't include the
 2            fact that a policeman had come along and said that she was
3             dead. He says that. Was there any reason to doubt that?
4        A   No reason at all, sir. After he told me that I did fill
 5            in the action and ask them to research that.
 6       Q   But you were really trying to find out whether there was
 7            any videos or photographic evidence which would show that
 8           he was involved with Victoria Hicks or there was some
 9           policeman involved with her.
10       A   That anybody was involved. I mean, if we could have had
11           on video the body on the pitch, we probably could have
12           identified police officers and certainly Paul Taylor with
13            this bright green jumper on.
14       Q   There are some photographs, I think, which do   identify
15           him?
16       A   Yes.
17       Q   Can we just have a look. Would you like to look through
18            these to see if you can see them. These are the ones on
19            the body file. I think may be they are the video ones.  I
20           seem to have got copies of them here. Somebody seems to
21           have thought that was him; and also that one there. That
22           doesn't help very much?
23       A   Not at all, sir, no. The other thing with the video
24           evidence, sir - I don't know whether you are aware of it -
25           is that Mr. Hicks actually visited the police station and
26           we showed him everything that we were doing and everything
27           we were looking at to try to establish who did what.
28       Q   To see whether there was any sign of Paul Taylor actually
29           administering to Victoria?
30       A   I don't know whether Paul Taylor was specifically
31           addressed, but most certainly Mr. Hicks came along to the
32            incident room and we showed him exactly what we were
33           trying to do to prove the continuity.
34       Q   You were doing that with a lot of families, I think,
35           weren't you?
36       A   Mr. Hicks was the first one who went there I believe, sir.



                                        7
     *

 1       Q   It looks as though there may have been some
 2           misunderstanding about this, but Mr. Taylor has clearly
 3           got the idea that you told him that there was no point in
 4           putting this in his statement unless he was certain about,
 5           and said something about perjury?
 6       A   No, sir.
 7       Q   When you got back to himafter you had made these   further
 8           enquiries, can you remember what you did say to him?
 9       A   I honestly cannot remember whether I telephoned him or
10           went round. I mean, I was backwards and forwards to
11           Liverpool almost every day, and I could have gone round.
12           I wouldn't argue with whatever he says, whether I went
13           there or telephoned him. I told him exactly what I had
14           done after I had seen him the first time. I told him the
15           result of those enquiries, and if he had said anything
16           else to me then, then I would have taken a statement off
17           him. I think he is confused, sir.
18       Q   You think he is confused about what he says that you   told
19            him?
20       A   Yes, sir.
21       Q    But you accept, as I understand it, that he may well have
22            been told by a policeman that she was dead - do you, or
23           not?
24       A   He certainly didn't mention it in his original statement.
25       Q   I know that.
26       A   Or his recollection.
27       Q   No, I know that.
28       A   Again, on my action which I completed, I do actually say
29           on here "Taylor was re-interviewed on 31.5.89 and has
30           retracted what he told Mrs. Hicks and went on to claim
31            that he was stressed out and he didn't really know what he
32           was saying, that he was taking drugs and medication."
33       Q   You interviewed him on 31st?
34       A   Yes, sir. I was never privy to the conversation that he
35           had with Mrs. Hicks obviously.
36       Q   No.



                                        8
 1   A   I understand that whatever he said to them he upset them
 2        by mentioning Victoria's name and what was done or wasn't
 3        done. I was trying to bottom that out. I went through
 4        his statement with him again, through his recollection,
 5        and he never diversified from that.
 6   Q   I am sorry, I am beginning to get a little confused.   What
 7       was the date the first time you went to see him when he
 8       said that a police officer had said that she was dead?
 9       I thought that was 31st May?
10   A   That was 31st which is when I completed my action asking
11       for those three lines of inquiry to be followed up.
12       Again, my script here - this is a handwritten message that
13       went into the incident room - "He had spoken to the Hicks
14       and said along the lines that he got Victoria out of the
15       pens, 'I was giving her the kiss of life and then a
16       policeman said "Leave her alone, she's gone" without
17       feeling for pulse etc.' This obviously caused great upset
18       to the Hicks."   I cannot remember whether that came from
19       the Hicks or from Paul Taylor that I was told that. When
20       I went through his statement and his recollection again,
21        he certainly never mentioned that, sir.
22   Q   He didn't mention that. Did you ask him about that?
23   A   Again, I can't remember the exact conversation but the
24        statement that was taken off him initially was taken by a
25       Detective Police Woman and it was a very thorough and long
26       statement.  I went through that again with him, and to my
27       recollection he certainly did not mention that, sir, no.
28       Like I say, I would have taken another statement off him
29       if I had felt it was going to prove the continuity of
30       anything else. We had nothing to hide.
31   Q   Really, when you interviewed him he did not mention this
32       business about the policeman. Did he actually say to you
33       that he had made a mistake in saying that to the Hicks?
34   A   I really cannot remember.
35   Q   Can I just have a look at that.  Perhaps we should take
36        photocopies of this. Would you like to run this off.



                                    9

 1       A   And that is the reply that I received. He describes in
 2           his recollection, sir, the drugs that he had been
 3           prescribed at that time and was taking, and he was clearly
 4           very, very upset and emotional.
 5       Q   I think that is very clear. This is his typewritten one
 6           of the 4th May. Is that right? Or is the one given to
 7            the police officer?
 8       A   As I understand it, the typed one was given on 4th May
 9            when his statement was taken.
10       Q   That is right. He certainly was upset. When he gave
11            evidence at the Inquest - I don't suppose you were present
12            - but he mentioned in his evidence that somebody had said
13            that she was dead when he was trying to give her the kiss
14            of life and so on. He doesn't mention it was a policeman
15            and he doesn't mention that the person had gloves on. The
16            solicitor acting for the families adduced from him that he
17           was talking about Victoria Hicks.     I don't suppose you
18            were present?
19       A   I was present, sir, at the first Inquest.
20       Q   No, this was at the main Inquest.
21       A   No, I wasn't   present at that.
22       Q   (Photocopies   produced) Can I just read this through. Can
23            I just look   at the original; I can't read this. So you
24            say in your   action that he actually retracted what he told
25           the Hicks?
26       A   Yes, sir.
27       Q   Can you remember how that came about?
28       A   I cannot remember exactly but certainly he wasn't sure
29            what he told Mrs. Hicks was the truth and everything,
30            which is why I highlighted those three actions to try to
31            prove or disprove what he was saying anyway.
32       Q   It is odd that he should have got this idea about perjury.
33            Did you draw his attention to the caution at the head of
34            the statement or anything like that?
35       A   I didn't take the statement off him, sir. I mean, I
36            showed him his original. No, we were treating people with
37            kid gloves. I mean, there was no bullying or anything


                                          10
1          like that, and I find it quite upsetting what he said in
2          his transcript.  I certainly didn't treat people like
3          that. I had kid gloves on when I spoke to people, and I
4          was very aware of the trauma that he had been through as
5          well, and I would have sat there for as long as it took to
6          get the truth out of him. I didn't bully him or
7          intimidate him, sir.  I also don't believe I had dinner
 8         with him. I think he mentions me arriving at tea time and
 9         having tea with him. I don't recall that.
10   Q     Does he. I don't remember that. That is in his evidence
11         to me, is it?
12   A     Yes.
13   Q     There it is. I don't know whether we can take this any
14         further. Do you think so, Chris?
15   MR.   BONE: I don't think we can, Sir Murray, no. One very
16         minor point. I was curious about his date of birth -
17         1939. That would have made him about 60 now, which is a
18         bit odd.
19   A     I think it is 1959, sir. Certainly on this statement here
20         it is 11.8.59. I can remember speaking to him. He was
21        quite an unusual character.
22   LORD JUSTICE STUART-SMITH: Thank you very much indeed for
23        coming.  I hope I shall not need to come back to you.

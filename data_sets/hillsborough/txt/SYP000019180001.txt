April 17th, 1989


Dear S i r ,
It was with h e a r t f e l t r e l i e f t h a t I saw my law abiding, f a n a tic a l Liverpool
supporting, 19 year old son a r r iv e home a short time ago. _ This was a f t e r an
agonising th r e e or four hours for myself and my w ife.           I grieve fo r those whose
loved ones did not come home.
I, th e r e f o r e , w rite to complain b i t t e r l y about the organisation and control of t h i s
match;

1.    i t was the wrong venue.
2.    even i f i t was the rig h t venue th e t i c k e t a llo c a tio n was rid ic u lu o u s .

3.     my son t e l l s me t h a t th e police allowed people in to the ground who did not have
      t i c k e t s , in f a c t , one o f his f r i e n d s , whose t i c k e t had been stolen in the post
      and hoped t o buy one a t the ground, was allowed in a t 2.50 p.m. by the police
      t o , "avoid tro u b le outside the ground".
4.    why was the gate which was opened o r broken down not supervised when within a
      few minutes of the horror s ta rin g some 250 p olice o f f i c e r s were on the p i t c h ,
      “to prevent fans ge ttin g to each other"? Inevitably t h i s meant th a t Liverpool
      fans were having to care for t h e i r own injured and dead.
5.    my son t e l l s me t h a t people who were drunk were allowed i n to th e ground and I
      can only shudder a t t h e i r reaction s in the panic s i t u a t i o n .

6.    a fireman who was on duty said to my son and his f r ie n d , " I don 't know who's in
      charge h ere, i t ' s a God awful mess".
The above words were scribbled on Saturday evening, sh ortly a f t e r my son a rriv e d
home.
I have now had time to r e f l e c t and to stand with my son, his f r ie n d and countless
other grieving persons on the Kop. I , th e r e f o r e , w rite with g re a t sadness, much
b i t t e r n e s s and deep anger and commend to a l l who have anything to do with the
organisation o r control of t h i s match, Dr. Ashton's comments on te l e v i s i o n
concerning r e s p o n s ib ility and a c c o u n ta b ility and a ls o the words of Simon Barnes in
"The Times" t h i s morning. This should not have been allowed t o happen.

 Yours f a i t h f u l l y .

L e ^p in gs Ln.          At    this     l o c ation we erec t e d barriers across                  the m o u t h of

the j u n c t i o n in order             to    comply w ith the         instructions          that we were          to

prevent access             to Vere Rd            by anyone      other       than    residents-



From       this    time    on there was a steady f 1ow o f y suppo rte rs arriving,

large       numbers       of whi ch were            carrying      cans/and b o t t 1es of a l c o h o l in

the for m of          lager and b e e r .            These     sug^o r t e r s     were a d v i s e d that    they

wo u l d    not    be all owed         in the       ground w ith the alcoho 1.                Wi thout a n y

problems          they turned          round and w a l k e d awa y from the                 ground and

con t i n u e d    consuming          the alcohol.           It also        soon became a p p arent          that

large       numbers       of    people were a r r i v i n g with o u t             tickets.       This was made

clear       by them w al k i n g about and a p p r o a c h i n g              other     fans asking      if they

had    'spares’.           1 myself           was a p p r o a c h e d two    or three       times   by fans

enq u i r i n g where          they    could obtain tickets.



As    the morning          wore       on an d kick         off approached,           the    percentage       of

people a r r i v i n g         in a d ru n k e n     state,     still       carrying       cans   of beer     etc.

increased,          but the moo d was               still    good.



Most       of my time at my              post was       spent,      apart     from     preventing     people

en t erin g       Vere Rd,       dir e c t i n g    s u pporters     to their        respective      turnstiles,

A bo ut 2 . 3 0     pm    (1430 hrs)           by w hich     time    I had been joined by P o 1 i c e

Se r q ea nt M o z I e y , there was a m a r k e d              increase         in the    number    of fans

a r r i v i n g and      it was       notic e a b l e   that    s u pporters were          starting     to build

up at      the    turnstiles.



S h o r t l y a f t e r wa rd s a fight            broke    out on L e p pings        Ln    in the area of the
                                                                                                                 PAGE      •;
                                                                                                                 S2149

bridge        o v er    the River         Don.      I d i d n ’t see what h a p p e n e d taut saw two

y o u t hs    being       led a w ay and thro u g h the barriers at Vere Rd,                           where       they

went     from t h e r e , I d o n ’t know.                By this       time the        conge s t i o n of       people

was    getting          worse and         the    crowd s t r e t c h e d     from the      turnstiles        to my

location.              Agai n I was        i n u n dated wit h      people a r r iving ask i ng

directions             and when       it was      pointed out that                the t urnstiles      they wa n t e d

was    the one s ur ro u n d e d by a sea of                    people,        they star t e d to become            very

agitated ,            asking    if there was any other                   way      into the ground.           Some

ignored my advice and                     crossed the barrier                into Vere Rd,        attempting         to

find alte rnat ive e n t r a n c e s .                 Some wai t e d      pat iently but the m a j o r i t y

s t o r m e d off and joined the growing                        number       of     people who    I could see

pushing          towards       the gates.



At 3 ^0 0        pm    <1500 h r s ) as         I was    talking        to a L i verpool        fan who was

h appy to a l l ow the               crowd to       clear      before      gaining      entry.     I noticed the

c rowd s u d d e n l y e a s e , this seemed to coincide with calls from the                                       crowd

for s o mething            to be done           to ease     the    crush.



A few moments               later     people? star t e d        to come back out of the ground,

some were             injured and         in a very d i s t r e s s e d state.             It soon became

clear        from talking            to   people       coming     out    that       something    had happened

near     to the         t u rntiles       and on the        inside       of the       ground    involving         people

being        t r a m p l e d on and       crushed.        At    that     stage       I w a s n ’t aware     of

an y t hi ng       h a p pening      on the      terraces.         A m b u l a n c e s and the F i re Br igade

star ted to arr ive                 but   I st i11 di dn *t know what was                  happeni n g , I di d n ’t

have a radio.                Access       to the ground           for    e m e rgency     vehicles     was

h a m p er e d     by people         stood making          no attempt          to either       enter   or    leave.



I remained at my                post      not knowing about             an     i n s t r uction for all

a v a i l a bl e      o f f icers    to go      into    the ground.            As    people    started      to come
                                                                                                               PAGE              4
                                                                                                               S2149

out    I at first a t t e m p t e d           to prevent           them from entering Vere Rd,                     but as

it became a p p arent               that    s o mething         serious     had happened,            I removed          the

b a r r i e r s so      people      could     clear       quickly and s u pporters were                    going    to

houses       in Vere Rd to            use     telephones.



I stayed         near      to the     j u n c t i o n and did not ^/rtter the ground at all

until      we were         told to go to the N o r t h Stored for de~farief, instead                                    I

j^e 1 ped to get           e m er ge nc y vehicles             to X b* ground and advise               fans    res

1ocat ion of t r ansport                 etc.       As mo re of the           corwd,        the younger       element

of whi ch had o b v i ou sl y been drinking,                           s t a r t e d to become       very

a gg re s s i v e      and a b us iv e     tow a r d myself and            other O f f icers who we re

outside.            They were        saying       things        like,    "You mur d e r i n g Bastards.

I t ’s your         fault     for    opening        the       gates.      I hope you d o n ’t sleep you

m u r d e r i n g Bastards".             Some     of the        older and more             responsible       fans       kept

a po l o g i s i n g    for the      behaviour          of these        supp o r t e r s    saying    there was

no t h i n g anyone         c o u 1d d o .



At this        stage as more             s up p o r t e r s    came and      began venting           their

feelings,           the only thing we               could       do was     stand and take abuse,               if we

had    reacted          in any w a y we w o u l d have              clea r l y been         put under       physical

abuse.        As       I stood and took the abuse                      I felt      totally helpless,           I still

d i d n ’t, know what was             happening,              I w a s n ’t able     to offer any           i nformation

to    people at all.                I a ct u a l l y started           to fear      for my own safety and                   it

crossed my mind that                  these       people who were             clearly drunk,           were    the

ones who        had a rr i v e d at         the ground           late and       responsible          for    pushing

outside        the      ground      before      the    kick      off.



E v e n t u a l l y all     the     crowds      d i s ap pe ar e d without          incident and we           called

into     the ground w here we were                     de-br ief ed.          At    no time     did    I see       or

handle any bodies,

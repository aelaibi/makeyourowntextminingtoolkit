      about      1 ,30pm      <1330)          until     we    could arrange           for a taxi.

      On entering           the        public     house at about              1 .,45 pm it was       full     with

      L i verpool       supporters,              most      of them were wear i n g Liverpool                    colours ana

normal         to    be    happening          at     a    football           match.

When     the        m a t c h was      eventually              stopped        I aid         see    people         l y ing       on    the

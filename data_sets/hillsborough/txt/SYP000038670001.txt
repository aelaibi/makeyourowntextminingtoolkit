HILLSBOROUGH INQUIRY


         Part I
                    THE HILLSBOROUGH DISASTER




                           INTRODUCTION




On Saturday, 15 April 1989, at Hillsborough, Foot,ball Stadium*,

the home of Sheffield Wednesday Football Club, a disaster

occurred when 95 football supporters lost their lives.



At the request of the Home Office and the South Yorkshire

Chief Constable, Mr Peter WRIGHT, the Chief Constable of the

West Midlands, Mr Geoffrey DEAR, agreed to inquire into this

disaster which from the outset involved criticism of the

Police handling of the event preceding the disaster as well

as the reaction to the disaster as it unfolded.



Very quickly a Judicial Inquiry was ordered and Lord Justice

Taylor was appointed to lead it.   West Midlands Police

Officers were at this time engaged in assisting Lord Justice

Taylor in the gathering of evidence for the Judicial Inquiry.



In addition the loss of life required evidence to be gathered

for H.M. Coroner, Dr Stefan POPPER and that work continues to

be undertaken by West Midlands Police.
Following the publication of the report into the Hillsborough

disaster by Lord Justice Taylor, the Chief Constable of South

Yorkshire requested the Director of Public Prosecutions to

consider if a criminal investigation should be carried out

into the events which surrounded the deaths of the 95 who

died.



That decision was affirmative and Mr Geoffrey DEABi. was aaked

and agreed to head the criminal investigation,     The

investigation is supervised by Captain Noel Taylor, of the

Police Complaints Authority.



Following initial meetings with the Director of Public

Prosecutions and the Police Complaints Authority, the

investigation format and procedure was agreed.     In essence

the first objective is to produce in five or six different

sections, composite files of evidential statements, reports

and documents all material to the overall crux of the matter,

the 95 deaths.     Further, to submit individual files on

specific criminal allegations made against named Police

Officers for alleged offences separate and unconnected to the

actual disaster.



It is necessary to identify all parties who may have some

degree of culpability and at this moment the following are

potentially in this category.
(A)   SOUTH YORKSHIRE POLICE



The Police Service has through its history developed wide

responsibilities not only in terms of law and order but in a

general duty to protect the public. The safety of those

policed has been an accepted responsibility for many years

and events such as a football Semi-Finals are but one

category of many.



The control of the football fans outside the Football

Stadium, in Leppings Lane, the crushing outside the

turnstiles and the opening of Gate ’C ’ may have a

considerable bearing on the later overcrowding in Pens 3 and

4.



The monitoring of those two pens, knowledge of crowd capacity

and restrictions applied or in evidence may be a primary

feature of the deaths and the Police responsibilities in this

area need to be examined.      Other parties may be interwoven

into this context and the acceptance of whose primary

responsibility this is may have been in doubt on 15 April

1989 at Hillsborough.



The planning and control of the football match identifies

Senior Police Officers who may by their actions or alleged

failures be in this category.
i.           Walter JACKSON, Assistant Chief Constable

ii.          David DUCKENFIELD, Chief Superintendent

iii.         Roger MARSHALL, Superintendent

iv.          Roger GREENWOOD, Superintendent

v.           Bernard MURRAY, Superintendent.



All were present at the match and took a part in the Policing

operation.     Specific allegations have been levelled at each

of the above in formal Police Complaint terms by relatives

who lost members of their families.



In addition, two Police Constables may by virtue of their

actions or alleged failings be considered in this same

category.     They are;



i.           Police Constable 417 David ILLINGWORTH
                                 $
ii.          Police Constable 129-5 Peter SMITH.



In each instance specific allegations have been made against

these two officers by individuals in Pens 3 and 4, that their

failure to open the perimeter fence gates ’caused’ some of

the deaths.
(B)     SHEFFIELD WEDNESDAY FOOTBALL CLUB



It is a fact that the deaths all occurred within the Football

Stadium.     There is a responsibility upon those closely

connected with ownership or management to consider the safety

of the Public who use their facility. In accordance with this

the following are identified as having that control and

responsibility;



i.          Herbert McGEE, the Chairman

ii.          Graham MACKRELL, Club Secretary



and in addition, the other Directors of the Club;



iii.        Matthew SHEPPARD, Vice Chairman

iv.         Stanley SPEIGHT

v.          Clifford WOODWARD

vi.         Keith ADDY

vii.        Ernest BARRON

viii.       Geoffrey HULLEY.



Mr McGee and Mr Mackrell have made written statements and Mr

Mackrell gave evidence at the Judicial Inquiry.     Mr Speight,

Mr Hulley, Mr Woodward and Mr Barron have completed

questionnaires for Police investigation purposes because they

were at the match.
The other two Directors, Mr Shepperd and Mr Addy were not

present and were, therefore, not interviewed.   It is not

proposed to interview these two at this stage as witnesses.



Depending upon the level of responsibility it may be

necessary to further investigate the role of some or all of

these Club representatives.




(C)   EASTWOODS CONSULTANTS



Eastwoods were first retained by Sheffield Wednesday in 1978

as consultant engineers to the Club and it is apparent that

Dr Wilfred Eastwood himself took the lead role for his firm

in terms of the work done at the ground since that time.



The involvement of Eastwoods with initially South Yorkshire

County Council and then Sheffield City Council and Sheffield

Wednesday Football Club is particularly important in a number

of crucial areas.



The testing of barriers, ground improvements and alterations

and crowd capacity all become very relevant and Dr Eastwood

has the main responsibilities in this area together with one

of his employees Mr Strange.
The introduction of the radial fences creating Pens 3 and 4,

the removal of barrier 144 and the failure of barrier 124a

associated to the crowd capacity all directly involved Dr

Eastwood’s company.   The degree of culpability, therefore,

needs to be addressed.



No further action or enquiry has commenced at this stage in

relation to Dr. Eastwood, Mr Strange or any other employees

who may have been involved in these aspects.




(D)   SHEFFIELD CITY COUNCIL



The Safety of Sports Ground Act of 1975 gave responsibility

to, in the case of Hillsborough, South Yorkshire County

Council, for the issue and control of the General Safety

Certificate.   South Yorkshire County Council was abolished on

1 April 1986 and the licensing authority for this certificate

was taken over by Sheffield City Council.



A working party consisting of representatives of the City

Council, South Yorkshire Police and South Yorkshire Fire

Service meet on a regular basis to discuss the issues

affecting safety of Hillsborough Stadium.
However, preliminary enquiries have shown that the

introduction of the two radial fences in late 1981 early

1982, and the radial fence from the middle of the tunnel in

1985 (creating Pens 3 & 4) have not been subject to an

amendment in the existing General Safety Certificate.



This may, therefore, have corresponding effects on crowd

capacity for the terrace areas and as overcrowding is one

identified obvious feature of the deaths that occurred, some

degree of responsibility may rest with those representatives

of the past and present Councils who have a responsibility

for the ground from the Council and Safety Certificate

viewpoint.



Hr David Bownes, the Chief Licensing Officer for Sheffield

City Council gave evidence at the Judicial Inquiry.



The over capacity in the pens is a strong feature of the

disaster and the removal of a crush barrier, No. 144, may be

seen as crucial when the reason for the collapse of barrier

124A is fully understood.   Mr Bownes had dealings with this

and effectively ’approved’ the removal of this barrier.
Hr Bownes may, therefore, be one individual from the Council

with an element of responsibility which in part was a feature

of the deaths in the terraces.



At this stage no further enquiries have been made to identify

other members of the present Council or the abolished Council

that may have taken a part in the issue or control of the

General Safety Certificate.



(E)   THE SUPPORTERS



From the outset it is clear that there is no evidence to

suggest any individual supporter or group of supporters can

be specifically Identified as contributing to the extent that

criminal proceedings could be envisaged.



Nevertheless, their actions during the build up to the

Semi-Final needs to be examined because primarily in respect

of the Police action it is the supporters that dictate the

decisions made.



The extent to which the effects of alcohol played a part, the

late arrival of many thousands of Liverpool supporters and

even perhaps their own, as a group, failure to recognise the

distress of fellow supporters in Pens 3 and 4 may be

important issues in the final outcome of this disaster

inve stigation.
OTHER PARTIES



The Hillsborough disaster investigation has resulted in a

number of instances being identified which may be significant

but which occurred prior to the actual disaster.



It will be necessary to assess at an early stage, the

closeness of these events to the disaster day, their effect

at the time they happened and the lessons that may have been

learned, or were ignored or not recognised at that time.



Documentary evidence suggests an awareness of crowd crushing

on the Leppings Lane Terraces as long ago as 1956.   In 1981

during another semi final there was a considerable crushing

problem on the Leppings Lane Terraces resulting in injuries.

The concern was shown by a de-brief held by South Yorkshire

Police to evaluate the problem.   The following years saw

alterations to the terraces including the installation of

radial fences.   There is evidence that people were injured on

the same Terraces at Hillsborough in the corresponding game

in 1988.



If that is correct, did those in authority at the relevant

times, the Police, the Club officials, Council officials have

knowledge of the problems and if so did they take action or

not.   It may be necessary to consider if these events in

history are sufficiently related to the 1989 disaster to
decide if any of the individuals involved then in the

organisations identified have any culpability as a result of

their failure to take action.



This investigation has not proceeded to that extent to

identify those individuals and will not do so unless it is

deemed necessary.



In general terms, the preceding paragraphs have summarised

the main issues and identified where possible the persons who

may have some degree of responsibility if criminal offences

have been committed.



GENERAT.




The evidence will be presented in a number of parts

culminating in a final report which will identify the

possible offences disclosed and those persons who may then be

considered liable.




G.J. DEAR

CHIEF CONSTABLE
   THE EVIDENCE



     PART ONE




The statements presented in this first section of

the report represent a cross section of those

people that in some way are connected to

Sheffield Wednesday Football Club.



From the Chairman of the Club to the programme

sellers, evidence has been gathered of the views

of a proportion of those present at the game on

Saturday, 15 April 1989.




THE CHAIRMAN AND DIRECTORS OF SHEFFIELD

WEDNESDAY FOOTBALL CLUB



Herbert Edward McGee, is the Chairman of

Sheffield Wednesday Football Club.     In his

statement he identifies six other Directors of

the Club and outlines their specific

responsibilities.   He emphasises throughout the

Clubs concern for safety regardless of expense.
                  - 13 -



St.Pages   Questionnaires   are completed by four of those
 7-13
14 - 20    Directors who were present at the match.
21 - 27
28 - 35

           Mr Keith ADDY,   the Director with specific

           responsibility for building and structural

           matters has not yet been interviewed.    It will be

           seen that the other Directors, on legal advice,

           declined to answer some of the questions on the

           prepared questionnaire.



           The failure of the crush barrier in Pen 3 and the

           associated structural failures related to Mr

           ADDY’s responsibilities suggest he would seek the

            same legal advice. Depending upon the advice of

           the Director of Public Prosecutions it is

           intended to refrain from interviewing Mr ADDY at

           this stage of the investigation.




           CLUB SECRETARY



St.Page    Graham Mackrell is the Sheffield Wednesday Club

36 - 59    Secretary.   He is a fairly recent employee in

           this position and he provided a comprehensive

           statement of the issues from his point of view.
STEWARDS



The role of stewards at football matches and in

particular their role at Hillsborough is an

important aspect of this investigation.



The exact responsibilities of stewards has been

the subject of debate.   There is no formal

universally accepted guide to their

responsibilities for reference.



To assist an Internal Communication dated 8 June

1988, is included which is directed to all staff

employed on match days at Hillsborough.   In

addition, following the disaster those stewards

employed at the West Stand and Terrace (Leppings

Lane end) side of the ground through solicitors

Hill Dickenson & Company have produced a report

which provides in part some history and some

viewpoint related to the events of 15 April 1989.



STEWARDS



Each section of the football ground has Stewards

allocated.   The West Stand and Leppings Lane

Terraces for example have a Chief Steward, STUART

THORPE. and he explains his role at football
matches plus the events of the 15 April 1989.



It should be noted at this point that some of the

Stewards were in fact Liverpool Football Club

Stewards employed on this day to assist the

Sheffield Club.




ACPO GUIDE



The Association of Chief Police Officers compiled

a report which provides a comprehensive

up-to-date view of the present understanding of

every conceivable aspect of Police involvement

with football.



The section on Stewards at Paragraph 71 of the

report should be addressed.



This document in its entirety will be of value in

the assessment of many of the areas applicable to

this investigation.



A Report from the Metropolitan Police outlines

briefly the duties of Police Officers and

Stewards respecting ’packing’ and monitoring

capacities at First Division football grounds,

including Wembley, in the London area.
                     - 16 -




            Statements from those stewards involved to a

            considerable extent on Saturday, 15 April 1989,

            are included.     Briefly, they describe the

            training received, the briefings given to them on

            the day by South Yorkshire Police and they

            describe the significant events that day.

            Certain stewards also marked individual maps

            showing their main position within the ground on




            The stewards provide a useful background picture

            of events often graphic and varied but valuable

            in assessing everything from the behaviour of

            supporters to the Police handling of the

            unfolding disaster.



St.Pages                      lakes reference to his knowledge

174 - 180   of a Liverpool protest group of 5-6000 people

            formed it appears because of a shortage of

            tickets for this match.



St.Pages                      tfho describes the useless tannoy

305 - 313   system and the supporters who arrived late.



St.Pages    Jack Stone who was posted to Gate ’A ’ at

87 - 95     Leppings Lane, is clear in his refusal to open

            the gate and giving a Police Officer the keys to

            do it.
                   -17 -




St.Pages                   just 21 years of age yet with

326 - 332   knowledge of the overcrowding at this ground in

            the year 1981.




            TURNSTILE OPERATORS



            Those operators who manned the Leppings Lane

            turnstiles describe their employment, the build

            up to this match and their individual

            recollections of important events on the day of

            the tragedy.



            Many of them make reference to supporters without

            tickets, being offered money to allow entry and

             some describe how supporters cheat the system to

            gain unauthorised access to the game.     Turnstile

            operators have been in the past and elsewhere,

            guilty of accepting money to allow in supporters.



            Indeed one Turnstile operator, following this

            match, was interviewed for theft when £30 was

            recovered from his home address.

Doc■Pages   A Crown Prosecution Service advice resulted in no

266 - 267   further action being taken against him.



            As with the stewards, some of the turnstile

            operators provide varied accounts, for example,
                   - 18 -



St.Pages                an how supporters abused the system

473 - 480   and how he was threatened.



St.Pages                    also verbally threatened by

369 - 373   supporters and spat upon.



St. Pages                 who recalls hearing the tannoy

354 - 364   system used telling supporters to go back through

            the tunnel.




            PROGRAMME SELLERS



            The very nature of this occupation results in

            close contact with football supporters.       In

            addition such person are placed in strategic

            ground positions to maximise sales.



St.Pages    Malcolm Hurst makes reference to between 40 and

567 - 571   50 Police Officers positioning themselves at the

            large concertina gate, GATE A when it was opened,

            and he estimates between 700 and 800 supporters

            entering.   He also recalls a tannoy message about

            crushing just before 3.10 pm.
                       - 19 -



    St.Pages                    Drovides evidence of the conduct

    556 - 560   of a supporter in confirmation of the account

    St.Pages    given by Eric Wood who describes a Liverpool

    587 - 589   Supporter stealing a programme, a policeman

                taking him back to pay and releasing him only for

                the supporter to return and assault Wood.



                There are other accounts from this category of

                employees which assist in the overall picture of

                the events preceding the match starting at 3 pm.




                GROUND STAFF



                This group of witnesses are in the main,

                permanent employees of the club with specific

                responsibilities.

    St.Pages                                            ie

^   630 - 642   recalls supporters jumping between the pens at

                about 2.45 pm in the West terraces.   He makes the

                point that no Police were present at the rear of

                pens 3 and 4 as in the past.               is also

                clear in his view that 901 of the Liverpool

                supporters he viewed at one point were drink

                affected.
                   - 20 -



St.Pages                                             provides

659 - 681   a graphic account of a number of events he

            witnessed and in which he became involved.     He

            refers particularly to a Policeman by perimeter

            Gate 4 apparently in a state of shock.    He also

            gives his own opinion that the Police present

            were not deployed effectively.              further

            states that many of the supporters rescued were

            dazed by drink.




            SECURITY



St.Pages    Douglas Lock is a retired South Yorkshire

598 - 616   Police Superintendent.   In earlier years he

            policed the Hillsborough Football Ground but

            following the Heysel Tragedy in Belgium he was

            employed by Sheffield Wednesday.   He provides

            background information and a recollection of

            events of 15 April 1989.   Included is reference

            to the computer monitoring of the ground capacity

            and confirmation of Police checks that day by

            radio and telephone.



            In addition he has responsibility for all

            Stewards and he provides further evidence of

            their training and explains how he has been

            involved in this very relevant area.

            CATERING STAFF



St.Pages                              in the Riverside

739 - 741   Restaurant situated in the South Stand provides a

            very descriptive account of her view of Pens 2 to

            7.   She describes a surge of people from the

            tunnel and relates how following the surge they

            were unable to right themselves.



St.Page     Andrew Lawson is a full time ambulance man who

703 - 721   works part time at the football club.   He makes

            reference to the 1988 policing of the same match

            and describes Police Officers checking tickets

            outside Leppings Lane and creating a filter which

            was not in evidence it seems for the 1989 game.




            CONCLUSION PART 1



            There are a number of further statements and

            questionnaires of a non-material or duplicate

            nature which only serve to reinforce the overall

            picture presented in this first part of the

            report.



            The evidence presented here will need to be

            assessed when the final report is submitted.
This report is submitted together with relevant

statements and documents for the information of

           I, Herbert Edward McGEE, of

           will state



           My date of birth is                                  I am Chairman of

           Easterbrook Allcard & Company Limited (trading as Presto Tools) and I

           am also Chairman of Sheffield Wednesday Football Club.



           I joined the Football Club as a director in December 1973 (001273),

           having been a supporter of the Club since my childhood,     I was

           appointed Chairman of the Board in October 1975 (001075).    Over the

           years there has been very little change in the composition of the

           Board.    The last appointment was 8 years ago.



           As Chairman, I have overall responsibility for the operation of the
                                                                  PAGE    2
                                                                  S1508

Club, and there are 6 other directors, each of whom has a specific

area to cover.   Thus, the Vice-Chairman, Matt SHEPPARD, is in charge

of finance, Stanley SPEIGHT is the Commercial Director; Keith ADDY is

in charge of building and structural matters; Cliff WOODWARD is in

charge of maintenance of the playing surfaces at the Club and the

training ground; Ernest BARRON is responsible for the Sports Hall and

Geoff HULLEY is responsible for catering.



In my activities as Chairman I do, of course, chair Board meetings

which take place on a regular basis - usually once a month, although,

occasionally, there may be a 6-week interval between meetings.     At

those Board meetings, we discuss all aspects of the Club, particularly

from a financial viewpoint, but it includes matters relating to

playing staff.   Apart from Board meetings, I also have regular

discussions with the Club Secretary and also with the Club Manager -

I would say these happen on a weekly basis.



In so far as safety aspects are concerned, particularly matters of a

structual nature, Keith ADDY was the director with specific

responsibility in that area.   He is a building contractor.   However,

as long as I have been a director, the Club has also employed the

services of a consulting engineer, to deal with all matters relating

to structual safety and particularly having regard to the requirements

of the Safety at Sports Grounds Act 1975 (000075), and the

requirements of the committee set up under the Local Authority, for

ensuring that the requirements of the Act are met.   In the early

stages, when I was a director, the consulting engineers were a firm

called Husband & Co, but in about 1978 (000078) I ceased using that

practice and instructed instead Bill EASTWOOD whose firm, Eastwood &

Co, have carried out the functions ever since.   I personally know Mr
                                                                  PAGE    3
                                                                  S1508

EASTWOOD as an extremely thorough and competent independent engineer

and he carries out a thorough inspection of the ground each year and

will report on any matters involving safety.    It is the policy of the

Board that where matters involving safety are concerned, any

recommendations made by Eastwood & Partners are sanctioned without

fail.   I would say that the Board generally are concerned to ensure

that Hillsborough Stadium is kept in top class condition from the

point of view of safety and the facilities offered to people using the

stadium - indeed, this is very necessary, because the Club relies to a

substantial degree on activities outside of the pure footballing field

to generate income.



The day to day management and administration of the Club is in the

hands of the Club Secretary and his staff.     However, when matters

involve major expenditure, they would be discussed at Board level and

the Board meetings would be minuted.   From time to time matters

relating to maintenance and structural safety of the ground would be

dealt with by the Board in that context, and I have caused a search to

be made of the Board minutes to examine all entries relevant to the

issues of structural safety, particularly in the Leppings Lane/West

Stand end of the Ground.   In 1976 (000076) Sheffield was not a

designated club under the terms of the Safety of Sports Grounds Act

1975 (000075) ('The Act'), but at a Board meeting on 6th October 1976

(061076), we considered the requirements of the Act and, particularly,

in relation to perimeter fencing which would be necessary if the

ground were to be considered for holding FA Cup semi-finals and the

like.   It was understood by the Board that perimeter fences would be

needed outside standing areas at the Spion Kop and Leppings Lane end

of the ground, and Messrs GKN were approached and they quoted for the

supply and erection of the necessary fencing.     The contract was placed

with than; they completed the work, and at the Directors' meeting

held on 28th April 1977 (280477) there is the following note:-



'GKN Fencing - The fencing, completed in time for the Semi-Final, had

proved to be of great assistance in crowd control.   It was agreed it

be extended between Leppings Lane and the North Stand, and Leppings

Lane and the Uncovered Seating, and a point between the Kop and

Uncovered Seating had to be examined to see if fencing would help.'



Subsequently, the St John's Ambulance Brigade suggested that more

gates in the fencing would be useful, and at a later date when it was

decided to install extra fencing, the extra gates were included in the

contract, which was again placed with GKN.   The Board meeting minutes

of Thursday, 29th September 1977 (290977) confirmed that this fencing

work had been completed.



The Club was notified that the ground was to be designated under the

Act from 1st January 1979 (010179) and at a Board meeting on 30th

November 1978 (301178) it was agreed that Eastwood & Partners should

be retained to act on behalf of the Club in relation to whatever work

was necessary to comply with the Act and with any Safety Certificate

issued by the South Yorkshire County Council.



From that time Eastwood & Partners have been retained by the Club, to

deal with matters relating to the Act and the licensing of the ground

by the Local Authority.    I have had much contact with them in that

context, with Mr. Eastwood in particular, and have always been

comforted by the fact that they have performed their tasks diligently.

Over the years they have regularly inspected the ground on an annual

basis and reported to the Club, and I can say that whenever they
                                                                  PAGE    5
                                                                  S1508

recommended that any work should be carried out, for safety reasons,

that the Board has never questioned that reccrrrnendation but has taken

steps to implement it.



Substantial works were carried out to the ground during 1979 (000079),

to enable us to obtain the licence from the local Authority, and

thereafter, over subsequent years, work was done to improve the ground

and the facilities offered on a regular basis.



In 1985 (000085) the Club was promoted to the First Division and the

Board were considering the possibilities in terms of development of

the ground in the long term.   The Leppings Lane end of the ground was

to be used for away supporters, although at that time seme Sheffield

Wednesday supporters had season tickets for the West Stand.   The

minutes do show that the matter being discussed at that time included

the re-organisation of the turnstiles at the Leppings Lane end and I

have been told that a number of alternative schemes were proposed.        I

do recall that at about that time the Bradford fire disaster occurred

and, as a result of it, we recognised that certain alterations would

be required to the South Stand at Hillsborough which involved cladding

to the stand with metal sheeting. I have at this stage no clear

recollection of the nature of the discussions which took place at

Board level before we approved the final scheme for re-organising the

turnstiles at Leppings Lane.   Doubtless, cost would have been a factor,

but I am certain that there was no question of adopting a scheme

involving lesser cost at the expense of safety.   The safety of

spectators at the ground was always a priority with us and we would

not consider lowering our standards on safety in order to save

expense.   I believe it was the ability to segregate home and away

supporters, together with improving the facilities generally, which
                                                                        PAGE      6
                                                                        S1508

        was of major importance, and certainly we did not consider that there

        was ever likely to be a dangerous situation created in admitting

        spectators to the ground at that end.   Over the years, Hillsborough

        has accommodated capacity crowds and we considered that the number of

        tumsitles available for admitting spectators to the ground was more

        then adequate and stood comparison with any other football ground in

        the country.



        I was present at the ground for the Semi-Final on 15th April 1989

         (150489) and was seated in the directors' box shortly before kick-off.

        From that distance, I did, of course, become aware at one stage of

        a disturbance at the Leppings Lane end of the ground when I saw

        spectators climbing over the perimeter fence, but at that stage Iwas

        certainly not aware of the tragedy that was occurring.   There is

        nothing that I can say from a spectator's point of view which would be

        likely to add to the evidence already available from those nearer the

        incident than I was at the time that it occurred.



         I have read this statement and it is true and correct, to the best of

        my knowledge and belief.

           I, Graham Henry MACKRELL, of

                           will say:-



           My date of birth is



           I am employed as the Secretary of Sheffield Wednesday Football Club.

           My employment history is as follows:-



           After completing my O-Levels at school I joined^                   (as

           they were then known), a firm of Accountants, at their

           office.     I qualified as an Accountant and became a Fellow of the

           Association of Certified Accountants in 1976 (000076).



           In the interim I left                    in about August 1974 (000874) to
                                                                    PAGE    2
                                                                    S1748

join the staff of Bournemouth Football Club and I was appointed Club

Secretary shortly after that.



At that time Bournemouth were a Third Division Club but they were in

fact relegated to the Fourth Division the year after I joined them.

The facilities at the club were therefore fairly basic but when the

Safety of Sports Grounds Act 1975 ("the Act") became law I was aware

of it and of the Green Guide that was subsequently issued.     The Club

was not of course a designated Club within the terms of the Act

because of its status but certainly work done at the Club thereafter

had regard to the provisions of the Act and the Green Guide.     One of

the Directors of Bournemouth FC at that time was an Architect and

he took a lead part in organising alterations and improvements to the

Ground but I worked closely with him throughout that time.



In November 1981 (001181) following an approach from Luton Town

Football Club I resigned my position at Bournemouth and became

Secretary to Luton Town FC.     I remained with that club until I

resigned in November 1986 (001186) and virtually immediately

thereafter joined Sheffield Wednesday Football Club in my present

position.



When I joined Luton Town Football Club they were in the Second

Division and won the Second Division championship that year becoming

promoted to the First Division.    At that time First and Second

Division Clubs were designated under the Act and as Secretary to the

club I had responsibility for safety matters.    As such I was the

Club's representative at meetings of the comnittee set up by the Local

Authority for the purpose of licensing the ground under the Act.       I

reported on safety matters to the Board and the Club retained a firm
                                                                     PAGE    3
                                                                     S1748

of Consulting Architects who dealt with all matters relating to safety

requirements.   I dealt with a particular Partner in that Architectural

Practice, one                tfho would inspect the Ground and the

facilities on a regular basis to ensure that we did comply with the

requirements of the Act and the Green Guide.



When I joined Sheffield Wednesday Football Club as Secretary the Club

had already an established system for dealing with safety matters,

licensing by the Local Authority and requirements of the Act and

the Green Guide generally.     The Club retained Consulting Engineers,

Eastwood and Partners, who performed the same role for Sheffield

Wednesday as the Architects retained by Luton Town FC had

performed for them.     Similarly in my position as Secretary I am in

effect the Chief Executive of the Club and I have overall control

of safety matters reporting to the Board on that as well as other

topics connected with the running of the club.



Since my appointment the composition of the Board of Directors has not

changed.   The Chairman is Mr Herbert MCGEE and there are 6 other Board

members.   They are in effect a non-executive Board who take

none the less a close interest in the affairs of the club and who

regularly attend Board meetings.     There are regular Board meetings,

perhaps 9 each year.     The club is, to my knowledge, a little unusual

in that the members of the Board between them hold only 4.8 per

cent of the issued share capital and there is in fact no single

entity who has anything approaching control of the club.     Each

member of the Board, in his non-executive capacity, takes special

responsibility for a particular activity.    Thus for example Matthew

SHEPPARD, the Vice-Chairman, is an Accountant and responsible for

financial matters.     Keither ADDY is a builder/developer with
                                                                 PAGE     4
                                                                 S1748

responsibility for the Ground and premises.



Insofar as the full time management of the club is concerned I am

assisted by 6 departmental heads as follows

MAINTENANCE MANAGER



Douglas LOCK has special responsibility for security matters.    I have

seen and read a copy of the Statement he has already prepared and it

accurately describes his position and role as Chief of Security.     He

has primary responsibility for the recruitment, training and

supervision of Stewards and Gatemen.   I am aware of the fact that

Stewards are given written instructions at the commencement of each
                                                                   PAGE    5
                                                                   S1748

Season, as to the duties they are required to perform etc.

Furthermore, at the start of each Season, Mr LOCK organises training

evenings.     There were 2 successive training evenings for the

corrmencement of the 1988/89 (000088/000089) Season, on one of which

there were instructions, demonstrations etc laid on for Stewards and

on the second evening for Gatemen, Car Park Attendants and the like.

I was present throughout the first of those evenings and for part

of the second evening but I had to leave early on the second evening

to attend a Board meeting.     At the training evening video films

dealing with emergency procedures etc and produced by one of the

Country's Police Forces were shown, as well as demonstrations given

on First Aid techniques, mouth to mouth resuscitation etc and talks

also by the Fire Brigade personnel as well as Mr LOCK himself.



I have always considered Douglas LOCK to be a very able and reliable

Security Officer, perhaps uniquely experienced in the sense that he

was previously a Superintendent with the South Yorkshire Police Force

in which capacity he had a good deal of responsibility for supervising

the policing of Sheffield Wednesday Football Ground at Hillsborough.

He is a man who has written and had published articles on policing of

football matches and because of his background he has also been of

assistance to me in liaison with the South Yorkshire Police.



            Ls the Club caretaker in charge of general maintenance. He

has been with the club some 40 years and is in fact approaching

retirement.     Essentially he carries out running repairs of a

maintenance nature and will often carry out small works requested by

Mr EASTWOOD.     He has the assistance of 2 men who work in his team,

              and             and there are also about 10 cleaners who

are employed on a regular part-time basis.     The Groundsman is
                                                                 PAGE    6
                                                                 S1748

       and he has a number of staff working with him in keeping the

pitch in good condition.



In my capacity as Secretary to the Club I have executive

responsibility effectively for the overall organisation of the

Club's activities.   As such I am the person with overall

responsibility for safety matters and liaise directly with the

Working Party set up under the aegis of the Local Authority.    This

Working Party consists of representatives from the Police and Fire

Brigade and also from the Surveyors/Structural Engineers' Department

and the Environmental Health Department of the City of Sheffield

(formerly the South Yorkshire Metropolitan County Council). These

meetings are held on an annual basis for the purposes of licensing

the club under the Safety of Sports Grounds Act 1975 and the Safety

Committee make a thorough inspection of the Ground each year for

that purpose.   In the past, those inspections would normally take

place in about August.     However in 1988 (000088) we brought the

inspection forwards to May of that year (000588) and the same is

happening this year, the intention being to give the club plenty of

time to carry out any necessary work that might be required as a

condition of issuing the License.



Prior to the annual meeting of the Safety Committee it is usually the

practice for Eastwood and Partners to carry out their own thorough

inspection of the Ground to make sure that, so far as we can, it is in

first class condition before the Safety Committee inspect.     In fact as

part of that process the Consulting Engineer will issue a

Certificate confirming their inspection and they are also required

to carry out certain tests - for example tests on crush barriers.
                                                                 PAGE      7
                                                                 S1748

If Eastwood and Partners, upon carrying out their inspection, came

across any matters upon which they needed a decision I would be the

person with whom they would liaise at the club.     Similarly if there

was any member of the Club staff, including Mr LOCK, who thought that

there was some matter relating to the structural integrity of the

Ground or otherwise relating to the Green Guide or the Act, they would

draw it to my attention and I would then deal with Eastwood and

Pamers.   Thus, for example, Douglas LOCK would not normally have

direct contact with the Consulting Engineers - anything he had to do

or say would be done through me.



I am also primarily responsible for liaison with the Police in

relation to the policing of matches at the Ground.     The club signs an

annual contract with the South Yorkshire Police Authority for the

provision of Police Officers on match days.    There is an annual

meeting called by the Police with representatives of all 5 Yorkshire

Clubs who come under the jurisdiction of the South Yorkshire Police.

They are Sheffield Wednesday, Sheffield United, Doncaster Rovers,

Rotherham and Barnsley FC.   At that meeting there is usually a general

discussion relating to policing and football and it is invariably my

practice to attend with a member of the Board of Directors.     In

addition to that annual meeting there is regular liaison with the

Police throughout the Season.   Thus, for example, when the Fixture

list is published in June of each year I send a copy to the Police for

their corrment prior to comrtencement of the Season and they may have a

particular request in relation to matches on the Fixture List.       I

recall, for example, that last Season we had a fixture against

Newcastle United on Boxing Day and the Police asked us to bring the

kick-off forward to 12 noon (1200) and we did so.     I do not recall

them giving a particular reason for that   -   the position is that if
                                                                 PAGE    8
                                                                 S1748

the Police, with their knowledge of policing matters, ask me to

co-operate with them in relation to particular matches I will always

attempt to do so in every way possible and I would not, for example,

require a detailed explanation from them as in that instance, as to

why they wished a particular change to be made.



For matches played at Hillsborough the Police Liaison Officer

(Inspector SEWELL) would normally contact me a week or more before the

match was to take place.   For a normal match where an unusual crowd

was not expected the contact would be made probably to find out such

detaiils as which turnstiles we intended to open, what time they were

to be opened etc so that he could be sure that our plans for manning

the turnstiles and stewarding the ground complied with his knowledge

of arrival times for visiting fans etc.   If it were a particularly

large match where we would expect, for    example,    a largenumber of

Away Supporters as well as Home supporters then      the degree of liaison

will naturally increase as a good deal    of more detailedplanning has

to go into the Policing of it from thepoint of view of providing

extra Police Officers and from the clubs point of view, deployment

of Stewards.   Inspector SEWELL is assisted in his liaison duties by

Detective Constable CHARLESWORTH stationed at Hammerton Road Police

Station and I would have a degree of contact with him as well.    For

example it would be my normal practice, prior to a Home fixture, to

speak to the Secretary of the visiting club for information as to the

number of Away fans to be expected having regard to their ticket sales

etc and I would pass that information on to the Police to assist them

in their planning.



The average gate this year at Hillsborough has been about 20,000 fans.

For the normal or average attendance the Contract with the Police will
                                                                  PAGE     9
                                                                  S1748

lay down the number of Police Officers who are deployed.     That number

can however be increased at the discretion of the Police Authority if

a particularly heavy gate is expected, for example, or indeed if the

Away fans are expected to be unruly.   Where the number is being

increased it is not the practice of the Police Authority to discuss

and agree with me before hand how many extra Police they will

involve.   I have never required them to agree extra numbers with me or

queried a Police invoice for manning - the invoice is in fact related

to the size of the gate as set out in the Contract with them, save for

seme matches such as the FA Cup Semi-Final, which would be charged on

a different basis.   The Accounts for the club indicate that for the

year ended May 1988 (000588) the club paid a total of #97,731, to the

South Yorkshire Police for policing the Ground.   Of that sum a total

of #39,800, related to the policing costs of the 1988 (000088) FA Cup

Semi Final between Liverpool FC and Nottingham Forest FC.



I am aware of the fact that the South Yorkshire Police draw up

operational plan for each Heme game at Hillsborough and they do not

normally provide a copy of that plan to a club.   I have however in the

past asked for one if only out of interest to see how they

organise the deployment of Police in controlling crowds and when I

have asked I have been provided with a copy.



In my dealings with the Police over the years, in relation to

Hillsborough policing, I would say that they have made it plain that

they regarded the function of Stewards from the Club as directing

people to their seats and manning gates around the ground.    They

very much regarded the Police being in charge of crowd control

generally, both inside and outside the ground and indeed the

written instructions to Stewards which we issue every year take
                                                                PAGE 10
                                                                S1748

these factors into account.   They were drafted by Douglas Lock and

approved by me and I have no doubt he drafted them having regard to

his own experience as a Superintendent with the South Yorkshire

Police.



I would say that in ray experience in the context of policing within

the Ground, the Police are most concerned about the question of

segregating Heme and Away fans.   It is ray belief that they regard that

as the primary means by which they avoid crowd trouble.



There are contingency plans agreed with the Police to deal with an

emergency situation at the ground.   Arrangements with the Police

basically cover evacuation of the Ground in an emergency and all

Stewards are trained in that procedure.   Their task is simply to man

and open the gates to allow people out of the Ground in an orderly

fashion.   Before each game the Police meet with the Referee and

discuss with him the emergency procedures which would be involved in

stopping the game and evacuating the Ground.   To ray knowledge these

emergency procedures have been tested during match days, to ensure

that they work properly and the test procedure will involve the

broadcast of a message over the Tannoy, by the Police Operator which

will act as a signal to the Stewards and the Police Officers to take

their positions for dealing with an emergency situation.   In that

context I would explain that the Tannoy system is one where the Police

control Room has the ability to operate it as well as the Club Disc

Jockey/Announcer but the Police have an override facility so that

they can cut across any announcements being made by the Club Disc

Jockey in order to broadcast a message.   The procedure for emergencies

involves the Police control of the Tannoy system and I cannot envisage

a situation where emergency messages would be broadcast by Club
                                                                 PAGE 11
                                                                 S1748

Staff.   If, for example, I became aware of an emergency which

necessitated a Tannoy announcment, I would report that to the Police

so that they could make the announcement, rather than make it myself.



As to the contingency plans for coping with spectators coming into the

Ground this is done on specific occasions when the Police would be

aware that visiting supporters who may have an all ticket arrangement,

might have a contingent arriving without tickets or, for example,

where they might expect a large number of spectators to arrive who

would be seeking to pay cash at the turnstiles.   They would then have

arrangements with us for turnstiles to be opened to admit such

spectators or, in the case of an all ticket match, they would have

arrangements made to remove spectators without tickets from the

vicinity of the ground.   That, for example, happened very recently

with the Middlesbrough game where the space available for

Middlesbrough supporters was severely restricted due to the closure of

the West Stand area following the events on 15th April (150489).     The

Police anticipated there might be a lot of Middlesbrough supporters

and had contingency plans in place, to my knowledge, to hold

spectators arriving without tickets at a nearby Police sports ground.

Other than that I am not aware of any other contingency plans to deal

with the question of a mass of spectators arriving for entrance such

as happened at the semi final on 15th April (150489).



I have stated that Stewards are instructed to man all exit gates from

the ground but the exception to that is the gates in the perimeter

fencing which allow access onto the pitch.   During the period that I

have been with Sheffield Wednesday I cannot remember any instance

where those gates were manned by Stewards - it is Police who are

normally stationed along the perimeter and I believe that the numbers
                                                                 PAGE 12
                                                                 S1748

of people Standing on the perimeter would be kept as low as possible

to avoid obstructing the view of spectators behind the fence.    I

cannot remember however any instance where there was express

discussion and agreement with the Police that they would be

responsible for manning those perimeter gates instead of Club

Stewards - it is just something that has always happened in practice

during my time with the Club.   Overall I would say that there is very

close liaison between the club and the Police and this is particularly

so having regard to the relationship between Doug LOCK and the South

Yorkshire Police.



On a match day the Police will have their own briefing sessions with

the ground, both a general briefing for all officers and specific

briefings for Officers posted to different sections around and within

the ground, as far as I am aware.   They also brief our stewards on a

sectional basis - ie the Officer dealing with policing on the West

Stand area will brief the stewards who are working in that area and

likewise the officer in charge of the Spion Kop will brief the

stewards in that area and so on.    The stewards will also be briefed by

Douglas LOCK on the match day and since he has direct supervision

of those stewards I leave that aspect to him although I am generally

aware of what goes on and have in fact from time to time attended

briefing sessions.



FA Cup Semi-Finals have been held at Hillsborough in 1987 (000087)

(Leeds V Coventry City); in 1988 (000088) and 1989 (000089).    These

latter two games have both involved Liverpool FC and Nottingham Forest

FC.   In 1987 (000087) the match was moved to a Sunday at the request

of the Police because they anticipated there might be difficulties

with Leeds United supporters. Chief Superintendent Brian MQLE was in
                                                                  PAGE 13
                                                                  S1748

charge of the policing as indeed he was for the 1988 (000088) game.

For the 1987 (000087) game I do in fact have a copy of the Police

operations manual which is the written instructions issued by the

South Yorkshire Police for policing the game.     I cannot now remember

exactly when I obtained a copy of that - it may well have been after

the fixture took place and to the best of my recollection I was given

a copy when I requested it because I was interested to see how they

were organising the match from their end. That match took place on

Sunday 12 April 1987 120487) and a few weeks before there was a

briefing meeting arranged at the request of the Police.    The earlier

briefing was on 20 March and involved Brian MOLE together with _____

                           of Leeds United and              of Coventry

City.     I attended with my assistance



For the 1988 (000088) Semi-Final, which took place on 9th April

(090488) of that year, the early briefing meeting took place in the

Boardroom at Hillsborough on 23 March (230388) with Mr MOLE present

and with                  of Liverpool and            of Nottingham

Forest.     It involved discussion with the Police and the participating

Clubs as to which areas of the ground their supporters would be

attending, how tickets would be colour-coded and marked for each set

of supporters, where car parking arrangements and parking of coaches

would be organised and matters of that nature.



For the 1989 (000089) Semi-Final there was no such prior meeting with

the Police - I understood they felt one was not necessary as the game

involved effectively an action reply of the year before, when the same

teams were involved and once again Nottingham Forest fans were to be

accommodated in the Spion Kpp and the Southh Stand area and the

Liverpool fans would be accomodated in the North and West Stand
                                                                  PAGE 14
                                                                  S1748

areas.



My own recollection of the semi final which took place in 1988

(000088) is that everything went extremely smoothly and indeed I have

referred to the file I kept for that fixture and the records indicate

that we had comparatively little by way of damage to the ground

afterwards.     There were in fact a couple of letters from supporters

afterwards, including one from a Liverpool supporter who expressed

his appreciation for the way in which the game had been organised and

stewarded.     My own recollection is that there were no problems in

getting the fans into the ground on the time for kick off that year,

but my memory is that the Liverpool fans in particular arrived earlier

that year than they did for the 1989 (000089) Semi-Final.



The draw for the FA Cup Semi-Final took place on Monday 20th March

(200389).     I was telephoned by              the Competition Secretary

of the Football Assocation, that morning before the meeting of the

FA took place.     He asked me to contact the Police to confirm that if

Hillsborough were awarded the semi final between Liverpool and

Nottingham Forest, that they would once again insist upon the

Nottingham Forest fans being accomodated in the Spion Kbp and Southh

Stand areas.    As a result I spoke on the telephone to Chief

Superintendent Brian MDLE who confirmed that that would be the case.

I was aware of the Police reason for so insisting - it enabled them to

have more effective control over the flow of fans into the ground,

since the Nottingham Forest fans, in journeying from Nottingham, would

normally arrive at the Penistone Road end of the ground via

Junction 34 of the Ml and Liverpool fans would exit the motorway so

as to arrive at the Leppings Lane end via the A61 from Junction 36 of

the motorway.
                                                                  PAGE 15
                                                                  S1748



I t e l e p h o n e d     [and   confirmed what Chief Superintendent Brian

MOLE had told me.   The Semi-Final at Hillsborough was later confirmed

by telephone and this enabled us to put arrangements in hand

for the printing of tickets etc.



I recall that a couple of days before the Semi-Final the FA telephoned

to enquire whether the club would be providing a Doctor positioned

near the playing area.    Arrangements had already been made b y _____

     for the Club Doctor, Doctor Bill PURCELL, to attend and he had

been allocated a ticket which would seat him in the Southh Stand in

the pen behind the dug-out.      I believe the FA were concerned about

the presence of a Club Doctor beecause of a recent event which had

received seme publicity, where a Bristol Rovers player had been

injured on the field and had swallowed his tongue and needed emergency

treatment.



I now turn to events that occurred on the day of the match, 15th

April, 1989 (150489).     I arrived at the ground between 7 and 7.30

am (0700 and 0730).     Inmediately after arriving I walked right round

the ground, as is my normal practice before a game, to check for

nryself the general state of things.     I would be looking to see, for

example, that the ground was generally tidy.



I had a number of tasks to perform that morning such as finalising TV

arrangements, including means of access for television crews, dealing

with the issue of passes, co-ordinating arrangements for a luncheon to

be held involving Management of the 2 competing clubs and FA

Officials and local dignitaries.      The guests started to arrive shortly

after 11 am (1100).
                                                                PAGE 16
                                                                S1748



I recall during the course of that morning, that I met with Douglas

LOCK in the reception area in the Southh Stand offices and talked to

him about the arrangements for the day.    It is normal for Doug LOCK to

seek me out on a match day to enquire whether I had any special

instructions for him and the Stewards.    On this occasion I needed to

talk to him about arrangements for opening the turnstiles.   That arose

because originaly we had agreed with the Police that the turnstiles

would open at 12 noon (1200) and a potential problem had then arisen

as a result of seme information that was inserted in the Liverpool

programme, for Liverpool fans, the previous week.    That arose because

Sheffield Wednesday played Liverpool at Anfield on Saturday, 8th

April (080489) and the Sheffield Police had arranged for an article to

be inserted in the Liverpool Programme giving instructions to

Liverpool fans as to their journey from Liverpool to Sheffield for the

FA Cup Semi-Final, arrangements for car parking etc and it was stated

in that document that 'Gates will be opened from 11 am (1100), with

pre match entertainment and refreshments available inside the

Ground." Subsequently the Police realised that this information

clashed with the arrangments that they had made with me, for the

turnstiles to be opened at 12 and I was asked by Inspector SEWELL, as

I recall, whether we could assist by having turnstile Operators there

to open a few of the turnstiles early if there was a build up of

spectators outside.   I had confirmed there would be no problem with

that, since Stewards and Turnstile operators had Standing instructions

to be at the ground no later than 11 am (1100) on the semi final day.



During the hours leading up to the start of the game, I was busy

dealing with a variety of organisational matters.   As is my normal

practice I would , from time to time, walk out of the office and check
                                                                 PAGE 17
                                                                 S1748

the position in the Ground itself.     Thus, for example, on more than

one occasion I walked down the players tunnel to see how the

spectators were building up and my principal recollection is that

Nottingham Forest were filling up their end of the ground at a quite

early stage but Liverpool supporters were not.    As I recall that in

fact was remarked on by several members of staff during the course of

that day.   From time to time I would also walk outside to see how

matters were outside the Ground.     I remember walking up the private

road that runs alongside the river from the Directors entrance to the

Leppings Lane entrance.   The Police had created a sterile area along

part of that roadway, by erecting barriers just beyond Gate C at

Leppings Lane End and a further series of barriers near the 'dog-leg'

comer close to Gate E.    I did in fact have to speak to the Police

there to arrange for some cars to be allowed to park within the

sterile area, since visiting dignatories from Nottingham Forest had

been allocated parking spaces there.     As I recall there was a group of

foot officers of the South Yorkshire Police manning each of those 2

barriers - perhaps of the order of 8 - 10 Officers at each barrier.



The last occasion when I visited the Leppings Lane end before problems

built up later was probably shortly after 2 pm (1400) but I cannot put

anything like an exact time on it.     However my recollection of the

situation at Leppings Lane at that time was that the number of

Liverpool supporters was starting to build up - there was a

substantial group of them present but I would not say that the area

was packed solid.   I can say that nothing about the scene at that time

struck me as unusual or potentially dangerous.



Subsequently I was in and out of the office (I had placed myself in

              office that afternoon) at intervals and on more than one
                                                                  PAGE 18
                                                                  S1748

occasion I would have walked down the player's tunnel to see what was

happening on the pitch and on the Stands and terraces, from the inside

the ground.   It was still the case that it was noticeable that

Livepool fans were slower building up in the North Stand and the West

Stand areas than the Nottingham Forest fans.



I had agreed with the media and with the television crews in

particular as to how they should position themselves prior to

commencement of the match because they were anxious to film the teams

coning out onto the pitch.   In particular Brian CLOUGH, the Nottingham

Forest Manager, was very much in the news at that time because he had

been banned from the touch-line and I knew that they were anxious to

film him and were aware that he had been allocated a seat in the pen

immediately behind the dug-out.   As I recall, I was out on the pitch

when the Liverpool team came out and just after they came onto the

pitch Doug LOCK came up to me and told me that gate C had either been

opened or broken down at the Leppings Lane end and as I recall he told

me that about 300 - 400 pieople had entered through the gate.   I said I

would go and see what the problem was and I immediately pushed my way

through the photographers in the area and walked up the player's

tunnel.   At that stage the Nottingham Forest team were also on the

pitch but the photographers were waiting for the arrival of Brian

CLOUGH, I believe.



I walked out of the Ground and around through the sterile area to Gate

C at Leppings Lane.   I imagine the match must have been kicked off at

about that time but cannot be certain.   Once the teams were out on

the pitch the noise from the huge crowd inside the stadium was such

that it would be difficult to tell from outside whether the kick off

had taken place and in any event I was concentrating on the problem in
                                                                 PAGE 19
                                                                 S1748

hand.   In going through the sterile area I did, of course, pass the

groups of foot officers who were on duty at each set of barriers and

when I arrived at Gate C the gate was partially open.   A mounted

Police Officer was positioned outside the gate and there was a line

of fans walking in and as I recall he was shouting to the fans

indicating to them that they should not come through in that queue

unless they had a ticket. The fans who were walking through were

holding up tickets for him to see that they had one.    There seemed to

be a number of fans around who did not have tickets and could not get

access as a result.



As I walked through the gate I recollect that there were a couple of

Police Officers stationed just inside it and one of our stewards,

Richard BEADSLEY, to whom I spoke.   Looking at him he seemed a bit

shaken and I asked him whether he was all right and he answered in

the affirmative.   I was intent on making my way to the Police Control

Box to find out exactly what was going on and to do that I had to

walk around the Southhem comer of the West Stand and go through a

gate adjacent to turnstiles 19 -22 to get to the Box.   That gate was

manned by Club Stewards who also man the exit Gate E at that point,

and they let me through.



I climbed up into the Police Control Box and I recall that Chief

Superintendent David DUCKENFIELD was there with Superintendent Bernard

MURRAY and I believe 2 other officers.   When I looked out of

the window of the Police Control Box I noticed for the first time

that they were a large number of Liverpool supporters on the pitch

around the Liverpool goal area, that other supporters appeared to be

seeking to climb over the perimeter fence to gain access to the pitch

and some were also climbing or being pulled up from the back of the
                                                                  PAGE 20
                                                                  S1748

terrace up to the seated area in the West Stand.   I cannot say whether

the gates in the perimeter fence were open at that stage - there was a

such a mass of people around that it would not have been obvious.    I

recall that I asked what was happening and was told that people were

being crushed in the pens because of pressure from behind.   No

reference was made at any stage to the gate having been opened and

it was clearly an urgent situation where I did not wish to interfere

with the Police operations.   They were giving instructions over

their personal radios to Officers as to how they should deal with

the situation on the ground and I recall that Chief Superintendent

DUCKENFIELD was talking to the Police Officer who had control of the

Tannoy System telling him to keep talking to the crowd.   As I recall

the message that was being repeated over the Tannoy at that stage was

asking the crowd to keep calm and remain patient without giving any

reason why - ie without explaining the nature of the emergency that

had arisen.   I recall that I did ask whether there were any fatalities

and Mr DUCKENFIELD replied, "I believe so, yes."



The impression I had was that there was a confused situation and I

heard the Police giving instructions to deploy men at the front of the

perimeter fence and to seek bolt cutters.



I left the Police Control Room and went back to the Directors' area

via the kitchens of the Riverside Suite, seeking out FA Officials, in

particular Graham KELLY, the Chief Executive, to advise him of what

was happening.   I met him in the offices' area, as I recall near the

boardroom and I told him that what was involved outside was not a

pitch invasion but a major incident and I took him and Glenn KIRTON of

the FA back to the Police Control Box.   When we entered the Control

Box you could see through the window that there were a number of
                                                                PAGE 21
                                                                S1748

people in obvious distress and receiving mouth to mouth resuscitation.

In discussions with the Police it was agreed that the match could not

be re-started but the Police were anxious not to announce that fact

to the fans because they feared that fans who might then leave the

ground would impede access to the emergency services.   Consequently

whilst the Police announcer was still talking to the crowd at regular

intervals over the Tannoy.   I believe no formal announcement was made

even at that stage that we had a major incident on our hands.



After a short while I left the Police Control Box again with Graham

KELLY and Glenn KIRTON and Mr KELLY said that he wanted to convene a

meeting in the boardroom with representatives of all 3 clubs, FA

Officials and the match referee.   Between the 3 of us we gathered the

various people together in the Boardroom where a meeting took place

and we discussed the abandonment of the match and agreed that we would

not formally announce it was abandoned until the Police considered

that it was safe to do so, having regard to their concern about access

for emergency vehicles.   I recall that during the meeting Doug LOCK

entered the room and said he had a message from Brian CLOUGH that he

was putting his players in the bath and taking them home, or words to

that effect.



Subsequently I recall that I went back to the Police Control Box and

was there when the announcement was made over the Tannoy that the

match was formally abandoned, the crowd were informed that there was a

major incident and they were asked to remain patiently in their places

until they were advised by the Police that they could disperse in an

orderly manner, without impeding the emergency services.   As I recall

the announcement was effective and later the supporters did leave the

ground in an orderly fashion.
                                                                   PAGE 22
                                                                   S1748



As to access to the ground generally, for an all ticket game I would

expect each turnstile to admit at a rate of about 800 per hour with a

good operator on it.   I am aware that for spectators for the Standing

area at Leppings Lane on 15th April (150489) we expected to have full

capacity (10,100) and their tickets would indicate that they should

gain entrance through turnstiles A - G.   With 7 turnstiles operating

I appreciate that it would take a period of time before all

spectators could be admitted.   However given that the turnstiles were

to be opened no later than 12 noon (1200) for a kick-off at 3 pm

(1500) and given the experience of the previous year where there had

been no difficulty with spectators getting into the Ground (albeit

some will always arrive late) I did not anticipate that there would be

a problem on 15th April (150489).   I would expect that

would have put his more experienced turnstiles operators on the

turnstiles at the Kop end and Leppings Lane end, for the terraces,

that day.



I would expect the Stewards manning Gate C (there were some 3 in

number) to assist in the orderly dispersal of spectators once they had

come through the turnstiles, for they would normally be caning through

at such a rate that it would be possible for Stewards to direct them

in a particular way.   Similarly the gate in the dividing wall at the

rear of the West Stand which divides the area behind turnstiles A - G

from the area covered by turnstiles 1 1 - 1 6 would be manned by

Stewards, even though it was open throughout that afternoon and

those stewards would also direct spectators towards the Standing

area in pens 5, 6 and 7 in the North West comer.    I would not

expect our stewards to be Standing on the terraces themselves

because it is not an easy task to ask a steward to Stand on the
                                                                 PAGE 23
                                                                 S1748

terraces surrounded by away fans for any football match.     Those

terraces are normally patrolled by Police with the assistance of

visiting Stewards where appropriate.   I know that there were

Liverpool Stewards in attendance at this game.    Apart from those who

may have entered via the turnstiles, a group of them arrived at the

Club's offices on 15th April (150489) and I authorised their admission

to the ground as Liverpool Stewards.



In conclusion I have been asked to ccmnent on two matters in case it

should be felt that they had any bearing on the tragic events of 15th

April (150489) - they relate to the provision of First Aid equipment

and loudhailers for stewards.



In 1988 (000088) the Local Authority Environmental Health Officers

inspected with specific reference to this item and wanted the club to

provide such equipment as was considered necessary by the St John's

Ambulance Brigade.    I spoke to Peter WELLS, the Duty Officer of the St

John's Ambulance, Sheffield area and he provided me with an extract

from a booklet listing what was required.   I gave that to

who organised the purchase of the equipment.     I am not aware whether

the Environmental Heath Officer came back to check that they had been

purchased.



St John's Ambulance Brigade are responsible for providing First Aid

cover at the ground during matches. This is a Standard arrangement

with the Football League and as I understand that they undertake to

provide adequate First Aid cover.   They will have details of our

Fixture List for the Season and a degree of local knowledge as to the

likely attendances.   If there is any variation in the Fixture List

they are notified and they are also notified of special occasions such
                                                                        PAGE 24
                                                                        S1748

       as the holding of a FA Cup Semi final at the ground.   They were sent

       a letter prior to the match on 15th April (150489) this year and asked

       to provide adequate cover and they confirmed they would do so.



       Prior to the incident the club provided no loudhailers for the use of

       Stewards but I was aware that the police had them for their own use.

       The Tannoy system was in my view the way to deal with any

       announcements that needed to be made to the crowd and the system is

       such that announcements can be directed to particular sections of the

       Ground including out into the Leppings Lane area to people outside the

       turnstiles.



       The number of safety stewards we employ is not a factor which is

       raised for discussion at Safety Corrmittee meetings in my experience

       of attending such meetings.   I believe that the Club would Stand

       comparison with virtually any other club in the country in relation to

        the number that we do employ on a regular basis and those numbers

       can be increased for certain matches if a large crowd is expected,

        this being done by agreement between Doug LOCK and the senior

        stewards.



        I have read this statement and it is true and correct to the best of

       my knowledge and belief.

           I am employed on a part-time basis by Sheffield Wednesday Football

           Club, Hillsborough, Sheffield, as a Chief Steward for all the home

           games at the above football ground.   I have been appointed Chief

           Steward for just the 1988-1989 (000088) (000089) season.   Prior to

           that I was deputy Chief Steward on the North Stand, a position which

           I held for three seasons and prior to that I was a Steward for about

           ten years.



           On Saturday 15th April, 1989 (150489) I arrived at Hillsborough

           Football Club at about 10.45 am (1045).   I went to the Security

           Office and obtained my radio, and together with the Stewards I was

           responsible for, I was to attend a briefing in the Kop by Inspector

           CALVERT at 11.00 am (1100).



           I arrived at 11.00 am (1100) and on arrival Inspector CALVERT was

           already there with about twenty Policemen and I believe he was

           briefing those officers.   It was about 11.15 am (1115) that

           Inspector CALVERT briefed my Stewards and myself.




                                                                                    60
CASTLEY                JOHN PHILIP                                        2


We were advised by Inspector CALVERT that it was believed that about

400 Liverpool fans were in possession of tickets for the Kop.    If any

were found they were to be escorted to the triangle area on the left-

hand side of the Kop as you look from the ground where there would be

a line of Policemen segregating them.



Inspector CALVERT also enquired if everyone was aware of the

emergency coded message, and if the stewards had been present for

last season's Semi-Final.   All my Stewards answered in the

affirmative.



On completion of the briefing by Inspector CALVERT, which lasted about

five minutes, I went to my office with the other Stewards for their

dockets.    They then remained in my Office, and I went to stile area

under the South Stand, and collected nine temporary Stewards, who, as

far as I am aware, are all Sheffield United Stewards.    I took these

Stewards to my office, and with all the Stewards, conducted a

briefing.   This consisted of telling them that the gangway of the Kop,

the steps were to be kept clear at all times.



I then asked my stewards to pair off with a Sheffield United Steward

and sent them off to the posts, telling them that I didn't want to see

a yellow and red jacket more than twenty yards near to each other and

I also reinforced the fact that Liverpool fans may attempt to gain

entry into the Kop, and what they were to do should they be identified.



I then completed the necessary paperwork for payment to be made to the

Stewards.   I then went to the stile room and got the money for the
CASTLEY                JOHN   PHILIP                                       3


gatemen, which I pay exit immediately.   The Stewards I pay on

completion of the game.    I then made a check of all the posts for

which i am responsible, but due to large amount of fans coming to the

ground and the vehicle traffic, I spent a lot of time at 'O' Gate.

It was whilst I was at this gate I saw two or three people at various

times during the afternoon, trying to buy and sell tickets.      We were

also having trouble with Liverpool supporters over the period of

several hours of about 200 to 300 Liverpool fans attempting to gain

entry into the ground, stating that they had been directed to 'O' gate

by the Police from the Leppings Land end, and also coming down on

their own volition because they said they would miss the match if

they stayed at the Leppings Lane end.



When they were refused entry they became abusive towards us, swearing

at us.    As far as I am aware the turnstiles were due to be opened by

eleven o'clock (1100), some of which were but not all of them.      It

was in fact 12 o'clock (1200) before they were all opened.



At about 2.50 pm (1450) I was at 'O' gate when I heard that the

Liverpool fans had broken down a gate at the Leppings Lane end of the

ground.



I then walked to the side of the pitch between the North Stand and

the Kop, and at that time the football match had just started.



I then saw several of my stewards on the walkway in front of the Kop

and I went over to see why they were there.   I was told they had come

down due to the vast number of fans in the Kop and on looking into the

Kop I could see it was fairly full, and having just come from 'O'
CASTLEY                 JOHN   PHILIP                                        4


gate, I knew there was thousands still outside.      I asked the stewards

that were there if they could see any of the other stewards to tell

them to come off.



Several minutes later and on looking down to the West Terrace, I could

see people trying to get out of the pens, by climbing over the fence

and people being pulled up into the West Stand.      The football game was

still going on.     In my mind I thought that there was something wrong

down there.   I then held the radio to my ear to see if anything about

what was happening was coming across the radio, but I didn't hear

anything.



The next thing that happened was that a Policeman ran onto the pitch

to the referee and the game was stopped.      The referee called all the

players to him and then they started to walk to the players' tunnel.

A Police Inspector was by now standing by me and he said, "If those

horses move," indicating some mounted Policemen at the top of the

ramp that leads down to the pitch between the North Stand and the

Kop, "Move those advertising boards", so in readiness with the other

stewards, we removed the gravel bags, and on looking again the horses

had gone and there was an ambulance there.      The ambulance started to

come down the ramp, so the boardings were removed by the stewards and

myself, and we had to break them to move them.      As a result the metal

spites broke off.    An Inspector told us to collect them up to prevent

any of the fans from picking them.      This we did and piled them up.



On looking up the ramp again there appeared to me what appeared to be

hundreds of police officers. They walked up the track to the half-way

line of the pitch and then went straight across the pitch forming a
CASTLEY                JOHN   PHILIP                                               5


barrier.



I then saw a Liverpool fan walking along the side track with a very

badly broken arm and he was taken up the ramp.     Then there was a

couple of stretchers come down with people on and I could see people

lay down on the pitch.     I could see that there was something terrible

happening on the West terraces, so I handed my radio to my dad and ran

up to the West Terraces.



On arriving at the terraces there were unconscious people lying all

over the place.    On looking at the goal area of the pitch I could see

that there were lots of people that were obviously seriously hurt.             I

helped to rip down the advertising boarding to use as stretchers.           I

could see that there were people who were just holding those injured

and not giving first aid.     I went to one young male and felt his neck

for a pulse because it was obvious he wasn't breathing.        There was

another young fan with him.     I felt a slight pulse.     I administered

mouth-to-mouth for quite some time, and eventually he coughed and he

started breathing by himself.    There were four people with a hoarding

close by.    I shouted to them and they came across and we put the lad

on the hoarding and they rushed off with the lad.        I then moved on

and there was a man aged 20 to 25 wearing jeans and casual shirt.          I

checked for a pulse on him and couldn't feel one, so I started heart

massage.    There was another person there doing mouth-to-mouth.     We

carried that for God knows how long, to no avail.    Again someone came

with a board and I ran down with this person on the board.       When we

got to the ramp there were loads of others there with people on

boards.    We took him round to back of the gym and I left him there.
CASTLEY              JOHN    PHILIP                                       6


I then ran back to the North Stand.    There were three fans and a St

John Ambulance man with a man on a board with a head wound, with

greying hair and a moustache.    This man was trying to get up, so I

assisted to carry him to the ramp and as we arrived at the ramp an

ambulance had just arrived and we put him straight on the ambulance.



I went back out again to the North Stand and I would say by this time

there were 7 to 10 bodies in the penalty area of the Kop end.    They

appeared to be dead, but there were people working on them.     Then

another person arrives on a board and somebody said he's still alive

but he wasn't breathing.    I then attempted to revive him with mouth-

to-mouth, but was unable to do so.



He was a white lad aged 25 years about.    He was wearing jeans and

denim shirt, dark brown black hair, stocky build.    Then somebody came

over and took him away.     I ran up to the top again, and there were

airways scatterd all over the floor.     I then checked on the people who

were lying on the floor, but conscious, checking that they were all

right.



Numerous announcements were then being made by the Police and the

Manager of Liverpool Football Club, regarding holding onto tickets.       I

carried on giving out water to people who needed it.     It was between

the announcement and my giving out water, that I saw three or four

fans attack a photographer and three or four Police Officers went to

his rescue and as the Police Officers escorted the photographer away,

I heard an Officer say to him, "It's your fault, you've been warned

once already to keep away."

       There were still lots of people milling about and in a distressed

       condition.     I eventually left the ground at about 4.50 pn (1650).

DATED: 300489                                               S R THORPE (SIGNED)



           I have been a Steward at Hillsborough Football Ground, the heme of

           Sheffield Wednesday Football Club for the past twenty two years and

           the Chief Steward in the West Stand for the last fifteen years.

           On Saturday 15th April 1989 (150489), I reported to Hillsborough at

           1100 hrs (1100), to commence duty in connection with the F A Cup

           Semi- Final to be played there between Nottingham Forest and

       Liverpool Football Club.



           I, together with the other Chief Stewards, had been briefed regarding

       the match about a week before by                 tfho is a Secretary at

       the Club.     She advised us of the tickets to be used on the day of the

       match and to assess the need for temporary Stewards.



       At about 11.30 hrs (1130) on the day of the match, I briefed the 30 or

       so Stewards who were working that day and posted them to their

       duties. Amongst the duties I posted Richard BEADSLEY, Malcolm BAINS

       and Ian MARSH to 'C' Gate at Lepping Lane.     This gate is used mainly

       by the Police to allow them access to the ground and all ejections
THORPE                  STUART   ROLAND


are done through this gate.      All the Stewards posted by me worked in

the vicinity of the West Stand.       I have no responsibility for the men

working in Pens one to seven or the turnstiles.



Other men (ie.                   |:            and Brian RID®) were

posted to man 'B' Gate.    This gate is only opened for emergencies and

at the end of the game to allow a swift evacuation of the ground.

The other gate in this area, 'A' Gate is not my responsibility, and I

do not know the procedure or operation in respect of this gate.

At the briefing I do not go through the evacuation procedure because

at the beginning of the season each Steward is given an internal

communication by the Football Club detailing the evacuation

procedures and all Stewards are familiar with them.      I have handed a

copy of this document to Sgt                   (Mkd SRT1) (Ex No      ).



I have not received any formal training in connection with my duties

as a Steward, but I have qualified as a First Aider through the St

John Ambulance Association as part of my full-time employment.



I only work as a Steward at Hillsborough as a part time basis at each

home game for which I get paid #15 per match, however for the Semi-

Final I was paid #25.



During my tour of duty, I patrolled around all areas of the West

Stand.   During that time I was in the area behind the West Stand and

the turnstiles.   At about 1345 I witnessed gate C being opened to

allow the Police to eject a number of supporters. At that time there

didn't appear to be any problem.
THORPE                STUART   ROLAND


I next witnessed gate C being opened at about 1445 hrs to allow the

Police to eject a number of supporters who had climbed over the wall

onto the top of the turnstile and into the ground.



A large number of Liverpool fans did this so much that the Police

Officer on duty in that area didn't appear able to cope.    The police

officers were also involved in searching of fans entering the

ground.   Most of the people who climbed the wall evaded the Police

and ran off to mingle with the fans who had produced their tickets.

On this occasion the Police Officers and Stewards had difficulty

closing 'C' Gate because the crowd outside the ground appeared to be

attempting to force the gate open.



Just after the kick-off, I was again in the area between the West

Stand and the turnstiles when I saw 'C' gate shaking and I got the

impression that the crowd outside the ground were trying to force

them open.   Then the gate was opened and I found myself in the path

of a crowd who surged through the open gate and ran towards the

tunnel under the West Stand which allows access to Pens 3 and 4.

I managed to get out of the way and went to stand by the perimeter

wall adjacent to 'C' Gate.



I was unable to direct the supporters either towards Pens 1 and 2 or

5, 6 and 7 because they just rushed forward 'en masse'.    If I had

tried to direct them I would have been trampled under foot.

I had previously witnessed gate C being opened at another semi-final

when the turnstile couldn't cope with the flood of people coning into

the ground, but on that occasion the Police were on hand to ensure

that the fans were directed towards Pens 1 and 2, and the Stewards
THORPE               STUART    ROLAND


were on hand to check the tickets, but I have never seen the gates

opened as they were on that day.



It was not until about 15 minutes later that I realised that a

tragedy had taken place.    I received no ccranunication regarding the

incident up to that point over the personal radio that I had with me.

I first became aware of the extent of the disaster when I saw two

Police Officers (I do not know their identity and cannot describe

then), carrying a body of what appeared to be a dead man from the

tunnel under the West Stand.



Whilst this was going on, the Liverpool supporters were obviously

very upset by what had occurred and were swearing at the Police and

the Stewards calling them GESTAPO amongst other things and blaming us

for the tragedy.



I began to busy myself helping Liverpool supporters. One youth who

was a white male, about 16 yrs old, about 14 stone and about 6

feet tall with blonde hair, was lying by the steps leading up to the

seating area in the West Stand.    I checked his pulse and discovered

it to be shallow. As I was doing this a woman approached me and

identified herself to me as a nurse, she took over.    She was a

Liverpool supporter, white, about 5'3" tall and quite plump.

I then directed a youth who was about 18 yrs, white, male with black

hair, wearing denim jacket and jeans, who appeared to have a broken

arm, towards a First Aider who took him away.



I was then approached by a man who was white, about 6'4" tall, about

17 stone, who was crying.   I asked what was wrong and he explained
THORPE                STUART    ROLAND                                    5


that he had seen his brother lying on the pitch unattended, so I took

him onto the pitch to see his brother.



All this time I was subjected to swearing because I was identified as

a Steward by the bib I was wearing.      Eventually I was advised to

remove my bib by a Police Officer for my own protection.



I saw one of the Stewards,                  came off the pitch, having

been helping with the injured, and a group of Liverpool fans grabbed

hold of him and pushed him up a wall calling him a BASTARD.       I

believed they were going to assault him, so I intervened and they left

him alone.   I then advised          to remove his bib also.



During these events I saw what was like rain falling from the West

Stand.   This was in fact urine where supporters were too lazy to go

to the toilet.   They were urinating at the back of the stand and it

was falling onto the people below.



After about an hour from kick-off the ground was still not clear and

I could see somebody or persons smashing the louvre windows to the

toilets in the West Stand.      Again the glass was falling down onto

the people below.   There was no one trapped at this location and the

damage was merely vandalism.      I did not see who was responsible for

the damage because I was outside.



Whilst in the West Stand I saw a snack bar which is normally staffed

by young girls, being looted.     The girls had gone to help with the

injured and there was a group of about seven youths stealing the pies

and other food from the snack bar.       (I can't describe the youths
THORPE                 STUART   ROLAND


involved, except to say they were all white and in their mid teens).

I told a Police Officer who chased them off.       Then the officer went

and the youths returned as I was tidying up.       They then shouted

after me and I feared for my safety and ran off, chased for a short

distance by them.



I had spoken to a Liverpool Steward who had came to the match to

assist us, before the game began and he said he thought some 'IDIOTS'

might ccme, because last year the St Ledger Race was run on the same

day as the same Semi-Final was played between Nottingham Forest and

Liverpool.   On that occasion everything had gone very smoothly and

we were expecting the same this year, but the Liverpool Steward (he

is                                       believed that more people would

come because the St Leger wasn't being run, which subsequently

appeared correct because there were a lot more people around this

year than last year.



I am willing to attend the Inquiry, if required.



I have handed to Sgt            |a map     (Mkd SRT2) (Ex No) which shows

my position at the time gate C was opened.      S R Thorpe

           I am a married man living at the above address with my wife.     I have

           been unemployed for six years, after being made redundant from

                           Ltd.   For the past sixteen years I have worked part-

           time for Sheffield Wednesday PC, as a Steward at their Hillsborough

           Ground, and for the last six seasons as Assistant Chief Steward.    I

           get paid #12 a match for league matches and #18 for semi-finals.    My

           duties as Assistant Chief Steward are basically on a supervisory

           level, to ensure that gates B and C at Leppings Lane are manned at all

           times and also that the two entrances to the West Stand seats are

          manned at the appropriate times.    I supervise eighteen stewards for

           semi-finals and possibly four or five less for normal matches.



          On normal matches I would be able to watch parts of the match, but on

           semi-finals I would not expect to see any of the match.    In my sixteen

          years I have not received any training as such to being a Steward,

          because it's the type of job you get to do by experience.    In my

          sixteen years, I must have worked on about six or seven semi-finals at

          Hillsborough, all of them as a Steward or Assistant Chief Steward at
MARSH                  ALBERT   RONALD                                     2

the West Stand Leppings Lane, and in all that time, up until this

year, there has never been any problems which stick out in my mind.

In fact, semi-finals, because of the organisation that's carried out

beforehand, usually go off just like an ordinary league match despite

the increased numbers attending the game.



On Saturday, 15 April 1989 (150489) I got to Hillsborough at 10.45 am

(1045).     I reported to the office at the end of the players' entrance

and obtained the keys to gates B and C.     I then made my way to the West

Stand and opened the gates at the bottom of West Stand which are

padlocked, and then ensured that gates B and C were unlocked and on

the safety catch.     I will explain here that gates B and C are unable

to be opened from the outside and that in order to open them from the

inside, they must be first unlocked and then the safety catch

released.    From the gates I made my way to the West Stand and checked

the fire extinguishers at the back of the Stand, to ensure they are in

order. My next task after that was to check and ensure that all the

eighteen stewards that I supervised that day were at their respective

posts for the opening of turnstiles at 12 o'clock (1200).    My eighteen

stewards are posted as follows, six stewards at the bottom of both

steps giving access to the West Stand, three on B gate and three on C

gate.   B and C gates are concertina gates, used primarily at the end

of the match for the quick exit of fans, although as a rule, 'C' gate

is used by Police for access to the ground and for ejecting fans from

the ground, but both gates are manned at all times in case of d

emergency.    On this day, the following persons were posted to 'C'

gate; 1) Malcolm BAIN, 2) Richard BEARDSLEY and 3) my son Ian MARSH,

which is their normal posting at the matches.
MARSH                 ALBERT   RONALD                                     3


From 12 o'clock (1200) until about 2.30 pm (1430) nothing untowards

happened and it was a usual semi-final day, and to be fair, we were

not expecting any problems.    The one thing that did strike me,

however, was at about 1.30 pm (1330) I was in the West Stand, and I

noticed, that it did not seem as full as I expected at that time, for

a semi-final.   Usually at this time, the Stand would be filling up

quite steadily, but this did not seem to be the case.



At about 2.30 pm (1430) I was in the enclosure comer paddock between

Gate C and the West Stand, and at this time things were beginning to

build up.   I was aware of fans caning in through the turnstiles and

just hanging about in the paddock in groups of ten, twenty, thirty

people, and one particular group were hanging about Gate 'C'. There

were about twelve Police Officers manning the inside of the

turnstiles, searching fans as they came through.   During this period I

saw police officers from the turnstiles, ejecting Liverpool fans

through Gate 'C' who had climbed over the wall onto the top of the

turnstile building and jumped down into the paddock.    I saw this

happen on quite a few occasions.   I would like to mention at this

stage that both gates B and C have a facility which enables the gate

to be opened only a short distance and then bolted at the top, to

prevent more than one person getting in or out at a time, and also to

prevent the door being pulled open from the outside.    I am unable to

say whether this facility was used at the times I saw Gate C being

opened.



I was now standing at the side of Gate C, talking to the three

stewards and the programme sellers who I don't know the names of, but

they were the usual sellers that are normally there.    By now I am
MARSH                  ALBERT   RONALD                                       4


aware of fans banging on Gate 'C' from the outside, which in my

experience was unusual because we don't normally get fans caning down

that side.    So now it must have been getting on towards 2.45 pm

(1425), when the Police cone to Gate C to eject sane more fans.       Then

as Gate C was opened somehow, and I don't know how, about fifty to

sixty, maybe more, Liverpool fans surged in through the gate.     X

immediately made my way towards the gates at the West Stand, to warn

my men to close their gates because of all these fans getting in

through Gate 'C'.    Unfortunately, I got caught in this surge and got

knocked to the ground and kicked whilst on the floor.     I managed to

get back to my feet and make my way back to gate 'C', aware that seme

of those fans who had surged in had got into the West Stand seats

rather than down the tunnel to the terraces.     I got back to Gate 'C'

and I saw one Liverpool fan who was inside the enclosure throw out his

ticket to fans outside the gate.     We eventually managed to close the

gate, but I would not like to estimate how many people got in on that

occasion.    There were still lots of fans milling around the enclosure

around Gate 'C' and a couple of minutes later I heard a call, "Open

the gates."    I saw the gates open fully to their limit and

literally hundreds of Liverpool Fans poured through the gates,

stampeding, the majority of them towards the tunnel.     I assumed at

this time that the call to open the gates had been made by a Police

Officer, although I wouldn't know who.    Neither do I know which of the

stewards opened the gate or if they did open it.     I, at this time, was

just stood there in disbelief.     I had never experienced anything like

this before and had difficulty accepting what was happening.     Everyone

of us there at that time, that's four Stewards and about twelve Police

Officers were helpless to stop this invasion through the gate.      There

was nothing we could do to prevent it.    The next thing I recall, was




                                                                                 77

minutes later I heard over the Police radio, " Mayday - Pitch

Invasion."   At this the police officers made off at speed towardsthe

side of the West Stand.   The next thing that happened was that I

became aware that there were angry Liverpool fans about and thatwe at

that time had been left naked as it were, by the lack of police

officers.



I then saw Superintendent MARSHALL in the paddock area and I told him

of my fears and requested a police presence in the paddock area, and

in a few minutes quite a few officers arrived in the paddock.     Time

went on, then I saw people being brought out from the tunnel who were

injured and taken out through Gate 'C'. I went outside myself to see

what the casualties were and it was then that I realised that these

people, who I assumed had been injured, were in fact dead, a fact

confirmed to me by a Police Inspector SYKES.     I went back inside the

paddock and by this time Stewards were being abused and threatened by

Liverpool fans who were blaming us for the problems.     I was told to d

take my Steward's bib off by a police officer, which I did.      Then I

went round the side of the West Stand, to open up the gantry on that

side (South West side) of the stand.   Whilst doing this I was

approached by a Liverpool fan who physically threatened me with

violence and abused me with every swear word going, before he made his

way up the gantry, despite my telling him that it was to be kept clear

for emergency purposes.



From there I returned to the paddock area where shortly afterwards

people were leaving the ground from the Stand.



During this afternoon, I did not witness any of the problems in the

       Leppings Lane terraces because from 2.30 pm (1430) until 5.00 pm

        (1700), I was almost continually in the paddock area between Gate C

        and the West Stand.

DATED: 060789                                                            (SIGNED)



           I reside at the above address with my wife and daughter, and have

           lived in Sheffield all my life and have always supported Sheffield

           Wednesday.   I have beer                            but am now packing

           it up.



           In 1988 (000088) I applied for a job as a steward at Hillsborough

           Football Ground and started work there at the first game in August

           1988 (000888).   Before the season started I went to meetings at the

           ground in the Riverside Suite where we were lectured by the Police,

           Fire Service, Ambulance Service and the Head of Security of

       Hillsborough, Mr LOCK.



           I was told by a Mr             of the Club, before the meeting

       started, that I would be covering Gate A in the ground.      This gate is

       situated in a steel fence between the West Stand and North Stand. I

       covered this gate all of the season and at times it was very busy, but

       there were no problems.
On Saturday 15th April 1989 (150489), I started my duty at the ground

at 11 am (1100) for the Semi-Final Notts Forest v Liverpool. I

collected the keys from a Mr STONE who covers another gate nearby.

A Mr                was with me on A gate.



At 11 am (1100) it was very quiet and no fans were in the ground. It

was just like a normal match day, until about half past two (1430) and

no trouble, apart from fans trying to climb over the fence and gate

into the ground.



Gate A is used to admit ground staff, Police and fans who have entered

the wrong section of the ground to their correct area.     It is not a

gate to admit people to the ground and checking tickets.



Between 2.30 pm (1430) and 3 pm (1500) it got very busy

with fans coming to me for directions because they did not know where

to go.    Several fans tried to gain access to the area I was covering,

but I did not let any unauthorised entry to the sections I cover.        I

even saw one youth hand his ticket through the metal fence to another

youth outside and he tried to gain access but I told him I had seen

his mate hand him the ticket and did not let him in.     He tried twice

to get in.   One or two fans tried to climb over the gate but to my

knowledge no one came over.    'A' gate was not forced open by fans and

I did not allow anyone through that should not have passed.



On a normal game you can hear the whistle for the start of a match,

but because of the large crowd I did not know if the game had started

or not.   It is my duty to cover these gates all the match.
At about 3.10 pm (1510) I heard a request over the Tannoy for First

Aid people.     I knew that something had happened in the ground but not

exactly what.     A person came to me and said he was qualified in

first aid and I took him down to the pitch.



I then returned to my gate and was told to open my gate by a Mr

        a Senior steward, to allow people out.



At the time I took the First Aid person down to the pitch the fans

who were all Liverpool supporters were very abusive and most had been

drinking.     I remained at this gate until about 3.30 pm (1530), when I

went onto the pitch, but by this time the injured and dead had been

removed and I did not see any of them.



The large sliding gate in Leppings Lane is called Gate A and also the

small gate I was covering.     The small gate I cover was not opened or

fenced on the day in question, but I did see the large sliding gate A

open, but I did not see who opened it.    Before this gate was opened I

could see it moving as if the fans outside were trying to force it

open.   I saw this gate opened on a few occasions to allow certain

people in and out, but when it was opened at the end, a large crowd of

people rushed in.    This caused extra work to tell people where to go

they seemed to be coming from all directions.



In my opinion a lot of the problems on the day was caused by the fans

arriving late for the match.

           I reside at the above address with my wife.



           I have been a Steward at Sheffield Wednesday Ground, Hillsborough, for

           about 15 years, and am a supporter of Sheffield Wednesday.   I always

           cover the same gate, gate 'A' Leppings Lane, with a man called___

           Gate A is situated near to turnstiles in Leppings Lane and is used by

           Police and ground staff, access from West Stand to North Stand.

           Nearby is the shutter gate which was opened to let people in, but I

           was not on duty at this gate.   I have been to semi-final matches at

           Hillsborough for years and have had no trouble.



           On Saturday 15th April 1989 (150489), the day of the match, I went to

           the ground about 11am (1100).   The match was between Liverpool and

           Notts Forest.   On arriving at the ground I went to a briefing by the

           Police and then took up my position by the gate I always cover.   It

           was about 11.30am (1130).



           It was very quiet up to about 2.30pn (1430).   The gates were opened at
12 o'clock (1200).    There was no trouble, people were sitting around,

eating and drinking pop.



At quarter to three (1445) it started to get very busy.    People were

trying to clirrib over the wall, gates and turnstiles to get in.   No one

got over my gate; seme did clirrib up to the top of it, but they didn't

get over.   Before the game I did not have any trouble with the fans.



Just before three o'clock (1500) I saw that the large shutter gate

near to my gate had been opened and fans were rushing in.    I heard a

Policeman say to Jack STONE, "Open that gate."    Jack STONE said, "I'm

not opening that gate for nobody, here's the keys, if you want it

open, you open it."



After this I was busy on my own gate and I did not see who opened the

gate.   The Policeman Jack was talking to was an Inspector I think.

Once the gate was open they all rushed in past me.    I think that if

the gate had not been opened it would have given way with the

pressure of the fans outside.



I knew the game had started, but I stayed at my gate.     I did not know

what had happened on the terrace until fans started coming out and

told me.    On hearing this I opened up my gate to allow people in and

out.    I did not look on the terrace or pitch and did not see any

injured or dead people.



I remained with         on the gate until about quarter to five (1645),

when it was quiet again.    After this I went heme.
                                                                                  3


        I think the game was badly organised.   If it was known the supporters

       were held up, the game should have been delayed.    I also think that

        the supporters were allocated the wrong ends of the ground.   Liverpool

        should have had the other end, where there is more reran. For the past

        few years, the Semi-Final has kicked off at 11am (1100) and I think

        this should have started at 11am (1100) as well.

DATED: 050489                                                    J STONE (SIGNED)



           I have worked as a Steward for Sheffield Wednesday Football Club for

           at least the last five years; all of that time I have worked on A Gate

          which is the concertina gate leading from the Leppings Lane entrance

           into the North Stand.



           I worked at last year's Semi-Final and I was at work at this year's

          match on Saturday 15 April 1989 (150489).     Also employed as stewards

          on A Gate are            and two other men who I know only as          and




          The normal system we work is that         and I control A Gate from the

          time we start work until half-time, when         and        take over.

               and I then go and watch the match.



          On the day of the Semi-Final I finished work at my normal job as an

          engineer with                  in                                    It

          would be about ten o'clock (1000).   After that I got washed and

          changed, then at work, got a sandwich from a cafe and went straight to
STONE                 JACK                                                 2


the Ground.   I probably arrived there at about ten minutes to eleven

(1C50).



I went into the ground and collected the keys for A Gate from the

players' entrance where all stewards sign in.   I went down to A Gate

and unlocked it.   To explain the locks at this gate I should add

that the concertina gate opens in the middle and are pushed sideways

to open.   There are four bolts, two on each door.   The bottom ones are

pushed down into the ground and the top two push into a metal spar

across the top of the gate.   There is also at about the middle of the

doors a hook-over hasp; this holds the doors together to prevent them

being pulled apart.   The final piece of security is a key which locks

the hasp and prevents it being opened by the handle.



The key I collected from the players' tunnel locks the hasp.     I

normally hold this key until half-time when I hand it over to



On this occasion I went to A Gate and unlocked it; I opened it

slightly to check what's happening and then closed it again.    I kept

the key on me.   This would be around eleven o'clock (1100).



Having unlocked A Gate, I unlock a small gate I have marked on a

drawing I made as (1).   This small gate remains closed but unlocked;

later a steward is posted to it.   I then shut and lock the gate I have

marked as (2).   I have given the drawing I prepared to Inspector

MORRIS.



About half past eleven (1130,) a lot of Police Officers arrived to

look after the turnstiles and the area outside them.   When they
STONE                  JACK                                                 3


arrived I unlocked and opened the railing gates of the perimeter fence

to the ground.    By now          one of the other stewards, had joined

me.



From then on I looked after A Gate, allowing people who have

permission to enter the ground through the gate, for example, Police,

First Aid people, other staff etc.



Not long after this, at most twelve o'clock (1200),           asked me if

I had earlier locked the gate marked (2).      I told him that I had.

        said that it was now unlocked.   This meant that people entering

the ground with standing tickets could enter the stand for seating.

Because of this         and I pulled one of the metal free-standing

barriers across this gate.     We couldn't lock it up again because the

turnstile feeding that area was open and people would have been able

to enter the seating area with standing tickets; it's a bad piece of

design really.    The barrier controlled by stewards meant we could stop

people getting in the wrong area.



TVo stewards were posted to cover this barrier.     I only know one of

them,                               He lives at

                              It's the            I don't know the
number.   His 'phone number is            By saying they were posted to

that barrier, the sort of Chief Steward for our end,         somebody,

t o l d a n d the other bloke to look after it.



Having sorted that out, I was at A Gate with               we continued

doing our duties without any real problems.
STONE                JACK                                                  4


About half past one (1330) I noticed that it was very quiet.     I don't

know why I noticed the time, but you look at your watch to see how

long to kick-off and I thought that not many people had ccme into the

ground.   I commented on this to one of the Policemen standing with us.



It started getting a bit busier after this, people were banging on the

gates and offering money for us to let them in.    They would hold the

money up to the little window in the gate.    Nobody was let in using

this bribery.   Despite the increase in people, things carried on

fairly normally until half past two-ish (1430).



Around this time I opened the gate for sane reason, either let someone

in or out of the ground.    I opened it only a small way and there was a

bit of a fight to prevent people forcing their way into the ground.

Vte managed to shut the gates after a struggle and I said to

"That's the last time I open that gate before kick-off."    I locked the

hasp lock and also made sure that all four bolts were in place

securely.



Not long after this it seemed all hell let loose outside.    The gates

started swaying and there was lots of banging on them.     People outside

were obviously trying to pull them open.     I got so worried that the

gates were going to be forced open that I held onto the top two bolts

in case they slipped.   I know this can happen; from previous occasions

this has happened.



I had been holding onto these bolts for at least five or more minutes,

when I was approached by a coloured Policeman.    He asked me to open

the gates so that he could go out to deal with the crowd.      I told
STONE                  JACK                                                  5


him "No way." I knew how big the crowd was by the way the gates were

going and I knew that if I opened the gate to let one Policeman out, a

lot of people would have got in.



Probably a couple of minutes after this, the coloured Policeman who

was still standing by me was joined by six or seven more.      One of the

other Policemen asked me to open the gates.      Again, I refused for the

same reason, the gates were still being pushed and swinging from side

to side and I was still holding the bolts up.      I knew that to open the

gates, however little, would allow a lot of people into the ground.



Another group of Policemen joined us at the gate now, I can't say how

many in total.    I was again asked to open the gate.    Again I refused.

The Policeman said, "We're opening all the gates in Leppings Lane,

it's ccme from our Inspector".     I still refused, I said, "No way".



He asked me to listen on his radio and I heard someone say on the

radio that the Leppings Lane gates were to be opened.      I again refused

because I felt it was dangerous.    I say this because of seme problems

we had had last year at the same match.      I will explain those later.



The Policeman tried to open the gate and I said to him that he

wouldn't be able to open them because I had locked them and held onto

the keys.



At this the Policeman told me that I had got to open them. I said to

him that if he wanted them opened he could take the responsibility for

opening them.    I then gave him the keys.
STONE                   JACK                                                      6

I asked              to witness what was said because I knew all hell

would be let loose if they were opened.



Then the Policeman unlocked the gate and handed me back the key.         I

couldn't describe this Policeman and wouldn't be able to recognise him

again.     All I know is I haven't seen this Policeman before.



I was standing by the centre edge of the left-hand door.      The

Policeman pulled open the right-hand door.      It opened all the way.       At

this I moved back a bit and the left-hand gate was pulled open from

the outside by the crowd.



A large crowd of people surged through the gate; I was taken backwards

by the crowd for seme distance before I fell onto my arse.       The next

thing I remember was standing up again and realised that my steward's

badge had ccme off.     I can't really say how many people came through

the gates but it was enough to knock me over and shock me.



I remember my jacket had been pulled almost over my head.        I took a

few seconds to gather myself together.      It was then      and I

started to shut the gate.      I remember he showed me his hand which he

had injured.



I don't think we managed to shut the gates properly when an ambulance

arrived.    Shortly afterwards, a fire engine arrived.    The next few d

minutes are quite confused to me, I remember helping some injured

people by C Gate, but I can't recall too much.     I noticed that by now

A, B and C Gates were open; I didn't see the others being opened but I

just recall seeing them open.
STONE                   JACK                                                    7




I saw seme bodies being laid out in the place I have marked as (3) on

the drawing.     I didn't realise at that time that anyone was dead.      I

then heard a man say to a Policeman, "You've killed my brother".         Seme

of the crowd were having a go at one or two of the Policemen.       There

were a few scuffles.



Throughout my duty on this day I cannot say that I saw more

drunkenness than on any other occasion, nor could I small drink any

more than normal.     The crowd disorder I have described is all that I

witnessed.     The only other occasion was after the people had started

to be brought out injured.     I had taken a lad from the back of the

goal by the West Stand to the First Aid room.      I was holding him up

anc. we walked across the pitch.     I took this youth to the back of the

North Stand to the First Aid rooms.      I saw sane people on the top of

the North Stand urinating down onto the First Aid rooms and people who

were approaching these rooms.      It was in the area where the Police

and First Aid people gather.     I don't know which club they supported.



I carried on helping people for seme time, but things are confused

and I can't really describe what I did.     Later on I heard from

someone that the disaster had been caused by a steward in Leppings

Lane opening a gate.    This caused a lump in my throat and I was

overcome by it.    It caused me to walk out and I came heme.   I was

overcome by this remark almost as if I were to blame for the

disaster.



The incident upset me greatly, and I have been feeling rough ever

to camp outside our house.     They spent seme days outside my house.        I

contacted the Football Club to ask what I should do, but all the Club

said was that I had brought it on myself.     That's not true.     I had not

spoken to anyone in the press until I gave an interview to ITV.



At no time during this interview did I say that I had opened C Gate or

that I had given the key to any Police Officer to open C Gate.        I

clearly said I was responsible for A Gate and that it was A Gate that

I had seen opened.



I would like to add to this, that there is no open access from A Gate

to the area leading through the tunnel into Pens 3 and 4.        There are

two small gates, one was locked and the other barriered and manned by

stewards, which lead from the fenced area alongside A Gate into the

open area behind C Gate and the tunnel to Pens 3 and 4.



I cannot say where the surge of people went after they knocked me

down.   It happened so quickly.



I earlier said that there had been similar problems at last year's

game.   A security man approached me at A Gate and asked me to open it

to let a wedding party of 32 people in.    The gates were being pulled

and banged as this year.     On that occasion I opened the gate and a lot

of people rushed into the ground.    There weren't as many people

through the door last year as got through this year, because there

were sane mounted Policemen helping us to stop them, but it could have

been as bad.



I have worked each Semi-Final for the last three years at least.          For

        the Leeds and Coventry game I had no problems.   The only trouble at A

        Gate of this nature has been from the Liverpool fans in the last two

        years.



        I used to be a regular Liverpool supporter, so I'm not biased against

        them.

           I am a married man and I live at the above address with my wife

           and my two children                                 I am presently

           employed as a __________             for




           For the last twenty years or so I have been a steward at the

       Sheffield Wednesday Football Ground.      When I first started it was as

       a temporary posting, which means I would turn up at the ground on

       match day and if anyone didn't turn up I would take their place.

       Eventually, I was taken on permanently, and for the last three years

           I have had the permanent posting of being on the inside of 'B' Gate,

       an exit gate.



       I usually work this gate with                  and                  Our

       duties comprise of to man gate 'B' from the inside of the ground and

       only to open the gate for police officers on duty to get into the

       ground, for programme sellers to get into the ground, and for other

       stewards and catering staff to get inside the ground.     These people

are only allowed in if they are in possession of their identification

cards.



We man these gates throughout the game and they are only opened

during the game in case of emergency and after the game to allow

supporters to leave the ground.



On Saturday, 15th April 1989 (150489), a Semi-Final football match

was being played at Sheffield Wednesday Football Ground between

Liverpool Football Club and Nottingham Forest Football Club.



At approximately 11.00 (1100) that day, I attended the Sheffield

Wednesday Football Ground and went to the Stewards' office which is

situated under the South Stand.



In the office I met up with Albert MARSH, the Assistant Chief Steward,

and together with Albert, we walked through the South Stand to gate

'B'. Together with Albert, I opened the gate to allow the van

containing the match day programmes to drive in and unload.    After

we opened the gate, Albert took the key and went about his own

business. After the programmes had been unloaded I opened the gates to

allow the van to leave and I shut the gates and secured them using

the inside bolts.



It was at this stage, I was joined by             and

     and     left me and went to the comer of the West Stand to

collect their official steward bib and to hand in their ticket for

payment for being a steward.
RIDGE                   BRIAN                                              3


When they returned, I, in turn, went and collected ray bib and handed

in vay ticket.



When I returned the three of us went to the West Stand for the

Stewards' briefing.    At this time there were already police officers

on duty in the concourse by gate 'B'.



It was approximately 11.30am (1130) when I arrived at the West Stand

and at this time all of the match day stewards were present, including

Albert MARSH     and Stewart THORPE, the Assistant and Chief Steward.

Also present was a Police Inspector who usually gives the match

briefing to the stewards.       I do not know his name, but all the lads

call him 'Captain BIRDSEYE', on account as he is not very tall and has

a full beard.



The Inspector gave us the briefing and run through the procedures in

case of fire or people needing First Aid and the code for an

emergency which is broadcasted on the loudspeakers and is 'Can Mr

MEADOWS report to Police Control.' When we hear this we must go to

the gate, in ray case Gate 'B', and open the gate, and be prepared to

assist in any way, depending upon the emergency and not to close the

gates until advised by a police officer.



After asking if there were any questions, we all left and went to our

posts.



I manned gate 'B' and the only times I opened the gate was to allow

police officers in.    During the course of the afternoon, I just

carried out ray normal duties.
RIDGE                   BRIAN                                               4




Gate 'B' is situated between the two sections of turnstiles into the

Leppings Lane entrance in the North part of the concourse.

In the door is a small porthole to enable us to view people wishing

to gain entrance through the gate into the ground and offers a limited

view of the turnstiles into the standing area.       From inside we can

see the people who have come in through the turnstiles for the

seating area.



During the afternoon, people started to arrive slowly and trickle

through the turnstiles and nothing really struck me as unusual.

It was just another normal match semi-final.



When the time reached approximately a quarter past two pm (1415), I

remembered commenting to another steward, I think it was

how quiet it was for a semi-final, as we hadn't seen many people cone

through the seat turnstiles and we usually judge the crowd by the

amount of noise coming from outside, but that day it was relevantly

quiet. After this time the crowd started to build up outside and the

volume of noise increased.      People queuing to get into the turnstiles

for the standing section began to kick and hit the gate, creating a

banging noise.   All the fans were singing and seemed in good spirits,

on the odd occasion that I looked through the porthole in the fence,

all I could see was a sea of people's faces.



As kick-off time approached, the banging on the doors increased

and so did the crowd.     It was then that people from the crowd started

to try and climb over the gate and the supporting fences.

At the comer of the seating turnstiles is a concrete pillar-shape
     RIDGE                   BRIAN                                                5


4^   building that contains the electrical equipment to operate the

     turnstiles.   I don't know how, but the Liverpool fans were climbing

     onto it from the outside trying to get in.     The police officers on

     duty near me were telling the fans to get back and they were

     shouting back, "We're getting crushed out here".



     Eventually people started to climb over the fence and jump down and

     run off, the police couldn't really follow them, because they had

     to remain on post.     At this stage the crowd had really built up and

     the noise was really loud.



     At one stage just before kick-off people started to panic that they

     wouldn't get in and people, one after another, started to climb the

     fence and get onto a small building by the seating turnstiles.      I

     don't know how to describe the building, but there were that many

     people caning over the fence that the police had to help the fans

     down to prevent them being pushed or from falling.



     People were walking across the top of my gate and I presumed they

     walked to where they could jump down somewhere by the standing

     turnstiles.   No one could get to them because the gate itself is

     about eleven foot high.



     At this stage we couldn't hear anything really because of the noise

     of the fans outside.      I don't even know if the game had started.     I

     could see people coming through the turnstiles normally, and those who

     were climbing over near the seating turnstiles and still walking across

     my gate.




                                                                                      1 00

People were still shouting outside, "We're being crushed."    At this

stage I was joined by a young PC.    I don't know his name or number -

came up to me and said, "You've got to open the gate."    I said, "Not

bloody likely," because this was against all that we had been taught.

The PC opened the gates and people just came flooding through.     I

couldn't even guess how many, it was just a flood of people, I didn't

see anyone fall at my gate but people were losing shoes off their

feet.   After the initial surge, I picked up the lost shoes and

collected them.    After opening the gate, there was no point in

shutting the gates again and it was then that I saw people lying on

the roadway between the river and the ground, with people attending to

them.



I didn't know what had happened because we never heard the emergency

code announced.    Then the Fire Brigade arrived and I showed them where

they wanted to go and then ambulances arrived again, it's hard to

remember what I saw and heard from what I saw on the televison.

People were coming back out at this stage saying, "There's people

dying in there."    These people were obviously shocked and distressed,

and people started to verbally abuse me.    I still didn't know what was

going on.   I was quite distressed myself and so I went into a

Portacabin to compose myself and find out what was happening.



When I came out people were still coming out of the stand, still

crying and shocked.   One fan asked me did I know where he could get a

drink of water from, so I gave him some of my tea and he walked off.

Another man came walking back with no shoes on, so he just picked a

pair out of the pile and walked off out of the ground.
RID®                   BRIAN                                                7


No one was carried out through ray gate, but I could see people being

put in ambulances outside.



At this stage, I went to the toilet at the back of the West Stand and

I met up with other stewards.    Stewart THORPE came up to us and told

us that people had been crushed to death and to take our bibs off,

and he walked away.



We remained together, while people left the ground, and at this stage

we didn't really know what was happening.     A lot of the fans were

leaving and I didn't even know the match had been abandoned.



I didn't really see anything else, except firemen carrying oxygen past

us.    I do not really know any times because I do not wear a watch, but

when the majority of fans had left.      I just melted into the crowd and

I made ray way home.



I cannot really describe very much because from ray posting I cannot

see very much.    I only know that the crowd arrived late, they started

to climb the fence, and then the gate was opened and people rushed

in.    Then all I saw was shocked, crying people caning out.   I still

don't know what really happened that day, that's all I can really

say.    I am willing to attend any court as a witness, if necessary.

           Further to my previous statement dated the 29th of April 1989

           (290489) in which I described my duties and actions on Saturday

           15th April 1989 (150489) at the Semi-Final football match played at

           Sheffield Wednesday Football Ground.

           In my statement I described an incident during which a Police Officer

           asked me to open gate 'B'. I refused and he opened it and allowed

           the fans in.

           I would describe the Officer as follows:-

       He was a Police Constable about 5'10 tall, medium build, I don't know

       what colour hair he had but he had a ginger moustache.

       He was aged approximately 20-25 years.

           I cannot describe him further and have never seen him at Sheffield

       Wednesday Football Ground before.

       I would not be able to recognise him again.

*          I have lived in Sheffield all my life and I am currently employed as

           a                Every two weeks I am employed from August to April as

           a steward at the Sheffield Wednesday football ground, Leppings Lane,

           Hillsborough, Sheffield.    I have been employed for the last 4 years in

           this capacity.    I am always posted to the B gate entrance to the

           football ground, as I was at this position on Saturday 15 April 1989,

           (150489) from 1100am (1100) to 5pm (1700).   My job is to stand by gate

           B and let police officers in and out, and any member of the public out

       who wish to leave, but they would not be allowed back in through the

       gate.      There is no actual job training for this post, the only

       training we receive is for the evacuation of the ground, for bomb or

           fire scares.



       There were two other stewards with me at the gate, "Brian and

       I don't know their surnames, they are also always posted to gate B.

       From my position at gate B, I am unable to see gate C or the

       enclosure behind Gate C into the tunnel.       I would have to walk to a

       gate in a dividing wall between gate C and B.       My instructions for the

match were the usual verbal instructions about letting people in and

out of the gate.     It is left to my own discretion as to whether I

have the 'B' gate open or closed.     Most of the time I have it open

until 10 or 15 minutes before the start of a match.     It is then closed

until 4.30pm (1630).     On this particular Saturday, I closed it at

1.40pm (1340), as it was a large match and I knew the train had come

into Wasley Bridge.     I have no radio or phone ccnmunication at my post.

I did not see any people coming into the ground with drink in their

possession.     However, a lot of people were under the influence of

drink, due to their attitude verbally.     I could smell drink in the

air.   The supporters seemed a lot more aggressive this year, compared

to last year.



At about 2.45pm (1445) I was standing inside the B gate.     There is a

small window that you can look through to see the area just outside

the gate.     I could see different faces appearing at the window.   They

looked in pain and I could hear people, banging and kicking on the

gate and shouting.



The next thing that happened was that people started to climb up onto

the turnstile roof (numbers 1-16).     I have never seen this happen

before.     I would say there was a dozen to sixteen people on the roof.

A police constable said to them that they can ccme down into the

ground if they had tickets.    A few had tickets and jumped down, but

the majority did not have tickets and stayed on the roof.    They would

not get back down onto the other side.    There were only about five

police officers in the enclosure where I was, which was obviously not

adequate for the amount people trying to get in.    After about 15

minutes, an Inspector climbed up onto the turnstile roof, to have a
                                                                            3


look at what was happening outside.     He then told people on the roof

to jump down into the ground and they then ran around towards Pens 7

and 8 of the West Stand.   As the people who were coming through

turnstiles 1-16, they were heading towards the seating area of the

West Stand.   I have never seen crowds like this at a match, certainly

not in the last 4 years.   At this ground, looking through the small

window, it was mayhem outside the B gate.     There was a lot of abuse

shouted to me and police officers by the fans.



At about 3.05pm (1505) I walked up to a gate in a wall which divided

the gate C compound from the gate B compound.     This gate is usually

open all the time. I just wanted to see what the crowd was like on

that side. As I stood at the gate and looked into the compound, it

was fairly clear of people.   It then suddenly went quiet.    There was a

crowd at the entrance to the tunnel under the West Stand, waiting to

go into the standing area, Pens 3 and 4.     They didn't seem to be

pushing.   As I stood there I saw two youths carry another youth out of

the tunnel. They shouted to me, "Hey what about this wack." I went

over and asked if he had fainted.     They said, "I think he's dead wack.

He's not breathing." I pointed them towards C gate where I could see

three St. John's ambulance officers standing. They then carried the

youth to the officers.   The youth that was being carried was white 14-

15 yrs, slim, dark hair, pale blue jeans, white T shirt, trainers. I

can't describe the youths carrying him other than, white teenagers,

wearing blue jeans.   A minute or two later I saw another youth come

out of the tunnel with a lad slung over his shoulder, like a fireman's

lift.   They went straight out to C gate. The lad that was being

carried looked like a teenager, dark hair, blue jeans.    That's all I

remember about him.   I don't remember the man who was carrying him,
        other than he was white and tall.     People were spilling out from the

        sides of the tunnel and standing around the compound.     Seme came

        through the gate where I was standing and into the compound behind me.

        Nobody was by then going into the tunnel.      I then went back to my post

        at gate B.    When I was standing at the wall gate, prior to going back

        to gate B, I saw the police open gate B, but nobody came in through it

        or went out through it at that time.

           I have previously made a statement concerning my involvement as a

           Steward at Hillsborough on 15 April 1989 (150489).



           In that statement I mentioned that at about 2.45 pm (1445) I was

           standing inside B Gate.   I looked through the window to the area

           outside and I could see that the people looked in pain.     They were

           shouting and banging and kicking at the door.



           There was just me and Brian RID® as stewards at the gate at that

           time.               was a few yards away at the exit in the wall

           area.



       We were approached by a policeman in uniform.         He said he had had

       orders that the gate should be opened.      We both thought this was the

       right thing to do.      The officer, Brian, and myself opened the gate.

           I would say about 400-500 spectators came in through the gate.    They

           all went into the end-way which leads to Pen 7.
        The gate was left open for about 15 minutes, however nobody came in

       through the gate after the initial surge I have mentioned above.



        I really cannot describe the officer who requested that the gate

        should be opened.




                                                                     SIGNED

           I am a married man living at the above address with my wife and two

           children.   I have lived there for the past four years.



           I am a                  by trade, but I've been

                         L981



           For the past seven years I've worked as a Ground Steward at the

           Sheffield Wednesday Football Club, Hillsborough, Sheffield, and I've

           always been posted to the West Stand, B Gate.     This job entails

           standing by the gate frcm 1.30 pn (1330) till 4.40 pn (1640) for

           league games, and 11 am (1100) till 4.40 pn (1640) for semi-finals and

           other similar games.   I am a paid steward and receive #12 for league

           games and #18 for semi-finals.   The posting for B Gate is always

       three stewards and I work with Brian, who's been there about nine

       years, and          who's been there about four years.    Although I've

       worked with them for a long time, I do not know their surnames.



       We all wear orange plastic jackets with 'STEWARD' on the front left
and an advertising for GGS Windows on the back.



I have never received any training for this job.     I've only been told

to remain on the post and if I was to hear, "Mr MEADOWS go to the

Police Room," over the loudspeakers, I am to open the gate as this

is an Emergency code signal.



Our Chief Steward is a man I know as Stewart and it was he who gave

me these instructions.



Over the years it has been accepted by the stewards and the Club that

we take short breaks of fifteen minutes, but one steward must remain

on the gate.



Brian,     and myself always stick to the same break times,

always remains on the gate 3-3.15 pn (1500-1515), then I replace him

till 3.30 pn (1530), and then Brian does it till half time, around

3.45 pn (1545), when we all are back at the gate.     From about 4 pn

(1600), we repeat the process w i t h a t the gate till 4.15 pn

(1615), me 4.15 pn (1615) to 4.30 pn (1630), when Brian returns and

opens the gate.   We should remain then till 4.40 pn (1640), but we

usually leave then to miss the rush.



These are the only breaks we have and I usually go up the steps to

the West Stand seating where I sit and watch the match for the

duration of my break.    The others do the same.   We do not go for

drinks or refreshment as we normally bring flasks which we place on

the floor near the gate.
At 10.50 am (1050), Saturday 15 April 1989 (150489), I went to the

ground for the FA Cup Semi-Final (Liverpool v Notts Forest) and went

straight to Gate B.   I was the first to arrive and, shortly before

11 am (1100), Brian and      arrived.   At this time the lock had been

removed frcm the gate, but they were still closed by a latch.     The

gates are two separate 'Concertina' gates which come together,

latched and padlocked.



Frcm the game the week before I was aware that the gates were to be

opened at midday (1200), but that was the only instruction we were

given.   I assumed that we were to carry on as normal, as we've never

had any special instructions or orders re semi-finals.



During the time till the gates were to open, we spent the time

chatting with the lads on the turnstiles (                      and four

or five others whose names I don't know), and amongst ourselves.



Fran where we stand, behind Gate B, we only get a limited view

through the turnstiles to Leppings Lane and on our right (back to

gate), there is a six foot wall with an open gateway sane ten yards

away, which leads to C Gate area.   To the left an open courtyard area

with steps up to the seating and access to the Vere Rd comer of the

West Stand standing area.   Contained in the courtyard are two

Programme Kiosks which are Portacabins.



At or just before midday (1200), three policemen joined us and, as

the turnstiles opened, a serial of police officers arrived, seme

twenty or so officers, including seme wonen officers.    They

positioned themselves behind the turnstiles to search the fans as
they came through.



At first, for the first hour, two hours, a slow trickle of fans came

through but I didn't pay too much attention.     I spent the time

talking with Brian,        ind some of the officers.   At about 2 pn

(1400), it seemed to build up a bit, but the officers were coping

with the searching etc.



At about 2.30 pn (1430), I became aware of a lot of noise outside the

gate and people were banging on the gate.     On looking through the

little gate window I could see a large number of Liverpool fans

massing outside.     We were talking amongst ourselves, that's me, Brian

and        that it looked like trouble was brewing due to the numbers

and the time.



Round about this time I noticed people climbing a temporary barrier

from our courtyard to the access to the North Stand which is all

seats.     I went to the barrier, to stop people going either way.     With

the help of two police officers and a North Stand steward, who I

don't know, we stopped it and the police ejected those they caught.

I would say that around twenty climbed over but only a few were

ejected.



At this time, from the noise outside, it appeared to me that there

were vast numbers still waiting to get in, and kick-off time was

approaching.    Also at this time people started climbing over the

walls, the turnstiles and the turnstile roofs and any other way to

get in.     Things were getting chaotic and a few more police officers

came.     This caused the fans to stop on the walls, etc, and a Police
Inspector climbed onto a turnstile roof and he told those on top to

get down.    I saw some officers helping them down inside the ground

and they were allowed in, tickets or not, they just walked away.



That seemed to stop it for a while but a few more fans climbed up and

over.    I moved away frcm the temporary barrier (a metal fence type)

to the area behind Gate B where I could tear more bashing and banging

on the gate.



Frcm all this noise, etc, I got the feeling something was happening

outside but, on looking through the window, I could see a mass of

heads.    I would guess there were a couple of thousand outside still

waiting to get in.



At this time, a fan, in his twenties, stocky build and wearing jeans,

hobbled over to me with two mates.    He told me that his leg had been

crushed, but he didn't say how and I didn't ask.    I was about to take

him to the First Aid Post but one of his mates pushed me away and

started swearing, saying, "We don't need no help from you Yorkshire

bastards."



I saw a policewoman coming from the North Stand area and I told her.

She went over to him.    I could smell drink on his mates but not on

him.    They weren't well and truly drunk, but obviously had been

drinking heavily.



It was around this time that I saw fans walking back frcm the stand

to the turnstiles.   There must have been a couple of hundred or so

which made me think something was wrong, as the game had started a
                                                                           6


minute or two before.   People were still caning in through the

turnstiles and there were still thousands outside.    Also at the same

time, a sudden silence fell over the ground.     I immediately ran up to

the seating (West Stand) to see fans climbing up from the standing

area into the Seating, being helped up.    Also there were people

climing over the perimeter fencing onto the pitch.    The game had

stopped and I saw players going off the field.



When I was down by Gate B, I thought it must be fighting, but on

seeing into the standing area, it was obvious that it was far too

full.   I returned to my gate and on the way I could see a few people

leaving the seating, but a fair few hundred leaving via the tunnel and

walking through the gap from the C Gate area.



As I got to the gate, odd fans came over to me, obviously angry for

some reason or other, shouting and swearing at me.    They were blaming

me and everybody for something or other.    I could see other fans and

groups of fans approaching other stewards and police officers.



I spent the next thirty or so minutes walking around the courtyard

area, not knowing what was happening, or had happened, or what to do.

During this time, I gathered, from various conversations I'd overheard,

that a gate had been opened and fans had rushed in.    All the time I

was walking about I was approached by a number of fans all blaming me

and the fact that they should be in the Spion Kop.    One fan grabbed me

by the front of my jacket and threatened me with his fist, conplaining

about the choice of ends.



Around that time a steward, who I don't know, came to me and told me
                                                                          7


to take my steward's coat off.    I took it off, rolled it up and hid

it under my coat.   I saw a Liverpool hat on the floor and put it on,

as I was scared and I felt that would help.



I saw that B Gate was now open and I walked out of it and stood

outside for about 15 minutes.    During this time, fire engines,

ambulances and police vehicles were arriving at the Leppings Lane

entrance and a lot of Liverpool fans (hundreds) were leaving.

About half of the fans were crying and obviously distressed about

something, pushing, shouting and arguing with the Police.   At this

time, a steward I know as          \ joined me, and after a short

while, he said something like, "Come on, I'll drop you home."



We walked to his car which was parked in Vere Rd or Fielding Rd and

he dropped me at home.   On the way he told me that he'd seen some

dead bodies and I assumed they must have been crushed or something.



My wife was out so I called at a neighbour's, and, from television,

discovered people had died.



Whilst I was at the match, I directed a number of fans to the

standing area on the comer of the West Stand near Vere Road.       I

didn't direct anyone anywhere else.   Also, I'd overheard conversations

of ticket touts selling tickets at #20/#25 in Leppings Lane.



During the journey to the game, I never saw any groups of fans at

all.   Whilst at the game, I saw a fair number of fans (thirty or so)

climbing over the walls, etc, and although a fair majority of those

fans I saw inside the ground had been drinking, only about 20/30
were drunk.



After consideration of what I know now, I feel that the disaster was

handled as best as it could be.



I also worked the same match in 1988 (000088), between the same teams,

and on that occasion we had no trouble at all.   This match (April 15

1989) (150489), there seemed to be a larger number of Liverpool fans

than the previous year, and there seemed to be a lot who had been

drinking heavily.



I would like to add that this match is the worst I've been to as a

steward in my seven years.   I can honestly say, I was petrified, as

I and other people seemed to be the brunt of their anger, etc.   I

feared for my safety.



I am currently trying to make up my mind whether to continue as a

steward.

Wednesday Ground on which I've marked my position and signed.

           at no time did I open gate B nor did I see anyone else open it.



           I have worked with               and Brian RIDGE for 4 (four) years as

           Stewards at Gate B and at no time have any of us been given a

           Sheffield Wednesday Club personal radio.



           It is normal practice for Gate B to be unlocked but kept secure on the

           latch so that it can be opened quickly in the event of an emergency.

           I am employed as a Steward at Sheffield Wednesday's Football Club

           at Hillsborough, a position which I have held for 4 seasons.

           On Saturday 15th April 1989 (150489) I was present in my capacity as

           Steward for the Liverpool/Nottingham Forest Semi-Final Football Match

           at the Hillsborough Football Ground.



       My capacity at this match was as gateman at gate C, along with two

           other Stewards, Richard BEADSLEY of                    and Malcolm

           BAIN of                                      During the last 3

           seasons at Hillsborough, I have worked gate C as my post and

       certainly during the last season I have worked with Malcolm and

       Richard on this gate.     As Stewards, we are provided with yellow

           jackets to wear to show our capacity to the crowds.   I have received

       no training for my position and no first aid training, and as far as I

       am aware none of the other Stewards have received any training in any

       capacity from the Club.



       As my position as gateman on gate C, I, along with the other 2
MARSH                   IAN                                                2


Stewards, are on the gate until the match is started.     It is then

normal practice for one of us to stay on the gate and be relieved

every 15 minutes so that the gate is always manned.     This was to be

the procedure again on Saturday 15th April 1989 (150489), after the

match had started.



I arrived at Hillsborough Football Ground at around 11.15am (1115) on

Semi-Final.    My hours of work were to be 11.30am (1130) - 4.45pn (1645)

or to the termination of the match that day. At around 11.30am (1130)

that date, we received a briefing in the West Stand by a Senior Police

Officer.     There were all the Stewards that would be working the West

Stand area that day present.    We already knew our postings for the day

and the briefing mainly was about forged tickets and what to look out

for with than.     There was no mention of any different procedure to be

adopted for this Semi-Final match and so we adopted our normal

procedure.    After the briefing, we all assumed our positions at our

posts ready for the gates to open at 12 o'clock (1200).



There was a steady flow of fans arriving at the Leppings Lane end

from when the gates opened and Malcolm, Richard and myself, took it

in turns to go on the outside of the gate to aid people as to where

to go according to the tickets they held.    This left the 2 of us at

one time on the inside of the gate.    At around lpm (1300) a Steward

from Liverpool Football Club joined us at gate C.    I am not aware of

his name.    He stayed with us at the gate for around an hour and then

moved on.



At around 2.15pn (1415), the fans started to arrive in numbers.

There was a constant mass of Liverpool fans outside on the Leppings
MARSH                   IAN                                                 3


Lane end.     The atmosphere seemed good, in fact jovial, but as the time

got closer to the kick-off time at 3pn (1500), it began to get tense

as the fans became impatient, wanting to get into the ground, and I

witnessed a number of fans, probably about a dozen, climb over the

wall directly above the turnstiles to gain unauthorised access.



On numerous occasions prior to the kick-off time fans were ejected by

the Police from inside the ground.     We Stewards are not allowed

to eject fans from inside the ground, only the Police are

authorised.    The Police were bringing the fans to gate 'C' and then

either I, or one of my colleagues, were opening the gate for the

Police to eject them.    As I say this has happened on numerous

occasions that day with no problems.



On one of the occasions when the gate was opened though, for the

Police to eject fans, approximately 40 fans surged through the gate

and it was impossible to stop them to check if they had tickets in

their possession or not, as they were through the gates and scattered

in different directions so quickly.    This happened quite early in the

afternoon though.



After this incident, the gates were opened again on many occasions in

order to eject fans but there was no problem.



As the time got closer to kick- off time, the crowds really started to

swell outside, and the fans seemed to be determined to get into the

ground any way they possibly could.    They were climbing over walls and

turnstiles, and were banging on gate 'C' and shouting abuse at us for

not opening the gate.    A lot of the Liverpool fans seemed to have been
MARSH                 IAN                                                  4


drinking, although I didn't see any of them with any alcohol.     It was

obvious to me, from my experience as a Steward and seeing fans over

the years, that a lot of them had been drinking prior to attending the

ground, although none of them were 'rolling drunk'. I could in fact

smell the drink off seme of the youths as they passed me and I have

since learned that The Fox Public House was 'drunk dry' by Liverpool

supporters.



From my position at the gate 'C', I could see everyone that entered

through turnstiles A - G.   It seemed to me that most, in fact the

majority of people entering, headed straight for the tunnel entrance

which leads to Pens 2, 3, 4 and 5.   No Stewards were posted outside

the tunnel, and, in fact, Stewards are never posted outside the

tunnel to direct people to Pens 1 and 6 and 7.



It's difficult to put a time to it but I would say that about 2.45-

2.50pn (1445-1450), a Senior Uniformed Police Officer inside the

ground informed us to open 'Gate C '.   I do not know who the Officer

was, or who actually had the information to open the gate, but we

opened the gate.   At this time there was a mass of supporters

outside, attempting to gain access and impatient.   I agree that the

gate needed opening, as there was a danger of walls collapsing and

people being seriously injured outside.   As the gates opened, there

was a mass of fans surged into the ground through them.   The sheer

number coming through frightened me enough to move away from the gate

and seek protection by the crush barriers by the programme sellers.

I cannot say how many entered through the gates at this time, but it

was hundreds and obviously none of them were checked for tickets.
MARSH                    IAN


The great majority of these fans made straight for the tunnel in

front of them.     As I said there was no one outside the tunnel in a

Stewards capacity to redirect them anywhere else.     The area between

the gate C and the base of Stand to X and Y area of the West Stand,

and the brick wall between the two sets of turnstiles 1-16 and A-G,

was 80     full.   Everyone seemed to be carried in the direction of the

tunnel in momentum.



After the surge of fans were through the gates, there was a lull and

so we were instructed by the Police to close the gate C again which

we did.



After a few minutes, we were again informed by the Police to open

the gate to allow the fans to enter in single file and to check the

tickets.    This we did supervised by the Police, and around 40 more

fans entered by this means.



We were then informed to close the gates by the Police and the

turnstiles were also closed.



From where I stood after we closed the gates, I could see the

entrance to the tunnel that leads to the Pens, and there was still

a vast crowd at the entrance waiting to get in.



At this point, a Liverpool fan came out of the tunnel and began to

shout that someone had been killed.     The supporters at this point

were still trying to get into the tunnel.     I don't know if the match

had in fact started or not.     I didn't pay much attention to the

running round in a circle shouting it but no one took any notice.



A few minutes later, I realised something was wrong.    I could see

groups of supporters helping fans out of the tunnel.    They were

carrying them and dragging them out back towards where I was stood.

I remained at the gate and almost immediately the first ambulance

arrived and I opened the gates. As more and more arrived I

realised it was something serious.    No announcements were made by

the Club, so I didn't exactly know what had happened.    In normal

circumstances the instructions for emergency situations at the ground

are:    A coded message is given over the loudspeaker system 'Mr MEADOWS

please go to the office', and, on hearing this message, everyone knows

it is the signal for everyone to go to their official postings, mine

being Gate C, but as I say no announcement was made until around 3.

30pm (1530). None of the Stewards have radios or camrrunication with

each other so none of us knew what was happening until then.



I remained at Gate C whilst the ambulances went through and behind

the stand to get to the pitch.



I saw a number of injured persons brought out of the tunnel and some

that I believe were dead.    They were taken to waiting ambulances and

scare were receiving treatment on the floor, aided by Police, Fire and

St John's Ambulance.   Prior to this I do not think there were any

St John's Ambulance personnel at the tunnel entrance.



I saw a person who I believed had died, on the floor in the alleyway,

outside Gate C, near to the turnstiles A-G.   The man had obviously

been attended to by someone, as his face was covered with a jacket,
MARSH                   IAN


his chest was naked .

             | I cannot remember what else he was wearing and I

didn't see his face at any time.     I knew there was nothing I could

do and I watched the ambulance crew place him into the ambulance.



The area around the top of the tunnel where I was, seemed calm, but

I sincerely believe it was through shock.     There was no chaos,

everything appeared to be organised quite quickly, and the injured

and dead were ferried away without any delay.



The Liverpool supporters appeared shocked and calm as they were

leaving the area, but they were verbally abusive towards anyone they

saw of an official capacity, including Stewards and Police Officers.

I did not see any violence at all or threats or any criminal offence

during this time.



From my experience as a Steward, there was nothing significantly

different about this match that made it any different from similar

previous matches.     I was on duty in exactly the same capacity at

Gate C at last year's Semi-Final between Liverpool and Nottingham

Forest, and the game was to be treated the same.



I must also add that I know the Club's policy is not to open Gate C,

apart from, for the Police to eject troublesome fans and for Club

officials to enter.    It is not normally opened for any fans to enter

and would only be opened on instruction of a Senior Police Officer as

it was on that day.



I know there is some speculation about the Gate C being a secure
        MARSH                   IAN


        gate.     It does not have a padlock on the gate and during match times

        it is always manned.    The gate cannot be opened from the outside.

        It is a concertina (folding) gate approximately 18 feet long and can

        be locked with a key.    During match times it is always unlocked by a

        Club official ready for us and none of the Stewards hold a key.       It

        is then locked with the key, after the match, by the official again.

        During the match, due to the construction of the gates, the left half

        of the gate remains in a closed position with bolt top and bottom in

        position, thus making this portion secure.    The other half of the

        gate, the bolts at the top and bottom are left out of position, thus

        enabling the gate to be operated by one man, and when the gate is

        closed, it is firmly secured by a moon-shaped metal bar with a hook

        at one end.

DATED: 020589                                               R w BEADSLEY (SIGNED)



          I am a married man and I live at the above address with my wife.



          I am currently employed as a                  and also work as a

          Steward at the Hillsborough Football ground on the weekday night

          games and the Saturday games, when work allows.



          I have been a Steward with Sheffield Wednesday for same nine years

          now. Originally I was posted in the West Stand, at the bottom of the

          stairs, which lead to the seated part of the West Stand.



          For the last four years, I have been posted to gate 'C' which is

          situated on Leppings Lane, at the entrance to West Stand enclosure.

          My duties involve manning the gate and allowing entrance and exit

          through the gate on the orders of the Police and persons in authority

          at the ground.



          The Club policy, however, is that the gate should remain shut at all

          times, unless circumstances dictate it as necessary to be opened.
BEADSLEY                RICHARD WILLIAM




I began as a Steward by asking the Chief Steward, Stewart THORPE, for

a post and I was made a temporary Steward filling in here and there.

Eventually I moved on to the posts previously mentioned.



Before every season starts, a meeting is called and a Policeman and a

Fireman came along to the ground and explain things about safety at

the ground.   We have seen videos of the Bradford Disaster and also

Heysel Stadium and the Fire and Police Officers explained what we

should and shouldn't do and also explained the use of fire equipment.

I have no knowledge of first aid and have never been given any

instruction by the Club on this or offered any facility to learn

first aid.



There are three Stewards assigned to gate 'C', myself, Ian MARSH and

a man called Malcolm.    I don't know his surname.



We are paid #12 for a normal game and #18 for a semi final and work

from about 1.00 pn (1300) until 4.45 pn (1645).      We work a system,

whereby one of us man's the gate for fifteen minutes at a time,

whilst the others watch the game and then switch about, so that I

miss fifteen minutes of each half of the game.



We all listen to the Tannoy and if the message, "Will Mr MEADOWS

please go to the Police Office," is given, we all make our way back

to our alioted posts and assist in any crowd dispersal etc.



Last year I was at my post for the Semi-Final between Liverpool and

Nottingham Forest and I experienced no problems whatsoever.     The
BEADSLEY                RICHARD WILLIAM                                      3


people all turned up early.     They were in the ground at 2.55 pm

(1455), and following the game, they all dispersed with no incident.



On Saturday 15th April 1989 (150489) I was again at work for the Semi-

Final, also between Liverpool and Nottingham Forest.



I arrived at Sheffield Wednesday Football Club at about 11.00 am

(1100).     I went upstairs, signed on and then went to my post.   With me

as usual was Ian MARSH and a man called Malcolm, whose surname I do

not know.    Gate C was partially opened from about 11.10 am (1110), to

allow Stewards and ground staff to enter the West Stand area.



At around 11.30 am (1130) to 12.00 am (1200) we were told that there

was to be a briefing upstairs in the seating area of the West Stand.



We left the gate shut but unlocked, with a Policeman keeping watch and

allowing ground staff in and out.



In the stand all of the Stewards posted to the West Stand area were

assembled and were being briefed by a Police Inspector who was with

his Senior Officer.    I think he was promoted from Inspector last year,

so he'd be the next rank along.



The Police Inspector I would describe as being white 5'8" to 5'9"

tall, medium build.    He had a full beard which was trimmed tidily.

The Officer normally works the game and I think is normally

responsible for the inside policing of that end of the ground.



The other officer also regularly works in the ground and as I say he
BEADSLEY             RICHARD WILLIAM                                     4


has not long been promoted.



The briefing was mainly about the manning of the fire exit gates.

The Officers wanted to know names of any Stewards on these gates so

that they could get hold of them if they needed to.



They said that we knew what to do, which we did, and they also knew

that the gate in our control would always be manned.



Tickets were shown to us and the officers explained what we were

to look for and to tear off the comer of used tickets, so that they

couldn't be reused by the fans outside the ground.



The briefing was about twenty minutes long and, on its conclusion,

all of the Stewards returned to post.



The gate 'C' was then partially opened, to allow persons into and out

of the stand area, and whilst there, we were joined by a steward from

the Liverpool Football Club, who had travelled with the fans to assist

in ground control of their own fans.



The Steward was a white male, aged 33-35 years and       to 5'6"

medium build with a slight midriff, straight, dark collar length hair

which was receding slightly at the front.   He had no beard and I didn't

think he had any moustache.   He had just a plain yellow bib on which

he wore over his clothes.



The three of us with the Liverpool Steward, manned the partially

opened gate, until a Liverpool fan came along and began moaning that
BEADSLEY               RICHARD WILLIAM


he had no ticket and could he get one from us.



The Liverpool Steward had words with the fan, and after he had gone,

we shut the gate, although it still was not locked.   This would have

been 2.10 pn (1410).



From this time until about 2.55 pn (1455), the gate 'C' was opened

and closed about half a dozen times to allow officers to eject fans.



It became obvious to me that there was an unusually large build up of

fans outside the gate and queuing for the turnstiles, as I could see

people outside through gaps in the gate and wall and mainly by the

numbers of people who were climbing over the wall to get in.



I saw Police eject about six fans who climbed over and they were all

thrown out into Leppings Lane side of the turnstiles through gate

'C', the door was then shut.



At about 2.55 pm (1455) we were standing by the gate, when the Police

Inspector with the beard, came over to us, and said something that I

don't remember and then said, "Open the gates." One of us said

something like, "Do you know what you're doing?" and he said, "Open

the gates."



I'm not sure who actually opened the gates on this occasion, it was

all very quick, it could have been me, it could have been Ian or

Malcolm or it could even have been a Policeman.



The gate allowed 2 or 3 people abreast to surge through due, to the
BEADSLEY               RICHARD WILLIAM


pressure of the crowd behind them.    Comments flew, as about 200 to

300 fans poured through the gate which was open barely a minute.



The canments were quite evenly divided between people saying on the

one hand, "If you don't open the gates there'll be a riot," and on

the other hand, "If you open the gates there'll be bloodshed."



After roughly a minute, as I said previously, the same Policeman told

us to shut the gates and with the help of Policemen on the outside of

the ground, we slammed the gates shut.



At around 3 pm (1500) or so the same Police Inspector came back to us

and said, "Open the gates."    There were several hundred fans milling

around by the gates, scores of fans coming over the walls and at this

stage the Police were helping them down.



The gates were again opened, by which one of us I can't recollect,

and as they came apart, I could see there were a lot of fans outside,

so I pushed the right-hand gate as you look at the West Stand, nearly

fully open.    There was then a sudden rush of fans pouring through the

gates, at least 20 or 30 people deep.    The front runners, so to speak,

were running and also being pushed along by the force of the crowd

from behind.



The people milling around in the enclosure joined in with the masses

and there were people everywhere. The crowd expanded seme ran

straight at the tunnel, others ran right and left, seme tried to get

up the stairs to the seating area.
BEADSLEY                RICHARD WILLIAM                                     7


I just stepped to one side.    If I hadn't I would have been trampled by

the crowd.



Within a few moments the vast majority of the crowd who had been

outside the stand entrance were in the West Stand area and one of us

shut the door, again on the instructions of someone in authority.

I don't remember who.



We then closed gate 'C' over to about 18" wide and began letting

people in as normal and checking tickets.



At about 3.10 pm (1510) a man came round to where I was standing from

the tunnel side of the West Stand.     He began conplaining, saying that,

"He'd been at Heysel and this was going to be another Heysel and that

he wouldn't be seeing any football."



I took him to the office and he asked for his money back, but they

said he had to get it back from Liverpool Football Club.



This would have been around 3.25 pm (1525) when I returned, and as I

did, I saw people sat up against the fence which borders the river

outside the West Stand.



Most were distressed and were struggling for breath, seme had blankets

on them and I presume were already dead.



I went to the tunnel to see what I could do, but I was told by an

Ambulanceman that there was nothing more I could do and would I give

drinks and any aid I could to the injured in the enclosure area, which
BEADSLEY             RICHARD WILLIAM


I did.



I then went onto the pitch and did the same sort of thing, helping

out where I could and trying to comfort people.



I then met up with the Liverpool Steward who was posted to our gate

and he was in an emotional state, complaining about the Club's

organisation and saying it was a disaster.



There was nothing more that could be done so I went heme.



I would describe myself as a white male, 5'5" tall, medium build.     I

have light brown side parted hair with a 2-3 inch scar on the left

side of my head above my ear where the hair is missing.     I also have

moustache and I would say appear to be in my middle to late twenties.



I was wearing a blue, red and white tracksuit top, blue jeans and a

steward's bib, yellow with 'UMBRO' on the back and the advertising

logo 'BINGHAMS WINDOWS' on the back.



I have entered my exact post on the plan of the Hillsborough ground,

which I enclose, signed by myself.

           I am a married man and I live at

                     rith my wife and my two children.



           I have been employed as a Steward at Hillsborough Football Ground for

           the last twelve years and I was present in this capacity at the Semi-

       Final Football match between Liverpool and Nottingham Forest on

       Saturday 15th April 1989 (150489).



       Since I have worked at Hillsborough, I have received no formal

       training as a Steward.     I have attended at the Annual briefing at the

       ground, which takes place at the beginning of the season, where we

       are informed about fire fighting and ground regulations.     This

       briefing is conducted by a Chief Fire Officer, an Inspector from

       Hairmerton Road Police Station and Club officials.



       In my capacity as a Steward, I am posted as a gateman at gate C which

       is situated at the rear of the West stand at the Leppings Lane

       entrance.     I have worked as a Steward on gate C for one season, but
BAIN                   MALCOLM                                               2


for the twelve years that I have been a Steward, I have always worked

in the West stand and have only missed working at one football match

in the last twelve years.    I am paid #12.00 for every game that I work

and for the semi-final matches I receive #18.00.       For a normal match I

attend the ground at 1.30pm (1330) and work until the game is

finished. For this Semi-Final I had to be at the ground at 11.00am

(1100) and work until the match was finished.



On Saturday 15th April 1989, (150489) I was working in the morning and

drove to the ground.    I arrived at 11.15am (1115).    At this time there

were very few supporters around the ground.     When I got to the ground,

I went directly to the coffee bar at the rear of the seats in the

West stand and signed on.    I was later than other Stewards but this

had been pre-arranged with the Chief Steward.     When I signed on I was

given a yellow steward's jacket which bears the club sponsors logo.



When I attended the match, I was wearing a grey ski jacket with blue

markings on the shoulders.   I was also wearing blue jeans, black

shoes, and a club identification badge.   I wore my steward's jacket on

top of my coat.



I would describe myself as a white man.   I am 43 years old and am

about 5 feet 11 inches tall. I am of stocky build and am clean

shaved.   I am balding, but at the sides of my head I have black hair

which is going grey.   This is cut to collar length.     I have brown eyes

and dark eyebrows but there is nothing about me which I would say is

particularly distinctive.



After I had signed on I went directly to my post at gate C.
BAIN                    MALCOLM                                               3




When I arrived at the gate the two other gatemen who were posted gate

C were already there.



The other two gatemen regularly work at this gate and have done so

for longer than I have.    Their names are Ian MARSH and a lad called

Richard, but I don't know his surname.       Both were wearing their yellow

stewards' jackets.



I have marked my C gate posting on a map of Hillsborough Football

Ground which I produce. (Ex. No.         ) (Ref. No. MKB/1) I signed this

before handing it to                         )f the West Midlands Police.



C cate is situated to the left of the standing turnstiles as you look

towards lappings Lane from the rear of the West Stand. This gate

leads out to Leppings Lane.       The gate is blue in colour and is

approximately 15 feet high and about 20 feet wide.       The gate is

constructed out of metal and is What I would describe as a

'Concertina' gate.   The gate is split into two halves, each of which,

opens in opposite directions to the wall.       The gate has a lock at the

centre and there are four securing bolts, two on each half on the

gate which push down into the floor and push up into the wall above

the gate.



The lock on the gate is unlocked prior to the game and we have to

release a small catch at the centre and the retaining bolts, if we

want to open the gate.    These gates are only supposed to be opjened

for the Police and for Club officials who have identification badges.

No one else is allowed to come in.      I opened the gate a couple of
BAIN                  MALCOLM                                               4


times immediately after I got to my post and I found the gates were

working correctly and were not obstructed in any way.



I have been informed that in an emergency a message will be passed

over the Tannoy saying, "Will Mr MEADOWS come to the office." If I

hear this I am instructed to open gate C fully and to stay at the

gate and supervise it. If there is no emergency a second message

saying, "Mr MEADOWS is no longer required at the office," is

broadcast. At this, I close the gate.    About three weeks ago at

3.15pm (1515), during a league match, the system was tested.     On this

occasion I heard the message very clearly, but there weren't very many

people at the game, and we had been pre-warned of the test.



When I got to gate C I could see that there were other Stewards at

their posts around the West stand.   A barrier had been erected to the

left of C gate as you look from the West stand, and programme

sellers were standing behind this barrier.   In addition, on my way to

the ground, I had seen that barriers were erected outside the ground,

to prevent access from the area outside the West stand turnstiles

along the alleyway which runs parallel to the river towards the south

stand.   This is the first time I've ever seen this done.   This was

manned by three Police Constables and two Policewomen.



In addition, there were about a dozen Police Officers inside the West

end of the ground, at the turnstiles, searching people.     I didn't know

any of the officers, they weren't the usual officers posted to this

end of the ground.



At the time I arrived at the gate, the turnstiles were open but they
BAIN                  MALCOLM                                                  5


weren't very busy at all.    There were only the occasional Liverpool

supporters caning into the ground.     Because it was so quiet, the

right-hand side of the gate, looking from the West Stand, was opened

a few feet, to allow easy access to the ground for the Police and

Stewards.   Whilst we had the gate slightly open, about 6 Liverpool

supporters approached me individually and offered me money in return

for allowing them into the ground and, on each occasion, I refused.        I

can't describe them all but I remember one youth who came up to me

and offered me #20.00 to let him in.    This youth was a white male

about 5'11" tall and slim.   He had ginger collar length hair and had a

very pale complexion. He was clean shaven and was wearing jeans and a

black check jacket.   He was dirty in appearance.   He spoke with a

Liverpool accent.



The Liverpool supporters continued to enter the ground in very small

numbers, with hardly any supporters waiting outside the ground.       It

was very quite which I thought was extremely unusual for a semi-final

game.   This situation continued until about 2.00pn (1400).



After 2 .00pn (1400) a few more people began to arrive, but What was

noticeable was the large numbers of people standing outside the

ground, Who obviously didn't have tickets.    These people were

Liverpool supporters and I would estimate that just after 2.00pxn (1400)

there were at least 500 people just hanging around and approaching

spectators coming in to the ground for tickets.



At some time around 2.30pn (1430), there was a sudden influx of

Liverpool supporters outside the entrances in Leppings Lane.      I

couldn't see where they came from, but when a Police Inspector saw
BAIN                   MALCOLM                                              6


them, he told us to close our gate and not to open it unless it was

for the Police.    This Inspector is regularly in charge of the West

stand perimeter.    He is white about 5' 9" tall and slim.   He has a

full beard but I don't know his name.    At this time we shut and

secured the gates with the bolts.



With the gates shut I couldn't see What was happening outside, but I

heard people banging on the gates. They were shouting, "Open the

gate," but the Inspector told us not to open it under any

circumstances.     I just stood by the gate with Ian and Richard.   From

where I was standing I could see the turnstiles.     People were being

pushed into them and they could hardly move.     People were crying to be

let in and I saw children being trapped against the rotating gate as

they were being pushed.



To get people out of this crush, the turnstile operators were just

letting people through without taking tickets.



The police officers who had been searching people were lifting

children into the ground over the turnstiles, to stop them being

trapped, and Liverpool supporters were helping them from outside the

ground.   I couldn't believe it, I've never seen anything like it

before.   There were so many people trying to get into the ground that

the turnstiles were ccnpletely overwhelmed.    As people got into the

ground they were complaining to us and to the Police about the way

they had been crushed trying to get in, but at this stage I didn't

see anybody who was obviously injured.



Between this time, which was about 2.30pn (1430) and 2.45pn (1435),
BAIN                    MALCOLM                                              7


things got progressively worse, the turnstiles remained packed solid

and the gates could hardly turn because of the sheer volume of people

trying to get in.    At about 2.45pn (1445), people began to climb the

wall above the turnstiles and jump into the ground.       Quite a few of

these people actually showed me tickets.



At this time the banging against gate C had got worse and it was

continual.    People kept saying "Let us in", and "Open this gate".

The whole situation was chaotic, and the Police inside the ground

were completely overwhelmed.      It was horrible to see all the people

coning into the ground crying and to see them being crushed like that.

The situation appeared desperate, something had got to be done, fans

whc had got into the ground were telling the Police how bad it was

outside.     I couldn't see anything outside the ground as bodies were

pushed against the small window in the gate and the gates were in fact

flexing in and out with the movement of the crowd.



At about 2.50pn (1450) the scene outside the ground was just madness,

people sounded as if they were going berserk. The inside of the ground

was also getting very packed with people looking for their friends or

waiting for friends to get in.



It was at this time that I heard someone say, "Open the gates."         I

saw two Police Constables go to the gates.       One was little, wearing a

helmet.    I think he had a Barnsley accent.     He was clean shaven,

stccky and he looked sun tanned.     I didn't recognise him as one of our

usual Officers, who attend heme matches.       The second Officer was

wearing a helmet, but I didn't see his face.
BAIN                 MALCOLM                                               8


These two Officers released the bolts and then the catch on the gate.

They then began to open the gate C up.     They had only opened the gate

about two feet, when there was a sudden surge from outside the ground.

I jumped behind the programme sellers' barrier with Ian, as the doors

were flung open by the crowd.   The two Police Officers were thrown to

the floor and a number of fans fell over them.     The people on the

floor got back up after only one or two seconds and all of the crowd

outside surged into the ground like a pack of animals gone beserk.



As this happened I heard a whistle and a loud roar from the ground.

With this, everyone who had run through the gate and into the ground

just carried on running straight into the tunnel which leads to Pens

3 and 4 in the West Stand terracing.     The spectators were pushing and

shoving.   I would say that there must have been at least a thousand

people who got into the ground before the Police shut the gate.



A few minutes after this had happened, a Constables outside the ground

said, "The majority are in now, open the gates and let the rest in

single file if they've got tickets."     I think it was Ian and I who

opened the gates this second time.   They were only opened about 3 feet

to allow the fans through single file.    About 200 people came in

after two Police Officers had checked their tickets outside.     I can't

really describe the Officers as they too were not known to me.    One

was a Police Constable and the other a Woman Constable who appeared

to be in her twenties.   I can't really describe them as they had their

backs to me.



Those who came into the ground on this second occasion, also ran

into the central tunnel which leads to the West stand.    When we had
BAIN                  MALCOLM


cleared those left into the ground, we closed the gates.    The area at

the rear of the West stand was now virtually clear.



After a couple of minutes, a few people waited out of the central

tunnel. I walked up to them and they appeared breathless.      They were

saying that there was a crush in the tunnel and they were hardly able

to breathe.   I would say there was only about half a dozen who had

coine out at this time and I thought it was just a normal case of

barging people out of the way that had happened.



One lad said to me that he felt as if his chest was on fire.      These

people went and sat by the rear wall of the Stand.    I don't recall

whet these people looted like.



A minute or two later, people began to stream out of the tunnel and

they were saying, "You better get seme help quick, there's a dead

body in there." At this seme Police Officers ran into the tunnel and

I went straight back to gate C.   I realised at this stage that

something was wrong so I opened the gate so that the emergency

services could be let in.



I stayed by the gate, and a lot of Liverpool supporterrs were leaving

the ground, saying they'd had enough.   I stood outside the ground by

the turnstiles in Leppings Lane, and didn't see what was happening in

the ground.   Another Steward called      who works on B gate, came

out to me and told me to take my Steward's jacket off because the

Liverpool supporters were causing trouble in the ground.



I took my jacket off and a number of injured people began to come
BAIN                 MALCOLM                                               10

out of the ground and were sat around the area of gate B.     There were

that many injured people in this area and that many people began to

cone out of the ground that my mind was just totally overwhelmed by

the extent of what had happened, that I honestly can't remember what

injuries people had, what they looted like or what people said.



There is only one person who sticks in my mind, the Police brought

him out of the ground, laid him on the floor and began to give him

artificial respiration.   This lad was a white male, about 18-20

years of age and was quite stocky.    I noticed that his legs and his

neck were blue but I couldn't see him very well, because he was being

given mouth-to-mouth and heart massage by the Police.




An ambulance arrived and the ambulancemen helped the Police and put

seine sort of pipe in his mouth.   After a few minutes, the ambulanceman

said, "I'm sorry there's nothing else we can do."



At this the Police Officer took his Police jacket off and put it over

the lad's head the Policeman put his helmet on top.     I can't remember

what the Policeman looted like but he was very upset.



There was a pair of jeans and seme training shoesat     the side of the

lad which I took to be his.



The Fire Brigade then arrived and I directed them to    the West Stand.

After this I'd just had enough.    There were Ambulancemenand Firemen

everywhere. I knew I couldn't do anything more so I just went home.
        BAIN                  MALCOLM


        I think that what happened was the worst thing that I have ever seen

        in all ray life.   I can't help thinking that what happened could have

        been avoided if the Liverpool fans hadn't all arrived so late and if

        those who hadn't got tickets had stayed at heme.    I did notice that

        quite a lot of the late arrivals had been drinking, but I can't say

        anything more than that; you could just smell the drink on them.     I

       would also like to add that this was the first time I have ever seen

        the gates in Leppings Lane opened to let fans into the ground.     It is

        normal policy for it only to be opened for the Police or officials.

        I am willing to attend at any subsequent hearing.

           I am a married man and live at the above address with my wife and

           three children.   I have been brought up in Liverpool and have two

           brothers, George 49 years, and                    My father has always

           been an ardent football supporter and, therefore, in turn, both I and

           my brothers enjoy football.



           I have followed Liverpool Football team since 1966 (000066), and have

           been a season ticket holder, following the team both at home and away.

           I have travelled abroad with the official Supporters' Club and have

       visited countries and cities, such as Rcme and Paris, to watch

           football.



           I attended the Cup semi-final match last year, 1988 (000088), at

       Hillsborough Sheffield, between Nottingham Forest and Liverpool

       Football Clubs.



       For the last ten years my brother George and I have also been stewards

       for Liverpool Football Club.      Not only do we steward home games but,
LLOYD                   RAYMOND   JOHN                                        2

on occasions, we travel to away games in the capacity of stewards.

Having been a steward for a number of years, you get to know the fans,

some just by sight, but others by name.



With regard to stewarding Liverpool grounds, I am fully aware of the

requirements for my job, namely, knowing fire points, identifying

suspect parcels, and assisting evacuation from the ground the case of

any emergency.



On Saturday 15th April 1989 (150489), the Cup Semi-Final was to take

place between Nottingham Forest and Liverpool Football Clubs and the

venue was at Hillsborough in Sheffield.                   the Head Steward

for Liverpool, had organised for eight stewards to travel to Sheffield

to assist other stewards at the ground with crowd control.      Our

instructions for the match were originally to arrive at the ground in

good time to get further match instructions.



I met my brother George at about 0930 hours (0930), to travel to the

ground, along with us was                                              Also

travelling with me, but as supporters, were a number of other people,

as we frequently travel to away games as an organised party if we are

not required to work.    We were travelling with a company called

Landliner, who are based in Birkenhead; we always use the same company

and the same driver takes us each time.     His name is



After being picked up at 9.30 am (0930) we drove from the Wallasey

area to other pick up points, collecting people along the way.        We

travelled after picking everybody up, to the area called Ecclesfield

Town just outside Hillsborough.     We went via the M62 and Ml and
LLOYD                RAYMOND   JOHN                                         3


encountered no delays on the way.     We arrived in Ecclesfield Ttown

about 11.45 am (1145) and went to the Travellers Inn pub for a drink.

When travelling to Sheffield, we always stop here for a drink because

it's out of town and we can have a quiet drink before going to work or

watch the match.



The pub itself is approximately three to four miles away but we needed

to arrive in good time.   In view of this, George and I left the pub

about 1 o'clock (1300) and caught a taxi to the ground.     The taxi

dropped us off outside the ground, at the Penistone Road north end.

Arriving at this point, we noticed a few hundred Nottingham Forest

fans and also a number of stewards and police officers.     At this time

there was nothing unusual and the atmosphere was good; the other

stewards, the remaining six who were intending to come to the ground,

were caning separately.



George and I walked around the back of the South Stand and met with a

man who I know now to be the Sheffield Head Steward.     The Head Steward

told George and I that only four stewards would be required to assist,

two of which would get paid.   As a result of this, I said I would act

as Chief Steward and George would assist, and we would split the wages

we were paid between the four of us.



I was allocated to assist other stewards in the turnstile area behind

the gates, to be more precise gate 'C'.     My instructions were to

remain on this post until 2.30 pm (1430) and then return to the West

Stand to supervise the other Liverpool stewards who were working

there, one of which would have been my brother George.
LLOYD                  RAYMOND   JOHN                                         4


When I got to ray post by the concertina gates, I was posted to assist

three Sheffield stewards.     I don't know their names but I would

describe them all as white males.       The first being 5'6" tall, of a

slim build.   He was clean shaven with fair hair, about twenty to

twenty-five years old.     The second was about 5'10" tall, of a slim

build, approximately 30 years of age, and the third was of a slim

build, about 5'10" tall.



Whilst on ray post I witnessed a gradual build up of fans coming to the

area in front of the turnstiles, and as I monitored the supporters

coming through, I noticed that several of the turnstiles were not in

use.    I thought this unusual because the volume of arriving supporters

was getting greater.



Several Nottingham Forest supporters arrived at the turnstiles but

they were re-directed to the other side of the ground by the police

officers near to the turnstiles.



There weren't any queues of people as such, just a mass of people

standing shoulder to shoulder, but during this time and up to 2.30 pm

(1430), no one was causing any trouble; the fans were just anxious to

get into the ground.



At 2.30 pm (1430) I moved from this post, up into the West Stand

seats and to a cafe behind the seated area.      I could see from where I

was standing, that the number of fans were increasing dramatically.       I

stood here for about 30 minutes, and whilst I was here, I did see ray

brother briefly - ray brother George.
LLOYD                RAYMOND     JOHN                                       5


The whole area of the forecourt in front of the turnstiles was

completely full now and people were still joining on from the outer

area from the pavements.



At about 2.30 pit (1430) I saw seme people climbing onto the turnstile

rooves and jumping over into the ground and, occasionally, I saw the

blue concertina gate 'C' open.    The first time was at about 2.40 pm

(1440), and between twenty to thirty fans ran in.     The second time was

about 3.00 pm (1500), but this time severed hundred fans surged

forward and ran through the gates.      I did not see these gates close

again and all the fans who were coming in ran directly towards and

under the West Stand into, I presume, the tunnel.     Prior to the fans

running through, I would say that the congestion in this area was not

assisted by the fact that seme of the turnstiles were closed, limiting

the flow of supporters entering the ground.



I noticed earlier on in the afternoon up until 2.00 pm (1400) this

gate, which I was working on, was open to allow free passage of

policemen, catering staff and other ground staff alike.     I did pass

comment to a Sheffield steward that this gate should be kept closed

as it was making the area difficult to control because people were

trying to enter the ground with and without tickets. The reply I got

was that it was always left open for ground staff to ccme and go.



At 2.00 pm (1400) when the gate was closed, there were two stewards

standing inside the gate and two outside it.     I, particuarly, was

standing outside assisting a Sheffield steward.     There were no police

officers with us, but I did see six to eight police officers about 15

feet away standing across a passageway which I assumed ran down by
LLOYD                  RAYMOND    JOHN                                       6

the river giving passage to the Nottingham Forest end.



The Police had formed a barrier effect in front of seme metal barriers

and were stopping people passing through.      They were sending them back

into Leppings Lane to go round.      This did not help the congestion at

all.



Going back to when the gates were opened the second tine, I cannot

recollect how many police officers or stewards were there at the time

because it was total chaos, and just a sea of fans.      As the fans ran

beneath me, I immediately went towards and into the seating section

of the stand I was in.   My brother and I went just into the seating

area because we were expecting seme of the fans who were running in

to ccme up to the seats where we were.



We stood there for a couple of minutes talking and monitoring the fans

in our section.   From where we were standing, I could see Pens three

and four and the terraces below.      I saw a number of fans climbing the

perimeter fences to get out of the pens.      I thought at this tine there

was going to be a pitch invasion; by this time the game had started.

I then saw an officer, a police inspector, run onto the pitch and went

towards the referee.   My brother and I still thought there was going

to be a pitch invasion so we went downstairs and onto the pitch in

front of the pens, to try and prevent this.     We tried at first to go

via the tunnel but the tunnel was packed and people were screaming,

"There's people being crushed." We knew then that it was something

more than a pitch invasion.      George and I entered the pitch via the

South Stand near the comer with Pen one.      At this point, George and I

got split up and I did not see him for another hour.
LLOYD                  RAYMOND   JOHN                                         7




The sight in front of me was total chaos, there were fans milling

about shocked and upset.    Some were very pale and holding their

chests and looked exhausted.     Police officers, stewards and St John's

personnel were helping people.     Some fans were screaming, "Get the

gates down, people are being hurt."       I could see people lying down and

people were helping them.



I went amongst the people on the pitch around the area in front of Pen

three, assisting wherever I could.       I helped people with minor

injuries, those holding their chests.       I also helped St John's staff

reassure casualties.



I, together with other Liveprool fans, then carried several people

over the pitch to the North Stand, Spion Kop comer.       We carried

casualties on makeshift stretchers made from advertising boards. The

people I was helping to carry, in my opinion, were dead and a couple

of them had their faces covered over.      Some of the people we carried

over - we ran them over.    I returned to the pitch area a couple of

times, helping out where I could.       I did try to move people away from

the chaos to make room for the emergency services helping.      Whilst I

was helping out, some people approached me and asked if I could help

this lad.   It was about 3.15 pm (1515) and I went to a lad who was

lying near to the 18-yds box, directly in front of Pen three.         I

checked the lad's pulse but I couldn't feel nothing.      I couldn't find

a pulse and then a man came over and asked if he could help.      He

tried to find the lad's pulse but couldn't.      He looked at me and said,

"He's dead son." Both I and the people I was with just broke down and

cried.   This man comforted me and asked me to take him away.
LLOYD                  RAYMOND   JOHN




The lad who had died I would describe as a white male, 20/30 yrs of

age.    He was clean shaven, he had a full face and was about 5'10"

tall.     He was of a stocky build, with dark short hair.I noticed a

bruise mark to the left          side of his face near to his temple.   Hewas

weering a blue shirt and jeans.



The man who helped me I have since seen on television or, at least, I

think it's him, and I believe he knew what he was doing.



We carried the casualty to the gymnasium and, on arrival, I saw about

five other bodies near to the entrance of the gym.     I returned to the

pitch and generally assisted once more with the dispersal of deceased.



I remember earlier on, that the Nottingham fans were singing and

chanting at the Liverpool end and seme fans who had spilled onto the

pitch, ran up the pitch          towards the Nottingham fans tohave a gowith

them.     This spurred the       Police to form a cordon acrossthe pitch

obviously to segregate the opposing fans.



Whilst with the casualties, I remember an ambulance coming over to

assist.    The goal net was taken down to give a free flow to the

effected area.    The ambulance came over and the ambulancemen began to

help.



I noticed during the chaos, that seme people had buckets of water and

were helping those who were thirsty and tired, from being crushed.      It

was a very warm day.    I met up with my brother and we left the

pitch area; I went to make a 'phone call to tell our families that we
LLOYD                  RAYMOND     JOHN


were alright.    We went via the players' tunnel to use the 'phone.

Prior to this our gaffer,                        was getting seme abuse off a

supporter who was cortplaining that the stewards weren't doing

anything.    I pacified him and sent him on his way.



When I went back out onto the pitch we just helped wherever we

could.   We were helping in the North Stand and the Spion Kop comer.

We moved down to the adjacent comer and, on the way, we saw a man in

a suit who said that Kenny DALGLISH wanted to know if his son was

okay.    I went off, and with others, we saw his son with other families

and, they were alright.    Someone went back and told DALGLISH that his

son was okay.    I went back to my brother and we again moved amongst

people near to the Spion Kop, helping where we could.          We eventually

moved to the West Stand where we met up with the rest of our lads and

we left the ground at approximately 4.45 pm (1645).



One thing I didn't mention was I assisted to pull a young girl from

the people who were milling about.         She was upset but I think it was

mainly out of embarrassment because I think she had wet herself.



I remember one man who was standing with me on the gate area to

lappings Lane.   He is c   |   a   t      Liverpool.   His name is

                                                  Whether he has anything

further to add, I don't know, he wasn't working that day; he was

talking to me because I know him from Anfield.



On the day of the disaster I was wearing a white shirt and a red tie,

a grey jacket, grey trousers and shoes.         I wore an orange steward's

jacket issued by Liverpool Football Club.
LLOYD                  RAYMOND   JOHN                                    10



I would describe myself as a white male, about 5'7" tall, of a stocky

build, with dark short hair.



Finally, I am prepared to attend the Judicial Inquiry if I am required

to do so.   I can recall vividly the fans, rushing through the gate and

the young lad dying.



The only critcism I would offer was, that I was disappointed to see

such a large number of police officers forming a cordon, when they

could have helped out with first aid.   What I don't understand is why

are people segregated outside the ground and made to go in separate

seating and standing turnstiles, when once through the turnstile,

they are mingled together again.    It seems pointless because the

stewards on the inside have to separate them again to re-direct them

to their respective match viewing points.



Where I stated earlier that I was posted to gate 'C' until 2.30 pm

(1430) and then to move to the West Stand, my instructions were to

remain on post.   The reason why I moved away from this point was

because I had a minor disagreement with a Sheffield steward.   He

wanted two stewards outside the gate and I didn't think it was safe.

Rather than argue with him, I moved away and went upstairs to speak to

the Sheffield Chief Steward.



A further point that should be raised is, I can't understand why

Police weren't moved in by the turnstiles to stop the crush and surge.

I would have thought they would have seen this from the cameras which

are mounted on the wall to the side of the ground.

           I am a married man, living at the above address with my family.     I was

           brought up in Liverpool myself and have two brothers, Raymond,       yrs

           and :



           The family I was brought up in, as is my own now, has always been

           interested in football.     As a youth I was a keen follower of Tranmere

           Rovers Football Club and regularly attended games with my family.    As

           I grew older I also cultivated an interest in Liverpool Football Club.

           Since 1964 (000064) I have been a dedicated Liverpool supporter,

           following them as a season holder at heme games and regularly

           travelling to away games.    My brother Raymond also had an interest in

           Liverpool and like me attended many heme and away games.



           I have travelled abroad with the Official Supporters' Club and was

           present in Belgium to see the Heysel Disaster.



           I attended the Cup Semi-Final in 1988 (000088) at Sheffield Wednesday

           Football Ground, between Liverpool and Nottingham Forest.
LLOYD                GEORGE EDWARD                                        2



For the last ten years, Raymond and myself have also been Stewards for

Liverpool Football Club.     In addition to stewarding heme games, I have

also on occasions travelled to away matches and performed duties.

Being a Steward for this amount of time I have got to know a lot of

Liverpool fans, some just by sight, some by names.     In relation to

duties at Liverpool, I am fully aware of the requirements of

stewards - namely, knowing fire points, identifying suspect parcels

and assisting evacuation frcm the ground in the case of emergency.



I was aware that Saturday 15th April 1989 (150489) was to be the day

of the Cup Semi-Final between Nottingham Forest and Liverpool Football

Clubs.              the ground Head Steward at Liverpool had arranged

for a group of eight Stewards to travel to Hillsborough, Sheffield to

assist controlling the Liverpool fans at the venue for the game.



My brother Ray and myself were to be two of the Stewards that day and

our instructions were to be at the Sheffield Wednesday Ground in good

time to be allocated a place to work frcm.



On the day of Saturday 15th April 1989 (150489) I met Raymond my

brother to travel to the game, at about 9.30 am (0930).

                                      were also travelling with us but

in the capacity of supporters.    We frequently, on match days, at away

venues, travel in an organised coach party.     It was the same on this

day, the coach taking us was a Land Liner of Birkenhead coach and the

driver's name was          The coach party was predcminently of Liverpool

stewards, although obviously the majority of them were travelling on

that day as supporters.
LLOYD                GEORGE EDWARD                                         3




We were picked up at around 9.30 am (0930) and went to several other

pick-up points around Liverpool to collect others in the group.

The journey down was uneventful.     I do not recall any delays on our

route which was M62, Ml.   We headed, as we do on all trips to

Hillsborough, to a town called Cambell Town where we normally go to

the Traveller's Inn Public House, for a drink prior to the game.     We

are almost like regulars there.     On this day, the coach party would

have arrived at the Traveller's Rest at about 11.45 am (1145).     The

pub is actually only 3 to 4 miles from the Sheffield Wednesday Ground.

Mindful of the fact we had to get to the ground, Raymond and myself

left the pub at about 1 pm (1300) and caught a taxi to the ground.



The taxi dropped us off outside the Penistone Road North end.     As we

arrived at this end, being the Nottingham Forest end, there were

already a few hundred fans about.     There was also Police and Stewards

about and I saw nothing unusual in the behaviour or atmosphere.    The

one point I did make to Raymond was the amount of space there was

about the turnstiles at the Penistone Road North end, as compared to

the Leppings Lane end which I have visited as a supporter before.



Although eight Stewards were travelling down from Liverpool, only

Raymond and myself were on the coach so we arrived independently from

the other group.



Having been dropped off, we made our way around the back of the South

Stand and met up with a man, who I understand was the Sheffield Head

Steward, at the rear of the West Stand.     I do not know the name of the

Head Steward, but he told us that only four of us would be required to
LLOYD                 GE0H3E EEWARD                                        4


work at the ground, the other four could go into the ground and watch

the game.   He also said of the four who were working, only two would

be paid.    The rate was #9.   As a result of this, Ray said he would act

as Chief Steward, and if he paid Ray and myself, we would split the

money between the four of us who worked.



I was allocated to assist local Stewards in West Stand seating, Z

entrance.    I was aware that the turnstiles must have been operational

already because I recognised a couple of the fans who were in the

ground already.



I left Ray and made my way up to the seating in the West Stand where I

joined a local Steward.    I do not know his name but I would describe

him as a white male, 5'10 - 5'11, 28-30 yrs, curly medium length

ginger hair, and he wore a yellow steward's jacket.     Neither of us had

a radio and I was not given any instructions on ground safety.     I did

not feel I needed any instruction as I was familiar with the ground

generally, having attended at Hillsborough seven or eight times.

I quickly familiarised myself with the immediate vicinity I was in.

My task was basically to ensure people had tickets and went to the

correct seats.    As I entered the stand there did not appear to be many

people in the ground so I went for a coffee in the refreshment bar in

a corridor behind the West Stand.     Having had a coffee, I returned to

my post and was kept quite busy.



About 2 pm (1400) I went for another coffee and met Ray who informed

me the other Stewards had arrived and had been sorted out and he also

ccmnented on how the crowd had started to build up in Leppings Lane.

Looking through a window in the bar, I looked outside the Leppings
LLOYD                  GEORGE EDWARD                                      5


Lane entrance and saw indeed that the crowds were now arriving thick

and fast.



Ray returned to his post and I to mine.    I was engrossed in my task,

but recall at about 2.45 pm (1445) I surveyed the ground, and, in

particular, recall the central terraces below the West Stand were very

full.    I looked about and saw the sides were still looking quite

empty and, in my opinion, there was room for hundreds more.    This

particularly surprised me, as having attended the ground and stood in

the terraces myself, I have always found the side views are better



Scmetime after this, Raymond came up and joined me in the West Stand.

He said they were having problems outside the ground.    He said it was

chaos.     He returned down the stairs and returned to me about 3 pm

(1500), in time for kick-off.



I would say of the people I seated and saw there was no dunkenness and

no disorder, and I saw at the most, only two people who had had a lot

to drink.     I would not describe them as drunk but rather in high

spirits.



At sane time around kick-off, or a couple of minutes after, my

attention was drawn to the terraces below us.    The central terraces

were very tightly crowded and there were surges from the back to the

front of the terraces. The surges are not uncomnon in a big crowd,

but I noticed and pointed out to Ray that a couple of supporters were

climbing over the perimeter fencing onto the track about the pitch.

Fearing the hooligan element might have been rearing its head, I went

with Ray to go down to the terraces, hoping our faces and Liverpool
LLOYD                   GEORGE EDWARD                                        6

accents may have been able to dissuade any troublemakers.



We made our way down the stairs at the rear of the West Stand.       As we

got to the bottom of the stairs the doors were locked but manned by

two local Stewards.     The Stewards unlocked the doors and let us out.



As we got into the enclosure to the rear of the West Stand it would be

about 3.05 pm (1505).     I saw the gate leading to the other half of

the Stand appeared to be locked.        I could see no Police or Stewards.

In fact, in the whole enclosure, the only stewards I saw were the two

on the stairs to the seating who let us out.



Both Ray and myself were wearing orange Stewards' tabards, and as we

walked towards the tunnel, some fans, in a shocked state, came to us

and shouted that there were people in the tunnel being crushed and

stampeded.



We made our way into the tunnel and again there appeared to be a lack

of Police and Stewards.     I could see nothing but a wall of backs and

realised that there was nothing I could do to get through there.



We turned around, and knowing the ground as we do, I went with Ray to

go around the West Stand on the South Stand side to try and get to

the pitch.   As we reached the side of the West Stand we saw a group

of four or five Stewards standing about.       We asked them how we could

get onto the pitch and they led us down towards the comer and onto

the track.   I remember the game had stopped but the players were still

on the pitch.
LLOYD                   GEORGE EDWARD                                         7


I saw a lot of fans were now climbing over the perimeter fencing onto

the pitch.     They appeared to be exhausted and were collapsing anywhere

they could find.     It was clear that it was not disorder but that

people were being crushed.



I saw a youth crawling, obviously distressed, towards my direction.          I

would describe him as a white male, aged 25-30 years, average height

probably 5'8.     He had a green jumper on and light trousers.     I

remember one of the first persons I saw was a St John's man who was

turning someone else in a similar state, in a position which they

could no doubt breathe more easily in.     I went down to the youth who

was panting and obviously struggling to breathe.       I turned him on his

side and pointed his head upward so he      could breathe easier.      He

recognised me because I remember he said something about Ray,          butI

did not know him.     I left him, still struggling to breathe, but

reassured him that he would be alright and I would try and get him

help.    I went to a First Aid St John's man and asked him to look after

him.    He said he would but there were more serious immediate problems.

This lad was on the pitch between the goal and the comer flag.



I left the youth and started to make my way in the direction of the

North Stand.     People were now flooding out onto the pitch and

collapsing exhausted and struggling to      breathe.    I went up to a number

of them who I could not describe and again assisted by putting them in

a position similar to how the St John's man did, that is an easier

position to breathe.



As I got behind the goal I saw the Police had got seme of the gates

open, the gates on the perimeter fence, and were trying to get fans
LLOYD                   GEORGE EDWARD                                          8


out as quickly as possible.     I tried to help and also noticed that

about me Police were joined with fans, pushing and pulling on the

fences, in a concerted effort to break the perimeter fencing down.



The fans coming out at this stage were obviously badly hurt and in

seme cases struggling for life, but they were, at least, alive.



Around this point, in the vicinity of the goal, I noticed a Policeman

who was with a young lad, no more than 12-14 years old.        The lad was

laid on the pitch.     He appeared to be unconscious and was very pale

but I thought, as apparently did the policeman, that he was still

alive.    I realised we needed oxygen if we were to be able to save the

lad's life.    I looked about and saw an ambulance, a St John's I think,

was coming along the track in front of the North Stand in our

direction.     I beckoned towards the ambulance and screamed for oxygen.

It seemed to take an age for the ambulance to arrive.     As it pulled up

near us, the driver, an old chap with glasses, got out.        I grabbed

him and shouted for oxygen.     He went to the rear of the ambulance and

fumbled with his keys.     We got into the ambulance and, to my despair,

I saw the oxygen cylinder was harnessed into place and not clipped.

Again the driver fumbled to undo the straps.     I joined in and in

seconds I had got the oxygen cylinder out and ran back to the

Policeman who was still with the youth giving him mouth-to-mouth

resuscitation.    When the lad was brought out the terraces, he still

looked to be alive.    When I looked at him this time he appeared to be

beyond help.     The ambulanceman went down with the oxygen.     I turned my

back.    I could do no more.



I took in very briefly the scene about me.     There was a Police line
LLOYD                  GEORGE EDWARD                                          9


across the pitch and by now there were fans and Police all about the

West Stand end of the pitch.     I saw Police and first aiders tending to

injured.     I cannot recall seeing any Stewards on the pitch at this

point.     The supporters that were being brought out of the terraces now

undoubtedly consisted of dead bodies as well.       The area behind the

goal was now littered with bodies; you could not walk without treading

on them.



I returned to a hole in the fence to the terraces where bodies were

being brought out.     By now a Police Sergeant, a big man, 6'6, was

giving orders and appeared to be the only person taking charge.

Everyone, myself included, was listening to him and acting on his

instructions as he gave than.     The Police in the area had got rid of

their helmets and we were all just helping to carry the bodies out,

like a conveyor belt.     I was aware of supporters ripping the

advertising hoardings and making them into makeshift stretchers.          I

assumed at this point some of the bodies we were bringing out had

their faces covered by their own shirts.      I assumed somebody must

have been pronouncing them dead within the terraces.       The bodies I

was helping to carry out I could not describe.       I was very distressed

myself and could not describe faces because I did not want to look at

them.     I was just helping to the best of my ability.



I remember specifically one body I carried.        It was of a 15-16 year

old.     His head was back and he had dark hair.    I carried his shoulders

and a Policeman carried his legs.      He was limp and jelly-like.   We

were having to carry the bodies further and further, because the area

was clogged up with bodies.     There was nothing we could do with him,

he was dead, and as if we both realised it, we just dropped him and
LLOYD                 GEORGE EDWARD                                         10

returned.



I helped two officers carrying another lad out.    Again he was

lifeless.    I carried his legs, the two Policemen had his shoulders.       I

remember he had his jeans about his ankles and he had         underwear.

As we put him down one officer immediately carried out mouth-to-

mouth. The other Policeman was trying to pull his jeans up.       I told

him not to worry, nobody would be looking.



I turned and returned crying to fetch another.     I remember at this

point, I saw other Stewards.    They were in the area nearest the Police

line; still I cannot remember seeing any by the goal.     I recall

another ambulance, possibly two, arrived on the pitch.     There were

Police and St John's giving mouth-to-mouth to other casualties who may

or may not have still been alive.     There were people in plain clothes

helping out.    I could not say if they were fans or nurses, as a lot of

people appeared on the pitch who said they were medical persons.        I

was aware by this stage that the bodies were now being carried away to

the far end of the North Stand.



I returned to the hole in the fence to the terraces where a large man,

again presumably pronounced dead, was being brought out.    He was a

white male, aged 30-35 years, 15 to 16 stone and 6'0 tall. He had a

multi-coloured jumper pulled over his head and wore no shoes.        It took

five of us to carry him.    Instead of leaving him, I stayed on and

assisted in carrying him on hoardings all the way the length of the

pitch and leaving him around the back of the North Stand at the

gymnasium.
LLOYD                  GEORGE EEWARD                                        11

I returned back down the pitch where I saw Raymond.      We both embraced

each other and then went into the corner where we had originally come

onto the pitch.    Looking into the West Stand we saw our sons and

gestured to than to stay where they were.



I moved on and helped carry another body on a hoarding, to the

gymnasium area.    I could not describe the body but by now there were

40 to 50 bodies lain out in the vicinity of the gymnasium.      I also

recall that by now the Fire Brigade had arrived.



I met with Ray again at the rear of the North Stand and we assisted as

best as we could in organising the ambulances and injured behind the

stand.



From there, about 4 pm (1600) we headed to the players' tunnel. We

were allowed in to use the phone as I wanted to phone my wife.     As we

went down the tunnel, we had to quell an argument between^

         and a fan.   I do not know what it was about.    We continued on

and made our call.



On our way into the tu,nnel I remember hearing an inappropriate

message over the public address, urging spectators to keep their

tickets which would be honoured for the re-match.



As we came out, having made the call, we helped look about the ground

for some fans.    At about 4.30 pm (1630) I remember seeing two or three

Police Officers collecting belongings left behind frcm off the

terraces. Two Policewomen were in tears saying, "What can we do now."

They were very young - I tried to reassure than.    About this time we
       LLOYD                   GEORGE EDWARD                                        12

       met with our children and went to leave the ground, consoling one

        another.    As we passed the rear of the West Stand, I saw the Sheffield

        Head Steward who had employed us.      He thanked us and I told him to put

        any money owed to us into a fund for the families.



       We made our way back to the coach, leaving the ground about 4.45 pm.

        (1645)     The coach was parked in a nearby main road.   On the way we met

        other distressed fans we knew and would have been on the coach by 5 pm

        (1700), because I remember hearing 'Sports Report' on the radio.      By

        5.20 pm (1720) all our coach party had returned, physically safe.      We

        set off home going by way of the Travellers Inn.



        I now remember that whilst carrying the bodies on the stretchers, I

        recall seeing a scuffle going on between fans in the North Stand, near

        enough at the half-way line.     I did not pay it any attention as I had

        other matters on my mind.



        On the day of the match I was wearing grey trousers, white shirt, red

        tie, grey jacket and orange Liverpool Steward's tabard.       I would be

        prepared to attend an Inquiry.

DATED: 080589                                                           SIGNED)



           I am a married man and I live at

       with my wife and son.



           I have been employed as a relief steward at the Hillsborough football

           ground for the last three years.   In this period of time I have worked

           at about two dozen football matches always in the West Stand of the

       ground.      I have been attending matches at Hillsborough for about the

           last thirty years, and as a result, I know the layout of the ground

       quite well.



       I attended at Hillsborough at 11.00am (1100) on Saturday 15th April

       1989 (150489) to work as a steward during the Liverpool versus final

       match.     On my way to the ground I noticed nothing which appeared to me

       as being out of the ordinary.     To carry out my duties as a steward I

       have received no formal training, it has been purely 'On the job'

       training and I have always been accompanied by an experienced full­

       time steward.
When I arrived at the ground I was wearing                        trousers and
a                jacket.   I was given a yellow stewards vest to wear at

the ground.



I would describe myself as




When I received my yellow steward's vest, I was told that I was posted

to gangway X in the West Stand Seating area and that I was posted with

a lad, I don't know his name, but he is the son of the Chief Steward

in charge of the West Stand.    I have indicated where I was posted on a

map of Hillsborough Football Ground (Ex.No.         ) (Ref .NoI         which

I produce.    I then handed this map to PC



After being posted I made my way to the seating area of the West

Stand.   Here a Police Officer with a beard and a flat cap briefed all

of the Stewards in the West Stand.    I can't remember what he said

exactly, but he reminded us of the emergency procedures in the ground.

Being a relief steward, I have not really been instructed in what to

do in an emergency situation, except to stay at my post and do as I am

instructed by Police or other stewards.      At about 12.30 pm (1230),

people began to come into the West Stand seats.      I stood at the step®

at the top of my gangway and inspected peoples tickets and showed

spectators where to sit.    For carrying out these duties I am paid
#9.00 for semi finals.



The West Stand seats filled up very slowly, but there were no problems

with any of the spectators.   One or two were obviously drunk, however,

they did not cause any problems.   I can't really describe what any of

these people looked like.



After about 2.30pm (1430) spectators began to flood into the West

stand seats and I was kept very busy checking tickets, a few people

with ground tickets and full tickets came up but we managed to direct

them to where they should have been.



At about 2.45pm (1445) I went down the stairs to the toilet situated

in the coffee bar area under the West Stand seats.   As I was using

the toilet I could see out of a louvre window a large number of

people walking along Leppings Lane towards the football ground.   I

didn't see any crowd problems and I thought it was a normal situation

for a game which would have a capacity crowd.



When I had finished I went back to my post and I saw that the West

Stand seating area was virtually full.   Because I was situated at the

edge of the stand there were still quite a few vacant seats in our

area, but I could see that the central area of seats was full.



At about 2.50pm (1450) I looked down into the West Stand terraces and

I could see that the central standing pens were full and that there

was plenty of space left in the pens at the sides of the terraces.

Because of where I was posted I couldn't see the central pens in the

terraces very clearly.   I just had the impression that they were full,
____________________________                                                 4


nothing more.



I then continued to collect and check tickets as I had been doing

previously.



At about 3.05pm (1505) there was a surge of spectators coming into

the West Stand seats.     They weren't aggressive towards us, it was just

that there were so many we were overwhelmed.     I tried to check as many

tickets as I could and seme of the spectators I saw had ground

tickets.    I turned these back to where they should go without any

difficulties.     This surge only lasted for about one minute and I can't

really describe what any of the supporters looked like.



A short time after this surge had happened, I noticed that scare

spectators were climbing over the fence at the front of the terraces

onto the pitch.     I was too far away to describe what they looked like

and I had the opinion that there was a pitch invasion taking place.

As I heard this I heard a commotion taking place in the coffee bar

area under the West Stand.     I made ray way down the stairs to this area

and I saw about 8 Liverpool supporters arguing with about 4 or 5

stewards.     I can't describe any of the supporters or the stewards, but

I did recognise the stewards as regular West Stand stewards.     The fans

were saying words to the effect of "It's stupid, there's people dying

dovm there". When I heard this I realised that there was semething

wrong.   I didn't want to get involved in any arguments so I began to

make my way back to my post.    As I was going I was approached by an

older steward c a l l e d w h o    is second in charge of the West

Stand.   He told me to take my yellow jacket off because people were

'having a go' at stewards.
I took ray jacket off and went back to ray post to look after the

seating area.     When I got back onto the stand, I looked down onto the

pitch and I saw a large number of Police, stewards and St. John's

Ambulancemen at the front of the central areas of terracing and on the

pitch near to the goals.     I could see that they were helping people

over the barriers and that they were helping injured people and giving

mouth-to-mouth resuscitation to people on the pitch.     I was too far

away frcm what was happening to describe any of the people who were

involved.



One incident does stick in ray mind.    I saw a group of about 14 or 15

supporters attack a tall blonde haired photographer, who was thinning

on top.     They were kicking out at him and punching him.   I think that

this is because he had been trying to photograph what had been

happening.    Because of what was happening seme policemen who were

looking after injured people had to go and stop the commotion.      They

didn't appear to leave people unattended, but that was the last thing

they needed, to have to get involved in, when people were hurt.       One

of the policemen escorted the photographer towards the centre of the

field.



I em unable to describe any of the people involved other than what I

have done already.



I then stopped watching what was happening on the pitch and continued

to supervise the West Stand.    People were leaving this area by now,

many of the people were obviously very upset.    When the stand was

virtually empty, I went towards the front of the stand where I saw ray
brother-in-law,                 talking to four old ladies who were sat

in seats. My                    is also a steward in the West Stand.

These four ladies were all in their fifties, they were wearing

Liverpool scarves and had Liverpool accents.     I can only really

describe one of the ladies, they were all very upset and were crying,

but this one seemed worst than the rest, so I put my arm around her

and I comforted her.    She was in her late forties or early fifties,

about 5'6 tall, medium build, grey collar length penned hair, plastic

riirmed glasses and she was wearing a dark anorak.    She was white and

was a Liverpudlian.



She told me that she had been in the upper terraced standing area at

the side of the West Stand.     She told me that people had behaved like

animals where they were standing and that some had urinated up her and

her friends' backs.



I consoled this woman for about twenty minutes and when the West Stand

was almost empty I showed her and her friends out of the ground.

I then went to two policemen who were in the West Stand, told them I

was a steward and asked if we were needed for anything.    They told us

no and said we could go heme.    I can't describe what they looked like.

I left the ground at some time after 5.00pm (1700) with my brother-

in-law.   I went out of the ground and began to walk along Tappings

Lane towards Hillsborough.    There were two Liverpool supporters

standing on the bridge over the river Don who were upset and had their

heeds in their hands. I stopped to talk to them and one told me that

500 or 600 fans had come to the match from Liverpool as a protest

because the Football Association had given Liverpool less tickets than

Nottingham Forest.    Both were in their forties and one was balding,
        they were both white but I can't describe them any better.



        After I had spoken to them I continued onto my brother-in-law's

        house. I think that in the circumstances everyone did their best to

        help.     I would like to add that when people come into the ground all

        they can see is the tunnel to the centre pens in front of them.     I

        think crowds are like sheep and they just followed one another, not

        realising that there was room in the side terraces. I also think that

        if the dividing fences were not in place, people would have been able

        to move out to the empty areas at the sides.



        I am prepared to attend any enquiry if I am required to.

DATED: 300489                                                           (SIGNED)



           I have lived at the above address for the past twelve months with my

           girlfriend.   I am employed as a                forking at




           I support Sheffield Wednesday Football Club and I have been attending

       matches at this ground since I was four years old.       Four years ago I

       obtained a job as a Steward at the Hillsborough Football ground.         I

       have worked at nearly all home matches at this ground during the past

           four years.   I have always been posted to the West Stand seated area.



       I have attended three meetings at the Club at the beginning of the

       last three seasons.      These meetings are held for Stewards employed

       at the ground, and are attended on a voluntary basis.      On each

       occasion we have been shown a film on ground evacuation procedures.

       The Police and Fire Services have been at these meetings to give

       advice.      Most Stewards attend these meetings.



       On match days my job as a Steward entails working on gangway Z or the
top of the steps at the back of the West Stand leading to gangways X,

Y end Z.



My normal hours of work on a match day are as follows.        League

matches 1pm (1300) until 4.40pm (1640) or until the end of the game.

Sari-final matches, 11am (1100) until the end of the match.           I am

paid by the club #6 for a League match and #9 for a semi-final.



On Saturday 15 April 1989 (150489) a Semi-Final match was to be

pleyed at Hillsborough ground between Liverpool and Nottingham

Forest.    My job on this day was West Stand seated area gangway Z,

to assist seated supporters to find their seats.        I was not

responsible for any gates within the ground.        I have marked with a

red. X a map of the ground, the position where I was working on that

day (           ).    I have signed this map.



At 11am (1100) on Saturday 15 April 1989 (150489), I parked my car

in a side street off Leppings Lane, Hillsborough and walked to the

ground.    As I walked towards the Leppings Lane main gate I was

offered a ticket by three separate ticket touts.        They did not state

a price, they just asked me if I wanted a ticket for the game.           One

ticket tout was at the junction with Fielding Road, one was at the

junction with Vere Road, and one was outside the paper shop right

outside the Leppings Lane gate.       There was a handful of Liverpool

Supporters waiting outside the gates at this time.



I went into the ground by the players' entrance, and went to the West

Stend seated area, gangway Z .       I sat down to wait for the turnstiles

to be opened.        At 11.30am (1130) I realised that I had left a
                                                                              3


Sheffield Wednesday sticker on display in my car.         I left the ground

by Gate C, which was already open, as there was a Policeman coming

through the gate at that time.        As I went through the gate I saw a

Steward whom I know as Richard who was posted to Gate C.



I vent to my car and removed the sticker and returned to the ground by

Gate C which was still open.        The crowd situation at this time was

much the same as when I arrived at the ground.        I returned to my post

at gangway Z.



The turnstiles opened at about mid-day (1200), and I remained on my

poet, assisting supporters to find their seats.         The West Stand was

all Liverpool supporters.



I was assisted in my ob by a Liverpool Steward named           [ who had

travelled down with the fans.        He helped me in showing fans to their

seats.       As far as I am aware       was a paid Liverpool Steward.



In the West Stand seated area, the supporters were generally good

hurroured.      I smelt alcohol on a few people's breath, but I did not

see anyone drunk.      I did not see any disorderly behaviour.     The

only problem I had before the kick-off was that at about 2.50pm

(1450), a large number of Liverpool supporters arrived in the seated

area at the same time.      Before this crowd arrived the West Stand

area was quiet and there were many seats empty.



Supporters continued to arrive at the seated area, West Stand, even

after the kick-off.      It was crowded at the top of the steps and

along the top corridor.
                                                                            4




At 2.55pm (1455) I heard frcm another Steward frcm Liverpool who I

don't know, that there were problems at gate C.      He told ire that

gate C was qpen and that all hell had broke loose.



I went straight to the snack bar on the West Stand top corridor.        I

went into the snack bar and looked out of the window which gives a

clear view of the Leppings Lane main gate.     I did not take any notice

of gates A, B or C.    Outside the main gates in Leppings Lane there

was a massive crowd of Liverpool supporters trying to get in through

the turnstiles.   The crowd was so tightly packed that they were

moving about as if it was just one body.     it appeared that people

were getting crushed outside the turnstiles.      I could see four or

five Liverpool fans on top of the turnstile building and others were

being helped off the top of the turnstiles by Police Officers.



After looking in leppings Lane for a few moments from the snack bar I

returned to my post.



As I returned to my post there was still a lot of Liverpool fans

arriving in the seated area, looking for their seats.



I saw that the match had just started when I got back frcm the snack

bar.



Within a few minutes of the game starting, it stopped.      I went down

to the front of the seated area and looked over at Pens 3 and 4 of

the West Stand terrace.   I saw that there was people crushed against

the fence at the front of Pens 3 and 4.    I saw some fans climbing
over the fence at Pens 3 and 4 onto the pitch.        There was also fans

climbing the dividing fence between Pens 3 and 4.        Some were going

frcm 3 to 4 and others were going from 4 to 3.



I then joined                 Steward), and we went down via the South

Stand onto the pitch.



It was about 3.10pm (1510), when I got down onto the pitch.          I

went to the front of Pen 3, West Stand terrace.        The small gate at

the front of this pen was open.       Two Police Officers and a Steward

were pulling people through this gate.       At the side of the Pen 3 gate

I saw a young lad                           who was crushed against the

fencing.     He was white, wearing a 'T' shirt with a collar.      I think

he had         hair.   I saw that his lips were blue and his face was

grey.      He was obviously in trouble.



I went over to him and put irty hands as far as I could through the mesh

fencing.     I could not get irty hands right through the fence.   I took

hold of this lad by his shirt collar and tried to hold him up.           He

was crushed and sliding down in front of the fence.       He didn't speak.

His eyes were shut.     He continued sliding down while I was holding his

shirt.     I tried hard but I couldn't hold him up.    Other people were

trying to hold him up from the back.      The pressure was so great that

he slid down out of irty reach.   I thought by this time that he was

dead, so I let go of him.



I then helped same Liverpool fans and a Policeman take a man with

injured legs on a wooden board across the pitch to the ambulance area.
I returned to the front of Pen 3 on the pitch with same supporters

and the stretcher board.     Seme supporters passed us a man who had

ccrre out of Pen 3. He was conscious and mumbling.    Same supporters

put this man onto irty stretcher board.   This man was white, 20-30

years, wearing blue jeans, training shoes which I think were Puma.

They were black trainers with a white stripe.     When he was put on the

stretcher board somebody put a black canvas jacket with a round

elasticated collar over him on his shoulders and back.

                       His eyes were open when we picked him up, but by

the time we reached the other side of the pitch to the ambulance area,

they were closed.    We left him on the board on the pitch near to the

ambulance area.     An ambulanceman came over to him and immediately

started trying to resuscitate him.



I then went back to Pen 3 area and by this time there was about 5 or

6 people laid on the pitch, with their heads covered o v e r .   They

were dead.



I continued assisting injured people to the ambulance area, but no

one else that had died.



On one occasion, I went to the ambulance area, I saw the man I had

taken over on the stretcher board.    He was still on the board on the

pitch.   His face was covered up with the black coat I mentioned.



I continued helping people during the afternoon and finally left the

ground at about 5.35pm (1735).



The only time during the day when I saw the tunnel was at about
        3.10pm (1510) when I was on the       pitch.   I could see the pitchside

        of the tunnel.     It was very tightly packed, and    people    in thetunnel

        were surging forward and then backwards as one body.       The crowds in

        Pens 3 and 4 also were surging several times and then trying to

        regain their balance.



        I have never received any first aid training.



        As far as I know Gates A, B and       C are only to be opened   for emergency

        services or Stewards.



        I would like to add that there were two photographers and one

        television crew in front of Pen 3 at the time when we were trying to

        assist people to escape.     These persons were obstructing us and

        refused to move.




                                                                          SIGNED

DATED: 290489                                                S. CAREWELL (SIGNED)



           I live at that above address with irty wife and family.



       About a month before Saturday, 15th April, 1989 (150489) I was at

       work when a mate who I work with, Stewart THORPE, who is the Head

       Steward in the West Stand at Hillsborough Football Ground, mentioned

       that he needed stewards for the Liverpool V Nottingham Forest game.

       Another mate who I work with usually worked at the game but he

       couldn't make it.      I'd never been to an F.A. Cup Semi-Final before,

       so I volunteered to do it.



       About a fortnight or a week before the game, I found out from Stewart

       that I would be definitely working the game and he gave me my ticket

       to get in.     He told me to be at the ground for 11.15am (1115) as that

       was when the stewards would be meeting.



       On the morning of Saturday 15th April 1989 (150489), I arrived at

       ground at about 11.25am (1125).      I entered the ground at the Leppings

       Lane end, via gate C, which was open.       There were two stewards on the




                                                                                    188
CARDWELL                STEPHEN   CRAIG


gate, one of them had a list and checked irty name on the list.      He

directed me upstairs to the West Stand.     When I got upstairs into the

Stand and there was a Police Officer giving instructions.        Because I

was a bit late, this was just caning to an end as I arriived.



After the Policeman had finished the talk, Stewart THORPE took me

downstairs to the refreshment bar underneath the Stand to get a 'bib'

to wear.     Stewart told me I was to work in gangway X in the Stand, to

check tickets and show people to their seats.      I was working with

another bloke who was an experienced steward and, from what I

understand, each temporary steward was put with an experienced one

in each gangway.     I got to lay post about 11.35am (1135).



Frcm then on I didn't move, except to go and get some refreshments at

about 1pm (1300) when we went one at a time.



I received no further instructions except that Stewart THORPE came to

see me to make sure I was alright.



At about 11.40am (1140) the Nottingham Forest fans began caning into

the Spion Kop.    From then on the fans were caning in, and from

1.30pm (1330) the fans were caning into the West Stand.        They were

just caning in in two's and three's and I was able to check tickets

and show them to their seats.



Frcm then on it was a steady flow of people, and then at about 2.50pm

(1450), a lot of people in great numbers were caning in.       It got so

bad., I couldn't check tickets with the amount of people caning into

the Stand.    I noticed that in the pens below the stand, this was
CAREWELL                STEPHEN CRAIG


happening as well.     There was   a lot of people packing in.This was

particularly so in Pens 3 and      4 behind the goal.



Frcm then on it just got worse.     tfore and more people were packing

into the Stand and the pens below.      People were already squashed

together and had nowhere to move.     The same volume of people didn't

seem to be moving into the outer pens to the left and right of the

Stand, they were just packing behind the goal.



I can't really put a time on the following events, because I wasn't

watching whether the game hadstarted because I could see      that the

people were still packing in.       In Pens 3 and 4 behind the goal I

could see that they were all pushing each other forward and more

people came in.



The first thing I realised somthing was wrong was when a young lad

had got frcm over the fence out of the Pens 3 and 4; I don't know

which.   He ran across the pitch towards the Forest supporters.     A

Policeman stopped him.



I then saw that other people were trying to climb the fence

from inside the pens.    Others were trying to get into the Stand frcm

the back of the pens.    Again this only applied to Pens 3 and 4.



I noticed that one young lad had been pulled out and was laid out

to the right of the goal as I looked.     Somebody, I think two people,

were tending to him.    I can't remember whether they were Police or

Ambulance.
CAREWELL                STEPHEN    CRAIG                                        4


By this stage people were being pulled over the top of the fencing.

I don't know when the front gates to Pens 3 and 4 were opened because

I didn't see.   I saw that policemen were trying to rip the fencing

away and kicking it to dislodge it.



In the Stand where I was, it was chaotic, with people standing

anywhere they could and more being pulled up from the pens.



As time went on, the crowd in the Stand began getting very aggressive

and volatile, and they began getting aggressive towards anybody

connected with the ground.



It would be about 3.40pm (1540) when I was threatened and assaulted

by a fan.   About five or six fans had walked down frcm the back of the

Stand.   They wore no colours but you could tell frcm their accents

they were Liverpool supporters. As they walked towards me one of than

grabbed the front of my shirt and pulled me towards him over the wall

at the side of the gangway.       He clenched his fist and pulled his arm

back as if to hit me.    He said, "You fucking Sheffield Wednesday

bastard." Somebody knocked his arm away and took him off and said,

"Leave him, he's done nothing."      They then walked off down the gangway

to downstairs. They were still shouting and swearing as they went.

I couldn't tell you what the kid looked like who assaulted me.

Because of his aggression, I couldn't tell whether he was drunk or

not.



I noticed that other people in the stand were looking at me.      The

mocd was aggressive.    I got the impression I was not wanted there.        I

decided to get out of the Stand, because I feared for my safety.        I
CARDWELL              STEPHEN CRAIG                                        5


took my bib off and waited a couple of minutes.     Then I went down the

gangway downstairs to the refreshment bar to hand my bib in.

Somebody handed me a cup of water, but I was in that much of a daze I

don't know who it was.



Then I got to the refreshment bar and saw that there was a youth

behind the counter.   He was grabbing trays of pop and other stuff

frcm behind the counter and giving it to the fans. They were running

around outside with cans of pop and other stuff in their hands.      The

youth behind the counter was in his mid twenties.    He wore blue denim

jeans and blue denim shirt, I think it was.    Other than that I can't

describe him.   I put my bib behind the refreshment bar.     I saw that

there were another 7 or 8 already there.    I left the ground straight

away at the lappings Lane end, but there were that many people there

I couldn't tell you which entrance I went through.



There were seme Police Officers forming a road block just outside

the Leppings Lane entrance.    Some of the Liverpool fans were having a

go at them, shouting and swearing, pointing their fingers.     The

Policemen didn't retaliate, they just stood there.



I haven't reported the assault or the looting to the Police.

                                                  I mentioned the

looting to Stewart THORPE, but that's about it.



I wouldn't recognise the kid who assaulted me or the kid who was

looting the refreshment bar.



There were seme Liverpool FC stewards at the ground, but what they
CAFDWELL              STEPHEN CRAIG                                      6

were doing I don't know.



From my position in the Stand I did not see any incidents near gate

C or the tunnel.



Saturday, 15th April 1989 (150489), was the first time I have been a

steward, although I had been to numerous football matches previously.



At no time did I ccme into contact with any person that was injured

or deceased.



Whilst the incident was going on I could hear that the Tannoy was

working, but there was so much going on, I couldn't tell what they

were saying.



To the best of my knowledge I didn't see anybody bringing

alcohol or drinking it in the Stand, but there were a few people drunk

in the Stand.   I, myself, saw about six people who were drunk.   One

man in particular, fell down the steps, he was so drunk.



I can say that when the people were being dragged out over the fence

by Police Officers, other fans were punching and kicking the officers

and also ambulancemen who were tending to the injured.



I am a Sheffield United supporter and previous to 15th April (150489),

I had not been to Hillsborough for approximately ten years.

DATED: 290489                                                               (SIGNED)



           I am the above and I live at the above address.     I work for

                                                   for about 12 years.



           I have been employed as a Steward at Hillsborough Football Ground for

           about 15 years.



        On Saturday 15th April 1989 (150489), I was at the Hillsborough

        ground in my official capacity as a Steward.         I was posted to the

        seating area in the West Stand on the left-hand side on an emergency

        gate.     It was my job to open this gate if asked to and to ensure that

        none of the fans from either the seating area or the standing area

        climbed over the dividing wall.    This is one of two gates.        There is

        another one on the right-hand side.    These gates are always manned,

        no matter how few people are at a match.



        I was shown when I first went onto the emergency gate, where all the

        fire points are and how to evacuate all the persons in the seating

        area in a case of emergency.    In the event of an emergency, a code
                                                                            2

narrs is used in which to allow us to open all the gates or to go to

the fire points.     The code word is, "Mr. MEADOWS is required".



At last year's Semi-Final I worked at the ground doing the same job as

I vvas doing this year, that of emergency gate Steward in the West

Stand area on the left at the front.     At the beginning of each year

we are fully briefed on fire and emergency by the Police and Firemen.



I was posted to the gate on irty own.   I am always posted to the West

Stand, but irty position varies from match to match.



Prior to the match postings we were fully briefed by a Police Officer

whc I think was an Inspector.    All the stewards were briefed in the

seating area of the West Stand as to the colour of the tickets and

whet to do if we had any difficulties.     He took the names of all of

us that were going to be on emergency gates.     This was at about

11.30 am (1130).



The same people are always posted to the large outside gates and so I

am not aware of any policy or procedure that is connected with the

opening or shutting of these gates.     I was not provided with any means

of conmtunication.



In the event of an emergency, I have to open the gate and filter

people out of the seating area and into the 'triangle' standing area

so that they can get out into the rear of the stands if the

'triangle' is full.    Then I would signal to the Police at the rear

left-hand side to filter people out via the access/exit point by the

Steiid.   There is always a Policeman standing about 8 ft in front of me
at the bottom of the seating.



I do First Aid training at work, but I have never received any

training because I am a Steward.



I do get paid for irty work asa Steward.The hours I work     are usually

1.C0 pm (1300) to about 5.00 pm (1700),    but as this was a cup

match, I started at 11.00 am (1100) and I wait until everyone has

left the ground.



I did not eject anyone on this occasion.     I did not witness any

alcohol being brought into the ground or being consumed.



From irty post I cannot see the Leppings Lane entrance, and once posted,

I am not allowed to leave my post.     Nor did I witness any problems at

the Leppings Lane turnstiles.     I did not see gate C opened.



About 3 minutes into the game, I saw people in Pens 3 and 4 surge

forwards.   I thought that it was unneccesary for so many people to go

into 3 and 4, as pens either side were only about half full.



I have no idea who opened gate C or for what reason.     I do not know

which Stewards were on these gates.



The only thing I can say about gate C is that at 11.00 am (1100)

the gate was closed.     I cannot say whether the gate has been opened

on previous occasions.



For seme reason the North and West Stands were not as full as they
________________________                                                   4


usually were at that time.     It seemed to me that the Liverpool fans

were leaving it late to get into the ground. The majority of the

Forest fans were in the ground and had settled down.     This was at

about 2.30 pm (1430).



As I walked towards the ground at about 10.45am (1045), I was

approached by a man who asked me if I had any tickets to sell. I

could see that he had already got 4 or 5 tickets, but I don't know

which side they were for.    I did not pay much attention to him and

I am unable to describe him.



I could not see into the tunnel itself and so I didn't witness

anything that happened in there.



In Pens 3 and 4 I saw that there were people surging forwards and

backwards as well as from side to side.    It seemed to me that the

crcwd was trying to shove their way out.    Normally when a crowd

pushes forwards, due to seme action on the field, they usually tend to

return to their original stance.    However, this time the crowd just

kept on moving forwards and then to the sides. I did not witness any

barriers being broken.



I could only observe the events from a distance as I wasn't about to

leave the emergency gate.    I didn't see anyone die or get hurt.   I

only saw them afterwards when they were on the pitch.    I didn't

assist anyone who was injured or dead.



In irty opinion, the fences that run down the terraces towards the pitch

caused a lot of the trouble.    If those fences hadn't have been there
people would have been able to filter out to the sides and prevent a

crush.



I didn't witness any fans being obstructive towards the Police or

Stewards.   I have, however, heard from other Stewards that other

Liverpool fans were causing trouble.



I cnly received verbal abuse as to what I should do.     I was not

injured in any way.



At about 2.30 pm (1430) a lady came and complained to me that

scire youths in the 'triangle' were urinating on them.    She returned

to me about 2.50 pm (1450) and again complained, showing me that

her legs were wet.



The 'triangle' is the area above Pen 7.



I think that the Police did everything that they could.    I saw them

climbing over the fence and giving reviving actions to people.       When

they left the ground the Forest supporters clapped them in

appreciation.    All the Services acted excellently and to the best of

their ability.



I think that nothing in the preparation of the match was different to

previous.



In irty opinion, alcohol had a great deal to do with the incident.   I

live quite close to the ground and I saw that in people's front

gardens there were a lot of discarded wine bottles and beer cans.     I
        have never seen so many left before.

DATED: 300489                                                          SIGNED)



        I reside at the above address with my wife and family.



        I am employed by the Sheffield Wednesday Club as a temporary Steward

        I was present in that capacity for the Liverpool v Nottingham Forest

        match on Saturday 15th April 1989 (150489).   This is only the second

        match I have attended as a Steward.   The other being the equivalent

        Semi-Final last year.   I don't have a specific job to do at the

        match.   I see the Chief Steward and he gives me a job for that day.

        This particular match on Saturday 15th April 1989 (150489), I was to

        shew people to their seats in the the seating area of the West Stand

        in gangway Y and to double check that no person entered the Stand

       with either a forged ticket or a standing ticket.    At this point I was

       on duty, with another Steward who I know only as            As far as I

       am aware he is a regular Steward at the ground.     I have received no

        formal training or had any specific instructions in what to do in the

       event of an emergency, but only how to recognise forged tickets

        (either written or verbally).
                                                                            2


I am not aware of any Club policy in the opening or shutting of

gates.   I was not in possession of either a radio or telephone, but I

was aware that a Chief Steward in ray area had a radio.     I was not

first aid trained by the Club.     I do not consider myself to be

competent in the application of first aid treatment.      I am paid a fee

whilst I am on duty at the ground and ray hours of work are between

11.00am (1100) and I finish when all supporters have left the ground.



At 11.30am (1130) on Saturday 15th April 1989 (150489), I took up ray

position, together with            at the top of the stairs in the

seating area in gangway Y.     I did not eject any persons frcm the

football ground.   However, I did inform two Police Officers, and

actually pointed out to them, a man who I thought was considerably the

worse for drink.   As he entered the seating area he fell over the top

step and fell onto the ground.     After pointing him out to the Police

Officers, I turned round to assist other people and when I looked

again they were not there and I assumed that he had been ejected.       I

was not aware of any alcohol being brought into the ground, or of any

being consumed within the confines of the ground.



Although I did not witness any problems in the Leppings Lane area

with regards to crowds of people, I did not notice that a lot of the

seets in ray area were vacant, and that it didn't compare with how the

ground was at the same time the previous year.     I could also see that

the North Stand was in a similar position.    This had also been

allocated to Liverpool fans.     I could see that both the Spion Kop and

the South Stand which had been allocated to Forest supporters were

alirost filled to capacity.    I could see that at the same time the

North Stand and West Stand were only about half full.
From ray position, I could not see the turnstiles, or gate C and so I

did not witness any problems frcm people attempting to gain access by

unethorised means, or anyone opening Gate C prior to kick-off.      I did

at one point go to the toilet and I looked out of the window slats

and saw that there was a large crowd waiting outside the ground in

Leppings Lane.



The only problem I witnessed which I can contribute to the opening of

Gate C was that I became aware of the problem when I saw people

climbing over the security fence to get out of the crush.    I believed

at the time that they were attempting to invade the pitch or possibly

even a fight had broken out.    Frcm the steady run of people actually

ccming into the seating area, I noticed a considerable increase in

persons coming on the stairs.   As far as I can remember, all the

people that I saw had the correct coloured tickets, and the majority

of them were intact and hadn't been separated at the turnstiles.



I could not see the tunnel frcm where I was, and so I did not witness

any surge of people in the tunnel.   However, after about 5 minutes of

the game, I saw the people in Pen 3 fall forward in a strange

way.   It looked wrong to me, as it seemed that everyone across the pen

fell all together and not everyone seemed to regain their stances.

Prior to the majority of the people entering the ground, I went to

seek a friend of mine who is a Steward at the ground, and at that time

I noticed that the back gate which allows access of persons between

Pens 2 and 3, was shut.   As far as I am aware frcm ray observations in

previous games as a season ticket holder, these gates are usually

marned by Police Officers, but I do not know whether it is their
responsibility to unlock or allow access via these gates.



After witnessing the initial crowd surge it is possible, but I didn't

actually see, the crush barrier breaking in Pen 3, although the

crowd did go forward in one movement and didn't as I would have

expected, stop in sections.



I looked down towards where the crush had been in Pens 3 and 4,

and saw that people were climbing over the fence.    I thought that it

was a pitch invasion, but then I saw that people were lying down on

the grass and people were injured.   I went closer and saw that the

gate to Pen 3 was now open, but due to the crush, nobody could go

through it.   I saw a Policeman grabbing hold of people and pulling

the-m free through the gate.



When I saw the surge in Pen 3, the people at the front seemed to

keep falling, and then disapper under the other people who were

coming forward.



Having observed supporters being pulled out onto the playing area,

some of which appeared to be seriously injured, I could see that the

problem was far more serious that I first thought.



I then decided that it was time that I went to assist anyone who was

injured, and so I went to the rear concourse and began to help with

injured people who had I presumed been passed up into the seating

area frcm the standing area.   This concourse is a refreshment arnaa

which runs the length of the stand and the rear of the seating backs

onto it.   I could see Police Officers doing first aid on injured
        people and some of the Liverpool supporters were pulling at them and

        saying things such as, "Why have you let this happen".   I could see

        that the supporters were angry and upset by the incident.



        Whilst I was assisting a young boy who was in a very distressed state,

        two youths came up to me and began making threats.   They said that if

        anyone died then they would be back to get me.



        I wasn't injured in anyway during the incident.   I think that everyone

        did what they could in the circumstances, but there was very little

        they could do.   There was much confusion between supporters.   When

        the incident first began happening, and I was becoming aware of the

        problems, people were still asking me to show them to their seats.     No

        announcement was made over the Tannoy to inform persons of events.



                                                                        SIGNED

DATED: 290489                                                           (SIGNED)



           I am a married man living at the above address with my wife and

        youngest daughter.     I have been employed in my present occupation for

           eight years.



           For approximately seven years I have been a Steward at the Sheffield

       Wednesday Football Ground.      I have always been posted to the West

        Stand.     I get paid for doing this.   At the start of the season, all the

        Stewards are invited to attend a meeting at the ground, which consists

       of a briefing from Police, Saftey Officers and a Chief of Security.

       They give us details of all new laws and regulations.      At this

       meeting we are given our rule book which contains our payment slips.

       Depending on the match, we fill in the amount on the slip and sign

       it.     At the briefing before the match with the Senior Steward, we hand

       him the slips and he gives us our jackets etc.      At the finish of the

       match we return to him and collect money.



       On Saturday 15th April 1989 (150489) at approx 10.50am (1050) my wife

       drove me to the football ground.     We were travelling frcm the
direction of Wads ley Bridge railway station towards the football

ground.     As we approached the junction with Bickerton Road, I saw a

man I beleived to be a ticket tout.    This man had several tickets in

his hand and was walking up and down the pavement.    This man was a

white male approx 5'8" tall, with short greyish hair, clean shaven,

wearing a brown jacket (Bomber style). As we were passing him, I

mentioned to my wife, "There's a ticket tout there already."



As we drove further up and down I got out of the car and walked

towards the ground, another male approached me and said, "Any spare

tickets?"    This man was a white male approx 30 yrs, wearing a red and

white scarf.    His hair was dark and short/average length.    He had a

moustache and spoke with a Liverpool accent.



I then entered the ground and went to the West Stand briefing area

where I was assigned to X gangway on West Stand seating.      My job

there is to assist people to their seats, keep the gangways clear and

help anyone with any problems in my area.     I was in company with a

temporary Steward but I don't know his name.



Up until approx 2.30pm (1430) it appeared very quiet, there were no

problems at all.



At this stage I went to the men's toilet which is situated at the

South Stand side of the snack area upstairs.     In the toilets there

are louvre windows so I had a look; from where I was I could see gates

A, B and C and the main entrance gate at Leppings Lane.    I believe

there was approx. 1500 fans outside the turnstile area waiting to get

in.   They did not appear to be overly aggressive.   I then returned to
ray post.



The crowd then started to cone in quicker.    At about 2 .45pn (1445) the

odd one or two fans were coming up from the standing area below over

the balcony and into the seated area.    These initial fans were dealt

with by Police Officers.



As it approached kick-off time, people were coming in in larger

numbers.    Some of the fans were getting aggressive and refusing to

show me their tickets.     I could smell drink off a number of fans as

they passed me, but I wouldn't say any of than were drunk.



Just before kick-off, I was directing people to their seats and I had

my back sideways onto the gangway.    All of a sudden, a surge of fans

caire from the gangway and was carried forward down the steps.    I was

not injured at this stage and regained my feet and went back to my

post.



I was trying to see people's tickets at this stage.    Some fans showed

me proper tickets but, approx. 10-20 fans showed me ticket stubs.      I

told them that the ticket stubs were not valid and the fans forced

their way past me whilst swearing and hurling verbal abuse.



At this stage I noticed people climbing over the balcony from the

standing area and I also noticed people climbing from the standing

area onto the pitch.



At this stage there was mayhem, the gangways were packed and fans

were running from gangway to gangway shouting abuse.
                                                                            4




At this time I saw a woman who appeared to be unconscious being passed

frcm the direction of the balcony to the gangway, a Police Officer

attended to her.



I tried to return to my post but is was blocked with fans.     The fans

then started getting very abusive calling us, "Yorkshire bastards,

it's your fault."   They also were pushing us and prodding us.    At this

stege I was very afraid for my safety.



My partner was trapped in the crowd at gangway X.     I was unable to

get to him.   They were shouting abuse at him also.



I noticed at this stage that the players had left the pitch.



I then got onto the landing where I was approached by a woman who

stated she was a nurse and could she help.    I directed her to the

bottom of the steps and advised her to ask the Police.     I knew at this

stege something serious had happened.



A youth approx 14-15 came up to me and asked me to help him.     He had

hurt his hand being pulled up frcm below.    I checked his hand and it

didn't appear serious.   At this point a man approached me and said,

"I'm a doctor, I can be of assistance where do I go?"     It appears that

frcm where he was sitting he saw more than I did.     I escorted the

doctor down the steps round to uncovered seats on the South Stand and

through the gate onto the pitch.



I started to return to my post.    As I got to the steps I could see
pecple laid on the concrete.    Some of the people were dead, others

were injured and others just shocked.



I valked around the people trying to offer help and I saw Policemen

giving the kiss of life to people doing what they could to help.



The one Policeman was giving a person the kiss of life when a fan

started man-handling the Policeman and shouting at him, "It's your

fault giving us this end of Ground."



The Deputy Chief Steward then said, "We've been told to take our

jackets off for safety reasons."



During this time I was trying to help the people who had come out

of the tunnel leading to Pen 3 and 4.



Myself and others were standing under the eaves of the upstairs snack

bar.    Up in that area fans were obviously urinating against the back

wall.   There is a gap in the flooring which caused the urine to fall

on myself and others below.    I believed this to be accidental as the

pecple upstairs would have been unable to get to toilets.



I vas still trying to help and ccmfort the numerous people who were

injured, shocked, etc.



Fans then started to leave the ground.   I then heard broken glass and

locking up I saw fans punching the windows out in the upstairs West

Stand toilet windows, on the South Stand side.   I then moved people

away from underneath, to prevent glass falling on them.
                                                                         6


At this stage some fans were still shouting abuse at us, others were

thanking us.



The majority of people had left the ground and the emergency vehicles

were removing deceased bodies.



The Chief Steward then approached and asked if we had any property

upstairs in our cupboard.   This is situated in the upstairs snack

bar . He told us to go and check our belongings, as while snack bar

staff were out assisting the injured, some of thecrowd   had broken

into the snack bar and damaged the property.



While checking the cupboard, a Policeman handed me anempty cash box

which I placed in our cupboard.



I then went downstairs and I saw one of the girls from the snack bar

and told her what had happened.



All the stewards then congregated by the steps.   After a discussion

we were stood down and myself and another Steward went to look at the

scene.



When we looted at Pens 3-4, there were several Policemen there talking

to a few youths.



A gang of pressmen then came into the ground talcing pictures.   My

friend and myself then left the ground through gates 19-22 and I

walked heme.
Further to what I said about fans initially climbing frcm standing to

seating, I would like to add that the Police were preventing the fans

from entering the seating area.   As they tried to come over, the

Police stopped them causing them to remain in the below standing area.

At this stage on the seating stand it was not apparent the extent of

the problem below.



Also, in my opinion, I believe that the fans causing the surge on my

gangway would have come from the crowd who entered after gate C had

been opened.   They would have entered into the area and forcibly pass

through the stewards at the seating steps entrance up to 'S' Stand.

Having spoken to the stewards after the incident, I know the Assistant

Chief Steward, who was at the bottom of the steps, was knocked over

and. injured by the surge.



On the day, my first reactions, being first aid trained, was to help

the injured.




I would like to say that the majority, 95 per cent of the fans, were

well behaved and it is a small minority who seem to cause the problems

         I am a single man living at the above address with my parents.



        On Saturday the 15th April 1989 (150489), I was employed as a steward

        on gangway 'U'. I have only done this job once before and that was

        at the Semi-Final in 1988 (000088).



        On the 15th April 1989 (150489), I drove to Sheffield Wednesday rc in

        my own car and I parked it in the 'Gate Inn Public House' car park in

        Penistone Road.   I was in company with my brother,       , and

        another friend of mine.



        We then walked along Penistone Road into Leppings Lane towards the

        Ground.   Just before we came to the junction with Vere Road, a man

        approached us, asked us if we had tickets.   We just ignored him and

        carried on to the ground.   This man was a white male, approx 5'9, with

        shortish hair, clean shaven, wearing denim jeans with a Liverpool
        accent.
We arrived at the ground at approx 11.30 am (1130) and spoke to

 senior stewards who gave us our jackets and we signed our payment

 slips.    The Senior Officer, 'Albert', then gave me my instructions

 for my duties at the match, which were, I was posted in company with

Senior Steward to 'U' gangway, upstairs seated area of West Stand.

My duties for the day were to check tickets, direct fans to their

seats, keep the gangways clear and generally assist fans with any

other problems which might arise.

My partner and I then went to our post.     Everything was normal up

until about 2.45 pn (1445).    At this stage fans started arriving in

larger numbers.



At about 2.55 pn (1455), there was a rush of fans coming into my

area.     I noticed three or four fans had full tickets; this being

unusual because when fans come through turnstiles on entrance,

tickets are ripped in half and one half is retained by turnstile

attendants.



I asked one of these fans how he had got into the ground without

showing his ticket and he replied, "Someone's opened the gate."

Another fan, who had heard the question, replied, "It's been kicked

open," to which I replied, "Who opened the gate?"



I then noticed fans climbing frcm pens three and four behind the goal

onto the pitch.



Then I noticed there was an awful lot of people packed into pens

three and four and there were not many in pen six.    I thought they

would move than frcm pens three and four into pen six.
                                                                           3



Frcm the people who climbed onto the pitch I saw one person just

collapse onto the ground.



Crowds were still rushing in behind my partner and I and the tunnel

leading to our gangway was full, so we decided to move round the back

to the snack bar.   I noticed there was one fan who was laid out by

the wall and two Policemen were trying to bring him round.     There was

scare fans shouting at than, telling than they weren't doing it

right.   The Policemen told them to go away, that they knew what they

were doing.



Another fan was sitting by a wall and appeared shocked.     My partner

gave him a drink.



All around us fans were shouting at us, "What are you going to do

about it?   Why have we got this end and not the Kop end?   They haven't

as many fans as us," etc.



The Policeman then carried the injured man downstairs and we went

halfway down the steps on the South Stand side.   I then saw my

brother, who had taken off his steward's jacket due to abuse he was

receiving frcm fans.   He told me to take off my jacket and we could

still help pecple without them on.



I then took off my jacket and took it upstairs and put it away behind

the counter.



At this stage I still didn't know what had really happened.    From the
steps I could see throught the gates at the bottom, Policemen and

everyone running around.



I went through the gates and there was people everywhere.    Injured

pecple were lying by the wall and others were being carried from the

tunnel leading to pens three and four.



I was talking to some other stewards when Albert came up to us and

said we might as well go home, emergency people were handling it.

I was watching everything happening but could not believe it was

happening.



I then walked out, on my own, through 'C' Gate and saw about twelve

police officers standing by the river, two abreast.     I looked at them

and looked down and I could see, through their legs, a line of bodies.

I knew they were dead as they had covered their heads.



At this stage I knew what they said inside was true and that's when it

hit me.   I was very shocked and just walked past them to my car.   My

mates were waiting for me and I took them heme and went myself.     On

Tuesday after the match, I decided I would take some flowers down to

the ground.   When I got to Leppings Lane entrance, the gate leading to

alongside the river was open for people to go in.     I could not go in

there, all I could see was the images of what I had seen at the match.



In my opinion, the dividing barriers in pens 1-7 should not have been

there and they should be taken out now. Also, I believe the tunnel

leading to pens three and four should never be used again.

I have been shown a map of the Sheffield ground and have put an 'X'
         where I was posted during the match.   I have signed this map (Mkd

                (Exh No      ).

           I am a married man living at the above address with my wife.



           I am employed by




           For the past four years, for larger league games and semi-final

       matches, I have been employed as a temporary Steward by Sheffield

       Wednesday Football Club, Hillsborough.      I receive payment of #9.00 at

       current rates, for working 11 am (1100) till 4.45 pm (1645).        Over

       those four years, I have been engaged on ticket checking on the West

       Stand Seating, working on a gangway.



       The job entails checking that each supporter has a ticket, check for

       forged tickets, and to direct to seats.



       I have not received any form of training, only verbal instructions

       from                      the Chief Steward for the West Stand.     We

       receive our instructions at each match when we report for duty.
I work with one experienced regular Steward.



I have received a basic knowledge of first aid at my firm, as part of

my training some eight years ago.



On Saturday, 15 April 1989 (150489), I was to work at the ground as a

temporary Steward, and at about 10.45 am (1045), my brother,

who was also working the match, picked me up from home and drove to

the Gate Public House, where he parked the car.    We then walked to

the ground via Leppings Lane.



As we neared the ground, near to the Chip Shop, a Liverpool man, well

at least he had a Liverpool accent, said to us, "Are you alright for

tickets?"   We said that we didn't need them, and that was it.    I

assumed he was a tout, selling tickets.



We carried onto the ground and in via C Gate, after showing our

passes at the door.   On entering, we saw our father who gave us our

yellow stewards' bibs, and told us our post and instructions.



I was posted to 'W' Gangway, West Stand Seating and my father told

me to go up and a regular Steward would be up.



I went upto 'W' Gangway, as shown on the photocopy plan (Ref      |)

(Ex No      ), and waited for the other Steward.   At this time the

ground was closed and en route I'd only seen a few supporters in

Leppings Lane area.
After about 20 minutes, a Steward who introduced himself as

arrived.   He repeated ray father's instructions and pointed out the

various seats which I already knew.



The ground was due to open at midday (1200), but just before I did see

a small number of fans in the standing area below in Pen 3.



From midday (1200) to about 1.45 pm/2 pm (1345) (1400), we had a

steady trickle, but then it began to build up to around 2.15/2.30 pm

(1415) (1430), when we had large numbers arriving, but it was easy to

cope. At this time I would say that we were only half full in the

seats, but I cannot say about the pens below.   At about 2.45 pm 1445)

there were a slight lull, so I went to the toilet, situated at the

rear of the Stand.    Whilst there I looked out of the window out onto

Leppings Lane.    I could see a thousand or more fans completely filling

the area from the turnstiles back out onto the main road. (Leppings

Lane). They seemed high spirited and waiting to come through.



I returned to my post, and only a few fans were coming into the

seating area.    Just after that there seemed a sudden rush of people

and one fan I asked for his ticket, said that he hadn't got one and

waited into the Stand, brushing past me.   Someone behind in the queue

said that they'd bust the gate, but another fan said, " No, somebody's

opened it," which I took to mean someone in authority.



I went to the stairway to see for myself, and on looking out saw loads

of fans surging through C Gate which was open completely.   I also saw

fans climbing over the walls adjoining the turnstiles.   I returned to

my post and carried on with my job.   At that time, it was Impossible
                                                                           4


to check the tickets as seme had them, seme didn't, and seme had full

tickets, having not ccme through the turnstiles (ie. with stubs

attached). Also some had tickets for other areas of the ground.       I

couldn't believe the numbers coming up the stairs, they just flooded

past us, pinning us back against the edge of the gangway.     I was

aware that the match had started and that was probably why they

surged up.



People filled all the seating, steps, gangways, and all round the

back.    There was just no room left, but no one else was arriving.



Due to all the people, I couldn't see the pitch, apart from the goal

posts.     Shortly after that, a Liverpool player, who I believe to

have been BEARDSLEY, hit the bar with a shot or cross.    At this point,

the people round me surged forward, slightly taking me with them, and

I got a view of Pen 3 below to see a large crowd surging forward.     I

was forced back to my original position, losing my view of below.



Things settled and I could now see the perimeter fencing of Pen 3 and

saw people climbing over, taken out by Police via the emergency gate

which was open, and over the fencing.    I thought that they were just

being moved, as perhaps there were too many in there, whereas the two

sides, especially the Vere Road comer, had room.



At this point, I saw players going off the pitch and people on the

pitch, and one flat out but moving.    Then there seemed to be a sudden

surge of people going onto the pitch, some being carried by fans,

Police, Stewards and St John's.    I realised that people had been

injured.    With______ I went to the stairway, where I saw a Steward I
know as        who is a friend of my brother, and we briefly spoke

about what had happened.   Whilst there, two or three Liverpool fans

came up the stairs and one of them was really upset, on the verge of

tears, shouting, "There's people dying down there, what are you

doing?"   I told him, "What can we do, we are going down".



His mate said something like, "You'd better or he's liable to hit

you," and at that the upset fan said, "Yeah, go on."



We went down with some other Stewards, who I don't know, to the

bottom of the stairs where I saw Stewards and a few fans discussing

whet had happened.   I made my way to the other stairway, where I saw

my father talking with a Police Officer.   I could see fans lying, sat

and stood in the courtyard area.   Some were crying, some were

coughing and I saw my brother and another Steward tending another fan

at the bottom of the steps.   He was upset, perhaps winded or

whatever.



I saw one youth, flat out at the front of the steps, who was coughing,

red faced, spluttering, with another youth who was okay.     I offered,

by bending down, an ambulance or first aid, but before I could speak,

his mate told me to, "Fuck off."



My father joined me, and told me he'd got to go to the main office.

I could see and hear fans abusing Police and Stewards, so I said I'd

go with him.   We made our way to the back of Pen 1, which was fairly

empty and out via a gate, manned by a Steward and Policeman, onto the

access road at the rear of the South Stand.
On leaving the gate, I saw a fire engine, ambulances and Firemen,

Ambulance crews, Police Officers & Stewards, all in that area.     I

also saw seme people on stretchers, seme flat out on the ground and

sorre stood up.   Those stood up, appeared injured, holding arms, legs,

stomachs, etc.    I think there were about three stood up.



There were four on the floor with coats over their heads and I

assumed that they were dead.



At this point, it really hit me how serious the whole thing was.       My

father and I just walked to the office in silence.    Dad went to the

office and I waited outside.    After a short while, ray father returned

and we went back to the steps at the rear of the West Stand opposite

'C' Gate.   I could see a few supporters walking round and they were

really quiet, shaking their heads, obviously having now realised the

seriousness of it.



I spoke to ray brother, telling him most of what I'd seen and he told

me he'd seen similar.    My dad went upstairs into the Stand and ray

brother, his friend                 (both Stewards), and I, were all in

a very upset frame of mind.    A Policeman came to us and said that

we'd be better off going home, due to our state, so my brother and

his mates left.    I returned the bibs to the store, found my father,

telling him we were going.    Dad said, "He was staying," and I left.



I also worked the same match last year (1988) (000088) and saw very

little trouble.    That year I did the same job, but I cannot recall

which gangway.    The only problem from that match I can recall, was

forged tickets.
                                                                                7




        I only saw a few fans what I'd call drunk, but seme had been drinking

        but probably more had not.



        Before the game, I did not see any incidents of trouble.



        I would say that this year's match contained a larger volume of

        Liverpool supporters than in 1988 (000088) and more arrived late.



        I do not know whether I will continue to work the matches.



                                                                      SIGNED

DATED: 290489                                                           (SIGNED)



           I am a married man living at the above address with my wife and two

           sons.   I am employed by




           I am a supporter of Sheffield Wednesday Football Club, and for the

       past five years I have been employed by them on a casual basis as a

       Steward.      I work almost every hcrne match, although I work shifts and

       occasionally have to miss a game.      I am paid #6 for each game I work

       and #9 for a semi-final.



       During my time as a steward at Sheffield Wednesday, I have attended

       three Stewards' briefings given at the start of each season, where I

       have been instructed in the use of fire extinguishers and evacuation

       procedures.      The Stewards are also given a briefing by a Police

       Inspector prior to each match.



       On Saturday, 15th April, 1989 (150489), the Semi-Final between

       Liverpool and Notts Forest was to be played at Hillsborough and I was
engaged as a Steward for this match.     I was supposed to be there for

11.00 am (1100) and I actually arrived at about 11.05 am (1105).       I

walked to the ground after leaving heme at about 10.20 am (1020) with

another Steward, Richard BEADSLEY.     The distance from heme to the

ground is about 2-2 1/2 (half) miles, and during the walk I saw only a

couple of car loads of supporters and I don't know which team they

were frcm.



On arrival at the ground, we reported to the Chief Steward in the

snack bar area in the corridor running behind the seats in the West

Stand.   I was then given my yellow Steward's bib and handed my voucher

to the Chief Steward which is a card we sign to say we are at work.

I then went straight to the bottom of the stairway leading to aisles Y

and. Z in the seating area of the West Stand.   Nobody instructed me

to go there, but I am aware that this is one of the positions that is

covered by Stewards who check the tickets of people arriving, and only

allow those with seating tickets to go up the stairs.     I was joined by

                  and                and a temporary Steward whose

surname was             It is usual procedure for the Stewards to make

their way to their usual positions in the ground, as most of us have a

regular place we stand.   I always work in the West Stand, but

sometimes actually in the seating area just assisting people to their

seats.   The Chief Steward and the Senior Steward go round checking

that there are sufficient Stewards in the necessary places, and if

required will move them frcm one place to another.



At about 11.25am (1125), I was stood at the bottom of the stairs

where I have described, when a Police Inspector with a beard, told us

to go to the seats by gangway X in the West Stand, for a briefing, and
when all the West Stand Stewards were assembled, he briefed us on the

colour of the tickets and emergency evacuation procedure.    He took

the names of the two Stewards posted to the two gates situated at

either side of the West Stand leading frcm the front of the seating

area, to the space behind the standing area.    He also reminded us to

tear the corner of the tickets, to prevent fans dropping than over to

others in the standing area who would then be able to use them again

to get to the seats.   The briefing lasted about five or ten minutes,

and I then returned to the bottom of the stairs leading to aisles Y

and Z.   I remained there with the otter Stewards I have named, up

until we went to help on the pitch.



Whilst I was on duty at this post, I obviously had a good view of

the Liverpool fans arriving.   The turnstiles were supposed to open at

midday (1200), but at least one of them was open when we came down

from our briefing at about 11.35 am (1135), because people had

started arriving as we got back to our post, although there was only a

few of than.   Throughout the afternoon, obviously more people arrived,

but I can remember thinking that there didn't seem to be as marry fans

arriving as there had at last year's Semi-Final.



The general behaviour of the Liverpool supporters as they came in,

was good.   There were a few who gave us verbal abuse when we would

not allow them upto the seating area without the correct ticket, but

that is not unusual.



It was only when the crowds suddenly surged through gate 'C', that

the trouble started.   Prior to this, I had not seen anybody who I

could say was drunk or disorderly.    Obviously some of them had been
                                                                            4


drinking and were rowdy, but that is quite normal.



I cannot be sure of the time when the first crowds of people came

surging in frcm Gate 'C', except to say it was between 14.40 hours

(1440) and 1500 hours (1500).     I did not physically see the gate

opened, but I was suddenly aware of hundreds of supporters rushing

towards me.   Seme were running, but it was just a mass of people

coming from the direction of gate 'C'. Together with other Stewards,

I attempted to close the metal gate across the entrance to the stairs

where I was standing, but was unable to do so.     Approximately 50-100

supporters managed to get past us.     I was on the stairway side of the

gate, and as we were trying to pull the gates inwards towards us, the

supporters on the other side were pulling than open.     As they rushed

past me, I was actually pinned to the side wall of the stairway,

although I was not injured.     This seemed to go on for about a minute,

and then we managed to get the gates closed and put the bolt across.

Everything then seemed to quieten down again, and so we opened the

gates again to allow ticket holders through.     After approximately two

minutes, there was another surge of supporters frcm gate 'C' again.

There was hundreds of than.     I cannot be more accurate.   Again we

tried to close the gates, but about the same number of supporters as

before (50-100), managed to get in and past us, until we eventually

got the gates closed.



As I have said I did not see gate 'C' actually opened or closed and I

don't know who opened it.     I know one of the Stewards manning the gate

was Richard BEADSLEY.   I don't know any of the Police Officers who
I was not aware when the match kicked-off, so I cannot be very

precise on times.     The first thing I knew was when a Liverpool Steward

who appeared to be in charge, told me there was trouble in the

standing area and asked me where the Chief Steward was.     I was unable

to tell him, so he asked me how he could get out onto the pitch so I

took him into the South Stand area and down onto the pitch.        We

crossed from the West to the South Stand through a gate situated just

to the rear of the Police Control Box.     This gate was being manned by

a Steward, so I showed him my pass and he allowed us through.



The first thing I saw was lots of people, I can't say how many, lying

on the pitch near to the West Stand and propped up against advertising

boards along the side of the pitch.     There were already Police Officers

and St John's people, together with Liverpool supporters, carrying out

first aid and trying to comfort people.     At one stage I saw a

Policeman giving mouth-to-mouth resuscitation to a teenager or youth

in his early twenties who was lying in the goal-mouth area and a

Liverpool supporter was shouting and swearing and saying, "It's your

fault," to the Policeman, although I didn't see him physically attack

or touch the officer.     It was only at this stage that I realised how

serious the incident was, although I still didn't appreciate people

were dead.



At one point, I was assisting to get injured supporters out of Pen 2

and onto the pitch.     Seme of them were unconscious and were being

passed through by both fans and the Police.     I helped to get a girl

out of Pen 2 who I think was dead.    She was white, aged about 17-20

yrs.   All I can say is she had blue denim jeans on, a light coloured

shirt-type blouse and a fawn coloured tweedy sports jacket.     I also
comforted a Liverpool fan who was hysterical and crying.       I took a

small lad who told me his name was           ind had lost his uncle to

the Police roan.



The reaction of the Liverpool supporters on the pitch was very mixed.

Sore of them were very distressed and crying, obviously shocked, and

others were angry.    I heard a number of them shout that it was the

Police's fault, and others were blaming Stewards, but I was not

threatened or abused by any of them.     At one point, they were going to

have a go at the Notts Forest fans, and the Police had to form a line

across the centre of the pitch to prevent this.      I remember carrying a

man who was dead across the pitch on an advertising board towards the

Gymnasium where they were taking the bodies.      I didn't actually go

into the Gym.   I left him on the pitch nearby.



The injured people were being taken to the rear of the North Stand.

I would not describe the actions of people assisting as co-ordinated.

Everybody was just doing the best they could, and seemed to be acting

of their own initiative.    I did not receive any specific instructions

from anyone.



As far as the Police are concerned, the Constables themselves were

doing a tremendous job, but I was surprised that there was no Senior

Officers around to give instructions. The highest rank I saw was a

Sergeant. The only place I could see an Inspector was organising the

line of Police across the centre, and, in my opinion, this should not

have taken priority over getting injured people to safety.



I cannot recall anything else I consider im p o r ta n t, and I left the
ground at about 4.45 pn (1645).



Further to the above, I can remember just after the first crowd surge

frcm Gate 'C', a man in a green jacket in his late 50's, early

sixties, came up to a Police Constable who was standing by me, and

told him to do something because people were dead in the tunnel.        At

the time we thought he was exaggerating.



There was a PC and a WPC posted with myself and the other Stewards,

but I don't know who they were.



The only announcement I heard over the loudspeaker, was telling people

to be patient and stay where they were until the emergency services

could clear the injured, and that the game had been abandoned.



I noticed that a number of fans had obviously urinated at the back

of the seating area in the West Stand, and the urine was running down

onto people stood in the area beneath the West Stand.     Obviously the

fans should not have been doing this, but they weren't intentionally

urinating on people, it was just running down.



The people who I helped, who were conscious, complained of pain in

their limbs    and chest.   I did not actually give anybody any first

aid.   I was   just generally comforting them.I saw a man in   the crowd

who told me he was a Doctor, and I helped him get onto the pitch so

that he could assist.



There are no other comments I wish to make.     I am obviously very

upset over the disaster, but I do not feel it has affected me too
        badly.

it knowing that if it is tendered in evidence I shall be liable to
prosecution if I have wilfully stated in it anything which I know
to be false or do not believe to be true.


DATED: 300489                                                           (SIGNED)



           I em a married man living at

                    with my wife and four children.   I have attended, as a

       spectator, at Hillsborough Football Ground for over thirty years and

           I have been employed as a steward at the Club for the last four

       years. I was present, in my capacity as a steward, at the Liverpool

       versus Nottingham Forest match on Saturday 15 April 1989 (150489).



       I went to work                              >n the morning of the 15 April

       1989 (150489) and finished at approximately 12.00pm (1200).       I then

       mace my way to Hillsborough Football Ground.       En route to the ground

       I saw a number of football supporters.      They appeared to be well

       behaved, but I did think that there were very few of them in the area,

       considering that a semi-final was taking place.



       When I got to the ground, at about 12.25pn (1225) the turnstiles

       were open, but very few people were entering the ground at this

       stage.      I went straight to see Stuart, the Chief Steward, and I

       told him that I had arrived.       I then took up my post for the game.
The other stewards had been at the ground at 11.00am (1100), but

because of my work commitments, I had previously arranged with the

Chief Steward to arrive late.



In the four years that I have been a steward, I have attended at the

Annual meeting for stewards which takes place at the beginning of

each season.    At this meeting we are briefed by a fire officer and

Club officials on fire fighting and the Ground Regulations.    This is

a briefing, rather than a training session and as far as being a

steward is concerned, I have received no formal training of any sort

and. I have had no first aid training.



In return for being employed as a steward, I am paid #6 for every

match at which I work.   On the 15 April 1989 (150489) I was wearing

                                                              In

addition, I was wearing a Club identification card and fluorescent

yellow tabbard which bears the logos 'UMBRO' and 'Binghams Window

Systems', who are Club sponsors.



I would describe myself as




I went to my post which was situated in the West Stand in the upper

seating area.   I was posted to gangway W and my instructions were to

check the tickets of people coming into the stand, show people where

their seats are located, and keep the exit area of the landing and

stairs clear of supporters, for safety reasons.
A relief steward was also posted to the gangway with me.      He

introduced himself to me as             I would describe him as a




For the last four seasons I have performed duties as a steward in the

West Stand and I am normally posted to the U, V and W areas of this

stand.    We alternate between being at the bottom of the stairs and

supervising the upstairs gangways in the West Stand.      As I have

previously stated, on the 15 April (150489) I was posted to the

upstairs area W.     I have marked the position I was in, on a map of

the ground.     I produce this map (Ex No     ) (Ref No

handed this map to PC                        of the West Midlands
Police.



I have been informed that in the event of an emergency in the ground,

a iressage will be broadcast over the public address system saying,

"Will Mr MEADOWS please contact the control roam immediately."        if

this message is heard, I have been directed to return to my post and

ensure that the area is clear for exit to be made.



Frcm about 12.30pm (1230) people slowly entered the stand and from

my position, I overlook Pens three and four in the West Stand

terracing.    The people who came into the West Stand were good-

natured, but I did notice that even at 2.15pm (1415) the West Stand

was virtually empty, even in comparison to normal league games.       At

this time only about 500 of the 4,500 seats were filled.    Pens three

ano four at this time were very busy, but this is normal as they are
                                                                          4


situated behind the goal-posts and people seem to favour this

position.   Despite being busy, people were able to move freely within

Pens three and four.    At this time the terraces at the wings were

virtually empty.



People continued to enter the West Stand, however the stream of

people coming in was not very great.    By 2.45pm (1445) the West Stand

seating area was about 90 per cent full, but still the crowd were very

good natured.   At this time Pens three and four were very full,

people could still move about, but it was very busy.    I made comment

to          that people were packing in behind the goals like sardines,

even though you could still see the terracing at each wing of the

West Stand terracing.



The football teams were warming up at this time, but everything

seemed to be progressing reasonably.



At about 2.55pm (1455), just before kick-off, there was a sudden

surge of Supporters.    A group of about fifty Liverpool Supporters

came running up the stairs to the top of gangway W, where I was

standing, and because of the sheer volume of them, I was forcibly

pushed to the right of the gangway, as you look at the pitch, onto the

people who were seated to the right of the gangway.    After I had got

back to the gangway, I presumed that the other entrances had also had

a sudden surge, because the upstairs seating area was more than full

with people sharing seats and standing in the gangways.   Seme people

had waved tickets at me as they ran past, some were for the seats,

but others were obviously tickets for the terracing and some people

dicnt show tickets at all.
At about this time the crowd began to get very noisy and excited as

the match was about to start.      Despite the Stand being overcrowded,

everyone appeared to have found somewhere to settle and there were no

problems of disorder.



After this surge, when everyone settled down, I looked down onto Pens

three and four and it was seething.      There was a lot of pushing and

shoving.    There appeared to be a lot of movement with the crowd

swaying in all directions, but I wouldn't say that the situation was

aggressive.      I thought that people were just trying to get a good

position for the game.      Even at this time, just prior to 3.00pm

(1500), there was obviously plenty of room in the wings of the

terraces.      I then again turned my attentions to the seating area.



A short time after the game had kicked off, there was a second surge

of spectators coming into the seated area of the West Stand.     At this

time the noise was deafening, with the crowds cheering.     This second

surge seemed to consist of a large number of spectators, I don't know

how many, but there appeared to be more than on the first occasion.



This surge was more aggressive and it appeared that they were intent

on seeing the start of the game.     The spectators again threw me to

the side and they filled all of the seats and the gangways

carrpletely.    I had to literally fight my way to the steps and I could

see that the stairwell was also packed solid with spectators trying

to push their way into the Stand.



I pushed my way (town the stairs to the coffee bar which is at the
back of the seats, to try and get some Police assistance, but I

couldn't find a Police Officer anywhere.    The Liverpool fans were

still streaming into the stand.



I fought my way back to my post and someone, I don't know, who said,

"There's trouble down stairs.” I had to lean on two people to look

down into Pens three and four, everyone seemed to be trying to see

whet was happening.



I looked down and saw a lad climbing on the perimeter fence to the

right of the gate on Pen three.   I thought that fighting had broken

out because people were fighting and shoving in pen three.    I

couldn't see Pen four at this stage.    The scene reminded me of crowd

violence I had seen in the seventies.    It was like looking at a tin

of maggots with everyone on top of one another fighting.



At this I again went down to the coffee bar to try and get help.      I

couldn't find anyone so I tried to go back to my post, but more

people blocked the stairs and I couldn't get up.



I then walked towards down towards the stairs which lead out of the

West Stand to the rear of the tunstiles.   I got near to the toilets

behind gangway U and V, when a group of about 6 Liverpool Supporters

carre from nowhere and bundled me into the toilets. They pushed me

against the urinals and pushed my face against a window.   They

screamed abuse at me and were saying things like, "This is a shitty

ground, you can't cope with Liverpool." They screamed abuse at me,

before I managed to push myself off the wall and run out of the

toilets.
As I got out of the toilets, I saw a man against the toilet wall

outside.     He had what appeared to be a leg and an arm injury.    This

mar. was white in his late 50's or early 60's, but I can't really give

a fcetter description of him.    I helped him out of the ground to gate

B.   I then went back up the stairs to the coffee bar area, where I

found a second man who also appeared to have arm and leg injuries.

He was white, in his 40's, about 5'7" tall and I think he had a grey

jacket on.     I helped him to gate B, and en route I was punched in the

back by a large white man, but I can't describe him.



By this time it would be about 3.15pm (1515), and when I reached the

area outside the ground by gate B, I saw about five or six rfcy(=>^gg>H

lined up against the wall by the river and Police Officers were

standing in front of than.



I left the injured man outside gate B and then as I was about to come

back in the ground, by the turnstiles, I saw a Liverpool fan run up

behind a Police Officer and set about him.    He was punching him and

was eventually dragged off by another Liverpool fan.    The scene was

very confused.    It was chaotic with a lot of shouting and abuse

being hurled.    I can't describe anyone I saw as it was absolute

mayhem.



I then leaned against a barrier.    I felt absolutely sick.   As I was

doing this a Police Officer came over to me and told me to take iry

tatbard off as I was 'sitting duck.' All I can say is that the

Police Officer was a lot taller than me.    I think he was the same one

I saw being attacked.    The same officer told me to go and tell the
other stewards to take their vests off because of the aggravation.



I took ny vest off, but I was wearing ny identification badge.       I

wert to find the other stewards and I told them to take their vests

off. A Liverpool fan came up to us, showed us his ticket, and said he

had arrived late and as he walked to the ground he was let in without

shewing his ticket; he was very angry.     This man had a pale grey

jacket.     He was white and in his fifties; he was very irate.



After this I helped the Police move people to try and get ambulances

through, I then went back to the rear of the West Stand and told more

stewards to take their jackets off.     Someone then told us that the

coffee bar in the West Stand was being looted.    At this the Chief

Steward, Stuart, came up to us and said he had handed his radio and

tabbard in because of the hassle he was getting.     He went up to the

coffee bar, and when he came back, he said he had got his jacket off

sar.eone who had stolen it.    I asked him what we were supposed to do.

He said, "I haven't got a clue".



I then walked round towards pen one to try and see what was

happening.    As I got to the side of the stand I was showered with

glass from windows which were being smashed in the stand.     I couldn't

see anything as it was mayhem.



I then again walked to the rear of the ground and joined other

stewards.    The police were trying to clear the area, but by this

stage, I was completely shocked and I can't remember a lot about what

happened.
When I realised the game was going to abandoned, I just walked out of

the ground, drove hone and then I just sat at hone all evening.          From

the time I left the ground, I don't recall anything as I was

corrpletely numb.



I have thought a lot about what has happened since and I feel that

the Police Officers didn't appear have any direction.       There also

appeared to be less Police on duty than at previous semi-finals.

A 5 far as the stewards are concerned, we were given no instructions

about what was happening and had to rely on our own initiative.



I just feel that the wrong gate was opened to let the people into the

ground and that there should have been more signs directing people to

the standing areas at each side of the stand.       I feel quite strongly

about this, as the question of signs has been brought to the attention

of the Head Steward at our Annual meetings, but it just seems to fall

on deaf ears.



Since the game I saw a gateman called Jack, who is in his mid 30's

anc. who is always on gate C.    He told me that he was present when the

gate was opened.



About 2 days after the game I returned to the ground.       It was

Wednesday 19th A p r i l 1989 (190489).   At the ground I saw a member of

the stewarding staff who is known as

                                                                       He
was bragging about being on C gate and he didn't appear upset.       He

was just proud of having been there.      He seemed to have not been

affected by what he had seen.

DATED: 300489                                                             (SIGNED)



           I am a married man with three children and have lived at the above

           address for the past two years.     I've lived in Sheffield for the past

           thirty years and I am currently employed as

                                                      a post which I've held for

           the past six years.



           Fran 1978 (000078) until 1985 (000085) I was employed as a part-time

           Steward at the Hillsborough Football Ground, heme of Sheffield

       Wednesday PC, and following a break of two years, when I was working

           in Bristol,   i resumed the position as steward at the ground fran 1987

           (000087) onwards.                Albert Ronald MARSH, has been a part-

           time Steward at the ground for the past seventeen years, as well as

                                                 I think he's been a Steward there

           for about eight or nine years.



           I'm a Sheffield Wednesday supporter and have travelled to many grounds

       all over the country to watch them play.
Accordingly, in the time I've been a Steward at the ground, I haven't

experienced a n y problems involving crowd disorder, pitch invasion or

general problems with administering the matches.



On match days my posting at the ground is usually on the stairway

leading to the seated area on the West Stand.     The access area to the

stairway is approximately 12' x 12', with two blue metal barred gates

which can be closed manually.     My duty is to stand on the inside of

the gates, and man it in accordance with the Judge POPPLEWELL

guidelines after the Heysel Disaster.    We usually work on a rota of

7 1/2 (half) minutes between 6 Stewards.



Normally on league games involving the Club, no access is given to

fans, as the stairway at the other end of the West Stand is used for

seating spectators to use the stand.    However, on big games like the

semi-final both entrances to stairways which lead into the West Stand

are used, as indicated on the plan drawing of the ground, a copy of

which is shown to me by the officer (Exh No             ) (    1 ref).



The West Stand holds 7,000 seated and 8,000 standing supporters, and

is generally referred to as the Leppings Lane end.    On normal games,

referring to the plan drawing, fans come in off Leppings Lane through

the main gates and through turnstiles 1-16 at A, for access to the

seated West stand and through turnstiles A-G at B, for access to the

standing area below West Stand.    Between A and B there is a fifteen

foot tall brick wall, with a blue metal gate set in the wall.    There

are usually two Police Officers and a Steward.    As stated already, on

league games at the ground, I don't have any contact with the fans

regarding ticket collections.
                                                                          3




However, on semi-final days the system is altered regarding

availability of turnstiles and access to the West Stand.    The gate

in the wall that separates blocks A and B in relation to the plan is

left open.    The entrance to the stairway that I visually man on the

block B, A-G turnstiles section on the South Stand side of the West

Stand is vised to allow fans into the seated area of the West Stand.

Hence people could vise both turnstiles to get to the West Stand for

either standing or seating requirements.    Access to the standing area

on the West Stand is via the sole tunnel in the middle of the West

Stand block on the A-G tumstile-side of the dividing wall.     The

other access points to the standing area are via the sides of the

West Stand.   As far as I'm aware, the tunnel on the Stand allows

access to sections 3 and 4, as pointed on the drawing, and access to

sections 1, 2, 5, 6 and 7, is by going around the sides of the Stand.



The FA Cup Semi-Final game at Hillsborough on Saturday 15 April 1989

(150489), between Liverpool and Nottingham Forest was designated an

all-ticket game.   As the stairway entrance on the south side of the

West stand was to be used for spectator access, I was on duty to

collect the tickets and the access system to the West Stand for big

games was adopted for this particular semi-final.    The method for

ticket identification was purple tickets for stands and red for seats.

The perforated slip on the ticket is ripped off at whatever turnstile

the spectator enters the courtyard by, and then my job is to inspect

the red seating ticket at my stairway entrance on the south end of the

West Stand and physically tear a piece of the ticket off, before

allowing access to the seating area.    This is purely to counter any

attempt by fans passing seating tickets from the seated area to the
standing area fans, in order to get into a seat.     In effect, the

seated fans should be left with a red ticket, with a piece t o m off,

together with the perforated slip missing.



On the match day for this Semi-Final, there were a total of nineteen

stewards on duty in the turnstile and courtyard area of this Leppings

Lane end of the ground.     There were 10 to 12 Police Officers doing a

cordo search on the inside of the A-G turnstiles.     I can remember if

there were any other Police on the 1-16 turnstile side.    Obviously

there were quite a lot more Police than usual, due to the size of the

game.



As well as the additional Stewards on duty at the ground, there were

some Liverpool FC Stewards at the ground.     I saw them, but I'm sure

there were none.   They wore bright orange bibs as opposed to our

yellow ones.   They introduced themselves to vis and floated around the

stand from post to post.



The crowd capacity at the ground is 54,000 and the tickets had been

sold.   As far as I know Liverpool were given 19,500 and Forest 25,000,

so we were expecting obviously 19,500 Liverpool supporters, with

15,000 in the West Stand.



Before the day I didn't anticipate any problems, as the previous

years' semi-final between these teams had gone off very well.     In

fact, there had been no problem at all in 1988 (000088) and the

organisation was maintained for the 1989 (000089) Semi-Final.



At 11.15 am (1115) on Saturday 15 April 89 (150489), I arrived at the
ground with                   and went in through the blue concertina

metal door as at B on the plan.     There's a second concertina metal

blue door as at C on the plan.     These gates are actually separated by

the A-G turnstile block.     They separate in the centre only and pull

to either side.     However, the centre connection can only be split from

the inside.     We went into the right flight of stairs into the West

Stand, checking in with the Steward at the coffee bar.     After

collecting my Steward's bib, I went down to the bottom of the stairs

and assumed my post.



Prior to this, at about 11.20 am (1120), we were all given a five

minute briefing by a senior Police Officer - I didn't know his name,

but he's got a black beard and is always there for all the hone

games.



As far as I can remember the gates opened at about 11.45 am (1145) or

12.00 pm (1200) up until 1.00 pm (1300).     The Liverpool fans coming

in by the two sets of turnstiles were arriving in small groups and

were making their way into the Stand in an orderly manner.     The

hundreds of fans who arrived in the first hour were mostly the family

groups, young children with fathers, and the people decked in rosettes

and generally in good spirits.     They were evenly distributed between

seating and standing.     I couldn't really tell if the standing fans had

gained access to the West Stand via the tunnel or around the sides of

the stand.     None of the people who came in the first hour had been

drinking, and the demeanour of them was very good and well ordered.



In fact, the first load was a lot quieter than we had actually

anticipated.
                                                                          6




At 1.30 pm (1330) I directed a woman from the stairway through the

gate in dividing wall and around to the elevated stand at section

7 on the plan, as she wanted a better view.



At 1.50 pm (1350) one Liverpool fan with a standing ticket, managed to

run past vis and up      the stairs.   He was caught at the   top by      one ofthe

temporary Stewards and with the help of the Policeman there was sent

back to the courtyard.



From 2.00 pm (1400) onwards the crowd situation became more like one

at any semi-final, by way of the size and general pressure of people

coming though the turnstiles.



However, at about 2.20 pm (1420), I saw one youth in a blue jumper

standing on top of       the turnstile block A-G for about    five minutes,

appearing to call to his friends to join him.    The turnstile block is

about 15-20 feet tall.   This Liverpool fan in the blue jumper was

then joined by about 10-12 fans in a matter of moments.



At this time the crowd in the courtyard was large, packing the actual

courtyard, but I couldn't see out into the outside of the turnstiles.

However, I can only assume that there were thousands still outside

there.



The fans on the roof of the turnstiles jumped onto the ground

gradually and were soon surrounded by the cordon of Police.

Within minutes, the blue metal concertina door opened by about 6

feet in the middle at position C on the plan - that's the door to the
                                                                            7


left of the turnstiles A-G which the fans had jumped off, as I

looked from the West Stand out into Leppings Lane.      I didn't see who

opened it or if anyone left via the door, as more than one hundred

people surged through the door and pushed into the courtyard, and

passed me and the       six other Stewards, plus        the LiverpoolStewards,

and up the stairs to the Stand.    We couldn't do anything to step this

surge as we were virtually knocked of our feet.



I then saw the same door C close again.    Again, I didn't see who

closed it or how it had been closed.     This      surge was somewhere in the

region of 2.40 pm       (1440) - 2.50 pm (1450).



Then about 5-10 minutes later I saw the same door at position C spring

open.   Each sliding section of the concertina door swung all the way

back.   Then literally, thousands came throughthe open doorway in a

massive surge, something like the start to the London Marathon.       By

then the courtyard was full anyway and this surge just pushed people

in all directions.   Again, I didn't see who opened the door, as I was

pinned to the inside of the flight of stairs as hundreds of Liverpool

fans charged up the stairway.     I was terrified the Liverpool fans were

even ignoring their own Steward.    They were shouting, "Get out my

fucking way." I was extremely frightened.



My attention was focused on the fans who were charging towards us in

the stairway ,and I couldn't really see into the tunnel or to the

other end of the courtyard.



In a few minutes, the second gigantic surge died off.     I lost track of

what was going on around me in those few minutes and couldn't really
see if the doors had been closedagain, or if people were still coning

in; it was all a blurr.



All of a sudden my attention was caught by a middle-aged man with a

grey jacket, with a Liverpool accent who came running down the stairs,

asking me to take him onto the pitch.    He said that he was a Red Cross

trained worker.    I didn't question him as to why, but took him round

to the separation gate near to turnstiles 19-22, and we both went onto

the pitch itself via the open seats and perimeter wall.    By then it

was about 3.10 pn (1510).    As I came onto the pitch, the sight I

confronted was a terrible shock.    I saw people Police Officers and

Ambulance staff running around the West Stand end of the ground.     Seme

were carrying hoarding boards as stretchers.    There were people lying

on the turf near the goal-mouth. The players and officials had left

the pitch.   Seme people were crying. It hadn't registered with me as

to what had happened.    It looked like a pitch invasion, but it soon

dawned on me that the situation was a lot more serious.



I went with the Red Cross man to the penalty area on the pitch and

helped him, together with others, to carry a youth off on a make-shift

stretcher - the youth was unconscious - I couldn't tell whether he was

dead or alive.    His body was limp and I didn't really want to look.

We carried him towards the North Stand and put him down on the pitch

by the half-way line near a group of St John's Ambulance workers.

Then I left and walked back towards the penalty area on my own.



By then I was slightly dazed; thoughts of clearing the pitch to start

the match were even running through my mind.   By the half-way line I

saw bodies lying prostrate on the pitch, covered from head to toe in
anoraks and items of clothing.     I presumed they were dead.   One body

that was carried past me in someone's arms.     It was a man staggering

past, holding the body of a young child.     The child's face was blue.

Again, I presumed he was dead.



People were crying and shouting for each other.     By this stage the

full force of the situation was soaking in.



I saw one lad lying on the pitch, with his head being cradled by

another lad of about the same age, about 22 or 23 years old.



The one cradling him, asked if there was any water, so I made my way

towards the players' tunnel.



Another youth asked me if there was a telephone.     I took him with me

towards the players' tunnel.     He said that his friend had died and

that the friend had a wife and two kids.    We both went up the tunnel

and found a room for him to phone from.    I eventually found a bucket

and took it back to the youth cradling his friend.    The youth lying

down was conscious and kept saying that he couldn't move his legs.



From then until about 4.30 pn (1630), I walked around the eighteen

yard line area of the pitch at the West Stand with the bucket of

water, handing it to anyone who required a drink.



People were distressed and crying, looking for friends.    There were

more people on the pitch covered in coats and blankets.    Again, I

presumed them to be dead.
From the pitch I saw two Liverpool fans actually fighting in the West

Stand seated area above section 3 and a Policeman had to walk from

above section 1 in the seated area, to separate them.     There were

still people hanging around on the pitch who were drunk, as well as

those who were suffering from shock.



I picked some items of clothing off the pitch, including an

expensive brown leather jacket which I left up in the players'

tunnel.    From the opposite end of the ground, the Nottingham Forest

fans started to chant at the Liverpool fans at about 3.30 pn (1530),

and some of the Liverpool fans on the pitch started to make their way

towards the Spion Kop end, but they didn't succeed as the Police had

managed to place a cordon across the middle of the pitch.



The Police on the pitch were receiving a lot of verbal aggression

from the Liverpool fans on the pitch.   The two main themes of the

abuse were the ticket allocation and the loss of control by the

Police actually in Leppings Lane.



By about 4.30 pm (1630) the West Stand seated area had emptied, but I

can't remember if the standing pens had emptied or not.



I then left and met up with                        by the South end of

the West Stand.   There were already a number of Stewards there.



         said, "Get your jacket off." He was very distressed and

shocked              said that there were dead bodies behind the wall

by door C on the outside.   I'm not sure what he meant; he was very

upset.
                                                                                11




        I also want to add that before the first surge of fans through the

        door, and at 2.25 pm (1425), I saw a group of 6-8 Liverpool fans who

       were visibly drunk and abusive, stumble towards the tunnel into the

        standing section.   They were very boisterous.   By then it was starting

        to get busy and I'm most surprised that the Police didn't step them as

        the Police had their hands full by then.



        Again, there was no physical sign or anything to direct standing

        supporters around the sides of the West Stand, to get in by the north

        and south sides of the West Stand block.   Accordingly, people caning

        in, especially in the two surges, headed straight for the tunnel and

        my doorway.

DATED: 290489                                                          (SIGNED)



       On Saturday 15 April 1989 (150489), I was employed as a steward at

       Hillsborough Football Ground.      The match due to be played was between

       Liverpool and Nottingham Forest.



           I arrived at the ground around 11.15 am (1115).



       At around 11.30 am (1130), all the stewards on duty were briefed by a

       uniform Police Officer.     At this briefing we were asked to keep the

       crowd in control and we were also told about the evacuation

       procedure.



       My specific post for the match was the stairs leading up into the

       seating area of the West Stand.     These stairs were on the left-hand

       side of the West Stand looking from the Leppings Lane entrance.      My

       job, with four other stewards who were, 1)                    2) |

       ________ v 3)            4) Not sure, was to check and rip off the

       corner of spectators seating tickets for the seating area. None of the

       stewards at this post were issued with radios or any other form of
                                                                             2


corrmunication.



As stated before, the instructions given to us with dealing with

emergency situations at the ground are that on hearing the code word,

 "Mr MEADOWS,", with the other stewards on this post, we're to go to

the bottom of the steps and ensure that the exit gates were open.



As part of my job, if spectators attempted to get into the seating

area without tickets, we were to direct them to pens six and seven. On

the day in question, I did not eject any visiting supporter from the

ground, nor did I see any alcohol being consumed or being brought into

the ground.   I did not witness any problems outside the Leppings Lane

entrance as this area was not visible to me but I did see a large

nurrber of approximately 30 Liverpool fans, climbing over the

turnstiles' wall.     At about 2.55 pm (1455), I saw a mass of people

rushing towards us.     They had all come through gate 'C' which I could

now see had been opened.     I did not see anyone open the gate.   A large

nunber of these people attempted to gain access to the seating area

and, in doing so, pushed me and my other stewards up the stairs with

than.   There was no way we could stop them and I think about a couple

of hundred went past us.    I do not know how gate 'C' came to be opened

but two stewards, 1)                    |id 2)          were on duty at
this gate.



At no time whilst on duty did I see any person die but I did see a

nurrber of bodies being laid down near to the river's edge.   The only

thing I saw I believe was a factor in the deaths and injuries nanscxj

on this day was the rush of Liverpool supporters that come through

gate 'C' and the fact that a large number of fans had left it very
        late to get into the ground and that a large number had been drinking

        alcohol.



        The position of steward at Hillsborough Ground I have held for the

        past 20 years and never, in all those years, seen anything like this.

DATED: 010589                                                          (SIGNED)



           I em employed on a temporary basis by Sheffield Wednesday PC as a

           steward at their football ground.   On Saturday 15 April 1989

           (150489), which was the Semi Final match between Liverpool and

        Nottingham Forest FC, I was on duty.



        I got to the ground at 11am (1100) and shortly after I was briefed

        with the other stewards by a Police Officer.    He went through the

        emergency evacuation procedure and also told us to be on the look out

        for forged tickets.



        My post for the match was at the bottom of the steps that give access

        to the seating area in the West Stand.     I was on the left hand side

        of the stand as you look from Leppings Lane.    I was with four other

        stewards whose names I do not know.



        I took up my post at about 11.30am (1130) and the turnstiles were

        opened at about 12 midday (1200).
                                                                          2


My duty as was the other four stewards on our post was to inspect

the tickets of the Liverpool fans, wanting to gain access to the

stend to ensure they had the correct tickets allowing them access if

they did I tore a corner off the ticket, so that the ticket could not

be used again and allowed them access.



There was a steady stream of fans caning into the ground and I did

not notice anything out of the ordinary until about 2.30pm (1430)

when I saw a number of Liverpool fans gaining access to the ground by

climbing over the wall and onto the roofs of the Lepping Lane

turnstiles.   The police tried to stop these fans but due to the number

coning over the wall they had little success.   This carried on for

about 30 minutes, during this time there was a large number of fans

caning into the ground, by legal and illegal means.



Although I could not see what was going on outside of the Leppings Ln

end. turnstiles, due to the noise outside, I could tell that there were

a great number of people still outside the ground and just after 3pm

(1500).   When the game had started, I saw a mass of Liverpool fans

just rushing towards us.   At this time I did not know how they had got

into the ground, but I knew that they had not come through the

turnstiles because of the vast number.



As they got to us they just pushed us to one side up the steps, a

Policeman and a Woman Police Constable who were with us told us to

let them go as there was no way we could stop them.   I am not sure

how many came past us but at least one hundred did and I have no

if any of these fans had tickets.
 ^      During the time I spent on the post I noticed that the majority of

        the Liverpool fans had been drinking, some heavily, this was apparent

        due to their behaviour and the fact that they smelt of alcohol.



        The first thing I knew about the disaster was when Liverpool

        supporters came to us from the direction of the tunnel under the

        stand asking us where the First Aid post was.



        The atmosphere turned very nasty with some of the Liverpool

        supporters blaming us for what had happened and I and the other

        stewards took our reflective jackets off so that they could not

        identify us.    I saw one Liverpool fan assault one of the stewards,

        this took place outside of the ground by the river Don where the

        bodies of the deceased were laid.    I do not know who the steward was.



        I did not see gate 'C' being opened but after the disaster I saw

        that gate 'C' was open.




                                                                       SIGNED

           I reside at the above address with my wife and two children, aged

           7 years and 4 years.   I have lived at this address for 11 years.



           I am employed as a

                       I have worked there for 7 years.



           I have supported Sheffield Wednesday Football team for about 30 years

          and. have been a regular attendant at home and away games.



          In November 1988 (001188), I became a Steward at Sheffield Wednesday

          Football Club.   Since becoming a Steward I have worked every home

          garre but one.   I am paid #6.00 per game.



          When becoming a Steward for the Club I had to take a passport

          photograph which was inserted into an identity tag stating my post,

          West Stand, and name, which I have to display on the front of my

          yellow steward's jacket.   I was told that my post would be in the

          West Stand and could have duties at any position in the West Stand.
Because I started as a Steward mid-season, I received no training at

all.   At the start of the season, stewards can attend a meeting on a

voluntary basis involving emergency services and evacuation procedures



I was told that if a certain message came over the loudspeaker from

the Police Control Rexam, it was a signal to assist spectators to

leave the ground by directing then to the exit gates.    This message

would be, "Mr MEADOWS is wanted at Police Control."



I have not received any first aid training.



Since becoming a steward at the Club, my post has been at the North

End of the West Stand seating area, either at the bottom of the

stairway leading to the gangways, at the rear of the West Stand

leading into the seating area, or at the top of the gangways U to Z

in the stand itself.



On arrival at the football ground for steward duties, I report to the

Chief Steward in the corridor at the back of the West Stand, to

collect my yellow jacket and receive any change in my normal posting,

and to hand over my attendance record card for my pay.



On Saturday 15th April 1989 (150489), I was on duty for the Liverpool

v Nottingham Forest Semi-Final match.



I attended the West Stand at 11.30 (1130), normally my tour of duty

would be two hours before kick off till the end of the game.

However, due to it being a semi final, we were instructed to attend

between 11.00 am (1100) and 11.30 am (1130).
I reported to the Chief Steward who I only know as Stewart.       I was

told my post was, as normal, at the bottom of the stairway at the

North End of the West Stand in the enclosure behind turnstiles 1-16.

I was handed my yellow coat, put on my identity card, and went to my

poet.    The only instruction I was given was to tear off the right-

hard top corner of the supporters' tickets as they entered the

stairway to the stand.



I have marked on a plan of the stadium shown to me by PC

           r with a red dot, my post.     I can produce the plan (Pef     )

(Ex No           )



With me at this post was                 together with

and one other.       I can't remember his name or the surname of the

others. A11 of us were wearing our yellow jackets and displaying our

identity cards.



Frcm my position I have a view of the turnstiles at Leppings Lane,

1-16, Gate B, the Portacabin next to Gate B, the wall separating the

enclosures at the rear of all turnstiles and gates at Leppings Lane

entrance, the 6' wide gateway in this wall next to the Portacabin

(marked on plan), the top 2 feet of Gate C which I can see by

locking over the wall I just described, and the North End of the

enclosures leading to the North Stand and comer terrace.



My particular duty for the day was to check supporters' tickets

before they entered the stairway to the seating area of the West

Stand, to ensure they were entitled to go there and to assist any
supporter with directions to areas allocated by their tickets.

Other general duties would be to inform the Police of any disorderly

behaviour of fans, but not to get physically or verbally involved

myself, assist supporters with directions to facilities within the

stadium, if I felt they needed to go there or were entitled, and to

assist emergency services if required.



I did not have any other verbal or written instructions for this

particular match.   I am not issued with any form of communication

equipment, neither were the other Stewards posted with me.



From my position, I do not have a view of the tunnel leading from the

enclosure behind turnstiles A/G and Gate C into Pens 3 and 4 due to

the 8' to 9' wall I marked on the plan.



It was about 12.30 pm (1230) to 1.00 pm (1300) when the turnstiles

opened leading into my enclosure and only a few supporters came in

and started milling around in the enclosure, getting programmes.     It

didn't get very busy until about 2.00 pm (1400), when a steady stream

of Liverpool supporters came through the turnstiles.    Gates A-C were

closed.   The enclosure was quite crowded, but there was still plenty

of rocm for supporters to move around.    At this time I was kept busy

by the supporters entering the stairway into the West Stand.



At about 2.40 pm (1440) - 2.45 pm (1445), I noticed that there were

two Liverpool supporters standing on the roof of the turnstiles in the

row- 1-16, right next to Gate B.   There were about 10-12 Police

Officers checking the supporters as they came through the turnstiles.

I don't know whether they persuaded them to get down, but one of them
junped down into the enclosure where the Police were.    The other sat

on the wall above the turnstile roof adjacent to Gate B, looking into

Leppings Lane.     I carried on checking tickets and, when I next looked

a few minutes later, there were a dozen supporters on the roof of

turnstiles A/G and 1-16 and one on the roof of the Portacabin adjacent

to Gate B.   I continued checking tickets.



Abcut 2.50 pn (1450) - 2.55 pn (1455), one of the stewards with me,

whc was standing on the stairway approx 3 steps up and facing the

enclosure, informed me that Gate C was opening.



I looked round and, above the dividing wall I marked on the plan, I

could see the top 2 feet of Gate C opening.    A lot of supporters

caire through the gate in the dividing wall.   Seme were running and

others walking quickly.    It very quickly became crowded at the

stairway and a slight crush was developing but the Woman Police

Constable and Police Constable who were standing four or five steps

up the stairway, shouted down to the supporters to slow down.      They

slewed down slightly but, as they were going up the stairway, they

were shoulder to shoulder and close together, one behind the other,

bustling each other up the stairway.    A small crowd waiting to get up

the staxrway was developing but not a tightly packed crowd.      I was

still asking to see tickets and the supporters were showing them to

me.   However, it is possible, due to the amount of people who

suddenly surged up the stairway, that seme supporters did get through

without tickets.



It was only a few minutes after this sudden influx of supporters, I

saw that Gate B had opened and supporters were coming through.     There
                                                                             6

seemed to be less coming towards the stairway when this gate was

opened than when Gate C had been opened, but I didn't pay much

attention, because I was still very busy checking tickets, but then it

became very crowded and the supporters were building up in numbers at

the bottom of the stairway, and the stairway itself was very packed

with supporters bustling upwards.     I was becoming fearful for my own

safety, worried about being crushed.     My colleagues voiced their fear

likewise and we moved out of the way, no longer asking to see tickets,

and the crowd quickly disappeared up the stairway.     The Policewoman

and Policeman had gone up the stairs to the landing, about 20 steps

up.



Although the supporters were rushing to get up the stairway, there

was no fighting, but a general pushing and shoving of each other to

get up the stairway quickly.     I didn't see anyone fall over.    The

enclosure on my side quickly cleared, with only the odd few

supporters milling about, unsure of where to go.



I looked at my watch, and it was 3 minutes past 3 (1503).     I asked

one of the other Stewards if the match had started because I hadn't

heard the usual roar when a semi-final or big match starts, but he

didn't know.



I then heard semething spoken over the loudspeakers but I couldn't

make out what it was.     I looted over towards the turnstiles 1-16 and

saw about 30-40 Police Officers running from the turnstiles through

the gate in the enclosure dividing wall marked on the plan.       I didn't

knew what was going on.
Almost immediately a few supporters came through the gate in the

dividing wall and into our enclosure, holding their arms and chests,

as if in pain.    One supporter came over to me and asked me where

St John's Ambulance was.    I pointed him in the direction of the gate

manned by another Steward leading from the enclosure to the walkway

leading to the back of the North Stand.    He said he'd hurt his arm

but not how.



I then noticed that more and more supporters were walking through the

gate in the dividing wall, seme of whom were crying.



Four youths came through carrying a fifth youth in a seated position

on their arms.    He was slumped and appeared unconscious.     His facial

colour appeared normal to me and didn't cross my mind that it was

anything more serious.    They shouted, "We want seme help."    They

shouted, "We want seme St John's Ambulance." I realised that it was

serious so I looked around the enclosure for any Police but couldn't

see any, so I ran up the stairway into the corridor at the rear of the

West Stand.    I saw a Police Inspector standing in the corridor near

to W or X gangway, using his radio.   I told him of the situation

below and asked if he could get seme St John's Ambulance there.        He

told me there was an ambulance on its way.     I can't remember what the

Inspector looked like.   He came back down with me, using radio as he

did, but I couldn't hear what he was saying.    As we got to the bottom

of the stairway I saw that an ambulance was parked outside Gate B.



The enclosure was littered with people sitting against walls, crying,

and seme apparently injured.   I didn't see anyone that looked

seriously injured.   I saw about three people lying alongside the
ambulance about 20 yards from me, outside Gate B, being seen to by

people who I don't recall were wearing a uniform.     I couldn't tell

how’ seriously injured they were.    As far as I can remember they were

moving.     I can't describe the people that were lying by the

ambulance.



I approached a number of people to try and find out what was

happening because we still had no idea of the seriousness or how it

had happened.



By this time supporters were becoming angry and shouting at us that

it was our fault.     They were obviously extremely distressed and seme

were shouting abuse at us and crying at the same time.    Listening to

the supporters, it became clear that people had been crushed and it

was very serious.     Because of the attitude of the supporters towards

us, we took off our yellow jackets and put them in our pockets. No

one actually threatened me or attacked me and I wasn't fearful of

being attacked.     I took off my jacket on the advice of one of my

colleagues; I can't remember which one.



I was talking to seme of the supporters about what had happened.      I

think this would be about 3.20 pn (1520), when a number of firemen

ran in through Gate B and shouted, generally, "How do we get onto the

pitch?"    Something distracted me, when I looked back the firemen had

gone.     I didn't see which way.



One of the Stewards, I can't remember who, told myself and my

colleagues that he had spoken to the Chief Steward and we were free

to go.    This would be about 4.00 pn (1600).
                                                                                 9




        I did not administer any first aid to the injured because the ones I

        saw and spoke to were not seriously injured.     I did not at anytime

        see any of the deceased.



        I did not at anytime go through the gate in the dividing wall to the

        enclosure by the tunnel.     I had a quick glance through and saw that

        the area was very crowded with people walking around in an apparent

        daze.



                and I then left the ground through Gate B and waited along

        Leppings Lane towards Middlewood Road.



        I left the ground because I felt that the situation was being looked

        after well enough by the emergency services and I knew my wife would

        be worried for my safety if she'd heard about it.




                                                                        SIGNED

DATED: 290489                                                          (SIGNED)



           I live at the above address with my wife          and I am employed




           I have been a Steward at Hillsborough Football Ground, Sheffield for

       approximately 13 years and I attend for the first team home games

       every week.



       Over the last 13 years I have missed only about 12 to 20 matches.



       On Saturday 15 April 1989 (150489) I was present at Hillsborough in

       my capacity as a Steward.



       My normal duties when I act as a Steward is in the West Stand.



       There is two stairways leading up to the seating area of the West

       Stand and my normal duties involve the stairway to the left as you

       lock at the stand on entering the ground.
                                                                         2

Above this stairway is a sign which reads 'UVWX'.    This relates to

the seating rows.



On Saturday 15.4.89. (150489) ny duty was to stand at the bottom of

these stairs and to check that only people with genuine access with

tickets for this area entered.



When checking the tickets I had to tear the top right hand comer off

to stop people passing these tickets on to other people to use.



I positioned myself on the wall of the stairway which is nearest the

pitch.



It is normal practice prior to a football season starting that a

Stewards meeting is called.



At this meeting we are given demonstrations from the fire service and

instructed in our duties should there be a need to evacuate the ground

in an emergency such as a fire or bomb scare.



If it is necessary to evacuate the ground there is a coded message

passed over the PA system.    This message is in the form of "Mr

MEADOWS please come to the police box."



At the end of the emergency the all clear is "MR MEADOWS is no longer

required."



It is normal practice to send this message out at least once a season

in order to practice.
We had had one practice this season.



Should this message be sent out I am to remain at my position

originally allocated or if not there return inmiediately.



The reason we are at these stations is to assist the crowd to leave

the ground quietly and without panic.



I did not hear this command on Saturday 15.4.89 (150489).



I have had no First Aid training at all from either Sheffield

Wednesday Football Club or anywhere else.



Last years (000088) Semi-Final was held at Hillsborough and was

between the same two teams, Liverpool and Nottingham Forest.



I was on duty as a Steward that day and I think I had the same duties

as on 15.4.89 (150489).



On Saturday 15.4.89. (150489), in my position on the stairway, I was

posted with, I think, five other Stewards.



These were

don't know where he lives but I think he works or did work at

         which is in the                     of Sheffield, there also
was a man named           I don't know him that well but I know he's a



                                                    I can't remember who
                                                                         4


the other two were.



During football matches I am always posted to the Leppings Lane end of

the ground and always involved with the West Stand.



On 15.4.89. (150489) I got to the ground at about 11.30am (11.30)



I hadn't been there long when all of the Leppings Lane stewards were

called into the West Stand for a verbal briefing frcnt a Police Officer.



I think this Police Officer is an Inspector.   This Officer is at

most home matches.



This officer has a full grown beard.



At this meeting we were shown photostats of entrance tickets and told

that standing tickets were blue in colour and seating tickets were pink

in colour.



We were told to look out for forged tickets and to tear each ticket

at the top right hand comer.



We were also reminded of the evacuation procedure.



The gates leading from Leppings Lane are labelled 'A', 'B' and 'C'.



I don't work on these gates and so do not know what the

responsibilities of the stewards are on match day.
During matches I am not provided with any radio or telephone

equipment so I cannot communicate with any other person in the ground

except verbally.



I am paid for my duties as a steward and receive #6 per match.



On normal match days we are required to be at the ground 90 minutes

before the kick off and we remain there until the final whistle.



On 15.4.89. (150489) the club asked us to be at the ground by 11am

(1100) but because I was working I couldn't get there until

11.30am (1130).    They could not give us a time of leaving because

there may have been extra time.



On 15.4.89. (150489) I did not see any person with alcohol in their

possession.



At about 2.30pm (1430) I could hear a lot of noise coming from the

other side of the turnstiles and I saw people climbing on top of the

turnstiles trying to get in.



Police Officers were telling these people to get back, I cannot say

if any got into the ground.



Just before the kick off we had a rush on the stairs.



From the bottom of the stairs to the wall opposite is about 15 feet

and this area was full of people.
We were being pushed back up the stairs with people trying to get up

the stairs.



Because of the amount of people we stopped ripping the tickets and

provided they had the right colour ticket we let them up the stairs.



Behind us halfway up the stairs was two Police Officers, a man and a

worran.



When the crowd pushed us back towards the officers, I think it was

the male Officer who shouted to us to let the people up the stairs or

we would get crushed.



I remember when I was walking to the match just by a shop that sells

tyres in Leppings Lane I saw a man standing by a car.   There was two

or three people around him and I heard 60 to 80.   He gave me the

impression of being a ticket tout.



As far as I was aware, the match kicked off and I heard the PA system

announce "Please get off the pitch".   Then a short time after there

was a message saying "Please stay calm".



A short time after this some of the Liverpool fans came from the side

of the ground by the north stand and they pointed at me and kept

shcuting 'This is your fault'.



These fans were upset but at the time I did not know why.



The final thing I would like to say is that on a whole the early part
        of the afternoon before the kick off seemed quiet compared with the

        previous years' match.



        I saw several persons who had been drinking but generally no one

        passed me who I would say was really drunk.



        There is one other thing I remember, after the fans pointed at me I

        saw two Liverpool fans carrying another fan in a sitting position.



        It looked like he'd hurt his leg.



        At this point a Police Officer, I think he was an Inspector came down

        the stairs and I said to him something like, "I think we may need

        some First Aid here."



        The Officer said that Ambulances were on the way.



        The fans carrying the other one came from the enclosure at the back

        of the West Stand and walked towards the North Stand.




                                                                     SIGNED

prosecution if I have wilfully stated in it anything which I know
to be false or do not believe to be true.


DATED: 010589                                                         (SIGNED)



           I am an                            employed by

                                                     I reside at the above
        address with my wife and family.

        Since 1974 I have held a part time job as a steward at the Sheffield

        Wednesday, Hillsborough Football Ground.    I have a regular post at

        the ground which is in the seated area of the West Stand at the

        lappings Ln end of the ground.

        On Saturday 15th April 1989 (150489), I arrived at the ground at

        about 11.20 am (1120) for the FA Cup semi final match between

        Liverpool and Nottingham Forrest.   I went to the seated area in the

       West Stand where I was present at a police briefing outling

       procedures to be adapted in case of emergency and how to deal with

        supporters causing trouble.

       After the briefing, I took up ray post at the bottom of the stairs to

       the rear of the West Stand.    The stairs give access to the seated

       area at the top of the stand itself.    I was joined by five other

       stewards at this post.   I have marked on a sketch plan of the

       football ground ray post for that match.    I now produce this sketch
plan in evidence, Exhibit Reference No          (Exhibit No             ).

I have never received any formal training for ray job as a steward

and I have picked up the requirements from other long serving

stewards at the ground.     I don't have any first aid qualifications

either.

On that particular match day the build up of supporters seemed to be

very quiet for the calibre of fixture, and the flow of supporters into

the West Stand was steady until about half an hour before kick off

when it picked up greatly.

From ray position on the steps I could see the top of the turnstiles

at the Leppings Ln end.

At about 2.30 pm (1430), as the flow of supporters increased, I

noticed about 20 people in all climbing over the walling above the

turnstiles. There were police officers below who were calling them

down.

My view of most of Leppings Ln was blocked by a wall running from the

turnstiles to the West Stand.    I couldn't see anything of main gate

'C' or the enclosure at the rear of the stand which gives access to

the tunnel beneath.

I wasn't aware of any problems in the West Stand at the ccmmencment

of the match,    It wasn't until afterwards, about 3.30 pm (1530), we

appreciated there was problems and we were getting abuse from

Liverpool supporters coming back down the stairs from the stand and

also from fans in the enclosure at the bottom of the stairs.     The fans

were shouting at us and saying that it was all our fault.     We knew

something had happened but I, personally, wasn't fully aware of what

had. gone on.   We were getting so much abuse that I took off ray

steward's vest and hid it under ray own coat.

Around 4 pm (1600), we were told that there had been deaths in the
        West Stand and we were told by the Chief Steward that the game had

        been abandoned so we were instructed to go home.

        I didn't go into the West Stand at all or into the pens below and I

        didn't witness any of the crowd problems which took place.




                                                                      SIGNED

           I am a single man and I live at the above address with my mother,

                     and father         I have been unemployed since October of

           last year (001088).



           I, along with              am employed as a Steward at the Hillsborough

           Football Ground for the past six years.



           On Saturday 15 April 1989 (150489) I was employed in the capacity at

           the ground for the Semi-Final between Liverpool and Nottingham

           Forest.    My job was to take the tickets from the fans and show them

           to their seats upstairs in the West Stand.   When I was initially

           employed by Hillsborough, I was trianed for the post by the Chief

       Steward, Mr Stuart THORPE.       Since then I have received no

           further training, aside from lectures given every August on safety and

       other matters in the Hillsborough Suite inside the ground.       Lecturers

           included Police Officers and Ambulance personnel who show how they

       deal with emergencies, like people collapsing with heart attacks, the

       kiss of life and just basic first aid, and Fire Brigade Officers who
                                                                            2

demonstrate the evacuation procedures.



Initial training included the basic layout of the ground itself, the

procedures adopted, tearing the comer of the fans' tickets as they

entered etc and what to do in an emergency.



I was also present at last year's FA Cup Sem- Final, once again

between Nottingham Forest and Liverpool, held at the Hillsborough

Football ground.



At the match in question I was not given a specific post; I never

am.     What I usually do is on match day at about half past one (1330)

I go to the snack bar Steward, once again Mr THORPE, sign in, hand him

our paying-in slips, put on our stewards' bibs, a fluorescent jacket

with 'Bingham's Window Systems' written in orange letters on the back

of the jacket and 'Steward' written in orange letters just above the

left breast and go to our posts.     I then go to the seats in the West

Stand and find out if there are any empty gangways.     If there are I

position myself in the gangway and notify the Chief Steward.     If there

aren't any, then I always position myself at the bottom of the right-

hand as you are facing the ground from the turnstiles at the main

gate, stairs leading to the seats of the West Stand.    This was the

case on the match in question.     On that day I was posted with four

other Stewards                                          a man I only

                 and             Also               came down from

upstairs to ask if anyone wanted to swap posts.



                                                                  is

I arrived at the ground at 11.00am (1100).        I did not receive any

verbal or written instructions for this particular match.



As far as I'm aware there is no Club policy on the opening of gates

A, B or C in Leppings Lane prior to kick-off time.



I went irrmediately on post with my fellow stewards, after collecting

my bib.     We are not provided with any radio.    Apparently we have been

told we don't need them.     The only persons permitted to have radios

are the Chief Steward and the security men.



If an emergency develops near to where I am standing, I inform the

Police and allow them to deal with it and also I think inform

security.     I don't rightly know.   If an emergency develops inside the
ground then we are told during the yearly lectures that a name, any

name, will be read over the Tannoy and followed by a message stating

that he is wanted.     On hearing this, I run to the position closest to

me at that particular time and escort the fans from the ground.



There were hardly any fans inside the ground at this particular

time, about two thousand if that.



At about half past twelve (1230), whilst my post was being covered by

the other stewards, I went to gate 'C' where the Steward there,

           I don't know his second name, opened it to let me out.   I

walked down Leppings Lane towards the Chip shop one hundred yards

away.    There were one or two Liverpool fans about, even at this early

stage.    The Chip shop itself was packed with them.   As I walked down,

I noticed four Liverpool fans moving amongst the fans, I heard one of

than say, "Have you got any spare tickets?"     I couldn't describe him.

I didn't take much notice of him.     I got my chips from the Chip shop

and walked back.     There were a few fans now queuing up outside the

turnstiles, about three or four hundred well-behaved at this stage.



I got back into the ground through gate 'C' and            closed it.

I didn't notice any problems with the gate.



As far as I know the gate was opened one more time, at half past two

(1430), twenty five to three (1435).    I saw the gate being opened to

let late Stewards, the Stewards from Liverpool, into the ground.        The

gate was imnediately closed again and secured.    I never saw it open

again.
So I returned to my post and continued my duties. The crowd

increased over two hours.   We weren't particularly busy and nothing

unusual happened.



One or two fans pushed past me, I didn't check their tickets but it

was quite obvious they had been drinking, swaying from side to side,

you couldn't mistake these characters, they were in fancy dress.      One

lad was in a sombrero and had a lady's dress on.    He was shouting at

the top of his voice, punching his fist into the air.      He was merry.

Others were dancing through the turnstiles, chanting, "Liverpool."



We, however, did not eject any supporters from the ground.     We are

not allowed to, not even if they take a swing at us.      The Chief

Steward advises us to find a Policeman if anything like this happens.



I, personally, did not witness any alcohol being brought into the

ground or consumed in it.   The fans aren't allowed to.     If we do we

inform the nearest Police Officer.



The next thing that happened was, I saw a Liverpool fan, an 18-19

year old youth, all I remember about him was he had a skinhead cut,

urinating at the side of the entrance to the toilet on the far side

of the tunnel into the stand itself.    He was being closely watched by

a Woman Police Constable, a blonde haired girl, little about 5'6",

thin, wearing a Packamac.   I've seen her in the West Stand a few

times, but I don't know her name.    She is quite good looking though.

She was standing initially at the top of the stairs where we were

standing.   She moved down to the landing with a male colleague and

finally joined us where she saw the youth urinating.    She chased
after the youths towards Leppings Lane, followed by her colleague.

I think she caught him.     I never saw her again and it left us without

Police support.



After this I glanced across to the turnstiles.       Youths were climbing

on top of the turnstiles, over the rail, trying to get inside the

ground.    There were about twenty doing this.     I can't remember any in

particular.



I then went upstairs to the toilets in the West Stand, directly

opposite the seats.     I looked through the window in the toilet.    It

overlooks the turnstiles onto Leppings Lane.       The street outside was

full of Liverpool fans.     There must have been four or five thousand

outside.    I've seen bigger crowds, but not outside football grounds.

I thought to myself, we are going to have a right rush on.



I came back downstairs and all the otter stewards were still there.          I

did not see any fans entering the Leppings Lane enclosure, except the

ones I mentioned earlier who were taken off the turnstiles by Police

Officers on horseback who passed them to officers on foot.       They must

have put them out, I don't know how.



Everything had gone quiet by then.    At about half past two (1430), I

was standing on the stairs just inside the locked gate, when I

glanced towards the turnstiles and saw about three hundred or four

hundred fans rush through the turnstiles and head straight for the

stairs.    I was with a new lad at this time.     I don't know his name.

I said to him, "They're going to rush the gate, I'm going to run for

it."          and I think      was on the gate.    They opened it, not
realising what was happening.      The fans rushed past them, knocking

down the Liverpool Stewards out of the way.      They were like wild

animals.    I ran up the stairs.    They were following close behind and

hid myself behind the snack bar.       I waited for five or six minutes

and then went back downstairs to see if                 ind the otter

Stewards were alright.



I was standing on the stairs for a while.                 stood with the

other Stewards.     I was walking up and down the stairs, so I did not

see gate 'C' opening.    However, I think it was about five minutes to

three (1455).     I don't know why or who opened the gate.     I cannot give

any further information but                   find the otter Stewards were

in a better position than me.      They may be of more help.   I also

don't know any Police Officers who were around gate 'C'.



I was frightened of another surge like the previous one, so I kept

moving up and down        thestairs.    All I heard over the Tannoy was,

"Don't panic Liverpool    fans, you'll all get in," or words to that

effect.    I don't recall the emergency signal being given over the

Tannoy.



I was out of sight        by this time to the tunnel to the pensof theWest

Stand, so I didn'tsee     the crowd surging through it.



However, I did go up into the Stand and I could see all the pens from

there.     I could see Liverpool fans on the pitch.    The pens were

packed, but I thought it was natural spillage.      There was nothing to

change in my opinion, no instructions to the Stewards, nothing over

the Tannoy at all.
                                                                             8




At about ten past three (1510) I was still on the stairs.     Liverpool

fans started to come downstairs from the Stand, roost, visibly upset

and crying.   One fan said, "There are people dying upstairs, why don't

you do something about it?"   I kept quiet, kept going upstairs.     I

saw a young girl aged about 16 years old.     She was laid in one of the

gangways and a man was trying to give her the kiss of life.    There

was a blanket over her.   By now I had realised what had happened.       I

came back downstairs. The fans were now coming down the stairs saying,

"It's all your fault, you're to blame," things like that.     Seme were

angry, shaking their fists at me.     Everything went quiet after about

twenty five past three (1525).     The Chief Steward came up to us and

said, "Take your bibs off, one of the Stewards has been threatened."

We then stood at the bottom of the stairs without our bibs, whilst the

fans left the stadium.



After a few minutes, Mr THORPE returned and said we couldn't do

anything more and to go on home.    When I left the stadium at about

twenty to four (1540), ambulances were racing past me.



That's all I can remember.




                                               This was my third semi­

final in six years.   I've been a football fan since 1976 (000076)

and this was undoubtedly the worst thing I've ever seen.



I thought the South Yorkshire Police handled the disaster as best

they could, but I think it was down to the Liverpool supporters.
        I've never seen so many Liverpool fans who were inside the ground

        drunk.



        During a normal match, my hours of working are from 1.15pm (1315) to

        4.45pm (1645) and I am paid #6 per match.

           States:-



           I have been employed at the Sheffield Wednesday, Hillsborough

           Football Ground as Chief Steward of the North Stand for the past 10

           years and prior to that an assistant Chief Steward for 5 years.



           It is my job to allocate jobs to the stewards in the North Stand,

           sign them on duty and pay them out at the end of the game.    I also do

           a check just prior to kick-off in the North Stand which involves a

           physical walking around of the North Stand to make sure all the

           stewards are in their correct positions.   I have two assistant Chief

           Stewards to assist me.



           On Saturday 15th April, 1989 (150489) I started work at the

       Hillsborough ground at approximately 10.45 am (1045) for the Semi-

       Final Cup Tie between Liverpool and Nottingham Forest Football clubs.

        Having collected my radio I attended a briefing in the North Stand

       held by a Police Inspector, at approx. 11.15 am (1115).      It was
CASTLEY                KENNETH                                            2

basically for the Junior Stewards to make sure everyone was aware of

Emergency procedures, prohibited articles from the ground, forged

tickets and general crowd control.



I then went to my office and started allocating jobs to stewards as

they arrived.    As far as possible stewards are given the same jobs

every time.     This took until approximately 1 o'clock (1300).   I

was aware that the North stand was to be occupied by the Liverpool

supporters, so I had made prior arrangement with a Liverpool Chief

Steward \_____                            that he was to arrange a number

of his own stewards to be unpaid volunteers, to assist in the

stewarding of their own fans.     They were to bring their own identity

waistcoats and other equipment. I'm not sure how many he had brought

with him, but these were needed to assist the steward in the West

Terrace.    I had 58 stewards who were under my direction in the North

Stand.



At approximately 1.10 pm (1310) I started seme paperwork, completing

all the necessary actions in respect of that by 1.30 pm (1330).



At approximately 2.30 pm (1430) I started my final check that all

was in order in the North Stand.     I checked that all the stewards

were in their correct positions, and wearing fluorescent jackets, if

required.   On completion of my tour everything was in order, and the

stand was well on the way to being completely full.    The Liverpool

supporters were in good humour and well-behaved as far as I'm aware.

There was no alcohol or prohibited articles in the North Stand.       I

completed my tour at around 2.45 pm (1445).
CASTLEY                KENNETH                                             3


Shortly after I had finished my tour, a Liverpool supporter was

bought to my attention by an assistant Chief Steward

It became apparent that the ticket belonging to the supporters was

forged.    The ticket was for J gangway seat 174.   From my experience I

was aware that no seat of this description existed.    On closer

examination, I noticed that the letter J and number 174 appeared to be

in biro.    I instructed the Liverpool supporter to remain in that

position whilst I sought Police advice.



I then went to the Police Control Rocm beneath the North stand and

spoke to Inspector S SEWELL.     He informed me that there was a problem

at Leppings Lane and could I sort the problem out myself.     I then went

back and spoke to the supporter, whose details I don't know, and

informed him of the situation.      I explained that the seat he believed

he had been allocated did not exist and he would have to stand.      He

accepted this and I escorted him to a standing area in front of the

Kop which is the East Terrace and left him there.     This is not the

normal procedure.    The Police usually deal with the matter but I now

realise the problem they were facing and why they had asked me to deal

with it.



I then took the forged ticket to the Chief Security Officer, Douglas

LOCK, who was in conversation with the Office Manageress,

at the top of the players' tunnel.    On arrival, I heard Douglas LOCK

say, "They've broken down a gate at Leppings Lane." I then related

the incident about the forged ticket to                and handed her

the ticket.   Because of what Douglas LOCK said, I went back to the

North Stand, because there is a gate in Leppings Lane which gives

direct access to the North Stand and I feared this may have been the
CASTLEY                KENNETH                                               4


gate he was referring to.   On returning to the North Stand I found

that everything was in order this would be around 2.55 pm (1455)

by then.   The gate which I was worried about, Gate A, Leppings Lane,

can be seen from the North Stand and I remember looking across and

seeing it still closed. By this time the North Stand was full and

there must have been 50-70 Police Officers by this time, on foot

patrol in the stand.



I then made my way back to my office to make sure it was in order.

I had previously arranged to stand on the perimeter track outside the

pitch invasion fences by the North Stand.     As I came back onto the

field from the ramp between the North stand and the East Terrace, I

was aware that Liverpool fans were on the pitch at the Leppings Lane

end.



Emergency procedure dictates that if there is any emergency situation

in the ground, the words, "Me MEADOWS is required at the Secretary's

Office," are announced over the Tannoy public address system.      This is

the signal for all stewards to go to their appointed location and for

all exit gates to be opened.     All stewards are aware of this.   On this

occasion I had heard no such announcement and obviously wondered what

was going on.



I then liaised with Doug LOCK who instructed me to make sure all the

exit gates were opened, which I did.     I then returned to the ramp

which I have previously stated is at the comer of the North Stand and

East Terrace and was instructed to allow access by the ambulances as

the casualties were being brought to this area of the ground.

       At no time did I approach the Leppings Lane end or am I able to

       provide any information relating to the events which took place in

        the standing area where the incident occurred.   All I can state is,

        from my position, I saw approximately twelve bodies which had been

        laid down at the Penistone Road end of the ground where I was.    I have

        no idea who these people were or where they had died, or to who had

        carried them there.    The injured were transported to Hospital via

        ambulance from the ramp away from the ground.    The dead were covered

       with coats over their heads.



        I left the ground at approximately 3.50 pm (1550).

           I live at the above address with my wife          , having been retired

           three years now.



           I have been a steward at Sheffield Wednesday football club ground

           since the summer of 1966 (000066).



           On Saturday 15th April 1989 (150489), I was present at Hillsborough in

           my official capacity as a steward for the Cup Semi-Final game -

           Liverpool versus Nottingham Forest.



           My posting for this match was my normal one and the same one that I

           held in the Cup Semi-Final between the same two clubs the previous

           year.   My specific post is to look after the press box area and the

           executive seats.   This involves checking all the tickets of supporters

           entering this area, and then showing them to their seats.   These seats

           are situated in the South Stand on the West Stand side.



           On this particular day I parked my car as is normal about 10 minutes
walk from the ground in Wadsley Lane, Sheffield, at 10.40am (1040)



On my way to the ground I was on foot and aware of a lot of Liverpool

supporters making their way to the Public Houses in that area. One of

the Pubs was the Horse and Jockey, another the Beehive, another the

Castle.     There are other pubs in this area, but I was particularly

asked by fans for these pubs by name.     The fans were polite and sober

at this time which was about 10.45am (1045).



There is a public house at the bottom of Wadsley Lane called the Park

Hotel which is closed, but there were a dozen or more Liverpool fans

sat outside with numerous cans of beer.     On the table there were easy

a couple of dozen pint cans of alcohol.



I then went into Hillsborough Football Ground and went to the

Stewards' meeting.     At about 11.20am (1120) I went to my posting in

the South Stand.     At this time the South Stand was empty.



At about 2pm (1400) most of the football ground was filling up as

normal, compared with the same match last year.     However, the West

Stand area, particularly the standing area appeared to me to be

filling very slowly.     I formed the opinion that people were leaving it

a bit late and there could be a rush near kick-off time of people

coming into the ground.



At about 2.30pm (1430) the Pens 3 and 4 of the West Stand appeared

full.     The Pens 1, 2, 6 and 7 on the edges seemed to have quite a bit

of room left for fans.




                                                                            295
Just after the match kicked off, I noticed that there was quite a

swaying movement of fans pushing forward and then going back a bit.

I've seen this at many matches before this is a normal experience.



Nottingham Forest had a corner kick and while this was taking place I

noticed there seemed to be a lot of pushing with fans going forwards

and this seemed to be ccming from the tunnel entrance to Pen® 3 and 4.



I didn't actually witness any fans fall under this pushing.    I saw

seme fans being pushed against the perimeter fence, but I saw no one

actually injured from where I was standing.



Then seme fans ccme over the top of the fence and set off towards the

Kop Stand.     Most of than were stopped by the Police, but one fan with

his Liverpool supporter's scarf tied to his wrist, managed to run to

the Kop end.     He seemed to make a threatening gesture with his arm not

having a scarf on it.     I think it was a 'V' sign, and the crowd

reacted to this by shouting and geering.



This fan ran back towards the Liverpool end and was eventually rugby

tackled and taken away by the Police.



By this time a lot of fans were being brought on to the field over

the fence and it was apparent that a lot were injured, and judging by

the resuscitation being given by police and other people, that seme

were very seriously injured.



I didn't witness any deaths or could not see or describe anyone who

was being treated.
At this time I was instructed by a senior steward I know as

          to take up a position by the stairs at the back of the South

Stand.     This I did and saw nomore of the tragedy.



After the crowd had evacuated, which I would say would be about

4.30pn    (1630), I went back upto the press box and noticed the press

interviewing people and taking pictures, I thought in an obstructive

manner and not assisting the emergency staff.



I noticed that a few Liverpool fans were shouting to the directors'

box that they should have had more tickets at the Kop end of the

ground.



When I eventually got hone and talked to my wife and friends I know

who live in the Wadsley Lane area, I was told of many Liverpool

supporters drinking outside pubs after 2pn (1400), and when they

eventually left the pub, just openly urinating in the front gardens

on the way to the ground.



When I left the ground on that day Leppings Lane was strewed with

hundreds of empty beer cans.

           I am a married man and I live at

                      with my wife.



           I have been employed as a steward at Hillsborough Football ground for

           the last six years, and for the whole of that time I have always

           worked as a steward in Gangway 13 of the South Stand.



           On Saturday, 15th April, 1989 (150489) I was working in the morning,

           however at about 11.30 am (1130) I finished work and made my way to

           Hillsborough to work at the Semi-Final match between Liverpool and

           Nottingham Forest.   I waited to the ground along the Halifax Road and

           by using Herries Road.     En route to the ground I saw very few

           football supporters, and there was no trouble.    When I entered the

           ground, I used the club officials' entrance, and made my way straight

           to my post for the game.     I was again posted to gangway 13 of the

           South Stand. This gangway is situated in the South Stand next to pen

           1 of the Leppings Lane Stand.
I have marked my position in the ground on a map of Hillsborough

Football Ground which I produce, (Ex No          )(Ref No

handed this map to PC                    >f the West Midlands Police.



When I arrived at the ground it was about 12 pm (1200).     At my post I

   met               who always works with me, and two temporary

stewards from Sheffield United Football Club who I have never met

before.   Because I had been working, I had missed the 11.00 am (1100)

briefing, however,           told me that we were to adopt the same

emergency procedures as in previous matches.



As far as emergency procedures are concerned, I have attended at pre­

season meetings at the Club where the Fire Brigade and the Police tell

us about how to deal with emergencies.     In the case of an emergency, a

message is passed over the Tannoy saying,     "Mr MEADOWS is wanted at

the Police box".     If I hear this, one steward goes to the top of

gangway 13 and the other to the bottom of the gangway.      We then wait

for further instructions.    If everything turns out to be in order

another message is passed over the Tannoy saying,     "Mr MEADOWS is no

longer required at the Police box".



When I got to my post I was wearing my yellow steward's waistcoat, a

blue jumper, blue jeans and white training shoes.



I would describe myself as

                                                              There is

nothing about my appearance which I would say is particularly

distinctive.
There was a steady stream of both Nottingham Forest and Liverpool fans

coming into the South Stand from just after 12.00pm (1200).    At

about 01.00 pm (1300) the flow got greater but it was not excessive.

I spent my time before the game in gangway 13, checking spectators'

tickets and showing them to their seats. Frcm where I was positioned,

I had clear view of the Leppings Lane terraces and up to about 2.40pm

(1440) the terraces were not very full, considering that it was a

Semi-Final taking place.   In contrast, the Nottingham Forest terraces

were almost full at this time.



The ground began to fill up, and at about 2.50 pm (1450) I could see

that the central Pens 3 and 4, of the Leppings Lane terraces were very

full, but there was still plenty of rocm in the pens either side of

the central pens.



At about 2.55 pm (1455) the central pens suddenly filled up and there

was an obvious crush in the pens.   At first I thought it was just the

case that the fans were swaying forward, but then I saw people

climbing from the terraces into the stand above the terrace.    To be

honest, at first, I thought that these people were just trying to get

into the seats for free.   I can't describe what these people looked

like.



It was at this time that people began to climb over the perimeter

fencing of the terraces onto the pitch.   At first I thought it was a

pitch invasion.   The Police let them climb the fences, but they stood

in a line to stop them going onto the pitch.   A steady stream of

people started to climb over the fence, and, after a short while, the

Police began to help people over the fence and the gates at the
front of the terraces were opened.



I still didn't realise anything was wrong until about 3.05 pm (1505)

when a spectator carried a young boy to the grass at the edge of the

pitch in front of me.     The lad was no more than 10 yards from where I

was standing and seemed lifeless.    A policeman ran over to the boy

and started to give him mouth-to-mouth resuscitation and heart massage

by himself.    When people in the South Stand saw this, they started to

cry and this was when I realised that something had gone seriously

wrong.



A group of Liverpool fans stood on the pitch watching the policeman

and he shouted to them to get back and let the lad have some air. I

would say that the policeman was giving the lad mouth-to-mouth for

about six minutes when he seamed to come round.     The people round the

policeman started to cheer, but, after about 30 seconds, the policeman

started doing the mouth-to-mouth and heart massage again.     I can't say

that I saw the boy move or anything, but I just got the impression

that he had come round because of the reaction of the people

watching.     The policeman carried on doing the mouth-to-mouth and

heart massage until about 3.20 pm (1520) when an ambulance man came to

him and took over.    A second ambulance man came and they put the boy

on a stretcher on wheels and then wheeled the boy towards the the

North Stand.     I lost sight of them in the crowd on the pitch and I

don't know if they carried on giving him mouth-to-mouth and heart

massage.



I can't describe the policeman nor the ambulancemen, but the

boy only looked to be about 9 or 10 to me.    He had a red top on and
                                                                           5


was wearing jeans.     He was wearing training shoes and was slim.   He

had fair hair which was collar length and quite short at the front.

I think this little boy died a couple of days later, as I'm sure I

saw his photograph on the television.



The scene on the pitch was complete mayhem with people everywhere. I

can't describe individuals or what was happening because I was

concentrating on the young boy and was not paying attention to

anything else.



After the little boy had been taken away the Chief Steward,

came up and told me to go under the stand and stop people from moving

through the exit which leads to the rear of the South Stand, because

they were going to use that area for first aid.     I went under the

stand and did this for about half an hour until nearly everyone had

cleared the South Stand.



During this time I helped a couple of people with leg and foot

injuries to the first aid post at the rear of the south stand.       One

was a white man, in his forties, with curly dark hair, a black jacket

and wearing jeans, he had a Liverpool accent and he just thanked me.



The other person I helped was a white male in his early twenties with

streaked blond hair.    He was about 5'10" tall, and was slim.   He was

wearing a light coloured jacket and he was hysterical.    He spoke with

a Liverpool accent and said his ribs hurt.    Both men had hurt their

feet.



I walked back up to the South Stand at about 4.45 pm (1645) and by now
                                                                                   6

        the ground was virtually empty.     I sat down for about five minutes, I

        couldn't believe what had happened.     After that I just left the ground

        and walked to my car and drove home.



        During the whole incident the Tannoy wasn't used to tell us what was

        happening and I was given no instructions.      I don't think peqple

        realised what was happening at first and I think this helped cause the

        problems.



        I would like to add that while this was happening, the press

        photographers just kept taking pictures.     They were stood by the

        fencing taking pictures and I think they were a hindrance.     I didn't

        see any photographers help to get peqple out of the terraces and I

        think they could have helped because they were behind the goal right

        next to the central pens of the Leppings Lane Stand.



        I am prepared to attend at any Inquiry if I am required to do so.



                                                                        SIGNED

           I am a married man, living at the above address with my wife.     I am a

                             by trade, having worked for the same firm,




           I am also employed as a Steward at Hillsborough Football Ground for

           first team matches.   I have been employed there for the past ten

           seasons.



           My actual job is to marshall peqple to their proper seats, preventing

           people frcm sitting in the season ticket holder's seats, and to keep

           the gangway directly in front of the Director's box clear.   This lies

           at the rear of gangway 17.



           I am paid #6 for every heme match.   I work as a Steward, but for every

           semi-final I work, I am paid #9.



           On a normal match day, I arrive at about 1.00pm (1300) and I then work

           through until the match is finished, about 5.00pm (1700).
                                                                            2



I have received no formal training for my post.     However, we, my

fellow Stewards and myself, have a lecture in the Hillsborough Suite

within the ground two weeks before the football season starts.       This

happens annually.     We are given lectures by the Chief Fire Officer

who shows us how to use fire extinguishers and where they are situated

within the stand and a Police Officer, who informs us of the procedure

to adopt in case of trouble within the ground, namely to call a

Policeman.    The lecture usually lasts about half an hour, something

like that.



On Saturday 15 April 1989 (150489), I was working within the

Hillsborough Football Ground, at the Semi-Final match between

Liverpool FC and Nottingham Forest FC.     I was actually working in

Gangway 17 on the South Stand of the ground, the uncovered seating.

In fact, I have held this post since I became a Steward ten seasons

ago.



Being a semi-final, we were told to arrive at the ground no later than

11am   (11 00 ) b y _________   one of the Chief Stewards from the

ground.    I arrived at the ground slightly after this time and entered

through the players' entrance in the South Stand.     Just inside the

             entrance, I saw signed a chit for our money, gave it to him

and received a receipt in return, along with a yellow jacket with

'SWFC STEWARD' and an advertisement for window systems just above the

left breast; it's more like a waistcoat really.     I also placed my

identification on the breast pocket of the jacket I was wearing at

that time.    The identification consists of a photograph of myself, the

owl's emblem (the symbol for Sheffield Wednesday) beside it, to its
                                                                            3


left, and ray signature underneath.    The badge itself measures 2 inches

by 4 inches, with a clip to fasten it to the jacket.



At that time, I was wearing grey trouses, a

suit jacket with                                  open at the neck.    I

was also wearing



After booking in, I then went to the South Stand for a briefing frcm a

Police Officer.    This was about a quarter to twelve (1145).   Briefly,

the briefing re-iterated what we had been told in the lectures, that

if there was any trouble within the crowd, bento scare etc

it and inform the Police Officers - persistent trouble that is.       The

briefing lasted half an hour, after which I went straight to my post,

gangway 17.



I was posted at this location with two other Stewards, one who I only

know as        has always worked with me, the two years he has actually

been at Wednesday's football ground.           is aged about




particular match he was wearing light blue jeans and a bluey-grey

blouson.   I think        lives in

anyway, and he has his                      , I believe.



The other Steward was temporary for the day and I don't know him.      I

couldn't describe him, but he was wearing an anorak slightly longer

than          blouson and jeans.



I actually arrived on post at about half past twelve (1230).    Of the
three Stewards, no one had any radio or telephone communication.

The only people supplied with such are the security personnel and the

Chief Steward.   If a problem occurs, our instructions are to notify a

Police Officer who will contact the Control Roan informing the Chief

Steward, who will be somewhere within the South Stand.



If an emergency occurs within the ground, then the stewards are

informed by the ground's Tannoy system, giving out the message, "Will

Mr MEADOWS report to the Police Roan." At this, my role is to make

sure the gangways leading from the ground are clear and to move the

people quickly to the exits at each end of the South Stand.    If the

emergency clears in the meantime, then the Tannoy gives the message,

"Mr MEADOWS, there is no need to report."   On hearing this, I return

to my post.



If someone is injured within the South Stand, I then fetch a person

belonging to the St John's Ambulance Brigade. They are usually

stationed at the comers of the pitch, near to the playing area. I,

myself, have received no first aid training.



If anyone causes a nuisance within the crowd, I have to report this to

a Police Officer who will remove the person from the ground.   We have

no power to eject supporters from the ground.



There was a steady stream of supporters in the South Stand, until

about half-past two (1430), when the crowd, consisting of Nottingham

Forest fans, began to ccme in in droves.



I did not see any alcohol being consumed within the seating area.   If
___________________________                                                  5


I had done so, it is my duty to inform a Police Officer.      Fortunately,

I have never had to resort to this.



Nothing much happened then until the teams came out and the match

started.     By now, the uncovered seating of the South Stand was full

and all the fans seated.     The match started at about three o'clock

(1500).



I was now standing on the top of gangway 17 with           and the

temporary Steward, when I glanced to my left towards the West Stand.

From where I was standing, I could see Pens 3 and 4 quite clearly,

even though I was virtually opposite the half-way line.     All I could

see was the crowd in the Pens moving forward, as if being pushed from

behind.     All I could hear, was the roar of the crowd.   I was very

surprised to see that in the Pens on each end of the West Stand, there

were very few people in than; there was a lot of room.      The crowd all

seemed to make for the centre pens, behind the goals.



Whilst the game was in play, I could see quite a few fans coming over

the railings onto the pitch.     This was from three o'clock (1500)

onwards.



I thought nothing of it.     I thought it was a crowd invasion.     The

match continued, until a Police Officer ran onto the pitch and spoke

to the Referee.     He came from towards the right-hand comer of the

West Stand.     I can't really describe him.   I didn't know what was

going on.     The Officer spoke to the Referee for a few minutes.    The

Referee then took all the players through the players' tunnel. The

Officer returned to the West Stand.     By this time, St John's personnel
                                                                             6

and Police Officers were walking hurriedly along each side of the

pitch towards the West Stand.



I then realised something serious had happened.     The Police and the St

John's were helping people over the railings and placing than on the

pitch.    They were giving first aid to those persons on the ground.



I watched as the juniors, the Junior team acting as ballboys, were

pilling placards and hoardings off the walls, and started using than

as stretchers.    Some of the Liverpool supporters helping as well.



I walked down gangway 17, stepped over the wall surrounding the pitch

and started to help than.     I walked towards the West Stand on the

pitch.    People were lying on the ground, seme crying.



I saw Police Officers trying to give heart massage to those people on

the ground.



I felt sickened by this sight.     People with blood on their faces.     I

started to stretcher seine of the people across the pitch towards the

gymnasium.    We were using a plywood hoarding as a stretcher.   I can't

remember what it was advertising, but it was about 8 ' by 3' in size

and it took eight of us to lift it and to stop it from sagging in the

middle.    I didn't particularly notice any of the others.   They were

mostly Liverpool supporters.    Other Stewards were helping to move

people from the pitch into the gymnasium but they were in other

stretcher parties.    I helped to carry approximately half a dozen

supporters, men and boys, a couple of whan were dead, with no movement

at all, into the gymnasium.     I couldn't really give a description of
any of those I carried, as I was shocked.



After that, I had decided I had had enough.     By this time, Sheffield

Wednesday staff, women, were carrying anything that could carry

water from the players' tunnel.     Brown stewpots, buckets, chrome

teapots, anything people could have a drink out of.     One woman I know,

a blonde haired woman about 5'4", of stocky build, wearing a navy and

blue jacket and skirt with a white blouse.     I think she works in the

                       She came out with the brown stewpot full of water.

Other young girls in the Sheffield Wednesday uniform came on the

pitch, carrying small paper cups and paper serviettes to wipe other

people down with.     At this time, I started to go amongst the injured

persons and the Police, seeing if they wanted a drink.     They all

wanted seme, so I gave out the water and when that ran out, I ran into

the players' entrance to get seme more.



When the trouble first started, I do remember two Liverpool fans,

aged about 19 or 20 years old, larking about in front of the

television cameras.    They were wrestling in front of the television

cameras.   I thought they were drunk and they didn't truly realise what

was going on.



As I moved amongst the injured fans, one thing I did notice is, that

some of them smelt strongly of beer.     I can't remember anyone in

particular.



I have been a football fan virtually all my life, five years of which

I spent                and this was the worst thing I have ever seen.

I felt sickened and upset.
I came back on the pitch with the water and continued giving it out.

When everyone was removed, I started to tidy up the pitch and then

went heme.



That's all I can remember.    I then handed my coat in and got paid and

I left the ground at about a quarter past five (1715) and went hone.



In comparison with last year's Semi-Final between Notts Forest and

Liverpool, which I also worked as a Steward in gangway 17, the only

basic difference between the two matches was there seemed to be a lot

more fans, Nottingham Forest fans included, coming into the ground at

the very last minute.



I have now been shown a map of the Sheffield Wednesday Football

Ground. I have marked 'X' on it, indicating my position during the

match.   I have now signed this map (Mk     )(Ex No      ) and handed

it along with a signed court label to PC                 . 1 would

describe myself as




At no stage during the match, or after, did I hear the emergency

signal given out over the Tannoy.   The Tannoy system itself is

terrible.    You can't really hear anything broadcast over it, only

slightly and with the crowd shouting, it's inpossible to hear it.

This has been reported at the Annual meeting, lectures, but nothing

has been done.    I'm sorry I cannot give any further descriptions of

the people involved, it all happened so fast.
        I would be more than willing to give evidence at any further

       enquiries.

                    which is in Sheffield.    I work a shift system and have been a

                 for twelve years.



           I am also employed as a Steward by Sheffield Wednesday Football Club,

           to assist at the ground on match days.     Although I am paid to do this

           work, I consider it to be a hobby as I enjoy it.     I have worked as a

           ground steward for the past three seasons, having attended virtually

           every match and my posting has always been in the South Stand and

           usually at gangway 19.    This gangway is situated about three quarters

           along the South Stand, closest to the Spion Kqp.    My role as a Steward

           is to assist people in finding their correct seats and to check

           tickets if necessary.    Also if there are no Police Officers about, to

           assist in the control of the supporters.     I haven't received any

           training as obviously my job is straight forward enough.      I'm,
however, a qualified first aider having received training in

connection with my work as



On Saturday 15th April 1989 (150489) the semi final between Liverpool

and Nottingham Forest was to be played at the Hillsborough ground.

Due to the size of the crowd that was to be expected the club brought

in a number of temporary stewards to assist the regular ones.     I had

received no special instructions before this day other than to be at

the ground at mid-day (1200).     Usually in a normal match, the parade

time is two hours before kick-off but obviously there was more to be

organised on this particular day.     I wished to get to the ground

before mid-day (1200) so I left my home at about 1015hrs (1015).



I caught the bus into Hillsborough which dropped me off by the ground

in Leppings Lane.     I then went into a cafe before making my way into

the ground.   Between the cafe and the ground I was approached by two

ticket 'touts'.     The one wished to sell me a ticket for fifteen pounds

the other ten pounds but obviously I declined.



All the stewards paraded in the South Stand top section at I believe

about twelve o clock (1200).    We were briefed by the Chief Steward,

              and a Police Superintendent.   During this briefing they

confirmed the usual instruction that if there is an emergency

situation, over the public address system would come the code "Mr

MEADOWS is urgently required at the Police control." On hearing this,

Stewards would then go about evacuating the ground.    The briefing was

very much the same as normal with no specific new instructions.

My posting for the match was as usual gangway 19 in the South Stand

and to assist me I had two temporary Stewards, but I didn't catch
their names.



Before the gates were opened I checked all the seats in my particular

area and then remained in my post.     In my particular area I was to

have Nottingham Forest Supporters and shortly after the gates opened,

they started coming in.   Nothing was unusual about the spirit of the

fans, everyone seemed in good humour and I saw no trouble.



Frcm my position in the ground I could see the West Stand and terraces

beneath it, being about 80 yds away.     I could see pens three and four,

which are the centre pens behind the goal, were filling up and at

about 1445 hrs I considered them to be completely full.    What was

strange about them being so full was that the pens to the sides of

these two had a lot of spaces left.    People normally tend to

congregate behind the goal but if the fencing hadn't been there they

would probably have filtered out to the side as it looked very crowded

in there.   I proceeded as normal showing people to their seats, but

couldn't help noticing that the Liverpool supporters in pen 3 and 4

were jumping about and it seemed to be getting even more crowded.



As the players from the two teams came onto the pitch I looked over

towards the Liverpool fans in pens three and four, and saw them all

surge forward.   The pens by now looked overcrowded but there didn't

seem to be any major problems.



The match kicked off on time at three o' clock (1500).    As the teams

kicked off I became aware of people climbing over the large fence at

the front of pens three and four, attempting to get onto the pitch.

Police Officers were going along the fence and pushing these people
back in.    I myself thought then Liverpool fans were trying to invade

the pitch and a Nottingham Forest Supporter in front of me corrmented

the same.   I soon realised though that there was problems down there

and it was probably due to the overcrowding of the pens.     I then saw,

I believe, the Police Superintendent come out onto the pitch and speak

to the referee.     As aresult of this the players went off the pitch,

which confirmed    to me that there was problems.



I remained in my post where I observed Police Officers pulling people

up over the fences, people climbing out themselves and others being

pulled into theseating stand above.    These people after getting out

of the pens stayed at the top end of the pitch and I saw a line of

Police Officers form a line around about the half way.     I believe this

was in anticipation of preventing Liverpool supporters making

their way up to the 'Kop' end.     I had already seen two Liverpool

supporters running up to the KOP and sticking their fingers up, the

one was arrested and others began forming on the pitch, looking as

though they might cause trouble.



After a couple of minutes more, when there was about one hundred and

fifty people on the pitch I decided to go down to see if I could

assist someone.   By this time people were being carried off on

advertising boards.   Some appeared to be just injured but others it

was obvious they had died as they had articles of clothing covering

their heads.



I went 15) towards the goal where I saw a Police Officer kneeling over

a person who was lying on the pitch, giving him heart massage.    This

person was a white male aged about thirty of a plump build with brown
hair.    I knelt down and supported his head whilst the Police Officer

continued to try and revive him.    The Officer had obviously been doing

this some time and was quite distressed as he was crying.     After a

couple of more minutes the Officer stood up, took his tunic off and

dropped it over the man's face.    I summoned scmeone to bring an

advertising board over and we used this as a stretcher to carry this

dead man off the pitch.    We took him the full diagonal length of the

pitch up towards the Spion Kop.    We then went round the back of the

North Stand up to the gymnasium, where we were instructed to take him

off the boarding and carry him inside.    This we did and I quickly

returned up the pitch.    By this time I was in a complete daze, due to

shock and I can't give any more times or descriptions.     All I became

aware of was I made four or five trips to the gymnasium with dead

people on boardings.     Everywhere seemed to be sheer chaos and everyone

seemed to be in a state of panic.

The crowd after a while dispersed from the stadium and soon people on

the pitch began to disappear.     I remained in the ground until I was

instructed to leave.     I believe this may have been about 1730hrs

(1730), but as I have said, I was in a state of shock and can't be

sure of a lot of things.

I would describe myself as a white man aged       years, 5'8 tall, of

        build with       hair, and a moustache.   On the day I was

wearing                   jeans, and my stewards jacket.

DATED: 020589                                                            (SIGNED)



           I live at                                  Sheffield, with my ccmmon-

           law wife,       and my daughter,



           I am employed by Sheffield Wednesday Football Club as a Steward.      I

           have worked in this capacity for five years.   My posting has always

           been in the South Stand uncovered seating area.   It is my job to

           ensure that people sit in the correct seats and to prevent people

           from getting onto the pitch at the end of the game.



           On Saturday 15th April 1989 (150489,) the F.A. Cup Semi Final tie

           between Liverpool and Nottingham Forest was taking place at

           Hillsborough and I was required to work as a Steward at this game.



           I arrived at the ground at about ten past eleven (1110).   A briefing

           was held for the Stewards and we were spoken to by a Police Inspector.

           I do not know his name.   We were instructed not to get involved in

           any trouble and to request assistance from the Police if it was

           required.
I took up position on my post at about half past eleven( 1130).       It

was my usual post which is gangway 15 in the uncovered seating area

in the South Stand.



Fran my position I have a good clear view of the West Stand which is

about twenty five yards away.



At about half past twelve (1230) the turnstiles opened and supporters

began arriving.    I carried out my duties and noticed nothing

whatsoever out of the ordinary.    The South Stand, where I was posted,

had been allocated to Nottingham Forest supporters.



At about quarter to three (1445) I looked across at the West Stand and

noticed that the pens behind the goal were only half full.       The areas

to the sides were very sparse and there was plenty of room for more

supporters.    I thought this was strange as it was close to kick-off.

In the corresponding fixture last year, at this time, the West Stand

was full.



As the game kicked off, the area in the West Stand behind the goal was

full but there was still plenty of room at the sides.



After a few minutes of play Peter BEARDSLEY struck a shot which hit

the bar.    It was at this point there was a massive surge forward on

the West Stand terraces behind the goal.   As the people pushed forward

they were replaced from behind by people coning through the tunnel at

the back of the terraces.    It looked like nobody could move.    People

began pulling supporters up from the terraces to the seating area
                                                                           3


which is above.



I then noticed that people were climbing up on the fence.    A few

climbed fully over.   A line of police officers were pushing them back.

After a few moments the Police then began pulling people over the

fences and out of the crowd.     More and more people were climbing over

the fences.



I saw a police officer run onto the pitch and approach the referee.

The game stopped and the players and officials left the playing area.

I looked at my watch and saw the time was six minutes past three

(1506).



I then went down on the pitch.     I saw a young boy being carried by a

supporter and a policeman from the goal area over to where I was

standing which was about twenty five yards from the bye- line at the

edge of the pitch.



The policeman and the supporter put the young boy on the floor and I

walked over and stood a few feet away.     The policeman turned his head

to the side                                        , The police officer

then began mouth-to-mouth resusictation on the boy.     He was joined by

another officer who began pumping his chest.    The lad's eyes were half

open and he was pale and not moving.     The Police officer who

gave mouth-to-mouth got up                        A Nottingham Forest

supporter came out of the seating area and took over mouth-to-mouth.

The young boy then began breathing for about ten seconds but he then

stopped.   It looked like he had died.   A group of   people came over

with an advertising board placed the lad on it and took him to the far
 side of the ground.



 I would describe the people involved in the incident as follows



 The young boy was white, and not very tall, he had short brown hair.

 He looted aged between 10-14 years old.    He was wearing a Liverpool

 shirt and a denim jacket or shirt.   He had no shoes on.



 I can only describe the one police officer

          | He was aged about twenty and had black hair.    I think he

had a moustache.



The Nottingham Forest Supporter was aged between 25-30.     lie was a

white man who wore glasses.   I only glanced at him for a few seconds.

I cannot recall anythxng else.   It seemed to happen very quickly.



I was very distressed and waited away and went to the far end of the

ground.   I was crying and felt very bad.



I went to the Stewards' meeting room at the far end of the ground and

stayed there for about five minutes until I had calmed down.



I then came back out and I saw a Liverpool supporter trying to

remove an advertising board from the Kop.     I went over and helped him

pull it off.



I then went back to my previous position and saw that Nottingham

Forest and Liverpool supporters were hurling abuse at each other.       A

small fight broke out which lasted for a few seconds.    It was broken
________                                                                   5


 up by the supporters nearby.    About ten people were involved

 altogether.



 I saw a Nottingham Forest supporter who was shouting abuse.      I told

 him to leave the ground but he just pushed me away.



The scene on the pitch was one of utter chaos.     Bodies were still

being carried away on boards, scuffles were breaking out between the

Police and supporters.     I felt confused and upset.



 I comforted two young Liverpool supporters who were crying.      The

situation began slowly calming down.     I walked away from the pitch

after about half an hour.    I went and sat down and cried before making

my way home.



The incident at the time was confusing and it is difficult to recall

everything.




I have indicated on a plan of the ground my position when on duty and

where I saw the young lad being given mouth-to-mouth marked

(Exhibit No           ).



I would like to add that when the scuffles were breaking out between

supporters and the Police, there was a young skinhead running round

knocking policemen's helmets off.    Photographers were also being

pushed and jostled.



I would describe myself as a white male, five feet eight inches tall,
       with short brown hair and                    On the day of the match I was

       wearing blue jeans,                         and a yellow steward's coat.



                                                                      (sgd)

DATED: 290489                                                           (SIGNED)



           I am a single man and live at the above address with my parents.    I

       am a



       On Saturday 15th April 1989 (150489), I was engaged at Sheffield

       Wednesday's Football Club as a steward.      I have only done this once

       before and that was last year at the FA Cup Semi-Final as well.        When

       an important game is played at the ground the Club draft in extra

       people to steward the game.     My dad has been a steward

                and he got me the job for the day, on both occasions.   Last and

       this year I was posted in the clear area that runs the length of the

       South Stand between the stand and terraced area.     I was the only

       steward in that area and I had been given instructions to keep this

       area clear and to direct people to their seats.     I was never given any

       training to do this.



       I only live                                     and at about 10.30am

       (1030) I left home with my father, and together, we walked along

                                          Lappings Lane and into the football
                                                                          2


ground through the main entrance in Leppings Lane.



On the way to the football ground, I saw about fifty Liverpool

supporters in little groups of two's and three's.    They were well

behaved and I didn't really take a lot of notice of than.    I didn't

see any of than drinking alcohol.



Upon entering the ground my father and I walked round to the players

tunnel and into the stewards' room.    At about 11.25am (1125) I went to

the back of the South Stand with all the other stewards on duty in the

South Stand and terrace area, for a briefing with the Police and Chief

Steward,                 Hie Police Officer told us that we were not to

get involved with supporters who cause trouble and to fetch a Police

Officer if need be and point the offender out to than and they will

deal with it.     Then the Chief Steward informed us that if we heard the

name 'Mr MEADOWS' announced over the public address system, this was

the code for the evacuation procedure.    However, on Saturday this was

not used.     After the briefing, I collected my stewards' waistcoat from

the stewards' room and took up my position in the clear area at about

midday (1200).



I referred earlier to the clear area being between the South Stand and

South Terrace. It is known to local people as the terrace, but it is

all-seated.



The South Stand and terrace area were allocated to Nottingham Forest

supporters and up until about 1.00pm (1300) there was only a few

people in their seats, then after that time it started to get busy and

by kick-off time all the Nottingham Forest supporters were in their
_______________________________                                              3


seats.   Everything in the ground was as normal as the previous year

when I carried out the same duties.    There was no disorder or

drunkenness, only both sets of supporters chanting for their team.



At about 2.45pm (1445), as part of my duty, I left the clear sttps

and went to the back of what's known as the South Terrace to gangway

fifteen, which is the second gangway along from the West Terrace.        I

could not see out of the stadium at any time whilst I was working.

Upon taking up my position at the back of the gangway, I had a clear,

unobstructed view of all of the West Terrace and I saw that the centre

sections of the West Terrace was packed full and so was the raised

triangle beside the North Stand, but both left and right wings of the

West Terrace were quite empty; there were large gaps.      At this time I

also saw people leaning over from the West Stand, reaching down to

people in the Terrace area and lifting them up into the West Stand.

They were pulling one after another up into the stand.     At first it

was a steady trickle of people being lifted up and then it was one

after another.   I didn't think anything was wrong because this sort of

behaviour has occurred before.    I did not see people surge forward.

There was Police Officers positioned around the perimeter fence on the

track.   There was about 8 or 9 Police Officers.   There was a group of

Police Officers also standing under the scoreboard on the right side

of the West Terrace.   I can't remember how many though.



At about five minutes to kick-off, that would be 2.55pm (1455), both

teams came out on the pitch.   People were still being lifted into the

stand, but nobody was climbing the perimeter fence.   It was not until

just after the kick-off at 3.00pm (1500), that people started to

climb over the perimeter fence.   The Police on the track went up to
                                                                           4


the fence, but I could not see if they were trying to push them back

or trying to help them.   I didn't see the perimeter gates opened,

because within a short time there must have been a couple of hundred

people on the track and pitch before the game was stopped.



It was apparent to me at this stage that something serious was wrong,

because at first I thought that the area was full and they were

bringing them onto the pitch.   This has happened before when

Wolverhampton played Tottenham in a Semi-Final match.



I remained at the back of gangway fifteen for about fifteen to twenty

minutes. During this time I saw people carrying people out of the

terrace area.   They appeared unconscious.    Then people were being

carried out on advertising boards and being placed on the pitch.

There were people lying all over the place.     Some unconscious, some

were trying to get their breath, others were giving people the kiss of

life.   During this time the Police were trying to pull people over and

out of the terrace area, as well as giving the kiss of life to people.

The Fire Brigade arrived and came into the ground by the Police

Control Box.    They got onto the pitch by climbing into the terraced

area of the South Stand where I was.    The Police were stopping people

leaving the ground where the firemen came in, to keep it clear for

people being carried out of the West Terrace on stretchers.     Upon

seeing this I went to the edge of the South Stand near the Policemen

and started directing people, who wanted to leave, via that way to

leave, instead via the Kop end.    The only people I let past were

people looking for relatives.     I did this for about ten minutes, then

a woman approached me and told me that she was a doctor and could I

direct her down onto the pitch.     Instead of directing her I took her
________________________________                                              5


down onto the pitch.      I looked round to see if there was anything I

could do, but there was nothing I could do, everybody was being

attended to and I would have only got in the way, so I went to the

edge of the pitch and directed people away.      The only person that

sticks in ray mind was the young boy wearing silver coloured tracksuit

bottoms.    He had blonde hair.   A Policeman and a St John's

ambulanceman were giving him the kiss of life and trying to get him

revived for about twenty minutes to half an hour, and then as I

escorted the doctor on the field, he was carried off by ambulancemen

on a stretcher.   He looked as if he was dead.     I stayed on the edge of

the pitch directing people, until most people had gone and only the

stewards remained.    Then I went back to the players' tunnel and

stewards' room.    I handed in my waistcoat and collected any wages.      I

then waited for my father and then we both left the ground together.

We were about the last stewards to leave.     There were roads blocked

off lappings Lane and we were directed by the Police after leaving

the ground onto Penistone Road, then into Vere Road.     We then walked

along Leppings Lane



I am not aware if there is any policy on the opening of gates A, B or

C in lappings Lane prior to kick-off.     I am not provided with a radio.



The reason I went onto the pitch, as well as taking the doctor, was

also to see if I could help because I have been trained in first aid

and have a certificate.     I was sent for training by my previous

employer.



My hours of work for the game were from 10.45am (1045) until 4.45pm

(1645), for which I got paid.
 I didn't have to eject anyone from the ground and I never at any time

that day witnessed anybody drinking alcohol.



I didn't see any of the incidents that occurred outside the Leppings

Lane entrance or turnstiles and I could not see any of the gates.



I didn't see any crowd surge or a crush or see any barrier break.



I didn't witness any obstructive actions by fans to the Police,

stewards or other persons in authority during the disaster.    The

people getting in the way were the press taking photographs.



I was never threatened in any way or injured.



I saw a number of Liverpool supporters run the length of the pitch to

the Nottingham supporters in the Kop, stuck two fingers up at them and

then they ran back towards Leppings Lane end.    One of them was caught

by a Policeman and taken away.



I thought under the circumstances the situation was handled as best it

could have been.   I think better use of the public address system

could have been made.



From ray experience as a steward, at last year's Semi-Final, there was

no difference up until the kick-off this time.

           I am a married man living at                               with my wife.
        I am employed as a



        I am a steward at the Sheffield Wednesday ground and have been for

       the past 3 years.     My post is        which is situated between

       the



       My job on that post is to man the external               in the case of

       emergency and to open it for authorised people, the Police and people

       with passes.     There is also an internal fence gate between



                               which I also man.     This gate is used for transfer

       of supporters and authorised people.        Gates are those marked on the

       map Ref No        (Exhibit No      ).



       I normally man the gates with                       On   Saturday 15th April

       1989 (150489), I walked to the Hillsborough ground leaving heme at

       about 11 am (1100).     It takes me about      tninutes to reach the
 ground.   There were already quite a number of Liverpool supporters

about, I was asked if there were any pubs open and also offered

tickets once.



There was also a ticket tout in Leppings Laned, offering tickets

for sale to fans.    That tout had a wad of tickets about an inch thick.

I overheard him offer a standing ticket in the West Stand for #25.

he also had seating tickets in the West Stand, but I don't know what

the price was.



I arrived at the ground about 11.15 am (1115), I went and signed on

and got ray stewards coat.   I met     _           on the gate,

everything was normal on ray gate, the atmosphere was good.



At about 2.45 pm (1445), we were surprised at how empty pens 1 and 2,

5 and 6 were there was plenty of room.     By that time normally most

fans are normally in and the pens full.



At about 3 pm (1500) a fan came to us and asked if we could get a

first aid person for him as he had hurt his ankle.    He told us he

had ccme through an open gate in Leppings Lane.    He still had his

ticket.    I went into the Police Control and asked for a first aid

person.    As I was inside I saw on the monitor a gate was open and

loads of fans going through.    I then returned to ray post and a second

injured person came and the girl collapsed.    At about the same time

as I got back it would be 3.02 pm (1502) there was a rush of fans

coining from the leppings Lane area, about 200-300 who didn't seem to

know where they going. Some went into Pen 1, seme climbed on the

turnstile dblock 19-22 where you can see most of the ground from.
 At about the same tune I saw fans climbing over the fencing in Pens 3

 and 4 trying to get onto the pitch.    I thought it was a pitch

 invasion. There was no announcement as to what was happening.



 People continued to try to get onto the pitch whilst the game was on.

There were a lot of fans about where we were and no one seemed to

know what was happening.     There were a number of fans with minor

 injuries in the area.



The game was then stopped.     I saw Graham KELLY going into the police

box.   There were coins being thrown at him and loads of verbal abuse,

still no one knew what was happening.    There were loads of people

now on the pitch, and also people from outside trying to get into

the ground through



It became apparent that there was something drastically wrong.     I

went onto the pitch and tried to console people.    At first, I took

drinks of water, then went back to the gate.



I was on the gate most of the time.    At first they were bringing the

injured out on stretchers through our gate and the ambulances were

lining up outside and taking people off to hospital.



I did go onto the pitch during the afternoon again to take water and

on one occasion there was a camerman taking pictures.    He was being

punched by angry fans because he was more interested in taking

pictures than helping the injured.



About 4.30 pm (1630) most people had left the ground and we went onto
        the pitch again.



        I asked if I could do anything to one of the Policemen, because I

        couldn't I then went to the office and then left the ground.



        I was informed by the Police at about 2.50 pm (1450) that the kick-off

        was being delayed, but almost immediately I heard that the players

        came out onto the field and I assumed it wasn't going to be delayed.



        I have been a steward for 3 years and during that time I have attended

 •      the one meeting a year for stewards.   I consider the training I have

        received is totally inadequate which has now been proved right.

        There is no formal first aid training and too little corrmunication

        between stewards and the Police.




                                                                       SIGNED

DATED: 010589                                                            (SIGNED)



           I am a married man and live at the above address with my wife.       I have

           lived in my present home for six years, but have lived in Sheffield

           all ity life.



           I support Sheffield Wednesday Football team and have been a regular

           attendant since I was 11 years old.



           I am employed as a

           where I have worked for ten years.    Prior to this, I worked for

                                  Whilst with            I attended several courses

           in first aid and gained a St John's Ambulance first aid qualification.



           For the past eight or nine years I have been employed as a Steward at

           Sheffield Wednesday Football, which is situated in Hillsborough, which

           is a suburb of Sheffield.   When I joined the Club as a Steward I was

           given a Steward's identity pass and booklet giving the fixture dates

           and receipts for payment for duty.    About two years ago this was

           altered and I had to give the club a passport-type photograph which
was put onto an identity pass.    This pass gives the area I work which

is shown as 'Gateman', and allows access throughout the ground.     I am

also issued with a mustard coloured waistcoat which displays the words

'Sheffield Wednesday FC Steward' on the left side.     I am paid #12 per

game.



My posting as a gateman is to gate 'N'. This is a small gateway which

is lockable by a sliding bolt and prevents passage by fans between the

seating and standing areas under the Spion Kop Stand.    The gate is

situated beneath the Stand and I man it, together with another Steward

I know as        My job on this gate is to prevent fans from getting

through and allow police officers to walk between the stands, and to

open the gate during an emergency.



I have not received any instructions as to using the gate, but have

attended all Stewards' meetings held at the ground, during which we

are told locations of fire extinguishers, medical staff and police

officers for each game.     I was also told that should a password be

announced over the Tannqy, that being "Mr MEADOWS", all Stewards

should report to their gates and unlock and open them to assist in

evacuating the stand.     I am posted to this gate as a permanent post.



From my post I do not have a view of the pitch, but have a good view

through the turnstiles and out into Penistone Road.     These turnstiles

are in the region of number 70-71.     During home games, the gate is

manned by either myself or           We take it in turns to watch one

half of the match each.



On Saturday 15 April 1989 (150489), I was to work at Sheffield
_________________________________                                          3


Wednesday Football Club, as a Steward for an F A Cup Semi-Final game

between Liverpool and Nottingham Forest.     The terracing under which I

work I knew had been allocated to Nottingham Forest fans.



Two weeks prior to this date I worked as a Steward at the Club, at

which time I was given a sheet of paper giving me the time I was to

start work on 15 April 1989 (150489).



At 11.30am (1130) on Saturday 15 April 1989 (150489) I attended at the

ground, signed in in the office and went up to my post where I met

       who was already there.



I was wearing my yellow waistcoat, together with my identity card.



In the process of my employment we have directives from the Club that

unless there is an emergency, no gate should be opened until about

twenty minutes before the end of the game.



From my gate I could see two Police Officers on the turnstiles, but

outside the ground, not inside.     I could see that they were searching

fans and taking flags and cans of beer from fans before they could get

into the ground.



During the time between 11.30am (1130) and 2.58pn (1458) I could see

lots of fans walking past the turnstiles carrying four packs of beer

cans and drinking from cans.    I could also see what appeared to be

ticket touts outside the ground, close to Monty's Motors.    I could see

that tickets were changing hands.
There was a steady flow of fans through the turnstiles, although it

was quite slow until about 2.20pm (1420).



At this time it began to get busier outside and there was queuing at

the turnstiles.   I was not continually looking at the turnstiles, just

looking over at regular intervals or if I heard something unusual.



At about 2.20pm (1420) I heard one of turnstile operators shout, "Eh,

stop him he hasn't got a ticket."   I looked across and saw a youth who

I can't describe, jumping over the turnstile.    He then ran into the

ground.



I then saw a second youth wearing a leather jacket, purple in colour,

and a green jumper, running from one of the turnstiles.    He was

shouting "Liverpool, Liverpoool." He was running around shouting,

"Liverpool, we're the fucking champions."



The Police saw him and about five to ten minutes later I saw two

Police Officers throwing him out of the end Gate in Penistone Road.      A

short time later, I saw the same youth again.    He was back inside the

ground and still chanting.   Within a few moments, the Police Officers

who were in the ground, threw him out again.



Whilst watching the turnstiles, I saw several incidents of fans coming

to the operative on the gate and offering them amounts of cash to let

them in. I could see #10 notes on the counter.    I did not see anyone

let in for payment, but there were several offers made.    This is not a

correct procedure, as this particular match was an all-ticket game.




                                                                             340
_________________________________                                            5


Up until 2.58pm (1458), which was when I left the gate, I could see

large numbers of fans walking past the turnstiles to walk towards

the opposite end of the ground.    They were wearing Liverpool

colours and chanting slogans, many were still drinking and carrying

cans of beer.     I witnessed a number of Liverpool fans coming into the

Spion Kop Stand.     I know that they were Liverpool fans as several

came up to me and asked if they could go from the standing area into

the seats, as the fans in my stand were from Nottingham.     I told than

that they could not move between areas.



One fan came to me several times complaining that he was being abused,

because he supported Liverpool and shouldn't have been in that section

of the ground.



At about 2.58pm (1458) I left the gate, as I was going to watch the

first half of the football game, but I first wanted to get a hamburger

to eat.



I walked along the passageway beneath the stands into the area beneath

the North Stand, where the nearest hamburger stall is situated.    As I

reached it, I saw about 100 fans supporting Liverpool running along

the passageway and into the Cantilever Stand.



I can only assume that an exit gate had been opened at the Leppings

Lane end of this Stand because of the amount of people en mass.



I then walked up onto the side of the pitch between the North Stand

and the Spion Kop.    This is the position where a number of police

officers stand.    I was shown a map of the ground by PC               and
have marked onto it the position I was stood, with a number 2 (Marked

        (Exhibit Number       ).



At about 3.06pra (1506), same day, I was walking to the above position.

I could see that the game had started and obviously I had heard the

chanting of the supporters.        I saw a Police Officer on the pitch

talking to the referee.   A few seconds later the Referee blew his

whistle and indicated to the players, by pointing his hand towards the

players' tunnel, for them to leave the pitch.



I looked towards the West Stand and could see that there were fans on

the pitch.    I could see a number of fans climbing the fencing and it

appeared that Police Officers were trying to get them to go back onto

the standing terracing of the West Stand.        I believed that the Police

were going to open the gate set into the fencing and move fans from

the centre area behind the goal-mouth to either side, where there was

more space.



I was approached by a member of the St John's Ambulance, who told me

that there were a number of seriously injured people in the West Stand

and wanted to know how to get the ambulance through onto the pitch.



The only way to get the ambulance in, was to knock down the

advertising hoardings in front of where I was standing.       Together with

several other Stewards, I knocked down the hoardings and the ambulance

was driven in.



The St John's Assistant asked me to go to the West Stand and assist

them.   This I did.
                                                                         7




As I ran to the West Stand end of the ground, I could see that the

fans in Pens 3 and 4 of West Stand were packed solid, with fans at the

front of these pens being pushed tightly against the fence.



There was about 150-200 fans already on the pitch, milling around, and

I could see that fans were being lifted up from the standing area onto

the ledge of the seating area above, by fans in that area.



I could also see that a small piece of fencing had been pulled back,

but the gap in it was not very big.



I could see a number of bodies lay on the ground, some were being

treated by fans and Police Officers.



I could see a number of Police Officers being pushed whilst they were

trying to give resuscitation to fans on the floor.   Fans who were

walking around were also spitting at the Police Officers.



As I got closer I could see that many of the people lay on the ground

were obviously dead.



The first thing I did was to look at the bodies to see if any were

breathing.   Most I saw were blue faced and I knew they were dead or

the others were being treated.



I was approached by a Police Officer who asked me to help him with the

body of a young lad.   I would describe him as about 5'4" tall, 14/

16yrs old, wearing denim jeans that were nearly white, baseball shoes
                                                                           8


and I believe a red coat.   His face was covered by a coat or

something.



I picked the boy up by his legs with the Police Officer at his

shoulders and put him onto an advertising hoarding.    Then, together

with several other people, carried him to a space at the rear of the

Disabled toilet in the North Stand next to an ambulance, where we laid

him on the floor.



Another body was brought in after that and laid beside the boy I had

helped carry.



I then returned to near to Pen 3, where I assisted several firemen to

carry another boy whose face was covered up away.     This time we took

the body to the seats in the South Stand and passed him over to

several firemen, one of which I know as



I returned to close by the goalpost.   As I did I saw a young girl

wearing a pair of white trousers with pink in them, and a red silky

style jacket.   Her trousers were undone,                        and her

top was rolled up revealing her stomach. I could see that there were

large bruises on her stomach, and I then noticed that her arms were

twisted in funny ways and they appeared to me to be broken.     Her face

was also covered up.



About five to six feet away I saw another body, this time a young man

about twenty.   He had a moustache, his eyes were half open and I could

see tears formed on the side of his eyes. He was wearing a navy blue

jumper which was rolled up and was holding his arms up against his
_________________________________                                            9


chest.



A short distance from him was the tody of a roan about 60 yrs old.      He

had a moustache and was wearing a light coloured jumper.    Again he was

obviously dead.     I saw a picture of this man in the Daily Mirror

newspaper several days later - only in the picture he was alive.

There was someone lying above him who appeared to be trying to bring

him back to life.



I then saw a girl lay on the ground.     She was wearing a white 't'

shirt and was being treated by a man who said he was an off-duty

Police Officer.     He told me this when I told him that he didn't have

her head back far enough.     There was a man stood close by who then

said, "I hope you know what you're doing, that's my daughter, Vicky,

cane on." I then heard fans frcm the crowd shouting, "Come on, get

her tits out for the boys."



A St John's Ambulanceman then cams up and the Policeman asked him for

sane oxygen.   He didn't have any, so the Policeman asked the same of a

Fireman close by.    He handed over a cylinder which was found to be

empty.   The Fireman then said, "What do you expect, I've already used

it on at least six people.     It only lasts about twenty minutes."    An

ambulance arrived and everything became a bit chaotic but I saw

this girl being put into the Ambulance.



Whilst this was going on, there were a large amount of fans walking

round shouting abuse at the Police and spitting at than.



I then saw two more bodies.    These were men, both of large build,
                                                                           10

whose faces were blue.    They had both vomited and this was covering

their faces.    From this, I believed they had been drinking.



A couple of girls from the Club's office came out onto the pitch with

jugs of water and I remember having a drink of it, then going to the

centre of the pitch and talking to some other Stewards.     I, at this

time, had had enough.    I was feeling ill.   I had a headache and I was

in somewhat of a daze.



I cannot remember much more about it, as I was somewhat in shock and

was sweating.   Whilst I was helping move the bodies, I had a number of

fans shouting and swearing at me saying, "You fuckin' Stewards caused

this," and "You should have given us the other end."



I also saw several fans fighting on the pitch.     I left the ground at

5.30pm (1730), at which time the Liverpool fans were still leaving but

there was nothing more that I could do.



I would like to make the observation that I saw Police Officers

pulling people out of the crowd and were pushing than to one side,

before checking if they could be assisted further medically.



I also saw during the problems after the game, a line of Police

Officers were used to cordon off the pitch.    I feel that they should

have been used to assist the injured and dying.    I also believe that

there were fewer Police inside the ground.



I cannot understand why the gate in Leppings Lane was opened because

it is obvious that fans who are fanatical about football will run
                                                                        11

towards the nearest entrance to get to the terraces, especially when

the game has started and this is what they appear to have done.



I would also like to say that I heard a number of fans frcm Liverpool,

about 20, said to me and were showing off to cameras from BBC

Television, saying that they had got into the ground either without

tickets or on forged ones.



Whilst every assistance was being given by a number of people, I saw

photographers and pressmen taking photographs of the dead bodies,

instead of helping themselves.   There were also a number of fans going

around pushing people who were assisting the injured.



I was earlier shown a map of the ground on which I marked my position

in the ground at the start of my tour of duty.   This is (marked____

(exhibit number        ).



I would also like it known that seme time ago the Tannoy system in ray

area wasn't working.   This was brought to the Club's attention and

rectified.   However, I did not hear any emergency message on the day

of this event.

Dear John,

My constituents,. Mr. & Mrs. Devine, of
have been in touch with me about the administration of the Hillsborough
Disaster Appeal Fund.   Mr. Devine is a retired police officer whose son,
Andrew, was seriously injured at Hillsborough.   He has been in a coma ever
since and is medically in a Persistive Vegatative State.

I visited them recently and have been in extensive correspondence with the
Trustees of the Hillsborough Disaster Appeal Trust.     I met with them on
Wednesday of this week and you will see from the attached letter to Mr. &
Mrs. Devine that I am extremely unhappy about the general principal on
which trusts of this nature operate.  More than £12 million was raised for
the Discretionary Fund and a further £2 million for the Charitable Fund.
The secrecy of which the funds are administered and the general lack of
accountability raises a number of disturbing problems.     But, as you will
see from my letter to Mr. & Mrs. Devine little consideration is actually
given to long term needs.     Quite a lot of the money has been blown on
abortive legal actions and many of the families were given no suitable
financial advice at the time that substantial sums of money were given to
them.   While I recognise that it is impossible to entirely tie the money
given to victims and their families it would be sensible to work out some
guidelines about the way in which such money should be used.        I cannot
believe that those who gave the money would have wanted it to be spent on
years of litigation (benefitting only lawyers) or on fast cars etc.   As you
can imagine, this is intensly distressing to a family like the Devine's who
continue to care for Andrew in their home - and who have shown remarkable
stamina and commitment.

questions which this matter raises and to take whatever action you deem
appropriate.

Yours sincerely,

Mr. & Mrs. Devine,




28th July,   1994




Dear Mr. & Mrs. Devine,

I promised you that I would seek a meeting with Mr.Reddington and the
Hillsborough Disaster Appeal Trustees.     On Wednesday morning I met Mr.
Reddington, Derek Morris, and Michael Blankstone and spend 90 minutes in
fairly intensive discussion and not little disagreement.

The principal points which I raised centered on the issues you brought up
with me during our meeting.   I complained about the absence of a contingency
fund, the lack of accountability, the arbitrariness of the dispensations, and
the failure to consider the long term needs of people in Andrew's position.
I also raised the general management of Disaster Funds and the lessons which
might be learned for the future.

At the end of our meeting there had been little common ground but there was
certainly  no   doubt  about  your  strength  of  feeling   concerning  the
 administration of the Trust Fund.

 I challenged the basis on which a Descretionary Trust was established and the
 secrecy which has accompanied its administration.     They countered this by
 claiming that they had consulted widely with all those involved in previous
 disaster funds (e.g. Bradford) and that the most important consideration for
 them had been "flexibility".

 They cited the example of the Abbervan Disaster Fund, which had been a
 Charitable Trust Fund, and they claimed that the Trustees had been so tied by
 the terms of reference of the Charitable Trust that they simply "couldn’t get
 rid of the money".

 They admitted that this led to them paying tax on the interest generated by
 the £11.6 million in the discretionary fund.  However, they also claim that
 they came to an unofficial arrangement with the Exchequer and the interest
 was ultimately transferred to the Charitable Trust.    The Charitable Trust
 totalled about £2 million (£600,000 from donations, £375,000 from interest
 £340,000 from the unpaid tax, and £626.000 which was transferred).  Of this,
 £100,000 remains which has not been distributed.     I suggested that this
 should be used to set up a contingency fund, from which annuities could be
 paid and help given where long term needs become clear.




                IIOUSI1' OF COMMONS TICL: 071-219 3454 - FAX: 071 219 .'Will
I specifically complained about the use of mon e y for residuary purposes while
there are victims families who are still in need.      Mr. Morris commented at
this point:   I can understand that point of       view and it is    not one we
overlooked."  However, it was clearly one w it h which he disagreed and he and
Mr. Reddington made a point of saying that there had been no objection from
consultantees."  I specifically asked who had been representing the views of
the injured and he said that there was no group.       I asked whether you had
been consulted and, of course, he had to confirm that you had not.

I also made a point, at R o b i n ’s suggestion       (and he was good enough   to
provide me with a superb b r i e f ) , about the way in which substantial parts of
the Trust money had been dissipated in legal actions.       The trustees confirmed
that they were aware that money had been used for such purposed but they said
" it is not the role of trustees to decide how the money is going to be
used."   Personally, I think that there needs to be a better balance struck
in the administering of these Disaster Funds between this               hands off
approach and one which seeks to specifically tie how every single penny is
spent.

Although they were full of all the sympathies that you would      expect I cannot
say that they satisfactorily addressed the points which I        raised and I am
going to copy this correspondence to the Prime Minister in       the hope that he
might ask the appropriate Government Minister to consider        the handling of
future Trust Funds set up in the wake of disasters.

Yours sincerely,

           THE USE OF TRUSTS IN THE DISASTER APPEAL -JEHB

                               HILLSBOROUGH EXPERIENCE



This     document         produced         by     Alsop    Wilkinson       is      extremely

interesting and should be read in conjunction with the interim

report of the trustees of April 1990.



The following points emerge from this documentation:-



1. The Fund raising over                   £12 million         was   "far and away the

largest domestic disaster fund ever raised in this Country".



2. In general the public perception of disaster funds is that

they are      charitable funds".



The    fact   that     payments        to       express   sympathy       grief   and      loss

rather     than      to       meet    actual       financial      need     would     not     be

possible      from        a    charitable         fund    does    not     mean     that     the

primary       purpose         of     the    donations      and,      indeed,       the     real

expectation       of          the     donors       was    to     seek     the    needs       of

the victims.



3. By the time that the Trust Deed had been executed over

£800, 000 had been received and no one who had donated money

would wish to (or indeed did) seek to reclaim their donation

on the basis that the minutiae of the trust fund documentation

should be contrary to the fundamental purpose of the fund as

perceived by the outside world.



                                                  3
 4.     The   uncertainty              of what was involved was                  clear       from   the

 start.        The potential' beneficiaries (unlike in the case of the

 Penlee Life Boat Disaster) were not known and nor were their

 needs.        This, clearly, should have been a warning to                                   the HDAT

 that     problems             which     had    not    been        encountered         in     previous

 disaster appeals might have to be faced.



  5. It is clear that there could have been a number of similar

  disaster funds dealing with the same situation.                                     The fact that

  those       who        would      otherwise       have         formed    a     separate       appeal

  coordinate          their         efforts     does       not    alter    the    fact       that   the

  appeal      fund        which        was   created was           a   private     fund       entirely

  unaccountable                to    anyone     and        not     subject       to     any     public

  scrutiny.



  6. The Hillsborough Disaster Appeal Trustees set up 2 separate

  funds.       A     discretionary             non-charitable           trust     which       received

  the    overwhelming majority of the donations and which did                                        not

  give    rise       to any tax problems ^as no donations                             to    that    fund

  were     adversely            effected       by   its     non-charitable             status^ - The

  second       fund       which        was   created        was    a    'charity       fund'       which

  received donations from charity and which attracted charitable

  relief.           It    is     not    clear what         charities       (if    any)       gave

donations        to       the       charitable         fund        [this       point       should     be

  clarified]          and what part of the donations to                           the       charitable

  fund were made by individuals seeking tax relief on charitable

  donations.




                                                       4
 The charitable           fund has not been used for the direct benefit

 of    the victims        and,    on reflection,      should perhaps         have   been

 kept entirely separate (i.e. with different trustees from the

 main fund) .        If this had been done then the trustees of the

 main fund would have had to have had regard for the entirety

 of the needs of the victims before deciding to make charitable

 donations from monies collected.                 For example, income has been

 transferred to the charitable fund (so as to reclaim the tax)

 when it may have been more appropriate to have used the income

[less    tax) for     the        benefit   of   the   victims    rather      than     the

 entirety of the income for charitable purposes.



 6. The trustees identified the following problems



 (i)    The problems of young widows and other who were not used

 to dealing        with large       sums of money receiving huge sums which

 they would        not be ableto handle in a suitable             way;



 (ii) Minors who           receive damages in civil claims which had to

 be deal with in a way which met sought approval and so there

 would    be   2    separate       funds   available     to    meet    the    needs    of

 minors who were victims of the disaster                      (whether directly or

 indirectly        because of a parent being killed in the disaster);



 (iii)    That there were           parents     who had lost a child and would

 not receive anything other than funeral expenses if the child

 was    over   18    or    would only have        a small      claim    (£3, 500)     for

 bereavement if the child was under 18 years old.
                                                                                                   (I


’"7-           The problems of the Andrew Devine case and other problems

       about       future   needs   and contingencies          were   not    tackled     in    a

       suitable and satisfactory way.



   ■         The    techinical summary and the general                approach    of    Alsop

       Wilkinson       is   of   interest.      For    example,       they   refer     to     Mr

       Reddinton's involvement as proving to be "a major contribution

       to the5#gcess of the trustees'                 work";    ,     £learly,    the    most

       major       victims'lpf   anyone   who   survived       the    disaster)

       family were completely dissatisfied with Mr Reddington and his

       approach.



C\- In the summary of techinical conclusions there is reference to

       one   combined appeal which does have advantages but                       also      has

       disadvantages.

2. The    advantage       of    having       a       discretionary         fund     giving       a

complete    discretion         as     to who         should benefit         and     how       they

should    benefit       does    not    mean          that    the    trustees      should        be

completely unaccountable for their approach (as they are)                                      and

should     not    rciean that       they     are      entitled       to    deal     with       the

distribution       of     approximately               12     million       pounds        in     an

unsatisfactory way.



3. The charitable funds are of relatively minor significance.

As    is clear from the fact that the charitable funds have not

yet    been distributed in their entirety the trustees                               are,       in

effect,    looking for ways            .. which they consider to be suitable

to dispose of such monies.                  Clearly, the fundamental intention

of    donors     over    5 years       ago was         not    to    provide       monies       for

general charitable purposes but was to provide benefit to the

victims of the disaster.



4.    A detailed breakdown             of    the charges,           expenses       and     other

deductions       has    not    been    provided            (point   2 of    your     original

letter to Alsop Wilkinson).                  For example, why is it shown how

much has been charged or paid to Alsop Wilkinson/Mr. Morris.                                     In



                                                 7
a    fund which          has    been    collected        from      the   public (in a very

public      wayj it       does    seem     strange          that    those    who   have    made

monies       out    of     the - fund      are     not      prepared        to   specifically

identify what they have made.                     After all, the banking of such

large sums of money                        be of such considerable benefit to

the    bank        instructed      and     yet     the       benefit      which    they     have

received         and     their    involvement          is    not    shown (^and     they     are

connected with the trusteesij^fther clarification and public

scrutiny of these aspects is appropriate.



4. The charitable trust seems to be far removed from the main

discretionary trust               in that the benefit of                     donations      from

that trust are not for the direct benefit of victims of the

disaster but are for general purposes.                             It does not seem to be

appropriate            that      the      same     trustees          should        have     been

responsible            for^funds          with     different             objectives.         The

distinction between the                  2 funds should have been highlighted

by     having       separate           trustees    and        administration.             Whilst

charitable             donations are, by their very nature, regarded as

being beneficial that does not mean that they are synonymous

with       the    intention       of     helping    victims         of    the    Hillsborough

Disaster.



5.    So    far     as    the    principles       of     operation        and    distribution

established by            the    trustees        are concerned           a number     of    them

raise grave concern.               These are as follows



(a) Whilst the fact that there has been unequal suffering and

hardship and that thee was not to be an equal distribution to
            all     those    affected        its     principle was not        put     into       practice.

            (b)     The     decision       to    make   payments      by   way      of    capital        sums

            rather than making payments over a number of years and to make

            payments        as quickly as possible was a mistake.                             Firstly,    the
I           needs     take     time    to       identify      and,    secondly

                                                                          Hit--1
            income or smaller sums                   in the earlier years'* would have                   been

            greater resources available to deal with needs which identify

            themselves        with     the      passage    of time      and    also       to    deal     with

            contingencies.            If     the     trustees      have been     patient          (as    they

            should have been) then the long term needs of certain victims

            could have been catered for rather than having the entirety of

            the funds distributed.



            (c)     The fact that there was                   confidentiality as to whom                   the

            distributions were made and the amounts of the distributions

            maybe beneficial           in certain respects but means that there                             is

            no accountability for what the trustees have done nor is there

            any scrutiny as to whether their approach has been appropriate

             (for     the     benefit           of    other       situations).           It     is      rather

            ^convenient' for the trustees that they are not accountable or



                                                              9

scrutinised in any way.



(d)    The        fact    that, it      would          have   been    impossible       for      the

trustees        to see all of the potential beneficiaries                             does     not

mean that they should not see any of them.                              There were a very

small number of very seriously injured victims such as Andrew

Devine *-m s        case has raised considerable practicable problems.




(f)    The        HDAT    appear      to     be    complacent        with     regard      to    the

information          required        to make a decision.                For    example,        Mr.

Morris      says the trustees considerdthe written representations

made by E Rex Makin                  & Co    (first paragraph on page                 3 of     the

letter       of    20th     May      1994)    and       yet   he     admits    in   the      first

paragraph on the fourth page of the same letter that they did

not    seek any information on compensation awards                              nor    do      they

wish       to     know     what      would        be    received.        It    is    hardly       a

satisfactory state of affairs for a matter of such importance

to    be   dealt         with   in    such a cavalier              way before       reaching      a

decision.

the       panacea       which Alsop    Wilkinson    claim.       There    would        have

been      a lot to say for the main fund holding onto the monies

before creating a multitude of                            which have only added

to the expense of dealing with matters.                   If the trust fund had

been held together for a longer period then the real needs of

the       beneficiaries        could   have been met       and    a    more     informed

decision as to how much each beneficiary really needed taken

with       the benefit of what was actually required.                     Whilst,        in

some cases          it may well have been appropriate to have                    vested

large capital sums this does not mean that it was appropriate

in every case.



Administering             individual     trusts                   be an        extremely

expensive business.                Indeed, Messrs. Alsop Wilkinson ^although

they are Solicitors who act as professional trustee^) were not

prepared       to       act as trustees of such a trust               because    of     the

problems       which are involved.          By paying capital            sums over to

other trustees the Hillsborough Disaster Appeal Trustees would

ensure       that       they   would   not be    criticised      if    anything        went

wrong [or         if     the beneficiaries       criticised      the charges       which

would be involved in administering such a trust^ because                                the

Hillsborough            Disaster    Appeal Trustees would say            that    it was

not       their     responsibility       having    paid    the    monies        over     to

others.        If the HDAT felt that such trusts                  were    appropriate

then       it would have cost considerably less                  if    they were        the

trustees       of       such   funds CLf the     administrative        costs    and     the

sort of problems which arose would have been dealt with by the

same people.             The advantages which they            \X/      for themselves

distributing the^fund.




                                                                Indeed,    if a trust fund

of     the   sort    envisaged          by     the       HDAT    had    been      set   up     the

administrative        problems           and       the     additional       costs       involved

would have been extremely damaging.




(j ) Whilst the trustees were advised not to base their method

of    distribution        upon     the       law     relating      to     compensation         for

personal     injury       or    debt     they      have to         have    some     method      of

distributing        the    monies       which        they held.         The WiLfyocl which

they    employed      really       was       not     satisfactory.           Firstly,        they

recognised that parents of a single child who was killed did

not    have any claim           (if the child was over 18 years                         old)    or

would only have a small claim (£3,500)                            if a child ^was under

the age of 18 years. £fcf/>eral expenses would be recoverable as

part    of   a   civil         claim.        The     Hillsborough         Disaster       Appeal

Trustees      paid       funeral    expenses     in any     event    notwithstanding

the fact that these would be recovered as part of any civil

claim (j.n any event^ '• The             fact that the trustees came to the

conclusion that they ought to recognise the fact that persons

had been bereaved seems to have been^blown out of proportion

and has,      in itself,        caused problems.          The reality is that          in

financial terms thet parents of single children have suffered

no   loss    or,    at most,        suffered a limited loss           (e.g.    if    they

have taken time of work to overcome the grief).                           The fact that

substantial        payments        were made to such         grieving      parents    has

enabled them to pursue with considerable vigour further legal

proceedings        (e.g. to reopen the inquestj and this may not have

been   productive          in psychological terms           for   them . Whilst        it

may well      be that parents            will never come to          terms    with    the

grie^       suffered on the loss of a child it does seem that the

grieA       has    been    fuelled    by   the    funding    of     the    Hillsborough

Disaster Appeal Trustees rather than being alleviated by more

sensitive         and    sensible    use   of    resources    and    approach       (e.g.

Counselling^ • This may well be an unpalatable view point but

should      have        been   obvious     to    anyone    with     experience       with

dealing with ^ t a l injury litigation.

         CORRESPONDENCE FROM THE HILLSBOROUGH DISASTER APPEAL

           TRUST AND MR REDDINGTON'S APPROACH AND ATTITUDE




Notwithstanding          great efforts     to convey to        the    trustees the

reality      of   the    situation   and      the   factthat    the    needs    and

contingencies to take a greatdeal of time                      to establish such

matters were ignored.



 The trustees s.imply wanted toget matters ^wound up" as quickly

 as   possible     and   did   not   understand orappreciate           that     the

 civil    claim would      not   cover all of the         needs.       There   were

1 indirect' victims who had to sacrifice a great deal who would

 not be covered by any civil claim and a prognosis and catering

 for the contingencies which would arise could not be forecast

 at   that    stage      (or, indeed,      even     now   5    years     after the

 disaster).

                   HILLSBOROUGH DISASTER APPEAL
                   MAIN DISCRETIONARY TRUST DEED


This is a long complex document.

It is <Jb4»i^Wthat anyone other than the trustees or other persons
directly connected with the administration of the trust would have
considered the document before making a contribution to the fund.
This fact could be confirmed with the trustees.    If so, then it is
clearly illusory for the trustees to indicate thatjfcnations w
the basis of what was set out in that document
                   THE HILLSBOROUGH DISASTER CHARITABLE TRUST


     This    is    a    long    document   which                gives   the     trustees
substantial        powers      to   distribute   monies   for    general      charitable
purposes** commemoration for those who died in the disaster and the
"generosity of donors to the trust fund".


It is hard to imagine that persons who made donations did so on the
basis that their donation for the benefit of the victims would not
be    used   for       such   purpose   but would be used to        commemorate      the
generosity of making a donation that was not used for the purpose
for which it was given !

                    THE HILLSBOROUGH DISASTER APPEAL TRUST
                             REPORTS AND ACCOUNTS


The main report to consider is the interim report of the trustees.
So far as the accounts are concerned notes for the accounts to the
year ended 3 0th June 1992 are of interest. In particular, it is set
out that the discretionary trust was closed on 5th June 1992                  (i.e
only three years after the disaster).


It is not clear what is meant by the charitable trus^giving a lien
in   respect   of    any   further   liabilities   which   may   arise   on   the
discretionary trust\ The trustees should be asked to clarify what
is meant by this.

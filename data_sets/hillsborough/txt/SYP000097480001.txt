            Dear     Stuart,

            INQUIRY

            Having        given       some       thought        to       the      points       raised         y e s t e r d a y ,b o t h    by

            might        be    helpful          to    put    one      or     two     points      on     paper'.

            So     far    as    the       opening        statement             is    concerned,          'although           the    t on e       a id

            appear        prejudicial                in v a r i o u s      respects,.. I t h i n k             we     should       Keep, in

            Firstly,           and    pe r n a p s      most    significantly,                  it -was a c c e p t e d         that        the

            decision           lo    open       Gats     C , in o r d e r           to   relieve        pressure          outside           the

            turnstiles,              was    a    proper        ana       necessary            decision,          in    the

            c i r cumstances,               T h i s s t a t e m e n t m u s t r e f 1 set             t h e o v e r w h s I rni n g        co n t e n t

adverted            to       the       potential             problems              which             would        have         ensued          :i.f    there

had     been        a    confrontation                      of    fans        on       the       pitch           and      described              the

placement               of    this          cordon          as    *n e c e s s a r y * .               It     follows              that,     this       part

of    the      operation                is       a l s o .•■uni i k e l y      to       come           in     for      any         serious

criticism               and       I    am     sure       that         this     will             come        as    a     relief          to    David

succeed          in     keeping            t ® 'his        timetable,               matters              can' s u r e l y        be     arranged

Dear Stuart,

 Inquiry

Having given some thought to the points raised yesterday, both by
Counsel to the in quiry and by the first witnesses, 1 felt that it
might be helpful to put one or two points on paper.

So far as the ope ning statement is concerned, although the tone did
appear prejudicia 1 in various respects, 1 think we should lj;eep in
mind that many of the comments made were favourable from on r point
of view.

Firstly, and perh aps most significantly, .it was accepted ttliat the
decision to open gate C, in order to relievo pressure outside the
turnstiles, was a proper and necessary decision, in the
circumstances,  Tl"
                  his statement must reflect the overwhelmi iig content
of the evidence r eceived by the inquiry to date.

S e c o n d l y , comment was passed about the forming of the cordcj>n across
the centre of the pitch, which has been criticised by some
supporters as bei ng wasteful of Police manpower.         Counsel t.o the
inquiry adverted to the potential problems which would haves ensued
if there had been a confrontation of fans on the pitch and described
the placement of this cordon as "necessary".          It follows th at this
part of the opera tion is also unlikely to come in for any Serious
criticism and I api sure that this will come as a relief to Davi d
Chapman.


                                                                                                                                                     /.   .. contd

Thirdly, Counsel |uo the inquiry, whilst critical, of arrange ments for
distribution of supporters between the pens making up the Ijeppings
Lane terracing, whs at pains to emphasise that arrangements inside
the ground were primarily a matter for the Club

So far as points of criticism are concerned, those which we re made
by Counsel in his opening statement and which caused some i rri tat.ion
do appear to be btised on evidence which is to be called frc m the
supporters.

The specific poin   which were covered. by evidence yesterdajy and the
evidence to be ca led again today were as follows:


       3..'   An impression that there were loss Police than las
              year at a distance from the ground, i.e. between
              the parking areas and the perimeter gates.          The of
              duty Merseyside PoJ.ice Officer who gave evidence
              first sa|d that he saw very few Officers between
              parking his car somewhere in Halifax Road and the
              outside <bf the ground.        Those that he did see were
              standing in groups at road junctions or manning
              the barriers which prevent access to the small
              residential streets to the immediate north of the
              g r o u n d . He contrasted this situation with last
              year, wh<fen he claimed to have arrived at
              approximately the same time, or perhaps a little
              e a r l i e r , and had seen many Officers checking
              t i c k e t s , giving directions and turning back fans
              who could not produce tickets.

              At the ground itself, the Merseyside Officer^and
              the other witnesses^) who 'gave evidence yesterday
              claimed to have seen only two mounted Officers and
              no other Police presence at all, until he got
              inside the ground.     Bill Woodward was able to
              knock this witness back a little in cross
              examination, by showing him timed photographs
              taken between 2.25 p.m. and 2.30 p.m., showing a
              large amount of Officers outside the ground at
              that time?.    However, he maintained that, whatever
              those photographs might show as to the position up
              to 2.30 ji>.m. , he on]y saw the two mounted Officers
              when he ^rrived at 2.45 p.m. Other witnesses give
              a broadly similar account.

              The Merseyside Officer, and so far one other
              witness (but others are to follow), gives evidence
              of an Officer at either qate 3 or gate 4 pushing
              fans who had come out of the pens back into them.
              Reference' was made to fans being pushed back
              through the gate and also to being pushed off the
              perimeter fencing which they had climbed up.



                                                                               u u n L.d,
                  O i i ' 4   <■ j   75   4   i   iKf   h h   .i n   L- fi i.   o r-.h




H a m m o n d su d d a r d s                                                               PAGE NO.   3




 Those are the thr ee points to date at which there is direc
 criticism support ed by evidence given at the inquiry.

 There were, of course, other points of criticism, as yet Ullsupported
 by evidence, the majority of which sound far more against         he Club
 than the South Yorkshire Police, if indeed they are appli cn ble to us
 at all. These     include the fa.iJ.ure to monitor the numbers Entering
 the separate pens, the    failure to provide any direction, e ther by
 stewarding or signs and the failure to take any particular steps to
 cope with the consequences of the opening of gate C, in te ms of
 preventing access? to the central tunnel.      This final critiefc ism is
 really an extensi on of the other two, since there would ha ie been no
 reason to take sp ecial precautions to deal with the entry through
 gate C if the Clu b had had a proper monitoring system and/<j>
 adequate stewardi ng and direction signs.

 We shall have to wait and see how these criticisms develop in
 ev,i dence.

 So far as the mec hanics of the inquiry are concerned, Couni el
 indicated an inte ntion to call, firstly, Liverpool supports rs, whom
 he ;i.ndicatcd (rat her hopefully I think) that he should fin sh with
 during this week and, thereafter, some local inhabitants, presumably
 a mixture of resi dents, shopkeepers and publicans.. He ant: cipated
 that this should take some part of next week and, thereafte r , he
 would be calling Officers from the South Yorkshire Police,         He
 indicated an inte ntion to call Officers concerned in the p anning of
 the m a t c h , office rs concerned with the situation outside the ground
 and Officers cone erned with the situation inside the grountjl . He
 proposed to cal] all those directly involved, plus a cross section
 of others.       How rrany witnesses this will entail depends on the
 breadth of the do finition of "directly involved".       Certain y r it
 seems to me that something between 50 and 100 Officers cou d be
 called.

If Counsel succeeds .in keeping to his timetable, this evideince could
start to be requijred at any time from the middle of next w ^ek - say
24th May - onwards.   My own feeling is that Counsel will n q>t be able
to keep to the ti metable and that we are more likely to ha\ e
witnesses called during the first week in June.

Ideally, I would like to see personally every witness prior to their
being called, but this may not' be possible if very large n timbers are
involved.   I shoujld at least wish to sit down with the Sen or
Officers and go through likely points of cross examination      In
planning these meetings, there is a balance to be struck b«ttween not
leaving j.t to the last minute but, on the other hand, hear i[ng as
much as possible of the evidence to be called from the Live rpool
supporters and thle local inhabitants.



                                                                                         /...   contd.

 I suggest that wo assess the position at the end of this we sk.

 I should say, spec ifically, that I see no reason for Roger      reenwood
 to cancel his arra  nged leave during the week commencing 22nfcl  May.
 I would anticipate!; that each of the Senior Officers will be g iv .ing
 evidence for no 1 es s than one day, hence, even if Counsel d ;>es
 succeed in keeping to his timetable, matters can surely be arranged
 so that Roger Gre 4nwood is called after his return.

 A further point which was made yesterday by Lord Justice 'l'aylor was
 that if any person wishes to put forward any observations o r
 submissions as regards the recommendations which the inquir y should
 make, then those Observations should be submitted in writin g within
 the next month,  ‘jL'he question arises as to whether the Sout h
 Yorkshire Police iis a body wish to make any recommendations      e.g.
 that all major football matches should start at 12.00 noon       with a
 ban on any licensed premises opening before that time withi n two
 miles of the vicinity.     There may be other matters which yc u would
 wish to put forwaltd.    On the other hand, it may be that any such
 submissions could be more appropriately made through the AC P O , on
 the basis that su ;h problems are common to all or at least many
 areas of the country,     Perhaps you will discuss this and 1<=t me know
 if you would like any assistance from,us in dealing with wr ittcn
 submissions.

 .finally, in thinking generally about the first day of the ,n q u i r y ,
 it occurred to me that you will wish to give at least some thought
 to the question of publicity and/or public relations.    You will have
 noticed that the two witnesses who completed their   evidence
 yesterday walked straight out to be interviewed in front of
 television camera s and, whilst T am not suggesting that thi s is an
 appropriate cours e for Police Officers who have given evide; nee to
 the inquiry, you tnay well wish ter consider, perhaps even with the
 Officers concerned, whether some form of statement may neec to be
 issued, either af■jter individual Officers have given evidence or
 after the evidence given by all South Yorkshire Police Officers has
 been taken.   it may be that, having thought about this matter, the
 decision will be that no such step is required, but I mention it at
 this stage so that thought can be given to it.

 If there are any matters which you would like to discuss a •ising out
 of this letter, please telephone me, as I shall be in the   ffice all
 day.  Alternatively, I hope to be at the inquiry tomorrow  looming
 and, as Kate Haljl from this office will also be present, I should be
 able to make time for a meeting durincj the morning, if need b e .


 Yours sincerely,




 Peter       Metcalf

    HILLSBOROUGH - CORRESPONDENCE FROM JOE BOSTON MP


     1.   Thank you for your recent fax encosing correspondence from Joe Benton MP about
    the Hillsborough disaster.

    2.     I agree that Mr Benton's letter is rather sparse on detail. I also agree with your
    assumption that he seeks a meeting with Home Office Ministers to enable two of his
    constituents, Mr and Mrs Church, whose son was killed in the disaster, to express their acute
    disquiet about the way their son's death was investigated by the coroner.

    3.     As I explained on the telephone yesterday, I have managed to obtain the attached
    video cassette recording of the recent 'Cook Report' on Hillsborough from our Press Office
    here. I watched the video recording of the programme yesterday. The programme centres
    around the work of the coroner and contends that evidence was fabricated by his staff in
    order that the time of death of the Hillsborough victims could be set at no later than 3.15pm
    on 15 April 1989. It goes on to suggest that this fixing of the time of death has meant that
    the actions of the police at Hillsborough have never fully been investigated.

    4.       Although there is a passing reference to the Taylor Report in the programme, neither
    the Government's all-seater/safe terracing polices, nor the current sports grounds safety
    legislation come under close scrutiny. Consequently, I do not think there is any need at this
    stage for DNH to become directly involved in this recent correspondence from Mr Benton.
    However, I would be grateful if you would ensure that DNH are kept informed of
    developments since sports grounds safety issues may come to the fore in due course.

    5.      I should be grateful if you would return the video cassette to me in due course.

         Dear Paul

         Dam ien Kel ly m a y have       already mentioned the              attached copy       of
                   ence from Joe Benton MP, on behalf of parents or one
         correspond1
         of those fcho died at the Hillsborough disaster*                       The letter is
         not     part jocularly    helpful    since    it    does       not    refer    to     the
         difficult es      which    have    been   faced    by   the        family.     we    can,
         however,      9e fairly certain that the complaint, is against                        the
         coroner a lid the police.


         2. As you m a y know, coroners are independent judicial officer©
         and neithsr the Home Secretary or any other Minister h a s the
         power    to   interfere    in     their   decisions.    Complaints           about    the
         police should be made in the first inetancc to the Chief Officer
         and I a m making enquiries as to whether this has been done.


         3,    W e hav e been asked to offer advice to the Home Secretary and
         it na y be that we will offer a meeting with Lord Ferrers purely
         on a 1 iste ning basis.         But, before doing so,          1 would be grateful
         to k n o w w]liether there is anything from a DNH perspective which
         y o u would like us to take on board.             1 would be grateful to have
         your comoi4 n t s by close of business on Wednesday, July 6.




                                                                        V

              27 June       1994.

              Dear Borne Secretary,

              Mr.      &    Hre.      Church,


              My constituents named above tragically lost     their
              aon   Gary   Christopher    Chu r c h , through    the
              Hillsborough disaster.   Since then, they have been
              trying to pursue some form of justice through the
              legal system but without success.       By justice, I
              mean answers to questions that would bring forth
              the  reasons for Gary's death and identify the
              causes and negligence if any, which brought about
              his death.

              M y constituents are honourable and worthy people
              genuinely seeking answers as anyone worthy of the
              name parent would seek to do.

              Hitho ut       going  into any   detail  at  this     stage
              eonce rning      the frustrations/    prevarications    and
              lack of cooperation they and 1 have experienced
              f r o m various members of the legal fraternity in so
              many different ways/ I am asking you to consider a
              requc st, which I now formally make to you, namely
              t o g rant a meeting with myself, Mr. & Mrs. Church
              and       their  chaplain and spiritual     aflviser,   the
              n e v e r end Ray Hutchinson of. Christ Church fi St. Mary
              in Wa tcrloo, Merseyside.

             Reverend Ray Hutchinson of Christ Church &           St. Mary
             in Waterloo, Merseyside.

             This       request       has   not   just   been  prompted  by
             t e l e v is i o n ’* recent edition of the Cook Report* but
             obvio isly          that   programme   does   bring  many  new
             questions requiring answers to the surface.

             The tistory and details behind that which Mr. &
             Mrs. Church have had to endure are very lengthy/ so
             much so, I felt it more appropriate to ask for this
             meeting so as you may hear at first hand the
             dread Eul manner in which my constituents have been
             treat ad.

              I do hope in an attempt to seek Christian justice
              you tti.ll give my request favourable consideration.

              In conclusion, I take this opportunity to mention I
              shall be T a b l i n g an"Early oay Motion 'in' the commons
              calliig upon you to initiate a Judicial Review in
              the Jighfc of rceent events which do have further
              bearifigs on the Hillsborough disaster.

              EDM d This House, in the light of the recent TV
              editisn    of  the Cook Report and the increasing
              conce m s and consternation of the relatives of the
              victi us of the tragic Hillsborough disaster calls
              upon    the   Rt.  Bon.  Home  secretary  to  order
              immediately a Judicial Review into all aspects of
              the disaster including recent events which have now
              emergsd through the said Cook Report programme.

              I loot forward to your response.




                      incerely/

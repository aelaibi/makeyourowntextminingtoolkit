Dear Jack,

Re: Hillsborough Disaster

As you know I have been trying to help my constituent Eddie Spearritt establish what happened
to him at Hillsborough between 3.00pm and 5.00pm.

The Stuart-Smith Scrutiny recognises there is doubt about when Mr Spearritt was admitted to
hospital. Stuart-Smith stated “from the hospital records as to precisely when Mr Spearritt arrived
at hospital     some suggest it was 5.00pm, others that it could have been earlier”.

This statement clearly implies there are at least two sets o f records, however I have only been
able to trace one set of records.

I understand that Lord Justice Stuart-Smith had notes taken o f his informed meetings with
everyone he interviewed in respect of his Scrutiny Report. He also had transcripts taken of his
formal meetings and he usually followed up these meetings with correspondence.

Can you please let me have copies o f all such notes, transcripts and correspondence in relation
to Lord Justice Stuart-Smith’s dealing with Dr Wardrope.

I look forward to your reply in due course.

Yours sincerely,




Mike Hall MP

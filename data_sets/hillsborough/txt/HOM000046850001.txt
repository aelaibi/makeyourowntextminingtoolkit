LIVERPOOL VISIT PROGRAMME


        Sunday 5 Octoher

        1605 train from Euston arrives Watford Junction at 1621 - reaches Liverpool Lime
        Street at 1903.

       Travel to Judge’s Lodgings by official car - there is accommodation for you and
       Graham (the Home Office Press Officer and I - as well as Mike Ward, one of Paul
       Pugh’s staff whom I am bringing along to help out on the Monday - will be in a
       hotel).



       Monday 6 October

        0830     -      car to Merseyside Maritime Museum, Albert Dock. Met by me, Mike
                        Ward and Press officer.

        0930     -      a 10-15 minute ‘photocall’, for regional and national media, including
                        TV. We have drawn up a brief statement to issue on your behalf
                        (attached) but there will be no press conference and you would not
                        answer questions. Are you content with this media handling plan
                        and the statement?

        1000     -      opening session in the lecture theatre - up to perhaps 150 people
                        present, mainly family but including Hillsborough ‘experts’ from
                        Professor Scraton’s project. No press. Goes on till 12.00 or 12.30.
                        All recorded by stenographers. I have had a few thoughts about
                        your opening speech, and drafted a (much briefer) preamble for
                        myself. The results are attached.

        1300     -      lunch (with Chief Constable? - still to be confirmed - if so travel by car
                         - only a couple of minutes away).

        1430     -      we start holding interviews with family members (in the ‘Boardroom’),
                        again recorded by stenographers.      This goes on until mid-
                        Wednesday.

        Tuesday/Wednesday 7/8 Octoher

        Details of the interviews are on a separate sheet. Car picks you and Graham up from
        the Lodgings at 0900 each day - interviews start at 9.30. On Tuesday, we finish at 5,
        when car will take you and Graham to the Lodgings - on Wednesday, we are
        scheduled to finish at around 1430, with a car to take you back to the Lodgings and
        then on to the station. Trains leave at 45 past the hour and are in London just under 3
        hours later.

Dear

Thank you for your letter of 23 February to the Prime Minister
which has been passed to this department in view of our
responsibilities for safety at sports grounds.  I apologise
for the delay in replying to you.

In his Final Report on the Hillsborough Stadium disaster,
published on 29 January 1990, Lord Justice Taylor made 76
recommendations, many of them concerning crowd safety.   Our
information is that they were largely and quickly implemented
by the responsible authorities.  Indeed many of them had been
included in his Interim Report and had been implemented even
prior to the Final Report being published.   In addition Lord
Justice Taylor's recommendations regarding the provision of
seated accomodation are being implemented at Football League
grounds.  The Government has made it clear that the
responsibility for this rests with the clubs themselves.   The
Football licensing Authority has been recently set up under
the Football Spectators Act 1989 and will be responsible for
monitoring the progress that clubs are making.   Also, the
Guide to Safety at Sports Grounds (The "Green Guide") has been
recently revised incorporating, where appropiate, the safety
recommendations made by Lord Justice Taylor.   The Green Guide
is used by local authorities to help them determine the
conditions of a safety certificate. (Under the Safety of
Sports Grounds Act 1975 a safety certificate has to be issued
to grounds which can accomodate more than 10,000 spectators).

Therefore several steps have been taken since Lord Justice
Taylor's Final Report to ensure that his recommendations are
implemented.

                                                    Yours sincerely


                                                    Steve Bilbe

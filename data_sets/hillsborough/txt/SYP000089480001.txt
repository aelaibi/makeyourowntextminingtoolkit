                                                                                 PAGE     2

        At 2.45 pm (1445) we were stood down by Inspector ATHORN & resumed to

        Cl aywhee1s Ln Traffic Off i ce for refreshments at Cl ay w he e1s L a n e , we

        had just been served with our meal when as a result of a radio
               c o m ih s A - r o t £ c x > n/>D                -----------
        message received by Inspector ATHORN, he had the radio, we all

        attended at the Leppings Lane End of the Football Stadium.            (Believed

        to be mass crowd dis or de r) .   Upon arrival,   there we re very few people

        in the vicinity of this area & no-one appeared to know what, we were

        required to do or where to go.       Soon after we arrived,     1 somehow

        became detached from my serial      so I teamed up with other officers from

        my division who were similarly unaware of what was r e q u i r e ^ /    I stood

        near a cantilever gate which was adjacent to the river
V- f


        I then saw officers and ambulance staff carry out the body of a white

        male appro;-;. 65 years old, who at that time,      X thought had been

        injured in fighting.



        Rumours went around about there being 10 people dead, and then I saw

        bodies being brought out from inside the ground by officers & civilian

        people, also many injured people.       I tried as best as i/could to

        assist with injured people & tried to ascertain who j/ne m o s t injured

        people were to get medical assistance to them firsSj



        By this time,   I'm not sure what /time it would be, there were at least

        12 bodies in this area,     then afa Inspector took charge of the situation
        —     '  1   »"                  /   \
        & had us   rearrange the bodies up to the side of the fence & form a

        bodily cordon in front of /(hem to prevent members of the public from

        seeing the dead people.



C A T
        By now the stadium was being emptied at the request made by the
Q tV
        loudspeaker system,
                                                                               PAGh.   3
                                                                               S3374



         A short time later,    barriers were   placed around the bodies &

         tarpaulins placed over them to form a screen.



         Our presence was then not required & so I moved onto Leppings Lane &

         tried to keep the   crowd moving away from the gates to allow ambulances

         & doctors access.



         At approximately 3 pm (1700)    I saw other members of my serial & I went

         with them & resumed m o b i 1e patro1 in a transit van with Insp ATHORN &

         SGT MURRAY around the Hillsborough a r e a .



         At approximately 6.45 pm (1845) we all     returned to Cla yw h ee 1s Lane

         Traffic Office where our serial was stood down.



         I then, along with other officers,     returned to Edlington Section going

         off duty at 8 pm (2000).

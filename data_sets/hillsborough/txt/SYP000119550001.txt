              At    8.00am             on       Saturday          15th       April        1989     I    commenced          duty        at   Niagara

              stables,                Sheffield.

              I am       the          regular          rider          of    Police        Horse        L O X L E Y „ and     in      this     capacity          I

              groomed             the       said       horse          for    the     Semi    final         football          match          between

              Liverpool                and       Nottingham                Forest.

              At    10.00am                the       same    day       I along        with       other        members        of      the    mounted

              department                   attended          a    briefing           for    members           of    Nott's,          L i v e r p o o l , and

              our       own       mounted             departments.                  The    briefing           was    conducted              overall       fay

              Superintendent                         Marsh       Operations           Division,            and      most     of      the     relevant

              facts       put          by       Inspector             Davies        South    Yorkshire              M o u n t e d , to       whom     I was

              directly                responsible.                    On    completion           of     the    briefing           we    set    fair       our

              horses          and          paraded          on    the       car     park    adjacent           to    the     'Niagara          Club’.

              My    working                partner          for       the    day     was    P.S,        Watson       Nott's          Constabulary.

              P.S.       Watson             and       myself          were     deployed          on     Penistone          Road        close     to      the

              entrance                of    the       rear       of    the     South       Stand«          Being       out      as     early    as       we

              were       I took             the       opportunity              to    familiarise              Sgt    Watson          with     the     layout

              of    the       ground.

              On    returning                   to    our    point          on P e n i s t o n e       Road    a    short       while        later,       I

              noticed             a    steady          stream          of    Nottingham            fans       arriving          in     plenty       of    time

              to    get       a       good       place       in       the    ground.         The        fans       were    in     good       humour       and
                                                                                                                              I SO         i   _|

                                                                                                                                  ^    PAGE

causing          no       problems.

At    approximately                   2.00pm          the    same    day       I positioned                my    horses       in

Penistone             Road,          direction             outside       the    large          blue       metal       gates       which

lead       to    the       rear       of    the       South       Stand.        The       volume          of    Nottingham             fans

had    increased                to    the       extent       that    they       were       starting             to    spill       into

Penistone             Road.           1 assisted             the    fans       into       their       correct          stand          or       sear

for    a    good          fourty       minutes,             and    assisted          Inspector             li. B o o t h     in       moving

the    fans          towards          turnstiles.

The    Nottingham                fans       at       this    time    were       arriving             carrying          four       p a c k ’s

of    beer       and       lager       to       the       extent    that       it w a s        almost          impossible             to       deal

with       the       problem          due       to    sheer       numbers.

At    approximately                   2.40pm          the    crowd       had    mostly          gone       into       the    ground             and

the    ones          that       were       left       outside       were       ushered          towards          the    turnstiles

they       requested.

At    approximately                   2.50pm          I was       instructed             along       with       P.C.    Swain          a

fellow          South          Yorkshire             mounted       officer          to    go    immediately             to    the

Leppirigs            Lane       end    of       the       ground.        The    instruction                came       from    P.S.

Sorsby.              I did       not       have       a    radian    so       did    not       at    that       time    realise                what

the    problem             was.

Due    to       the       urgency          of    P.S.       Sorsby,       P.C.       Swain          and    I cantered             along

the    rear          of    the       South       stand       where       on    arrival          I saw          that    the    large

blue       gates          where       the       mounted          enter    the       ground          were       open    and    a       large

group       of       fans       were       pushing          to    gain    entry          into       the    ground.           Not

knowing          what          had    caused          the    gates       to    be    opened          I attempted             to       block

them       off       using       the       horse.

The    crowd,             if    they       can       be    called    that       were       more       like       animals,             the

stench          of    beer       was       overpowering             from       the       vast       numbers          that    had

obviously             been       drinking.                 There    were       Liverpool             fans       being       pushed             to

the    floor          and       their       fellow          supporters          stamping             all       over    them.           The

ones       I saw          get    up    again          rejoined       the       push       totally          oblivious          to       the
                                                                                                                                      '"'PAGE

pain    they       w e re     causing          to    their       own       supporters.

From    my    position          outside             the    gates       I could             see       directly             into       the        rear

of    the    West       stand       where       the       two    central             gates       allow          supporters             to        the

middle       of    the       standing          area       of    the    West          Stand.           The       area       was       full        of

what    I    can    only       describe             as    idiots       pushing             with       nowhere             to    go    there

were    people          being       pushed          to    the    ground          and       walked          over,          fans       were

also    climbing             over    the       walls       into       what       by       now    was       obviously             a    very

dangerous          situation.

I attempted             to    halt       the    flow       of    fans,          it    was       by    now       an    impossible

task.        As    T. l o o k e d    at    the       ones       who    had       not       yet       pushed          their       way        into

the    ground        I could         see       from       my    experience                that       they       were       not       only

drunk       but    wild       with       it,    not       listening             to    me    nor       to    reason.              The        fans

were    jeering,             pushing,          and       attacking          a    police          horse          wi t h fists          as

they    were       being       carried          along          with    the       flow.

Seeing       that       it    was    a    lost       cause       to    try       and       get       the    gates          closed           I

looked       towards          Lappings          Lane.           The    gates          that       are       opened          to    let

police       vehicles          gain       access          to    the    rear          of    the       South       Stand          were        wide

open.        I then          placed       my    horse          across       this          gap    to    stop          the       flow    of

fans    in a n      attempt          to    regulate             them.           By    now       we    looked          to       have

started       to    regain          control          of    the    situation,                another             horse          c a m e to       my

right       hand    side       and       did    the       same    to       block          the    gates          n e x t to      the    ones

1 was       at.     I was       being          spat       at    and    a    string          of       abuse       from          drunken

louts       was    being       directed             twards       myself          and       two       other       mounted             officer'

I    could    see.

Davies,       Mounted          department                appeared          and       instructed             me       to    check

tickets       of    the       few    fans       that       were       left       outside.              This          I did       although

there       was    by    now    no       problem.

Almost       immediately             after          this       order       from       Insp       Davies          along          with        about

another       seven          mounted       officers             1 was       instructed                to    go       to    the       rear        of

the    North       Stand       as    we    were          informed          that       there          was    a    pitch          invasion.

                                                                                                                                              TAGE
                                                                                                                                              R 316

On    arrival        1 saw       the          dog       section          with       their          dogs      out      of       their          vans

■going    on    to       the    pitch,             along          with       many       foot       officers.               A    short          while

later     the       dog    seciton                came       off       the    pitch          and    all      that         was       left       was       a

large     amount          of    foot          officers             facing          the       Kop.

A    message        came       over       the          radio       from       the       officer          next        to    me       saying          that

t h e re w e r e     people          dead»              This       didn't          sink       in    unt i 1      I saw          a    youth

being     carried          out       on       a    stretcher             and       put       at    the     side       of       a St.          Johns

ambulance           out    of    the          view          of    the    public.

From     then       there       was       a       steady          stream       of       bodies          being        carried          out          some

on    stretchers           carried                by    foot       officers             and       many     more       being          carried             by

football        fans.           They          were          by    this       time       using       the      advertising                  boards

as    make     do    forms       of       transport                for       the    bodied.

For    some     reason          I dont             know          why    but    I started                c o u n t i ng     the       ones          that

were     obviously             dead,          the       ones       who       seemed          to    have      gone         blue       so       quick,

the    onew     with       vomit          at       the       sides       of    their          faces        on    the       stretchers,

the    woman        with       her    clothes                high       around          her       neck     as    though             someone             had

attempted           to    revive          her.              The    most       sad       of    all       when     a    lad       who       looked

no    more     than       twelve          passed             by    us    the       police          mans      anorack            rell          from

the    body     showing          him          dead.

1    counted        to    sixty       five             or    so    and       even       then       it    just        d i d n ’t s i n k            in

what     had    happened.

Ambulances           were       then          arriving             in    droves          all       sense        of    time          had       gone

and    then     the       feeling             of       horror          thinking          back       that        it    would          not       have

happened        had       the    Liverpool                   idiots          not    turned          up     so    late          and    in       the

drunken        stupor          they       had          got       themselves             into.

All    the     mounted          officers                at       the    back       of    the       North        Stand          were       then

deployed        to       assist       fans             on    their       way       home       after        the       game       had       been

abandoned.

I was     at    the       bottom          of       Hillsborough                Park,          main       gates        and       saw       a    crowd

of    perhaps        thirty          fans          fighting             violently             amongst           themselves.                    I
                                                                                         FW5E
                                                                                         R316

  galloped     towards     them     and   they   dispersed   unfortunately     I was   unable

  to   get   hold   of   any   of   them.    They   just   hadn't   had   enough.

    opened         at     the      right      of       the       turnstiles.                     We       were       at      the     front        of     the
                                                                 -



    c r o w d at        t hi s     point,                        shouted           to me             to       come      through and               I , in

    t urn,      shouted            to B r i a n        a n d we           walked        through                quite         freely         in o r d e r l y

    fashion.              We w a l k e d      towards                the     tunnel          and walked                     through         the       tunnel,

    iiy f i r s t       impression            of       the       tunnel           was       that          it was            dark     and     dingy        an d

    Brian       wa s      behind.

    We    had      gone       through         the        tunnel             pretty          quickly.                 Th e     players            were

    having         a kick          about.          W h e n we             got     to    the          bottom          of      the     tunnel           there

    was      a good          crowd      of    pe o p l e .            We     made       our          way       to    the      r i g ht      of    the

    getting          worse.            As    far       as    I am                           8 r i a n w a s s 1 111                b e h in d m e »          iiy

    last      recollection                  was     seeing            him a few m i n u t e s                       after       entering              what     I

    now      know       to    be P e n 3„              When          I turned           to       him and             told       h i m we         we re

    making         our       way      through          tooths             right,        that          was         the       last     the     t h re e     of       us

    ever      saw       of    him      u nt i l ./much l a t er                 when        we       were         informed           that        he    had

                myself           and              had       k ep t        going        to    the          r i gh t      of    the      pen a n d         down

    until       we      got      to    a barrier.                    I just        have          a    vagus          recollection                 of w h a t

    happened.                The      crush       wa s      so       intense           that          I felt          sure       1 was        going        to

    die.        I knew           I had       to    get       away           from       the       barrier.                   I recollect               putting

    my    head       on      the      man    in    front             of me        to    gain          some          space       so     that       I could

    move      away.           I eventually                  did and             then        came          a    little         bit      of    e as e      in the

    crowd       and       1 was        able       to     get         to     the    downward                   fence       and      climb         over     the

    fence       into         what      I know          was       p                as    did                                   w as     helped          out     by

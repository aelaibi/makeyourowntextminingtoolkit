             I am                       of the above addess where I live on rny own.

             On Saturday 15 April            1989 I went to see the F.A.           cup semi final at

             the Hillsborough Stadium, Sheffield between Liverpool and, Notti ngham
                                                                           o v t

             my ticket from                                             who got it from Anfield.

             It was a Leppings Lane standing ticket and cost £6.Q0p.                      I travelled to

             the game by coach organised by the Liverpool supporters

             club of Lower Breck Road, Anfield. My friend actually booked four

             seats.      I can't recall the coach numb«r^or/^firmt.                     __ C u Q    g ' ^

             We left the Liverpool area at about 9am (0900)and arrived in Sheffield

                 at about   11.am (11.00) we did not encounter any travel delays.

                 Before we went into the ground I did see quite a few fans drinking

                 from cans. They were actually both sets of fans. We arrived quite

                 early and the coach was parked with all the others near a factory

                 estate. On route from the coach towards the ground I did get

                 directions from a police officer but I misunderstood them and ended up

                 at the Forrest end. We then made our way to the correct end and got

                 some food. We sat on a nearby wall until about 1.45pm (1345) and

                 walked back towards the Leppings Lane entrance.

fc               t W n s t i l e s and went straight    in.   I do recall seeing police outside the

                 turnstiles and I also recall seeing a couple of stewards inside.
  U . L   v/     There were no queues to get in but not many people were arriving.               I

                 d i d n ’t see any fans drunk,    fighting or anyone disorderly.One of the

                 friends who I went with had been to the ground before so we d i d n ’t

                 really need any directions from anyone, we knew where the

                 turnstiles were. We got through them O.K. and got into the terraces

                 O.K.   I d i d n ’t see any gates open I d i d n ’t see anyone climbing into the

                 ground. My ticket was taken at the turnstiles.

             As time went on the crowd continued to get thicker and I was

             continually being pushed about.                                                    I eventually got seperated from my

             cousin.              I made my way towards the back because of the crushing.                                                            I

             could see                           about 6 to 8 feet away he seemed O.K. At that time it

             was about H.45pm (1445) Although I was being pushed about I w a s n ’t too

             bad I was wearing my coat                                              and the weather was hot which eventually

             affected me and I started to get short of breath.                                                                    I made my way to       the       J

    ^        wall below the West Stand.                                          I d o n ’t know why but fans seemed to be

             pushing back up to the wall.                                               I couldn’t see what was happening.                           I was

             becoming short of breath,                                          I recall                people being lifted out and at that

             time my head                     was              banged against the wall by the feet of                                        people

             being pulled                     up.              Eventually police were telling fans to                                        go to the ba

             of the terrace so they could get out injured fans,                                                                     so as the fans

^            pushed back I was getting crushed.     I do recall that at one time Peter

                          fans tried to see what was going on. That was the worst of it.

        \f   Eventually I made my way out of the tunnel,                                                                 that would be about 3.HQ

             pm (152Q). I                     was              dazed.              I was sat down by a post at the                           exit ofthe

             tunnel where                     someone gave me some water.                                              I saw people trying to revive               I

             people next to me. The injured next to me were being given

             drunk.           I could smell beer a lot. There were about 4 of these bodies by

             me,       1 d o n ’t know if they were dead.                                                  I revived myself after a short

             while and with my cousin we walked about ending up in the upper

             terraces where we watched. After about                                                                  10 minutes         and myself got

                                                                                                      S1791

                   some water and went onto the pitch handing out drinks. We

                   eventually left there at about 4.45 (1645) and went back to the coach.

                   A1though at that time I was injured I d i d n ’t go to the hospital                 in

                   Sheffield.

                   After    I got o u t , and up to when I left the g r o u n d , I d i d n ’t see

                   anything that I would consider a criminal offence.               I can’t say there

                   is anythi ng I would consider a factor           in someones injury or death.

                   After the match was stopped I could see fans and police were trying

                   their bes t . Some police,       like u s , d i d n ’t seem to know what to d o , they

                   may have been shocked.         I d i d n ’t like the way the police 1ined

                   across the pitch.

                   With regard to the fences I believe they should stay up but the

                   emergency exits should be b i g ger. I thought the ambulance took a long

                   time to arrive.

                   I would like to add that while the crowd was getting thicker, about

                   2.45pm (1445)        I saw one fan who was standing on a crash barrier and

                   diving onto heads of people          in front,   he had long ish ha i r , I c a n ’t

                   describe him any other w a y , he was about 5 or more feet a w a y .

                   I also want to add I think the ticket allocation was wrong for the

                   teams.

                   The last thing I want to mention is that when I got home I had

                   head a c h e s ,

                   In relation to the statement          I ’ve already signed,

                                      I heard / a f t j the radio that two old school friends who I ’d

         Carl   lives in the Morefields area as does Paul,    that is in the Tower

         Hill area of Kirkby.   They went to St Kevins R C School with me. Paul

         was in my class and Carl    is a year younger than me.    I ’ve known them

         both since I was twelve.    I c a n ’t r ecall what they were wearing.    I did

         try to see where they were    in the pen but I couldn’t find them,

         The only thing they said to me out side the ground is that w e ’d meet

         in the ground.   I carried on eating my dinner.

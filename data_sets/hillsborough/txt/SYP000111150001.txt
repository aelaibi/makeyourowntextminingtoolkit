notice      t h at      many    of       the L i v e r p o o l         supporters                 had    been        drinking

        It b e c a m e       obvious           that      the       fans       without          tickets          were      loitering around

        were     suspected              of     picking            pockets          as    they       followed        the        crowd        in

        towards            the    turnsti l e s .             At     this        stage        h u n ^ ^ d ^ o ^ y y y i i g ^ e r e still

        any     spares           and when          a spare           ticket         d id      become        available            a    crowd would

        immediately               gather          around          the    seller          as    f a ns     became        desperate               to buy

        one.          I actually             stood       in f r on t          of    one L i v e r p o o l        supporter              who      was

                                        a    spare       ticket          for       £60.00.           A number           of     fans        declined

        to     bu y    the       ticket        because            the    p r ic e       was    too       high.

        At     around 2^30              pm     I walked            the     length          of L e p p i n g s      Lane        with        DS Mc Sloy

        and     I remember              thinking             that       many       of    the      fans w o u l d        not      get       in -for

        th e    start.

Whilst        walking           ba c k     along         Leppings        Lane       towards           the      ground       PC    EhoTton

drove        past       in the        Police          Landrover          with       the     horn       blaring.             He    drove

towards          the      turnstiles             in L e p p i n g s      La ne.          W h e n we       arrived          back       at    our

original            positions             PC B u x t o n ’s L a n d r o v e r        was       parked          in the

c a r r i a g e w a y at        the       edge      of    the    larg e    crowd          trying          to    gain       access          to

the      g ro u n d .      Th e      crowd was            extremely        dense          and     I remember               commenting

to D C ’s A s k e w a n d L a w r e n c e                 with whom        I had w o r k e d              numerous          previous

area      from       both       ends       of L e p p i n g s      Lane    and       joining           the      packed mass                of

fans.         Th e      fans      walking           down Leppings              Lane       from        the      direction          of       the

Catchbar            Lane       were       singing         and    jostling           and     this       section           appeared           to

h av e    been       drinking             heavily.

There        wa s    no    chance          of    gaining         access        to    the       crowd and             our    operation

wa s     abandoned and with                      other       CID    officers             I stood          in the         carriageway

watching            the    situation             deteriorate.              Th e      f an s      coming         down       Leppings

Lane      ha d      obviously             just      left     public       houses          and     they were              frustrated

when      they       saw       the    depth         of    the    crowd     between             themselves             and       the

turnstiles.                The       time       no w was        about     E^SjC^pn^ a n d             the^ncKHl^of              the    c rowd

became        desperate              as    k ic k     off    approached.                 The    frustration                of    the

crowd        turned        to     anger         and      several      fans       demanded             that      PC    Buxton          in his

Landrover            and a        uniformed              Inspector        wh o      I have        never         seen       before          do

something            to    ease       the       situation.            These         officers           did      their       b e st     by

shouting            to L i v e r p o o l        f a ns    over     the    vehicle           loudspeaker               to    s to p

pushing          because          people         were       getting       c r u s h e d at        the       f ro n t .      At    this

S ykes       stood        on    the       fringe         of the     crowd        but       I did       not      see a n y

 DC     Lawrence           and       I made          comments          a b o u t the     situation            to       this           e ff ec t .

 Some        fans     at    the       front          of    the c r o w d     began       climbing            o nt o          the wall

 above        the     turnstiles               to      escape        the    crush.            Some      of    these           people          were

 being        hauled        up       o n to    the       wall    by     Inspector             Bennett.

 At     about       £.55        pm    there          was a                                                                   the s t a d i u m

 Around           this     t im e     the      situation appeared                       to    ease.          An    officer              began

 directing            the       crowd         o v er     the    Landrover              loudspeaker            to m a k e          their          way

 to a        p oint      between           two      of    the    horses           where       access         to    the       ground           co u l d

 be     gained.            It    s e e m e d as          though       the     problem          had      been        resolved

 although           I did        not       know        if a g at e         ha d    been       opened,         or       if    so,        which       one.

 With        the    situation              no w a p p a r e n t l y        under        some     s or t      of     control             I then

 left        the    scene        with         other       CID    officers              and walked along                     Vere        Road

 which        runs       parallel             to    the N o r t h S t a n d .            As    we w a l k e d a l o n g               the     road

 there        seemed        to       be    s om e      sort     of    dispute           involving            residents                in the

              drunken        fans      had       obviously             relieved            themselves.

              With     other       officers             I went         to     the      gymnasium            to    l ia i s e    w i t h CII

              came     in that         the       pitch         ha d    been        invaded.

              came     into      the       gym and          instructed              us     to   clear         the     area     of     table        and

              chairs       to m a k e       way       for      incoming          fatalities.                  The     area     was      clewed and

             were      grey      in    colour          and were          obviously              dead.           However?        the       firet

Statement of Martin David LOCKING DC 1108

I am a Detective Constable presently stationed at Hamnerton Road Police Station,
Sheffield.

At 9am on Saturday 15th April 1989 I commenced duty at Earaerton Road Police Station
in connection with the F.A. Cup semi final football match between Liverpool and
Nottingham Forest at Hillsborough.

At %k3&r: I attended the briefing at the football stadium with other uniform and
CID officers by Chief Superintendent Duckenfield. At about 11.30am I went with
DS McSloy, DS Smith (F2), DC Lawrence, DC lilley, DC Lindsay (F2) and DC Hallan
to the Leppings Lane end of the ground to take part in observations for a team of
pick-pocket s. During tho corresponding fixture between the two sides last year
numerous thefts from the person had been reported at the Leppings Lane end of the
ground and these reports had prompted the observations at the repeat fixture.
DC Hallan had in his rear trouser noeket a wallet alarm and ny duties together with
the other CID officers was to keep observations on DC Hallam and obviously
respond to any attenpt to steal the wallet*

On talcing up position outside the Leppirgs Lane turnstiles the situation was quiet
and the crowd sparse. Uniform officers had taken up their position on the turnstyles
and there were numerous officers under the command of Tnsp. Sykes ( '?.) on duty
in Leppings Lane itself awaiting the arrival of supporters coaches. At this stage
the Policing of the game was nuca the sane as any other match, all the serials
were in their correct postions ready for a build up of Liverpool supporters.

As the day progressed the crowd in Leprings Lane increased. DC Hallam wandered
around the area outside the turnstiles and CID officers took up positions in and
around the area trying to identify potential offenders.
Uniform officers relayed reports of ticket touts which we gave attention because in
the past pick-pockets have operated where small crowds have gathered around touts
and on some occasions touts have acted as diversions for the thieves. Between
1pra and Bpm the crowd strengthened and there were numerous fans without tickets
 'milling around' the Leppings Lane end trying to buy 'spares.' During this time I
went with DC Lawrence up Leppings Lane towards the junction with Catchbar Lane in
response to a call that touts were active in that area. Me also followed DC Hallan
down Leppings Lane to the fish and chip shop at the end of Fielding Road.
At this stage I began to notice that many of the Liverpool supporters had been
drinking heavily. Bmpty beer cans littered the streets and many supporters were
boisterous. However such an atmosphere was to be expected at such a match
and has been a common feature in previoi’s big games involving other big clubs.
’./hilst I was. stood in Leppings Lane near to the fish and chip shop I was approached
by many fans asking for spares. The fans without tickets v/ere loitering outside the
ground in the hope of obtaining a ticket.

Because of the flow of supporters in Leppings Lane coming from v/adsley Bridge our
observations became centred around the area adjacent to the 'corner' shop at the
side of the Leppings Lane and in front of the metal fences in front of the
turnstyles. Whilst we were stood in this area our group was constantly being
'moved on' by officers on horseback. A Merseyside Mounted officer Became prominent
in keeping the crowd roving, frquortly assisted by a female South Yorkshire officer.
At some stage I also saw two Mounts 5 derreants. It be:ame obvious that the fans
                                     .


without tickets were loitering around this area causing congestion and increasing
problems for the mounted officers. The act! n of the mounted officers also
disrupted our observations which be car's increasingly centred around a small area
in front of the fence beneath the large sign because of the large crowd.
By about 2,20pm the crowd was very dense. DS McSloy reported seeing an Asian
looking nan with another man constantly following the crowd in the direction of the
turnstyles only to reappear and repeat the process. This man was wearing glasses
and a dark coloured sheepiskin coat. West of the team began to keep a look out
for these men who were suspected of picking pockets as they followed the crowd
in towards the tnrnstyle. At this stage hundreds of fans were still outside the
ground with no tickets. I was constantly asked if I had any 9spares' and when a
spare ticket did become available a crowd would immediately gather around the seller
as fans became desparate to buy one. I actually stood in front of one Liverpool
supporter who was trying to sell a spare ticket for £60,00p. A number of fans
declined to buy the ticket because the price was too high.

At around 2.30pn I walked the length of leppings lane with DS McSloy and DC Askew
who had joined the team after dealing with a prisoner at F1 to look for the suspects
that DS McSloy had seen. I noticed that the crowd in Leppings Lane was particularly
dense in view of the time and I remember thinking that many of the fans would not
get in for the start.

Whilst walking back along Leppings Lane towards the ground PC Buxton drove passed
in the Police landrover with the horn blaring. He drove towards the turnstyles
in Leppings Lane. When we arrived back, at our original positions DC Buxtons
landrover was parked in the carraigeway at the edge of the large crowd trying
to gain access to the ground. The crowd was extremely dense and I remember
commenting to DCs Askew and Lawrence with whom I had worked numerous previous
matches in uniform at this location that the crowd appeared, beyond control.
There were still thousands of fans still walking to the area from both ends
of Leppings Lane and joining the packed mass of fans. The fans walking down
Leppings Lane from the direction of Satchbar Lane were singing and jostling and this
section appeared to have been drinking heavily.

There was no chance of gaining acces : to the crowd and our operation was
abandoned and with other CID officers 1 sttod in the carraigeway watching the
situation, deteriorate. The fans coxing down Leopings Lane had obviously just left
public houses and they were frustrated vhen they saw the depth of the crowd
between them selves and the turnstylec. The time now was about 2.-Opm and the
mood of the crowd became desnarate as kick off approached. The frustration of
the crowd turned to anger and several Tans aemandea that PC Buxton in his landrover
and a uniformed inspector who I have never seen before do something to ease the
situation. These officers did their best by shouting to Liverpool fans over
the vehicle loudspeaker to stop pushing because people were getting crushed at the
front. At this stage there was no obvious manpowere available to rake any
impression on the hostile crowd. 1 saw Chief Inspector Waring and Inspector Sykes
stood on the fringe of the crowd but I did not see any uniformed constables
except PC Buxton. PC Bn ton directed the mounted officers who were positioned
in front of the metal fence outside the tnrr,styles and totalled k to form a line
across the crowd to stern the flow of fans arriving. The mounted officers tried in
vain to do as he instructed but their efforts did’nt seem to eliviate the situation.
By this time the crowd was so dense that the turnstiles or constables oa. duty at
them could not be seen and so it is possible that any uniformed presence was lost
to syself in the sea of fans.

PC Buxton gave the crowd assurances over the loudspeaker that the matter would be
resolved and that everyone would get inside. He kept repeating that the Police
were currently trying to 'sort the matter out.’ Fans were still approaching
the landrover whore we were standing and pleading with PC Buxton and the uniform
Inspector to resolve the natter. The crowd at this point was out of control
and DC Askew, DC Lawrence and I made comments about the situation to this effect.

Some fans at the front of the crowd began climbing onto the wall above the
turnstyles to escape the crush, done of these people were being hauled up onto the
wall by Inspector dennett.
At about H.Hypn there was a roar from the crowd inside the stadium which obviously
signalled the arrival of one or both of the teams. This roar increased the
desparation of the fans waiting tc yet inside-

Around this tins the situation ay..-.3area to ease. An officer began directing
the crowd over the landrover loudspeaker to cake their way to a point between
two of the horses where access to the yround cbuld be gained. It seemed as though
the problen had been resolved although I did not know if a gate had been opened
or if so which one.

With the situation now apparently under so e sort of control I then left the scene
with other CTI) officers and walked along Vere Hoad which runs parrallel to the
North stand. As we walked along the road there seemed to be some sort of dispute
involving residents in the road. I remember 1)3 Smith dealing with someone in that
road and offering advice but I don't know what it involved. There was urine
running across the pavement outside uany of the passageways where drunken fans
had obviously relieve.: themselves.

With other officers I went to the gynmasiun to liaise with C O officers taking reports
of crime. Hhilst in the gymnasium a report cane in that the pitch had been invaded.
Chief Inspector Beal then came into the gyn and intructed as to clear the area of
tables and chairs to make way for inconing fatalities. The area was cleared
and bodies began to arrive, some on stretchers and some on advertising boards.
Some of the bodies were a state on undress. The bodies wer ? grey in colour
and were obviously dead. However the first body to arrive in the gyn was in fact
alive and this nan was placed in the recovery postion while others were tended to.
The bodies were placed in lines and sheets of paper placed over there heads.
Instructions were given for each body to be accompanied throu.gh.out the proceedings
by at least one Police Officer. He then began the tank of ‘bagging1 the property
of each deceased and labe?H.iiig sac’:, body. Hody bags arrived and each body was placed
in a .jag with the relevant property to await identification. Unen all the bodies
 had been placed in some sort of order I went with .Detective Inspector Towell
and other officers plus relatives of the deceased ^ack to Hannerton Hoad Police
Station m sere I carried out duties involving friends and relatives of the deceased
persons.

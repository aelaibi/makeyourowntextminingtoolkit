checked,              they       just    went       straight               in.        These          two    police         officers               were

I    cannot           remember          having       seen       one         steward.                 Usually        they          wear       some

Myself           and                                 waited           for        a    few       minutes          bfuotr t h e n        decided

to    go       into        the    ground       as    it       was    nearly               kick       off.        I d i d n ’t          see       any

signs          directing           me    any       where,       but         I d i d n ’t         have       to    look,           I just          went

straight              towards       the       tunnel.

        I   considered            was       wrong    or    criminal.             When         it    became           obvious          what       ha:

        occurred.,          the       Police       appeared          to   me,    not     to     want       to       get      involved,            a'

        appeared           to    be    handling          the    situation          as    if        some    more        thugs          had       got

        out     of    control.              There    also       appeared         to     me     to    be    a       lack      of      ambuUnc*

        response,           because          I saw       only     one     ambulance            arrive          on     the       pitch       and

        that     was       about       twenty       to    half       past    three       (1320        -    1530        hrs),            I feel

        Police        control          and    a    steward        supervision            to     allow          a    smooth           filter

        towards        the       turnstiles.              Also       as   far    as     I am        aware,          Liverpool

        attendances              are       about    thi rty       nine      thousand           average             weekly,           for    home

        matches,           whereas          Notts    Forest          average       about        eighteen              or     nineteen

        thousand           weekly.           This    should          have    been       taken        into          account           and

        Liverpool           supporters             allocated          more      tickets         and       ground           space,           As    i

        was,     ground          space       appears       to     have      been      allocated            to       accomodate              the

        n urn tier    of    tickets          issued.           But    the    plan       fell        down       clue    to       lack       of

        supervision              inside       the    ground          to   direct        the     Supporters,

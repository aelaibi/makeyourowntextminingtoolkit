          Dear Mr Barratt.

          SAFETY OF SPCRTS GROUNDS ACT 1975                                ^
                Y o u wrote on 30 M ar ch suggesting that Hillsborough Stadium, the
          ground of Sheffield Wednesday F.C., should be designated under the
          Act.

          2.       As y o u k n o w the basis of the present range of designation is
         •that it should cover all First Di vision grounds plus those regarded
          as ”international" grounds, i.e. regularly u sed for international
          matches.        A l t h o u g h Hillsborough is not of course in the*First Division
          and does not technically fall u n d e r the second category either there
          seemed to us to be a case for regarding it as of comparable status by
          reason of its regular use as the venue for semi-finals of the F.A.
          Cup and for-Cup Final replays.               Xn accordance therefore, wit h the
          requirements of s. 18(4) of the Act we have consulted the- intercs-sted
          bodies, including the Football"League and tbs Football Association.
          The latter have however made 'the point that there is at present no
          certainty that Sheffield W e dn esd ay will be invited to stage a semi­
          final of the F.A. Cup in the next year or two, and that in these <
          circumstances it is questionable whether it would be justifiable to
          insist on bringing the club within the ambit of the general require­
          ments of the safety certificate procedures.               The Club itself is averse
          to being designated.* -While the. latter is riot, of coursc, in itself n ‘
          sufficient reas on not to designate their ground, the point made by 1',^
          Football Association is -a fair one:* the case for des'i-cnation is hot
          ov er wh e l m i n g ; In these circumstances therefore-'fre are not minded for
          the time being to press f oryclesignation in the face of the reservation-
          expressed by the Association.

m       Dear Kr Barratt,

                                          Safety of Sports Grounds Act 1975

        1.   You will recollect that following your suggestion that Hillsborough Stadiua
        should be designated under the 1975 ActQrour letter of 30 March 1977 refers) we
        wrote to you on 2k August last year explaining that as the Football Association
        had indicated that it was uncertain whether Hillsborough would in future be used,
        as it had been in the past, for staging FA Cup semi-finals, we were not minded,
        at that tine, to press for its designation.

        2.   As you know, the issue was raised again with us this    year; and we again con­
        sulted the Football Association to see if their position remainded unchanged. The
        Association have now confirmed that their previous reservations on the propriety
        of the Hillsborough ground's designation because of uncertainty that it would be
        used again as the venue for semi-finals of the FA Cup and for Cup Final replays,
        no longer applied. They have indeed indicated that designation' would be welcomed. .
        On the basis, therefore, that there is now a clear and general indication of a re­
        newed expectation of resumption of the past practice of Hillsborough Stadium being
        used as a venue for matches of comparable status with, those.;in; respect of .which the
        so-called international grounds were designated, Ministers have decided-that --— ; -
        Hillsborough should now be designated at the same time as the grounds of the clubs
        promoted to the First Division at the end of the recent football season.

        3. ■ -i- trust that'you will find this outcome satisfactory.’ I am writing similarly
        to the Chief Executive" of South Yorkshire County Councils

                                                     Ycurs sincerely,'

 Finally, Z would draw your Attention to the fact that there does not
  appear t o b e provisionJEa; the certificate for laying down th e m axima
  number of people %*o may be Allowed toattend specified activities, and
  I woOId expect .that the capacity of the ground should be* stated and the
  makers* that Are .Allowed to be'in particular parts of the ground. A guide
  to this.*was* done ^in71970, when the Hillsborough stadium was examined and
  a report on* crowd capacity was prepared by Husband & Co., Consulting
  Engineers, and the conclusions In that report were agreed by the then
„ Chief Constable, Hr. Barker, the overall capacity being 55,000.

E arlier tn tbe year I wrote to the South Yorkshire Football Ctabs pointing out
the desirability of consulting the County Council on any ground alterations o r
Improvements tn an effort to obviate tbe possibility of such alterations or
improvements needing further work to m eet the requirements of the Act when
their grounds are designated. I would add that It was stressed that this
prooedkire would be additional to any planning or building bye-law approvals
which It might be necessary for the d u b s to seek.

I now attach copy of a le tte r dated 25th Ally received from M essrs. Eastwood
and Partners acting as Consulting Engineers to the Sheffield United Football
Chib L td ., relating to a new secority fence around three sides of the pitch a t

on the Officer Working Party f°r tbe Sheffield District (in the case of the police,
d irect to Superintendent T . Johnson). As discussed with bis representative, a
meeting of the Wo*Log P arty has been arranged for 10.00 a.m . on Wednesday,
15th August, 1979 a t the Town Ball, Sheffield, to discuss the proposals.

As we are approaching certification, I would also suggest that the opportunity
be taken to review the position relating to tbe Sheffield Wednesday ground.

                                             Yours faithfully,

         Dear Sir,                                          -

         SAFETY OF SPORTS GROUNDS ACT 1975

         Thank you for            your letter of the 21st August, and I apologise
         for the delay            in replying, but we have been very carefully
         into the work            schedule with Eastwood fc Partners with
         regard to the            completion of all the necessary work.

         It is expected that all work will be completed by early
         Deceaber. A lot of progress has been B&de andsany areas
         have been coopleted. Apart froo the new staircase at the
         back of Spion Kop all outside work is finished, and this
         new exit along with work in the South Stand we hope to
         complete by the end of October. 1 understand that the
         electrical scheme is the one that may be a little tight
         in completing but, nevertheless, all being well December
         seeas to be the right date for completion.

          I am asked to suggest to you the 7th, 9th or 12th
          Novenber as possible dates for a meeting and inspection
          at which perhaps any contentious poirts could'be dis-                           ‘
          cussed.

          Hay I on behalf of xay Directors thank you for youx
          sympathetic consideration re the issue of the safety
          certificate, and I do assure you that all efforts
          have been made and will continue to be so to meet
          all the requirements that have been put to us.
           Yours faith-fully.

Porting Party Heeting a t the Sheffield Wednesday fo o tb all Ground, where
i t v ts intended th a t a fin a l inspection would be Md« with a view to the
issue o f a Safety C e rtific a te .
On a rriv a l a long discussion ensued between the Sheffield D istric t Council
Building Representatives and Representatives o f the Club’s Consultative
Engineers, Eastwoods.
I t was suggested by the Counc il employees th a t they were not sa tisfie d
with the safety o f the south stand in th a t they did not agree with the
p resentation of figures concerning stre s s submitted by Eastwoods.
The discussion was o f * technical nature and b asically d ea lt with the
possible danger to th e stand in the event o f abnormally high winds and
heavy snow f a ll s . Xn either of these conditions, Batches would not be
played in any case and the safety facto r would not be apparent, however
the discussions were o f such a nature th a t u n til fu rth er enquiries had
been a«de i t would not be possible to issue a Safety C e rtific a te .

U nless tbe HUUboroogh Stadium ts allocated an F. A. Cup Semi-Final o r
tom e such o tte r representative match, It ts unlikely that the near capacity
crowd achieved at the Boxing Day local derby with Sheffield United will
occur afaln daring the current tea son.

I am quite sure that, from a purely police operatic**! point of view, you
w ill be reviewing tbe experiences gained from the Boxing Day match and
m ay even have done ao already.

The County Council’s interest is, of coarse, from an overall point of view,
and any comments which you fee! able to make would I am sure be of great
assistance for fata re occassions.

At 10.00 a» Tuesday, 10 February 1961, I attended at Sheffield

Safety at Sports Grounds. Persons present Included Hr David Vaughan

of the South Yorkshire County Council, Hr Ken Hennott of the

South Yorkshire Fire Service, Chief Superintendent Herold, F

Division, representatives of the Club and representatives of the

Building Authority.



A general inspection of the ground took place and no sajor problems

were identified, the majority of work being in the fora of ■ainfcen-

anoe, however, discussions were undertaken concerning the Police

Roan and the siting of possibly tesnporary ticket offices both in

Penistone Road and Leppings Lane. Ihere were no objections to

 these offices on a temporary basis in order that the situation

 might be assessed as to the types of queues which might develop.

 So f a r a s the P olice Rocn i s concerned, the Club had received our

 su g g estio n s and the B etter was to be placed before the boanh

              Dear David,

                          f°r the notes of the visit to Hillsborough
              of the working party on Safety of Sports Grounds.

              Just one point I would like to clarify and that is
              UIK5er (C) North Stand. You do say that we have
              agreed with the police on nett acccraodation for
              then. This is not so, we are still in the
              discussion stage.

              Yours sincerely,



              Secretary.

 its objectives of advance identification of difficulties during the forth
 cooing footbell season with a viev to deciding upon a course of action to
 obviate those difficulties before they bectme apparent to outsiders.


 X.       MINUTES OF THE PREVIOUS MEETING

 1.1   The minutes of the meeting held at Si?gara Sports Club on 16 October
 1980, which had been circulated, vere received and accepted.


 2.        HATTERS ARISING F30K TEE HIWTES

 2.1       I tea 3 - Television and Press

  2 .1 .1 The Chairman said th a t a meeting had fin a lly been arranged with
 -representatives of both the national and local cedi a, and th is vould take
  place in October 1981 a t the Niagara Sports Club. This was the f i r s t
  occasion upon which such a meeting had been possible, due to other
  cocxaitments of a ll concerned. The suggestions made a t the meeting on
  16 October 1980 w ill then be put forward. The Press Council had been
  approached about the d if f ic u lt ie s encountered but had been unable to
  assist and suggested th a t ind ividu al approaches were necessary.
 .   >
     2 .1 .2 The recent public disorder situation throughout the country, and
     the possible im plications fo r the forthcoeaing fo o tb all season, were then
     discussed. Mention was also made of the situations where crowd
     disturbances axe magnified by excessive oedia coverage, resulting in
      *copycat* incidents. Superintendent Lar-Jbert suggested that 'i t should be
     w ritte n into contracts w ith the television coepanies th at they should only
     photograph the actual sporting event taking place. Bcwever, Hr Bennison
     pointed out that the contracts are agreed between the Football League and
     the te le v is io n companies. Be suggested that le g is la tio n concerning the
     point raised by Supt Lambert may be the ansver. Hr England reiterated the
     point made at a previous meeting thct fcv d iffic u ltie s were encountered
     w ith the photographers d e ta ile d to covcr the actual eatch - ths ones
      taking excessive account of hooligar. orientated incidents were the news
      rep o rters. He maintained that a close liaison vith the television
      producer vhe attended the ma'.ch would b« extrcr-.jly benefJcinl .^nd had
 1.1.1 The Qtdnun a*ntio«od th* possibility o! using video recorders
 which could then by analysod end, wfcer* n*c*st*ry, cetrospectiv* arr*sts
 M<k. ftill photograph* vould b* obtain froo th* video recordings for
 us* 1a court vh«r« n*c*ssary. Apart fro* enabling th* polic* to catch
 hooligan*, it could have * d*t*rr*nt *ff«ct upon would-be hooligans vho
 M y think tvic* be fore’causing troubl* if th*y thought their actions v*r«
 being Monitored. Chief Superintendent Berold e*r.tion*d briefly th* fact
 that defendants at Leeds Crown Court had recently been found 'not guilty*
 of offences arising out of disturbances during the match between Sheffield
 Wednesday and Newcastle at Hillsborough at the beginning of the 1980/81
'season. They had produced television recordings as port of their
 successful defence.

 2.2   Itea 8.3 - Banning of Supporters

 2.2.1 Assistant Chief Constable (Operations) highlighted a problea which
 occurred last season over the release of a 'conviction* of a Sheffield
 Wednesday supporter involved in disturbances at Oldhaa. Despite the fact
 that the information was passed by us in good faith* it transpired that
 the person had not at that tine been convicted of the offence and was
 •waiting trial on a 'not guilty* plea. Mr England aentioned that of the
 naaes published after the disturbances at Oldhas, only two had reacted
 adversely, and one of those vas the person vho'vas not then convicted.

 2.2.2 Xn view of the difficulties caused by.this incident* the Clubs aust
 now obtain details of any of their convicted supporters fron the press
 If they wished to publish those details in their Batch progresses.


 3-    SAFETY OP SPORTS GROUNDS (DBSIGKATION) ORDER 1981

 3.1 Superintendent Hole told the aeeting that Rotherhaa and Barnsley
 DOV came within the provisions of this Order and Dcncaster could well
 follow in the near future. Mr Vaughan and aeabers of the working party
 had visited the grounds concerned.

-3 .2  Mr Vaughan said th a t in fo ra a l liaison had been maintained with a l l
 the South Yorkshire fo o tb a ll clubs fo r the past 12 months. Sheffield
 Wednesday presented no probleas; Barnsley and Rctherhaa vere being
 processed; and Doncaster and S heffield United vcre being investigated on
 an inform al basis. Be wished to thank a ll the clubs fo r th e ir excellent
 co-operation with the working party aeabers and he hoped the enquiries
 would reach a-successful-conclusion.                  -----


 4.     DEVELOPMENTS SINCE THE IAST MEETING

 4 .1      Mr Chester said th a t the companies forced through the Sheffield
 Onited Football Club had been brought about in an e ffo r t to recognise the
 value o f supporters and supporters* clubs in th e ir assistance to the
 parent club. S h e ffie ld Onited were trying to ensure that the supporters
 associations f e l t p a rt o f the club. The nev organisations have_ . -
 co n stitutio ns and form al cocmittees and he vas avare th at
 received a tremendous response to date. Strenuous e ffo rts vo'*           r ta id •
 «ade to ensure that these organisations w e r e ' successful. Mr       cse
 th a t two or three years ago the hooliganisa p r c b l e a was acu e.     -    *,
 th is had decreased and supporters had been thanked in t h e :ea                .
 T h e r e had been a good response to this in itia tiv e . The    a         *
 o u t th a t there had been a general decrease in arrests and ejections froa
 grounds over the last season.
         «w *#nnlK*» g«v* o e to iia ©t 11\* iatn tl?ic* tio n system op*r*tir>g to r
ju v e n ile s who vere M«b«r» o f the fcothtrho Bnit*d Junior Supporters Club.
To enter the junior turn*til** they vere required to product a birth
certificate and the Club vat trying to encourage families beck into
football grounds.

4.3 Chief Superintendent Watson suggested that not enough uaa was made
of the public relations man on Batch days, mart could be a development
of the functions of the man who plays the records in the pre~match period
so that his role encouraged the fostering of the spirit of good behaviour.
This man could possibly Identify mnd velccae the visiting supporters*
although Chief Superintendent Berold felt that this could be counter­
productive and induce a disorder situation.

4.4 Hr Wright suggested that drinks consuaed before the match could
create probleas and Mr Chester asked whether the police set local JPs to
discuss probleas st football grounds. The Chairman assured his that such
Meetings did take place* albeit not specifically in relation to football
Batches. Bovever* st the various informal meetings which did take place*
the probleas were aired.

4.5 Nr England cooaented that the ground regulations at Billsborough had
recently been altered and asked whether the police would, with that backing,
refuse entry to known miscreants. The Chairman assured his that they would
refuse access to the ground to known trouble causers but said that the
re-written regulation was short of the phrase *deny access to,*. On the
face of it, it merely allowed policesen to eject persons causing trouble
inside -the ground and, while the police would interpret this regulation
in the spirit in which it was meant, it could well be re-written, with the
addition of the missing phrase, to good effect.

 4.6 Hr Bennison suggested that the police should draft an appropriate
 ground regulation which could then be included by the clubs, and the
 Chairman said that this could and would be done as a matter of urgency.


 S.     FPTORg OPERATIONAL DITTICTTLTIES

 5 .1    The Chairmen stated th a t the Football Association, in th e ir wisdom,
 had ensured that on a lte rn a te Saturdays four cf our clubs were a t Booe,
 w ith only S h effield Wednesday being Away. Obviously the reverse applied
 on the a lte rn a te Saturdays. This created certain operational d iffic u ltie s
 which would be overccoe but these were exacerbated in some circumstances
 such as when the S h e ffie ld Show occurred,      four fo o tb a ll matches
 takin g place w ithin the county on the sa^e day, end s im ila rly the St Leger
 Race Week a t Doncaster coincided w ith the sjse four clubs being at Booe.
 T h is would represent a considerable drain on sanpcver resources.

 5 .2     Superintendent Mole proposed that stevards should lia is e with the
 F ir e Service concerning f ir e precautions in view of the recent^nation wide
 disturbances when f i r e bcsbs had been throvn, but Kr Bennison, supported
 by Hr Spinks, id e n tifie d the current d iffic u lty in obtaining stewards.
 Mr W right asked’ whether police cadets, or a sim ilar body w ithin the Fire
 S e rv ice , could uzidertake supervision of fire points, but the d iffic u ltie s
 in h eren t in such a systea were pointed out to hia.

 5 .3  Chief Superintendent Berold si'id that he and his Sub-Divisional
 Cocrnander, Superintendent Chapoan, had spoken to stewards on this subject
m   r
        '   and safety In general during * friendly Mtch at *111thorough, and they
            proposed to hold an exorcise to test safety precautions In th« near
~           future. Be suggested that other elubs might consider doing something
            similar.


            6.    AKY OTHER BUSINESS

            6.1 Chief Inspector Stuart informed the Meeting that during the forth*
            coving se»son, an officer from the Football Liaison Department vould be
            on duty at Headquarters on all match days. Advance information about
            spectator movements etc. should be as full as possible so that the
            Football Liaison Department can inform the Force to be visited by our
            spectators in the hope that the quality of our information would be
            reciprocated when we receive four sets of supporters on alternate
            Saturdays.


            There being oo other business the meeting closed at 12.35 pa.

P osition in South Yorkshire
The Hillsborough Stadiua o f the Sheffield Wednesday Football Club ltd . v«s
designated by the Secretary of State as requiring to apply to the County
Council fo r a Cenersl Safety C ertificate by 1st January, 1979. Following
   l *il*d investigations by the Officer Working Percy for the Sheffield D istrict*
the C e rtific a te was granted on 21st Deceaber, 1979, a fte r approval by the
C oonittee.
    O ffic e r Working Parties for the four D istricts hsve also been giving

General Safety C e rtific a te

On 30th November, 1978, the Conrattee approved a draft General Safety Certificate
\copj attached) as the b&sis for the stardard c e rtific a te to be used throuehoec
the County.

The General Safety C e rtific a te granted to the Sheffield Wednesday Football Club
L td . on 21st December, 1979, was based on the standard c e rtific a te vith additions
to aeet the particular conditions at the Hillsborough Stadium.

Experience gained since the granting of the Sheffield Wednesday General Safety
C e rtific a te has shown the d es ira b ility of incorporating two ainor aoendaents
to the standard c e rtific a te for the following reasons:-
(a)         the Chief Conatablt feels it essential that, in order to maintain
            public safety, th* police commander at a football ground should
            have tha discretionary power to decide the actual moment whan chc
            •xit fata* should be opened. To safeguard the Folic* and th* Club
            concerned, it is suggested that paragraph 10 should b« amended
            accordingly, tad

(b)        as it is standard practice for.Institution of Electrical Engineers*
            C«rtificat«s to be issued for five years for completely new
            installations and lesser periods for other installations (based on
            the results of tests and the known age of the installation) it is
            felt that the 12 months requirement mentioned in line 2 of paragraph
            26 should be amended Accordingly.

Recommendation

(i)        That the standard South Yorkshire General Safety Certificate b« amended
            to read as follows

             (a) Paragraph 10

             "The Bolder shall ensure that, except vhere otherwise marked on
             the plans, all doors and gates which fora an egress route between
             any spectator accooaodation and the public highway, or other open
             space outside the stadia, shall be so secured as to open inediately
             and easily from the inside and shall be manned at all times the ttadita
             is heing used for a Specified Activity by at least the number of stevaxds
             required by Fart 2 of Schedule 3. All such doors or gates shall be
             opened by the stewards responsible and secured in the fully open
             position at a time agreed between the Bolder and the Chief Constable
             and at any other time on evacuation of the stadium or a part thereof oa
             heing ordered so to do by a police officer in uniform or by the sounding
             of the alarm”.

             (b) Paragraph 26

             tlThe Bolder s h a ll w ith in  .months of the date of this c e rtific a te and
             thereafter not less than once in each period of five years in respect
             o f new installatio ns (and such lesser period as the Chief F ire Officer
             may require in respect o f other installations) supply to the Chief
             Fire Officer the c e rtific a te of an independent E le c tric a l Engineer as
             to the current compliance or non-compliance of the e le c tric a l
             in sta llatio n w ithin the stadium with Section E of the I.E .E . Regulations
             or other sections or Regulations for-the tiee being in force relating
              to the E lectrical Equipment of Buildings".

        Dear Sir,

        Sheffield Wednesday Football Club

        I attach copy of a letter d a t e d a n d plans from the Club’s
        Consultants, Messrs. Eastwood & Partners, relating to proposals to erect
        radial barriers on the West Terrace for ground control purposes and also
        to erect security gates at various locations around the North Stand now
        that the gymnasium is open to the general public.

        As discussed on the 'phone today between Hr. D. Vaughan of my staff and
        Chief Inspector T. Stuart of your Operations Division, a meeting of the
        Officer Working Party vill he held at 9.30 a.s. on Friday, 11th September,
        1981, in the Conference Room at the Division Street Fire Station, Sheffield,
        to discuss the proposals and formulate a response.

        Perhaps you will kindly arrange to be represented at bosh Headquarters and
        Divisional levels, as usual.

                                                                                Yours f a it h f u lly ,

               Dear Hr. Mallett,
               Wfe arc experiencing delays anfi very heavy congestion on the
               Penistone Itoad side of our ground, particularly fear evening
               Batches. This, we feel sure, is due to a shortage of turn­
               stiles. ife have looked into isproviag this particular
                afcea an3, hopefully the alterations could be made at the
                end of the season but to get over the iimediate problem,
                we could in fact erect six turnstiles with no other
                ccrcplication than taking out an exit gate, and this gate
                vould be replaced with .-another *hen the main alteration
                was done next svsnrer.
                I have already spoken to Chief Superintendent Berold, and
                this proposal’meets with his unqualified agreement.

                Will you look into this natter with the utmost urgency,
                end I shall be pleased to have your deliberations, in
                order that viiatever work needs to be done can be started
                immediately.

             Dear Mr. Mallett,
             Further to ay telephone conversation with Mr. David
             Vaughan this morning, I have pleasure in enclosing plan
             and     •n«; of our proposed alteration fit Penistone Road.

             TO further explain our predicament, the reason     cannot
             replace the exit gate immediately is, the area *i>ere it
             will go along with six sore turnstiles is at the present
             tine a toilet area \£iich will have to he moved. 2hs
             spectators, viho would normally use the present gate, could
             in fact use Door *0* as an exit.

              May we have your approval to make these alterations, and
              we will then submit the necessary plans etc.

              Yours sin cerely .

        !•     Furpo«« of Meeting

        The purpose of the meting vet to consider the request of the Sheffield
        Wednesday Football Club ltd. (contained in correspondence circulated to each
        °v     disciplines represented on the Working Farty) to temporarily increase
        the tuaber of turnstiles on the Fenistone ftoed tide of the ground by taking
        o«t the 11 ft. exit gate and installing six additionel turnstiles, pending
        the carryitig out of e permanent scheae in the 1982 close season.

        i:____Additionel TVirnstiles

        The' Police representatives pointed out that public order and public safety
        probleas vere caused on occasions outside the ground (mainly at evening aatcfees)
        hy spectators spilling ait onto Fenistoae Road vhilst trying to gein admission
        to the gromd. These probleas had been discussed with the Club, and had
        probably resulted in the request now before the Working Party. However, vhilst
        pitting the case for additional turnstiles, the police representetives stressed
        t7*t ln no v*y did they consider this shculd be done at the expense of aeans
        of escape, shculd the Working Party consider that this would be the result of
        the Club's temporary proposals now under consideration.

        ?**      Service representatives reported that they had carried out a site
        inspection, and pointed out that the existing five exits in question vere only
        Just adequate in the event of anaxiauat capacitycrowd (usingthe Green Guide
f   I   calculations).

        The Working Party discussed a ousber of options which aigbt be open to the Club,
        pending the carrying out of the permanent proposals in the 1982 close season.

        I*.'■A S AGRttD th a t, v h ils t the Club’ s peraaiiest proposals were welcoae in
        Pr ***cip le , £he temporary proposals for six additional turnstiles on the         *
t       Penistcnc Rosd side of the ground (byresoving theexisting           21 f t . exit gate)
        could not be supported.

           WAS ALSO AGREED that, in order to be constructive, the folloying options
        should be brought to the Club’ s notice:-

                * reduction of 3,860 in tbe Spion Rop capacity should the Club wish
                to proceed with the temporary proposals;
Cb>   tht construction of lost fora of easily rtacvtable turnstiles to ttublt
       tht exist log 21 ft. 6xi t gets to contitut to V« available;
                                     %

<c)   tht construction of otv turnstiles in the area of the Stadiui between
       the cod of tht South Sttod tod tht Fenistone toad, possibly for use soltly
       tt evening aatches vhtrt largt attendances are envisaged should tht

Vhilst ntither tht Cluh nor its Consultants had replied to        data to tht
representations made regarding .tht new police and first facilities, tht Folict
representatives rtporttd that it appeared that soae progress vat being'aade and
that tht subject had httn discussed at a rtctnt Board setting.

IT WAS AGREED that, in tht abstnct Of a fin indication frost tht Club as to vhtn
tht otv polict and first aid facilitits art to be providtd, Mr.        Vaughanshould
draw to tht Club*s atttntion that tht North Stand capacity       is dtttmintdby
tht evacuation tiat of 8 ainutts originally agrttd using tht non~coabustibility
standards of tht Crttn Cuidt. If tht existing polict and first aid facilities
art to rtaain, than tht tvacuation tist vill havt to bt rtductd to tht
conbustible standard evacuation tiat of 2J ainutts. Maturelly, this vould
tntail either a rtduction in the nuabtr ©f spectators adaitted to tht North

information And your fils s copy of * note Z hsv* dict*t*d for ay
divisional fil* relating to tb* provision of th* police room facilities
at th* Club.

Hy position 4s Divisional Cosaander is scMvfcat delicate in that following
problems with th* evening match when Wednesday v*r* *t bam* to Rotherham,
I pressed th* Club management into considering putting 1a more tumstil*s
w there was a vary real risk to pedestrians queueing outside tb*
F*aistoo* Road turnstiles and spilling into the dual carriageway, ifcat
initiative was largely responsible for the Club's present position.

1 know that v* have to abide by the Safety of Sports Grounds Act 1975 -
as writtan - and can never knowingly consent to breeches of tb* rules,
but in all the tim* I have been responsible for the policing of
Hillsborough there bavm been a number of occasions when I have bed
considerable problems (and resultant risk to life and limb) getting
P*ople into the ground but never one occasion when we have bad
difficulty getting them out. Despite that, however, what has come out
of this current move is that the Club now knows that the County Council
r*ally have then by the 'short and curly's’ and unless and until they
tske action to provide the facilities required by the Act, then they are
Dot likely to be granted any other form of concession - temporary though

*hich was attended by other »»©ber« of the TtCC and Sergeant         rq (op#)
division, and chaired by D ivisional Officer 3ones of the Pire Service.

Con»iitr»tion m m given to th« propoMli being put forward by th* Club to
replace one of the existing exit gates oo Penistooe Road vith six *ore
turnstiles. Whilst those present agreed in principle with the advantages,
the Fire Brigade said that they could not in any way concede to the request
without sone alternative arrangements being »ade to bring up the nuober of
Exit units still existing to the ainiaua of 69 units width required by the
Safety Certificate.

Ibe Secretaryt David Vaughan, of SYCC, is to convey the Meetings feelings by
latter to the Club, putting forv&rd possible alternatives in that sooe torn-
•tiles giving access to the Kop could be sited in the existing 13" wall in
the car park adjacant to the emergency exit gate near to the Hillsborough
Suite. Alternatively, soee fora of removable tarnstiles could Le considered
if such itecs are available. The only third alternative being that if the
6 turnstiles to be installed at the Penistone Road side *e^n the closure of
tb* 21 ft. existing Exit gate, then the arithmetic of the utter Beans that
the Club would have to agree to a capacity reduction of 3,840 persons on the
Kpp. this, of course, reduces the total ground capacity below 50,000.

David Vaughan of SYCC is to forward ®e a copy of his letter to the Club.

              Police and First Aid Facilities

    *ol*ce and the Area Health Authority representatives confirned that the
outline drawing illustrated the basic features which they had asked should
   incorporated at earlier meetings with tbe Club.

H                  the Club's proposals were acceptable in principle, subject

on behalf of the Working Party):-                             *

        Regulation approval fro® tht Building Authority.

3_.___ Temporary Structures

At the netting held st the Hillsborough Stsdiua on 4th February, 1912, concern
vas txpresstd as to tht possibility of inadtquatt structural stability of
ttmporary structures, such ss scaffolding used in connection vith ttltvisioo
transmissions. Tht Club had bttn rtnindtd of thtir obligations.

Sinct that tint, tht Club had bttn in touch vith the Ttltvisioo Authoritits
vho, in turn, had bttn in touch vith Mr. Vaughan by *phone. As at that stage
only idtas (nainly of a structural nature) vert being floated, it vas agreed
that the best aethod of Baking progress vas for the Television Authoritits to
contsct the Building Authority dirtct.

Tht discussions which then took plact indicated that tht provision of stmi-
ptnumtnt or ptrcantnt facilitits vas bting considtred. As tht position
currtntly vas that tht proposals atoost had substanct, it had been suggtsted
to the Club (by lttttr. dated 31st March) .that the next stagt vas for the
Club and its Consultants to agrtt appropriatt proposals vith the Television
Authorities and then to submit arrangement drawings for consideration by
the vhole Offictr Vorking Party in tht usual vay.

4.      Additional Turnstiles and Exit Cate in Penistone Road

The Club *t the setting on 4th February had expressed their intention of
proceeding in the forthcooing close season vith the demolition of seae of the
existing toilets on the Penistone Road side of the Staciia in order to
provide additional turnstiles and an exit gate at that side of the Stsdiua.

It vas suggested that it say veil be that the Club would carry out the work,
at the sase tite as the provision of the nev first aid and police facilities
if pressured to do so. Certainly, additional turnstiles vere desperately
needed (especially at evening notches) at the Penistone Road side of the
Stadiim in view of the lioited area available for queuing ar.d the consequent
inhcrtnt danger to~"both spectators ar.c road traffic.   Additir-cl'y, the stc-t
*~dths free: that side of the St 2 diu2 vere just adequate, ar.d an extra exit
vould relieve the situcricr..

IT V.AS AGREED that Chief Superintendent Herold vculc let both Mr. V a u g h a n
*nd Divisional Officer Ray have details of the police recosoeadations.
Following this. Divisional Officer Ray would ccnfina to Mr. Vaughan the
County Fire Service support of the proposals, and Mr. Vaughan would incl e
*n appropriate paragraph in his letter to the Club.

           u n ti l th e and of next season, due e n tire ly to the size o f th e
           p ro je c t end the p o ssib ility o f creatin g hazards for our

    Dear Sir,
                                                                                   7f
    Safety of Sports Grounds Act, 1975          V
    X understand that the Club has coenenced re-developoent work on the
    Penis tone toad side of the ground, involving new turnstiles, toilets
    and refreshment area, etc.

    As you will recall, tbe proposal was first raised on a temporary basis
    by tbe Club*s letter dated 25th September, 1981. Subsequent correspondence
    and meetings of the Officer Working Party indicated that, whilst the
    teaporary proposals could not be supported, the County Council supported
    in principle the need on public order, and safety grounds for improvement
    of the Penistone Road side of tbe Stadiua.

    However, except for a sketch plan of the teaporary proposals forwarded
    with your letter dated 30th Septeaber, 1981, the County Council has not
    had formal notification as required by the General Safety Certificate or
    detailed drawings and calculations of the Club’s permanent proposals for
    consideration under the.Safety of Sports Grounds Act.

     It may well be that, because of the County Council's support in principle
     of the need for improvement of the Penistooe Road side of the Stadiun,
    -th a t this has been overlooked by the Club or its Consultants.

    Perhaps you would kindly arrange to le t me have five copies of the detailed
    drawings and calculation? of the work now in hand.

                                                     Yours fa ith fu lly ,

     obtained the necessary planning and building regulation approvals, they had
     overlooked the necessity of seeking approval under the Safety of Sports
      .rounds Act, 1975, to the proposed improvements at the Penistone Road end of
^   the Ground. Through the Officer Working Party, the County Council had
W   indicated to the Club over 12 months ago that they supported the improvement*
     xn principle, particularly the provision of additional turnstiles, but the club
     nad not previously supplied any details or plans.

    -?«     Penistone Road End Improvements.

    The Officer Working Party considered the detailed plan now supplied by the
    Club of the proposals to provide additional turnstiles, new toilet facilities
    and new refreshment facilities at the Penistone Road end of the Hillsborough
    stadium by demolishing the existing toilet facilities, re-siting one of the
    existing sliding/folding egress gates and digging into the rear of the
    existing Spion Rop.

               FOR THE POLICING OF FOOTBALL MATCHES -
               •EVACUATION AND STEWARDING*



 The Interim Report; of the Committee of Inquiry into Crowd Safety
 and Control of Sports Grounds, under the Chairmanship of
 Mr Justice Popplewell, was published in July 1985 and has been
 supplemented by Hocre Office Circular 54/85 which urges, srongst
 other things, chief officers of police to respond quickly and
 constructively to the spirit of the recccirendations. The report
 contained 24 recommendations including the following:        * -

 Reccrmnendat ion 1

 'Evacuation procedures should be a natter of police training
 and form part of the briefing by police officers before a
 football natch,'                   .

 Recommsndat ion 10

 ‘Stewards in all grounds should not only be trained in fire
 precautions and fire fighting but should also be trained
 in how best to help the police in evacuation.'

 As you are aware, evacuation plans and the training of stewards
 have been exa.Tdned. A ccnnon framework irakes reference to plans’"
 far sinpler and allows officers with limited knowledge of the
 stadium to contribute -tore effectively and with greater speed
 in an evacuation situation.

 In drawing up the suggested forrrat it was acknowledged that
 considerable flexibility is necessary to take account of the
 many local factors that make each ground unicue.

 Vfhilst responsibility for the training of stewards lies f i m l v
 with the club, the police have a vested interest in -axiniising
 tne crowd ~ar.5ge.Tent potential of non police resources at sports
 Grounds. io t m s end it is ieit the oolice should orovice a
 significant input into the training of stewards and that the new
 appendix on stewarding (attached) provides a satisfactory* fca^is
 for ensuring adequate standards are achieved and iraintained.

 Appendix 'L' r page 35 of the South Yorkshire. Police Standing
 Instructions ror tne Policing of Football >!atches, should now be
 removed and repieced with the new Appendix 'L' oages 35 - A3 ,
 attached hareto.

 Page 2 of the Index of the Standing Instructions should also he
 a.T*=nded so that the last line reads - Aroendix 'L* 35 - 43
 Elrergency Evacuation Procedures/Stewards.
Following the abolition of the County Councils cn 31 Karch 1986,
District Council Officers will ba rospor^ible for Safety of Sports
Ground Act iretters as from 1 April 1986, together with representation
of the Local Building Authority, Fire Service and Police. It is not
envisaged that this will have any significant effect on established
procedures and the working party will continue to function as outlined
at paragraph 16.1, page 11, of the Standing Instructions. Reference
made however in that paragraph to South Yorkshire County Council
should, be aniended to read 'District Council*.

                SUBJECT:            POLICING - HILLSBOROUGH FOOTBALL GROUND


                I refer to the memorandum dated 8 May 1986, requesting suggestions
                from various Officers who have been intimately concerned vitr. the
                policing at Hillsborough.

                The policing of the ground is by and large a fairly smooth affair
                but I believe that we could considerably enhance our efficiency
                with certain changes which could be made by the Club in their
                procedures.                    _             _

                Inspector Creaser has highlighted various cf these and all of them
                have been shown before when we have made approaches to the Club,
                in many cases with very little success. One of the greatest
                problems we have is access to-the ground, particularly at the
                Leppings Lane end. The redesigned turn stiles do not*give any­
                thing like the access to the ground, either cn the Leppings Lane
                terraces or in the West Stand, needed by away fans.

                On occasions last season when large numbers attended, we had avay
                supporters who were justify ably irate because of the i n e f f i c i e n c y
                of the system , which was turned on the police and could, have
                 resulted in public disorder.

                One of the points which is not mentioned is the access fci hoae
                supporters at the Penistone Road end where ticket holders at major
                matches do not have sufficient turn stiles to alicv smooth access -
                There is a gross lack of flexibility in the manner in which turn
                stiles operate at the Penistone Road enc for the Spion. Xcp and
                the North Stand, which may well be aggravated if more hens fans
                decide to use the Kco new it is covered-

                I have in the past suggested at the Club that they lock at the
                problems, both of allowing ticket holders easy access and s Li tCfil
                lining the entry for paying customers by using a number cf 1corr
                money turn stiles', as is the case at other grounds.

                Inspector -Creaser mentioned my interest ir. the .-an:                                        •.ic

I must echo the comments made by Inspectors^Crscser, White and
Svkes that the majority of problems as hillsbcrougn are as a result
of the clubs inability to efficiently run tneir own arrairs on
match days.

            SUBJECT-                SAFETY AT SPORTS GROUNDS r REVISED EDITION
                                    OF THE GUIDE TO SAFETY AT SPORTS GROUNDS


            I have gone through the whole of this extremely comprehensive document
            and whilst a considerable amount of the contents is applicable to management
            of the club, engineering problems and fire officers, certain paragraphs
            are worthy of mention in relation to Sheffield Wednesdays Football Ground
            at Hillsborough.

            Paragraph 16 relating to crowd pressures. As you are aware the kop has       j
            had a tendency at recent matches to produce this wave effect_and it is
            necessary that when a large match is anticipated in the future, we should    \
            ensure that the numbers allowed onto the kop strictly adhere to the capacity
            allowed. It is imperative therefore that the automatic counting system
            is always in working order for 'A* and *B' category matches. such as the
            visits of Manchester United, where almost capacity crowds can be expected.
f
            Paragraph 23 onwards lays down the management responsibility very clearly
            and is to be welcomed, since there have in the past, been grey areas as to
            who is responsible for crovsd control etc.

            Paragraph 28 recommends the appointment of a safety officer and identifies
            his duties. I can only presune that the safety officer is in fact       Lock,
            although I have never heard him designated as such, and this should be
             clarified with the club.    Furthermore, in the discussion of a central
             control point being designated (other than then police control), one would
             assurae that the central control point designated in respect of the Sheffield
            'Wednesday ground would be the video viewing room in the south stand.

            Paragraph 43 relates to records of tests kept and examination of the ground.
            I am not aware that these are kept by the club.

            Paragraph 199 relates to exercises of stewards regarding emergency procedures
     ■T
      j '
            and I am not aware that the club have ever carried out exercises in this
    (       respect.

             In conclusion, Sheffield Wednesday Football Club have complied with the
             guide,to a very large extent, more so I would suspect, than the majority
             of clubs in the country, and it is only on minor points as identified above
             where improvements could be made, so far as police procedures are concerned.

             Dear Sir,
                               Safety of Sports Gruunu Act 1975 ~ Spioa Kop
                                                        Development
                      ThanX you for your letter of 13 October, setting out
             the matters which were discussed at tbe meeting at the ground
              on 12 September. Our comments on the various matters are as
              follows (taXing the paragraphs in the same order as your
|e«<        - letter)
                    Return barriers on radial gangways completed a day or
              two after the meeting.                                          ‘                                     ___
                         The continuation of the top crush barrier adjacent to
              grid line 14 is not considered appropriate.                                  It will be
              realised that there has to be a                       balance j     with the need to
              penalt free movement sometimes being »ore important than
              slavishly following the recoaaendation of continuous b a r r i e r s
               at fixed spacing (for example the police.request during last
               susvmer that we should remove parts of barriers at the Leppincs
               Lane end).

                         All perimeter sheeting now has the guard mesh in front
                    it

SAFETY Q F SPOfTIS GKttCS ACT 1975 - SHEFFIELD WTEED FOOTBALL CLUB
M O SHEFFIELD WEDNESDMf FOOTBALL CLUB

 I refer to your letter dated 13 Hy^cter 1986.

Both stadia, eo far as the tolioe are concerned, neet our requirements
under the 1975 legislation.

 Co-operation afforded by both clubs is very satisfactory with the
 exception of the lade of OC3V facilities at Brarnll Lane. It is hoped
 that this can be remedied as soon as possible as it will be a valuable
 asset to us in effectively policing the ground.

 Yours faithfully

               On Tuesday. 10 March 1987, I attended a meeting at the Fire Station,
               Division Street. Various items were discussed aost of which were of
              .no direct Interest to the Police but I *et out below items which axe
               of interest and could possibly be examined and resolved at the next
               hone fixture.

«•             Sheffield Wednesday

               1   The Fire Brigade reported that they rede a spot check at Hillsborough
                   daring the Chelsea natch (30 8 86). They found that stewards were
                   not in position at the sliding gates below the South Stand. The gates
                   were locked and it would have been impossible to gain egress frcrn
                   that area in the event of a fire.

               2   Persons were seen clisbing on the girders at the rear of the new kop.

               3    The bolts on the gates at various points is tbe perimeter fence were
                    of the ordinary sliding bolt type. It would be no6t difficult to
                    undo this type of bolt in a panic situation where people are crushing
                    against the gates and putting pressure on the bolt.

               Sheffield United

               A spot check here had shown stewards not in position at locked gates and
               on another occasion stewards frctn Rotherham were being used. These
r              persons did not have local knoyledge of the grouid.

Future Administration of tbe Council's Certificating Function

Following « meeting on Tuesday 10th Karch I have given some further thought to
tbe above subject.

Many points mere raised-at tbe meeting but I think that the general feeling m s
that the roles of each Authority Involved in the system should be defined
perhaps along tbe lines adopted by tbe South Yorkshire County Council.

I have no objection in principal to roles being defined in this may but I should
make It clear that if it Is agreed that particular Authorities adopt particular
roles then they will be under a duty to consult with other interested parties
where there is an overlap of Interest. As I see It the Authority which carries
out a particular role will have the responsibility of advising tbe Council as
Certificating Authority on all matters falling within that Lead Authority role.
                                           <


 I have drawn up a draft Schedule which atteapts to define Lead Authority roles.
 I should point out that the draft is intended to be open for discussion and I
 would therefore welcome your coataer.ts on it. Would you please also let me know
 if there are any other matters trtiich should be Included in the Schedule.

 Moving onto the question of inspections of stadia, this point feas also discussed
 at the meeting on 10th March. My view la that the existing syste* of hi annual
 limited Inspections Is no longer appropriate; I feel that one major Inspection
 Per       should be carried out on each stadlua which should include all the
 areas and installations within the scope of the legislation. To back up this
 inspect ion there should he a number of "during performance" inspections by
 Officers. I thisk that there Is general agreement in relation to “during
 Performance inspections as they would highlight the performance of the safety
 systea at each stadium whilst it i t in operation.
                                                             Cont...

                                                               736690 - Mr. Bovnes
                      Fw WWpSofi*      ofth'oiraS*"   r«*{                      .(STD Coo* 0742}
Perhaps "durltg performance* inspections could be arranged me that each
Authority carries put such inspections independently with • tegree ef central
co-ordination to prevent two Inspections t«Uo( place simultaneously. At the
first step towards the development of • programme oi inspections It might b*
appropriate for me to arranf* a Joint inspection involving representatives fron
•11 tbe authorities in order to provide as insight into problem* ifclch may b*
encountered.

Moving on to tbe "working party" structure I think It is dear from tbe meeting
of lOtb March that some clarification of its status is required. It is
reasonably el«ar from tbe Couaty Council's records tbat the working party as
such v u actually a decision aiUo( body presumably sctlngunder delegated
powers. Bovever, tbe normal City Council practice is that tbe principal powers
remain with * Committee or Sub-Committee (In this ease tbe General Purposes
Panel) with routine mstters being delegated to a Chief Officer (in this case
syself). I would therefore propose to ask the Panel to accept tbe working party
 ms a forum for discussion.

I take a view tbat tbe lead Authority will be able to use the Sorting Party ms
m useful forum for discussion prior to drcvlng up tbat Authorities formal view
to be submitted to tbe Certificating Authority. I propose that when an
Authority feels that a meeting would be appropriate contact should be made with
my Chief Licensing Officer, Hr. k v a t * , ubo will then make arrangements for the
meeting to take place. An agenda will be prepared and circulated prior to the
meeting and at the conclusion of the meeting Mr. Bovnes mill prepare a list
shoving tbe subjects discussed and tbe action to be takeo by each Lead
Authority. This list will be circulated ms well.

 Would you please consider the points I have raised and let      me    have yourcomments
 on them In due course; It will be necessary for me to formulate a report to the
 General Purposes Panel on the administration of the Certification system.

 Tours faithfully,

congratulate Chief Superintendent Meacovs on receiving the Queens Police Medal.

Financial Aspects on Policing Football Grounds in South Yorkshire

Chiej. Superintendent Denton spoke to the Conference on this subject and said
that football overtime allocations for the season 1 5 8 6 / 8 7 was £ 5 4 7 , 6 0 0 and the
force maintained expenditure at 84% of the budget.

He continued by saying that for the cosing season, £ 6 4 0 , 5 0 0 had been allocated.

A general discussion took place on the allocation of overtime at football
matches and was concluded by Chief Superintendent Denton asking members to
monitor the situation although the allocation had been increased.

Chier Superintendent Denton also spoke on policing football grounds and payment
 y ciubs for that facility. After a short discussion he concluded by saving
that a forthcoming meeting with club members would clarify the situation*and
enable written contracts to be drawn up.

Public Order Guide on Football Hooliganism and Use of CCTV/Photography (Video)

Superintendent Stuart circulated a draft guidance of paragraph 12 (Football
Hooliganism Section) ACP0 .Mini Manual for Public‘Order.

A short discussion took place resulting in all commanders agreeing with the
principle. The Chairman concluded by saying that he would consider the matter.
(This was discussed at chief officer level and the decision was status quo).

Public Transport

Assistant Chief Constable Jackson introduced this item and said that the
provisions of Public Transport at football catches was one of the elements to
providing a successful police operation, however, it was not the responsibility
of the police to provide that service.

A short discussion took place resulting in the Chairman saying that hopefully
Transport Corporation would provide transport for the coming season or arrange
for another company to do so. Mr Jackson asked that divisional comanders
monitor the situation.

Overt/Covert Police Operations (Use of Spotters)

Superintendent Stuart introduced this item and said the use of overt and covert
spotters had been discussed at the first  and second division     conferences.

He said that other forces had used overt  and covert spotters     within police
operations resulting in a high degree of success, however, both systems were
labour intensive and costly.

The use of overt and covert spotters was discussed at length and Chief
Superintendent Mole said that spotters fros the British Transport Police gave F
Division an excellent service at the Leeds semi final.

He continued by saying that such a systes should be   on an exchange basis and
would help to reduce football hooliganism.

The Chairman agreed and said arrangements should be made by Divisional
Commanders to exchange spotters where it vas clear useful intelligence would be
gained and that he should be consulted if it was felt that a      covert operation
was necessary.

Membership Schemes
    *
Assistant Chief Constable Jackson said that a meeting had taken place to discus
Membership Schemes and conditions. A list of conditions were defined and
accepted in a scheme vithin South Yorkshire but the clubs hadnot agreed at chi
stage to introduce photographs on membership cards.

Superintendent Stuart continued by saying that all clubs in South Yorkshire had
entered into the scheme. The members discussed the COGGANS systen.

Mr Stuart outlined at length the Membership Scheme including the Membership Car
and its format.

Assistant Chief Constable Jackson saic that the scheme did not directly affect
the hooligan element but was designed to embrace all the converted and family
taembers and allowed the police to concentrate on other areas of crowd control
and hooliganism.
He continued by saying that hopefully Membership Card Scheme would promote
family areas within the ground, thus requiring less policing. The system was a
government initiative in conjunction with the Football Association and it will
be monitored, assessed and developed accordingly. Any comments regarding the
scheme should be forwarded to Superintendent Stuart, Operations for collation
during the season.

Exclusion Orders

The Chairman introduced this item and explained fully the system involving
Exclusion Orders anc the taking of photographs.

A lengthy discussion took place regarding photographs, equipment and
installation of the same resulting in the Chairman saying that officers should
be instructed in the use of camera equipment provided. This would reduce failure
rate in film exposures.   Inspector Eggleston said that he would provide the best
equipment available within the budget, being mindful of certain failure rates
involving prisoner photography.

The Chairman asked the members views on where the Exclusion Order Index should
be kept for easy access by our officers and other forces.

Acting Detective Chief Superintendent Addis explained the full system of
Exclusion Orders and a lengthy discussion took place on therecording and
retention of the Orders.

The discussion was concluded by the Chairman saying that advice would be sought
from Superintendent Hale (Communications and Computers Department) regarding the
possibility of entering Exclusion Orders on the BODS FILE for easy accessability
and an order outlining procedures would be produced.

South Yorkshire Police Standing Instructions on Football

The Chairman introduced this item and said that the Orders would require some
amendments in relation to Exclusion Orders and Membership ScheEes, and a new
Force Standing Orcer in relation to Exclusion Orders.

The order was discussed and it was accepted there was n o need fcr further
change.                                                  "

1-   Purpose of Meeting
     The Chairman welcoised the representatives and recalled the recent
     problems encountered by certain football clubs in paying fo r the
     supply of special police services. The clubs needed their grounds
     policing for public control and safety reasons, and the recent High
     Court decision had defined the law as to the payment for such
     services. The Police Authority were naturally concerned to see that
     similar circumstances did not occur again. For these reasons, the
     Authority saw i t to be necessary to take action on two levels. Ths
     Association of Metropolitan Authorities hac been requested by the
     Authority to take action on a national level, and locally the clubs
     had been supplied with a copy of a draft contract which thevAuthori'
     would require the clubs to enter into as regard the payment'for the
     supply of special police services in respect o f the forthcoming
     football season. The clubs were invited to consent on the d ra ft'
     contract.                                          ------------------------—

Football      Cl u b s Vi ews

The Football Club representatives expressed the following views:-
(a)      Draft Contract
         The clubs did not object in principle to the d raft contract but
         considered that i t would have to be on more normal commercial
         lines to be acceptable. In p articu lar, in Clause 6 i t was
         considered that 3 hours was more appropriate as regards
         cancellation or postponement (as against the 5 hours quoted).
         Clause 7 was not liked at a l l , and the 14 days quoted in Clause
         8 ought to be the snore generally accepted 31 days as regards
         payment, together with the removal of the threat of termination.
         The 5% above base rate quoted in Clause 9 was f e l t to be
         excessive.
(b)      Scale of Charc-es
         The scale of charges attached to the draft contract showed an
         increase of 7/8% over l a s t year’s charges, whilst everyone else
         was looking to keep increases below 5%. Additionally, there was
         no guarantee as to the duration of the scale of charges (the
         l a s t increase having been applied by the Authority with effect
         from 1st April, 1987). The charges made for policing football \
         matches in South Yorkshire often compared unfavourably with        '
         those for similar fixtures in other parts of the country, and
         reference was made in p a rtic u la r to the policing costs of the
         F.A. Cup Semi-Finals at Villa Park and Hillsborough
         respectively. More than ever, football clubs had to look for
         means of cutting costs, and policing costs could not escape this
         exercise. One of the Clubs suggested that the minimum charge
         basis should commence at a crowd attendance at 2,000, rather
         than 1,000 as at present.
(c)      National Action                                                   ‘ ^
         I t was understood that the Football League had a Police Liaison
         Committee and representations could possibly be made through
         that Committee for national action. However, i t had to be born*
         in mind that the 92 clubs in the Football League tended to         <?
         operate on an enlightened sel f - in te re s t basis. In the final  'I
         event, those clubs who paid th e ir policing accounts promptly
         should not have to rear responsibility for the irresponsibly
         run clubs as well.
                                                                  \
P o l i c e A u t h o r i t y ’ s Views

The Police Authority responded to the views expressed by the football
c l ub s as f o l l o w s : -

                                    -3 -



    (a)   Draf t Contract

          The draft contract was based on a contract signed by the clubs
          in the Metropolitan Police area, but was open for discussion.
          On the specific point in Clause 6 on cancellation, officers from
          other Divisions often had to be called in to police football
          matches and, as they usually cane on duty at the ground at 1.00
          p.m., the period of 5 hours was the Einirsuni acceptable from an
          operational point of view. Additionally, the Statutory Police
          Regulations provided for a minimum payment to police officers
          for 5t hours duty in the case of Officers who volunteered tc
          work overtime on th e ir rest cay or off night s h if t i f they cnce
          report fo r duty. Unless they could be contacted before leaving
          home (which in some cases could be as early as 10.00 a.m.), the
          Police Authority had to pay them. The occasions when
          cancellation cr postponement of football matches became
          necessary were very infrequent when looked at in terms of the
          to tal number of satches played over the season, and perhaps the
          Football League could consider e a rlie r inspections by match
          referees when gases were in doubt- A copy of the actual
          Metropolitan Police contract would be obtained-
    (b)   Scale of Charses                                                  */-
          The scale of charges were d ire c tly related to Police pay and
          allowances (the annual Police Pay Award being effective fron 1st
          September annually). Whilst the Authority had increased the
          charges with effect from 1st April, 1987, the previous increase
          had taken place with effect from 1st December, 1985 (the
          Authority having delayed the implementation of the increase
          pending the outcome of the High Court Appeal judgement). As
          regards comparison with policing charges in other parts of the
          country, the figures shown in the Digest of Football S tatistics
          published by the Football Trust showed that the amounts charged
          to the South Yorkshire Football Clubs compared very favourably, \
          Additionally, the Digest showed th a t the Football Trust        \
          reimbursed clubs to the extent of 35% of the police charges        f
          (excluding VAT). The F.A. Cup Semi-Final was a one-off affair
          and was not charged on the same basis as other matches. Whilst
          the Villa,.Park charges might have been less than the           ‘^
          Hillsborough charges, i t was understood that the West Midi an; « ?
          police charges would not ba as low or. future occasions. An
          assurance was given th a t the scale of changes was not an attempt
          by the Authority to recover the policing costs lo st.
    (c)   National Action
          The Authority had made representations to the Association of
          Metropolitan Authorities that the Football League should act as
          guarantor for payment by football clubs of policing charges.
          This happened with other s e l f regulating bodies, such as the
          Building Societies .Association. Unlike the Police A u t h o r it y
          (who were recarded as an ^unsecured" creditor and thus only cot
          15p in the £ for the raterayers), the Foctball League was
            regarded as a "secured" creditor and thus received payment in
            full on the recent financial collapse of the Rotherhaa United
            Football Club. It was understood th a t a national scale of
            charges being considered by the Association of Metropolitan
            Authorities would generally be higher than the existing South
            Yorkshire charges.
4.   Future Action
     Whilst a revised d ra ft contract would be prepared and circulated for
     discussion at a further mestir.c to be arranged cn Friday 24th Julv.
     1SS7, the Police Authority stressed the extent of th e ir fiduciary
     duty. The recent High Court Appeal judgement had rasde the legal
     position very clear. If the Police Authority did not take reasonable
     steps to protect the interests of ratepayers, the individual Members
     of the Authority could be open tc surcharge by the D is tric t Auditor.
     The Authority did not wish to see any football club having to close
     and intended to be as sympathetic to clubs’ problems as possible.
     However, in the final event, the Police Authority had to give f i r s t
     p rio rity to i ts statutory duties and responsibilities.
                                                                               tr
                                                                               V

MINUTES OF THE PREVIOUS MEETING

The minutes of the meeting held on 6 August 1986 which had been previously
circulated were accepted as a true and accurate record.

MATTERS ARISING FROM THE MINUTES

a    Close Circuit Television

     The Chairman invited comment from tne members as to the success or
     otherwise of Close Circuit Television over thelast  season.

     Chief Superintendent Lodge said that the equipment at Barnsley had proved a
     success and a number of excellent arrests had resulted fror it.

     He continued by saying the equipment had also proved invaluable for
     intelligence gathering.

     A short discussion took place and it was generally agreed that the
     installation of Close Circuit Televisions at football grounds within South
     Yorkshire had been a success.

     Item discharged.

     Conduct of Players and Officials

        Jacksor. referred to item 3 or.   previous r.inutes a    id that in
     general the conduct of players ar    ficials vas good a     ery
     encouragement should be given for    s to continue.
     Members of the meeting agreed with the comments made by the Chairman.

     Item discharged.

c    Supply of Alcohol

     Club representatives queried the need for control of sale of alcohol in the
     grounds and said that it created a tendency to drink outside the ground and
     supporters arrived not too long before the match started.

     Mr Jackson said there was plenty of evidence by way of practical experience
     and research that alcohol vas a motivating factor in the commission of
     offences and a causation of hooliganism- He said that prior to the
     legislation he had policed a first division ground and the fans arrived not
     long before the game started having been drinking elsewhere. He said it
     was the topping up of alcohol inside the ground that could cause problems-

     He had noticed a tendency, however, for problems to develop away from the
     grounds and that he was a member of the National Working Party who wo-jld be
     considering all such matters to try in co-operation with clubs and everyone
     else with a vested interested, to resolve the issues. In the meantime,
     clubs and the police should continue their efforts to fight hooliganism and
     make their views known as certainly had been done so in the past.

EMERGENCY EVACUATION AND STEWARDING

The Chairman referred to documentation previously circulated outlining notes of
guidance for Stewarding and Emergency Evacuation Procedures. He stressed che
need to ensure that there vas appropriate briefing by the clubs and the
appointment of fit and responsible persons.  Tor our part, we would assist and
give advice.

It was agreed by everyone that ve should continue to ensure that public safety
was paramount and that the high standard of awareness would continue.

Item discharged


EXCLUSION ORDERS

The Chairman circulated guidance and said that from 1 August 1987 persons
arrested at football grounds having c o m i t t e d certain types of offences vculd be
subject to Exclusion Orders.
                                                                        \



Mr Jackson briefly outlined the procedure to obtain Exclusion Orders and i'S
effect on police and football clubs.
ALL TICKET MATCHES - FANS ARRIVING AT MATCHES WITHOUT TICKETS

Chief Superintendent Lodge said that their first match of the season was Leeds
United v Barnsley and although it was an all ticket match a substantial amount
of supporters would attend without tickets.

He continued by saying that this could create policing problems and there had
been suggestions that supporters could be allowed entry to the ground but this
would defeat the object of all ticket matches.

Chief Superintendent Broomhead said that this created two police operations one
inside the ground and another outside and by allowing persons into the ground
without tickets, would lose the credibility of all ticket matches and cause
general problems for others.

Mr Broomhead continued by saying that it was general policy to publish in the
local press and the programmes that persons attending without tickets would be
turned away.

Mr Jackson agreed with the general view of the members that persons without
tickets should not be alltiwed entry or otherwise we-would never stop non-ticket
holders coming thus aggravating future policing operations.


MEMBERSHIP SCHEMES

The Chairman said that this was a government initiative aimed at lessening
hooliganism at grounds.

He noted that clubs in South Yorkshire had not gone for a scheme which included
photographs and said it was generally felt that photographs should have been
included on the cards.

Mr Spinks, Secretary of 3arnsley Football Club said than to date, they had not
agreed on a Membership Scheme as the Football League Working Party had rejected
their Scheme on a technicality and proposed an amended Schese.

He continued by saying that the amended scheme was unacceptable in relation to
the segregation of members and non members and therefore was rejected by the
club.

Mr Spinks said that they intended resubmitting proposals back to the Football
League Working Party and welcomed any comment the police wished to make and
indeed invited officers to attend the ground to facilitate these actions-
                                                                      N

The Chairman said that Barnsley Football Club should try and resolve the
situation with the Football League Working Party and as it was their
responsibility to consider them and monitor thea, but there vas no doubt the
police would be asked to comment to assist the future evaluations.
Representatives from Barnsley Football Club said they would rather have no
scheme than accept proposals that were not constructive and workable. The
Chairman said that future developments and evaluations would hopefully determine
the use of such schemes.

Item deferred.

POLICE ROOM AT OAKWELL GROUND - UP DATE

Chief Superintendent Lodge said that the new police control room at Oakwell
Football Ground would be an asset to all concerned.

He thanked the representatives of Barnsley Football Club for their help and said
 ■Jaat the new control room would assist in better policing especially inside the
ground, ie: camera sightings, personnel address system and possible evacuation
procedures.

The Chairman agreed and thanked everyone concerned.

Item discharged.

POLICING ARRANGEMENTS 1987/88

The Chairman said that in addition to comments Eade earlier under Policing
Arrangements 1986/87, we should continue to work together and any problems
encountered by football clubs within the area should be discussed with the
appropriate commander.

Kr Jackson said that "football is a national sport to be enjoyed by families and
we should strive to stamp out hooliganism in whatever form.

Item discharged.

There being no further business the meeting closed at 12.25 pm.

CP1PAMCE
Where advice Is *iven to tbe bolder by any of the four Officers mentioned it
•bould be acted upon ia accordance with tbe time constraints given in tbe
•dvice. Tbe bolder is reminded that failure to take steps to ensure tbe
reasonable safety of spectators could five rise to a prosecution.

 Tbe Chief Constable sad bis Officers have a particularly
  elation to "public order* situations tbe correct handling of which should
 reduce any risk to spectator safety*
 The Chief Constable must therefore be provided with appropriate facilities at
 the stadium for control, crowd surveillance, detentioo and administrative
 purposes. These facilities are essential if public order is to be maintained
 mnd tbe risk to spectators minimised.
 Tbe Chief Constable must also be informed at the earliest possible moment of the
 proposed date and cootent of all specified activities so that appropriate
 planning can take place.
 In addition there must be consultation and agreement between the bolder and tbe
 Chief Constable well In advance of specified activities a b o u t the proposed
 methods of admission and the segregation of spectators. Consultation mtst also
 take place if advance information is-such that public order difficulties may
 arise. As a result of this consultation It is possible that the Qiief Constable
 may require, for reasons of preserving public order, that tbe specified act vity
  Is “all ticket” or the specified activity should not be played at all at the
 Stadium or tbe day and tbe time of the specified activity should be changed.

Dear Sir,

Fire Safety and Safety of Place ”&T port Act 1987
Safety Certification________________________

I refer to your letter of 3rd Deceaber, and feel that I ought to confirm
that only one Safety Certificate is currently in force in Sheffield, namely
that relating to Hillsborough.

As far as I can see the existing Hillsborough Certificate does not contradict
the amended Section 2 of the Safety of Spoils-Grounds Act 1975. As you are
aware, the draft revised Certificate conditfoojL:'0?hicir vere circulated to you
and upon which you commented some tine ago) take full* account of that
amendment of the 1975 Act.         /' *                      *4

Minutes of the last meeting (17 June 1987)

The minutes of the meeting held on 17 June 1987, which had been previously
circulated were accepted as a true and accurate record of that meeting.

Matters arising from the Minutes

There were no matters arising from the previous minutes - 17 June 1987.

Coach Operators/Traffic Commissioners Guidelines

Superintendent Stuart introduced this item and said that as a result of a
meeting with the Transport Manager of a local coach company (Ridings Travel) it
was apparent that some of the Traffic Commissioners Guidelines were not being
adhered to by Coach Operators throughout the country.  In particular, rule 4
'coaches attending designated events must not stop at any premises where '
intoxicating liquor is available'.
                                                                        <


Mr Stuart continued by saying that this guideline was difficult to implement as
most notorvray service areas sold intoxicating liquor and bona fide supporters
who wanted to stop at such premises for ordinary refreshments were being
penalised.
                                                                    \
He continued by saying that Ridings Travel were to lose approximately £50,000
per annum in revenue if they adhered to the guidelines as regular customers were
hiring coaches from other companies that stopped at motorway service areas
irrespective of the rule outlined.

The Chairman outlined in full the Traffic Commissioners Guidelines and the
procedure to be adopted through Mr Phillips, ACC at Greater Manchester,
Secretary to the ACP0 Sub Cormtcee on Hooliganism at Sporting Events of
breaches to those Guidelir.es.
Superintendent Stuart said that to date only 16 breaches had been reported to Mr
Phillips this season and in percentage terms this figure appeared low taking
into account the number of supporters coaches that travel nationally each
weekend.

Chief Superintendent Mole said that it was slightly unfair on normal supporters
when executive coaches were offering to travellers, champagne breakfasts and
other similar packages in order to attract custom. He continued by saying that
uniformity should be sought in implenenting the Guidelines nationally.

Chief Superintendent Mole said that one solution say be to 'stockpile' coaches
at such locations like Tankersley and question drivers as to their schedule
stops and then escort them in a convoy of ten to the appropriate ground.

The Chairman said that the use of intelligence across forces, good planning and
appropriate deployments were isportant features in preventing disorder and each
match should be treated on its merits.

A short discussion took place on the Guidelines resulting in the Chairman saying
that he had written to Mr Phillips about Rule A with a view to
it being discussed at a national level - the important thing was that we should
use all methods available that contribute to a reduction in public order.

Chief Superintendent Broomhead said that coach parking facilities were now
becoming a problem at Bramall Lane and asked if other members had similar
problems and should we as a Force be asking certain clubs to provide parking
facilities.

A short discussion took place resulting in the Chairman saying that wherever
possible encouragement should be given for clubs to provide appropriate parking
places.

Item discharged.

Football Intelligence

 Superintendent Stuart introduced this item and said that a number of Divisional
‘intelligence Officers and Football liaison Officers were contacting other Forces
 directly. This was outside the system presently being operated and frequently
 created duplicity of inforcation by the force Fc-ctball Intelligence Officer, ?C
 Rosevear.

Chief Superintendent Mole said that he accepted information received, from PC
Rosevear was correct, however, it was not always up to date and his Divisional
Intelligence Officer was in touch with the visiting teams and even the
appropriate sub division up to the kick off and beyond, thus gaining direct and
icsediate information.

Chief Superintendent Mole continued by saying that it was frequently the case
ter nore relevant intelligenc€ tc be gathered within the last few hours to k_ck
orf than any other period.
Chief Superintendent Herold said that PC Rosevear was the Force Football
Intelligence Officer and he should be the person to liaise with other forces
throughout the week to avoid duplicity and after Friday evening for the other
appropriate personnel to continue in respect of fixtures in their divisions.

A short discussion took place resulting in the Chairman saying that it was
equally important for relevant intelligence to be gathered and disseminated up
to and including the football fixture, than days prior to it and a balance
should be struck between those concerned.

Item discharged.

Use of CCTV at Football Stadia - Force Standing Order

Assistant Chief Constable Jackson said that this item had been raised at Chief
Superintendents Conference and certain valid points had been raised which
differed from the draft guidelines issued by the National Working Party.

In particular, viewing of CCTV, the preparation of pocket books by officers
involved in incidents recorded on tape and collusion by those officers when
preparing their pocket books.

It was generally thought that when officers had made an arrest or been involved
in an incident,   they should be allowed to view a     tape recording of that arrest
or incident and   converse prior to preparing their pocket books, these being
contrary to the Guidelines.

A short discussion took place resulting in the Chairman saying that these facts
were to be raised at the National Working party.

He continued by     saying that it had been approved    at Policy Review Committeefor
tape retention     to be 12 months from recording or    corresponding fixture.

Superintendent Stuart said that a number of other forces had also expressed
their concern over the viewing of closed circuit television and the question of
collusion prior t o <the preparation of pocket books.

He continued by referring to problems encountered by police and comments made by
a High Court Judge when they allowed numerous viewings of a video tape to take
place after an incident at Luton Football Ground and did not keep proper
records.

Mr Stuart said that the reasoning behind using closed circuit television is to
establish the truth and create another way of presenting evidence of fact before
a court.

H * continued ky saying that it was thought nationally that collusion between
°. lcers should take place during viewing the tape and advice would be
circulated to all forces in due course froia Kr Ghandi, Deputy Director Public
Prosecutions.
                                      - A




The Chairman said it was essential to keep an accurate record of all viewings,
including place viewed, time, day, date, persons present and other relevant
information coming to light during the viewing, in particular, identification of
persons in the video.

A short discussion took place on this item resulting in the Chairman saying that
we should await the directive from Mr Ghandi and write the recommendations into
a draft order in due course for discussion at Policy Review Committee.

Superintendent Swann asked for advice on the purchasing of tapes and who should
provide the funding for the equipment.

The Chairman said that the purchase should be made centrally and in bulk. Chief
Superintendent Herold agreed to make arrangements for the purchase on behalf
divsions.

Item discharged.

Exclusion Orders

The Chairman introduced this item and asked members if any problems had occurred
with exclusion orders and the system adopted.

Mr Jackson continued by referring to the apparent delay in circulation of
exclusion orders by Magistrates Courts and that ACC Watson was to raise the
issue during his liaison with Magistrates Clerks with a view to speeding up the
process.

Detective Chief Superintendent Addis said that in some instances, exclusion
orders had been received as late as one week after issue, however, the telex was
being received on the day of issue.

Mr Addis said that to date, 13 exclusion orders had been made and details
forwarded to the relevant forces.

Mr Addis continued by saying that only 2 minor problems had occurred, namely
that an exclusion order had been received with a black and white photograph
instead of colour and that on 3 occasions orders had been received without
photographs, however, in general the system was working veil and all members
agreed.

Hr Addis concluded by informing members that in the near future all photography
would be in colour.                                                '■

Item discharged.

Spotters


             ~Tltroc^uced this item and asked mecbers if any problems had occurred
with the use of 'spotters'.
Superintendent Swann said that B Division had 2 full tine spotters who travelled
in uniform to away fixtures.  He continued by saying that the officers provided
a deterrent, as away fans recognised them and knew that the possibility of being
identified existed.  The spotters also provided intelligence for local and home
forces on persons of interest attending away fixtures.

A short discussion took place and all members agreed that the system was working
well. The Chairman concluded by saying that the British Transport Police were
also very helpful by providing travelling spotters and intelligence.

Chief Superintendent Hole made reference to an incident whereby one particular
force refused to provide spotters due to financial constraints and concluded by
saying that if it was to be a national scheme, all forces should participate.

The Chairman said that he would liaise with Hr Phillips on this natter.

Item discharged.

Membership Schemes

The Chairman introduced this item and asked for members views on the present
schemes.

A short discussion took place on Membership Schemes and all meabers (with the
exception of B Division) agreed that they were working.

Superintendent Swann said that Barnsley Football Club had not agreed with the
Football Association on a suitable scheme.

He continued by saying that Barnsley Football Ground had not initially been
designed -with total segregation in mind and a Eembership scheme would at present
create problems in policing fixtures, however, the police and Barnsley Football
Club did agree in principle to some form of scheme being adopted.

The Chairman concluded by saying that the situation should be Eonitored closely
with a view to being in a position to give a police view on the subject.
                                   i
Levels of Policing

The Chairman introduced this item and askec members views on current policing
levels and if the balance vas right.

 Superintendent Stuart made reference to the Dog Section and their attendance at
 football matches. He said that some divisions only wanted the provision of dogs
 in duty time and not overtime or leave, due to financial constraints.

 Mr Stuart continued by saying that it was not always possible to supply dogs in
 duty time and a balance had to be struck.   In future, when dogs were being
 supplied the commander will be given the option of having the full quota of dogs
 offered or only those working in duty time.
The Chairman said that it was important for commanders to identify their needs
according to the fixture, and deploy resources accordingly as members of the dog
section may be required elsewhere.

He continued by saying that the balance of handlers/dogs on overtime or leave
should be spread evenly across the force.

Community Policing at Football Matches

Mr Jackson referred to Community Policing at football matches and said that
Chief Superintendent Mole had introduced a system of using the same officer at
the same point within the ground at each fixture.

Chief Superintendent Mole said that it was similar to community policing in the
fact that the same officers was positioned in the same area of the crowd each
time. This enabled the officer and certain supporters to become known to each
other and become a community type constable.

Mr Mole continued by saying that the system was working well and fewer resources
were now needed on the perimeter. The officers had become known to the rowdy
element and were quick to identify contentious areas. They also provided an
ideal intelligence gathering resource.

Chief Superintendent Mole then referred to resources and parking facilities at
Niagara Sports Ground. He said that a problem had evolved with officers/people
visiting Hillsborough. These people were using the parking facilities at
Niagara and therefore caused congestion resulting in emergency vehicles being
unable to move freely within the complex.

Mr Mole asked members to convey the message to officers with a view to finding
other parking facilities or to be more sensible in their mode of parking.

A short discussion took place resulting in all members agreeing that it was a
problem especially when match days at Hillsborough coincided with other
functions at Niagara.

Item discharged.

There being no further business, the meeting closed at 11.50 am.

ITEM                               DESCRIPTION                                  ACTION TO BB TAKEN
*«>»««*
           rS.W.F.C.   - Building Surveyor's aemortndua of 2.Z,

            The Building Surveyor's representative outlined the
            nemoranduir. and the circumstances which gave rise to itl
            Superintendent Stuart indicated that zhe gangway p roblea
            had been discussed with Sheffield Wednesday who were
            going to take steasures vith their Stewards in ar. atieapt
            to ^resolve it. As far as the turns"ile question, ns
            concerned, a pattern has developed of people arriving
            some i5 ains. before the start of the game hoping to
            gain admission. This trend M y be due to the banning of
            alcohol at sports grounds which coulc lead to pe-o?le
            going elsewhere for refreshment prior to the foctoell
            Batch. As the available turnstiles operated quite
            effectively for the ■ajority of the tine, and that the
            late arrival problem cculd perhaps only be dealt vith by
            education cf spectators.

            c l o s i n g the south terra re (which is in a very pc-or
            c o n d i t i o n ) , but whether or not there should be

                            HELD AT 2.15 PM ON MONDAY 27 JUNE 1988
                              AT POLICE HEADQUARTERS, SHEFFIELD


    PRESENT:

    W W Jackson Esq Assistant Chief Constable (Operations) - Chairman
    Chief Superintendents Addis, Mole, Owen and Thompson
    Superintendents Brookfield, Duckenfield, Mole, Murray, Simpson, Sleath and
    Stuart
    PC Rosevear (Football Liaison Officer)
    PS       (Secretary)

    APOLOGIES FOR ABSENCE

    Apologies for absence were received from Chief Superintendents Herold,
    Broomhead, Nesbit and Wain.

    MINUTES OF THE PREVIOUS MEETING

    The minutes of the meeting held on 12 January 1988 which had been previously
    circulated were accepted as a true and accurate record of that meeting.

    MATTERS ARISING FROM THE MINUTES

    There were no matters arising from the previous minutes of 12 January 1988.

    PARADING FOR DUTY AT FOOTBALL MATCHES

    Mr Jackson introduced this item referring to Standing Order H E and Force
    General Order 54/1982 item 6 relating to travelling time and travelling
    expenses.

    He said representations has been made in January this year concerning non-
    compliance with Item 6 of General Order 54/1982 and as a result he had
    canvassed divisional.commanders asking if there vas a need for re-negotiation cn
    this matter,

    Mr Jackson then promoted a discussion on the views expressed in the replies anc
    the present situation at each division.  On conclusion the mecbers agreed that
    re-negotiation of this aspect was unnecessary at this stage.
                                                                             «

    Item discharged.

    ARRESTS BY MOUNTED OFFICERS

    Mr Jackson said that it had been brought to his attention that on ^ose occasions
    a mounted officer has made an arrest and there has been a tendency to retain the
    officer at the Charge Office to complete process papers, resulting in the loss
    of a horse for some considerable time.

    Following a short discussion Mr Jackson said that custody officers at football
    grounds should be instructed to release mounted officers follcving the initial
    formalities required for evidential purposes, leaving the administrative
    procedures to be completed later.

    Item discharged.
                                            - 2 -




    PLAYER BEHAVIOUR ON THE FIELD OF PLAY

    This item was introduced by Mr Jackson the papers having previously been
    circulated.

    He said that following the well publicised case in Scotland,the aspect of police
    intervention into incidents occurring on the field of play has been subject of
    discussion at National level and the paper shows the recommended guidelines.

    Following a discussion on the content of the paper the Chairaan stressed that
    the guidelines were still awaiting approval and are not for implementation at
    this stage.

    Item discharged.

    CCTV/PHOTOGRAPHY - STRATEGY TO COMBAT HOOLIGANISM


«   Superintendent Stuart introduced this item outlining a proposed strategy to
    combat hooliganism.

    He said the suggested strategy based on the use of closed circuit television
    should comprise of the following

    Intelligence officer
    Designated arrest teams
    Post match analysis
    Follow up enquiry teams

    He said the Divisional Intelligence Officer and Underwater Search Unit Officers
    could act as the evidence gathering teams which has the added advantage of not
    making further demands on divisional personnel. Also the Underwater Search Unit
    are normally committed to football in duty time on match days.

    Concerning the designated arrest team, Mr Stuart suggested that the Crime and
    Vandal Units could fill this role supported by detective officers.
    He said the post match analysis could be achieved by the Divisional Intelligence
    Officers and the Underwater Search Unit viewing the video tapes after the match
    to identify and target offenders.

    Finally the follow up enquiry team where necessary could cc-mprise of the Clime
    and Vandal Unit,' Underwater Search personnel and divisional CID where
    appropriate.

    Mr Stuart informed the meeting that negotiations were still taking place
    regarding additional closed circuit television equipment, also for the
    allocation of a portable video camera.
                                                                  \
    He said the quality of the recordings produced by the portable recorders were
    excellent and in contrast to the static camera inside the grounds its use allows
    greater flexibility when covering sections of the crowd both in and outside the
    ground.
A short video film taken by a portable unit was shown to the members to show its
value when considering the matter of identification/evidence.

After a lengthy discussion on the various aspects of the strategy plan and the
use of a portable video camera, menbers agreed that the use of a video camera
should be implemented.

Superintendent Simpson said that officers were available as part of the usual
match day staff who had attended the Greater Manchester Police course of CCTV
operators when part of their training related to still photography. He
requested a camera for use by those officers therefore negating any further need
for a Scenes of Crime Officer.

Concerning this strategy plan Mr Jackson asked the members to sunit their views
through Superintendent Stuart within 14 days.

LOCKS ON PERIMETER FENCES

Chief Superintendent Mole introduced this item for the information of members
because other clubs were contemplating using the same locks in their perimeter
fencing as those used at Hillsborough.

He said problems have    been experienced with the retaining spring working loose
on the lock, allowing    the spectators access to the field of play.
Superintendent Murray    explained the defect and warned against using this type of
lock until the design    has been modified.

Item discharged.

REPORTS OF 1ST, 2ND, 3RD AND 4TH DIVISION FOOTBALL SEMINARS

Superintendent Stuart introduced this item and summarised the various natters
raised at the mid season conference.

a    Covert Operations
                                                                                  <

     Superintendent Stuart said chat the recent well publicised court cases
     involving this type of policing indicate the problems that can arise vhen
     the officers are not sufficiently trained. As an alternative solution he
     suggested that an officer should be used as a 'passive observer1. He would
     accompany the problem groups, observe and listen to what is being saLd and
     report back, thereafter, having no further involvement.

     Mr Jackson said that community policing on match days should be strongly
     considered whereby a number of officers are allocated the same area of the
     ground on each match day in order to identify the trouble makers. it is
     important that these officers target and establish the identity of any
     hooligan element in their areas. He said so far ve cid r.ot see the need in
     our Force to run a covert operation and if there was a need his authority
     should be sought. Any advice regarding recent operations vould be
     disseminated to Divisional Corranders.
                                      - 4 -




b   Personal Radios

    Mr Stuart said that it has been established that organised groups are using
    the police personal radio as a source of information for their activities
    simply by standing near to an officer and listening. To combat this the
    use of earphones should be encouraged.

c   Cameras

    For the information of the members Mr Stuart informed them that recent
    intelligence shows that some of the organised groups are making use of a
    camera to record their actions at football natches in crder to boast about
    them afterwards to their friends. On one occasion to cate this   type of
    evidence has been found and provided the basis of a successful prosecution.

d   Offensive Weapons

    Mr Stuart informed the meeting that supporters are knovr. to be taping
    Stanley knife blades to their body or concealing then i~ turn ups of
    trousers etc in order to escape detection when searched upon entering the
    grounds.

e   Football Supporters Association

    He said that representations had been made by the associations concerning
    the retention time of away supporters at the end of the game. They accept
    that there is a need for this policy but are showing soce concern for the
    bona fide supporters who travel by private transport and are left in a
    vulnerable position when making their way back to the car, which is often
    parked some distance away. They argue that by the tine they are released
    from the ground, the majority of police resources have already been
    dispersed.

£   Prevention of Alcohol Act

    Mr Stuart informed the meeting that Barnsley had recently submitted papers
    for prosecution concerning the use of a transit van by avay supporters and
    carrying alcohol.

    After representations to CPS and the other associated conferences it has
    been decided that a prosecution vould fail on the grounds chat the vehicle
    is not adapted for the carriage of passengers.

g   Membership Schemes                                          N

    Mr Jackson said that this matter was being exaained at National level and
    research was being carried out and he would report on any developments.

    A general discussion took place on the systems pertaining in our Force and
    it was agreed that we would consider any recocnendations in due course.
h   Exclusion Orders

    Superintendent Stuart informed the meeting that complaints had been
    received concerning the duration of the orders which are generally about
    three months which on occasions has been imposed at the end of the season
    and therefore expired before the start of the new season.

    It was suggested that   12 months should be thestandard period.

    Chief Superintendent Owen said that there hadbeen a recent casewhere CPS
    had failed to proceed with a case because theoffender had already been
    sentenced to 9 months imprisonment relating to a separate incident and
    therefore the opportunity to impose an exclusion on him had been lost.

    Hr Jackson asked that details concerning this matter be passed to Mr Addis
    and they could be raised at the CPS/Police Working Party in the first
    instance and if we felt there was a need to take it further it could be
    discussed at the Magistrates Courts Working Party meeting. He expressed
    that we MUST have factual information that required addressing.

I   Play Offs

    Mr Stuart said that representations had been made to the football league
    concerning the lack of consultation with the police and the requirement of
    policing football matches at very short notice. As yet the Football League
    have not responded.

J   Closed Circuit Television

     Superintendent.Stuart outlined the findings of the survey by Sandridge on
     the equipment already used in the grounds. Mr Jackson expressed the
     importance of informing him of any alterations suggested so that he could
     give the best advice available to support divisional connnar.ders in their
     operational needs.

     Item discharged.

ANY OTHER BUSINESS

Fixtures 1988/89

Following the recent release of the fixtures for the forthcoming season Mr
Jackson asked the members if they presented any problems.         %

Chief Superintendent Mole said the Boxing Day fixture at Hillsfcrough when
Newcastle are the visitors could present a problem therefore, he had asked for a
12 o'clock kick off. This was agreed.
                                         - 6 -



    Mr Jackson requested that members examine the fixtures closely so that any
    alterations of times could be discussed at an early stage with clubs. He
    expressed the importance of feeding intelligence to Force Intelligence Unit and
    measurements against that to determine resources required. It was important for
    us to ensure that we did not over or under police. This could only be achieved
    by gathering all the information and intelligence together so that our
    deployment was as accurate as possible.

    Mr Jackson said the pre-season neeting with the Clubs was scheduled for 20 July
    1988 and any items to be raised should be forwarded to Superintendent Stuart by
    10 July 1988.

    Item discharged.
€
    Evacuation Procedure/Contingency Plans

    Mr Jackson emphasised the need to test our contingency plans and requested that
    Stewards and police officers be briefed concerning them and particularly
    evacuation procedures at each pre-match briefing.

    Item discharged.

    There being no further business the meeting closed at A.30 pm.

The minutes of the meeting held on 24 July 1987, which had been previously
circulated were accepted as a true and accurate record of that meeting.




3     MATTERS ARISING FROM THE MINUTES


3.1   All Ticket Matches

The Chairman promoted a discussion between members concerning the experiences
over the previous season by the Clubs and Police, vhen matches had been
designated "all ticket". During the discussion it was agreed that on such
occasionsfpopevere crowd problems had taken place, however, the Clubs did
stress th^t==Eney haa proven to be financially detrimental to thea because
many casual supporters who had decided to attend on match day were not able
to purchase tickets, therefore reducing the number of persons passing through
the turnstiles. At the conclusion of the discussion it was agreed to
continue with the existing arrangements for the forthcoming season.


3-2   Membership Schemes

Assistant Chief Constable Jackson said the whole aspect of membership schemes
was presently subject of re-examination by the Government and no doubt we
would be made aware of proposals in the ne3 .1* future«

A long discussion then took place concerning the individual schemes presently
in operation in this area. It was 'the opinion- of the Clubs representatives
that they had done little to assist in reducing the problem with the
hooligan element attending matches.

A discussion then took place regarding the well publicised trouble
caused by English supporters at the recent European Championships in Germany,
and it was agreed that the popular press exacerbate the situation *by
’hyping up* the situation at every given opportunity.

MATTERS ARISING FROM THE MINUTES

There were no matters arising from the previous minutes on 27 J<une 19$



CLOSED CIRCUIT TELEVISION -
Visits to Stadium by Football Trust Technical Committee      x

Superintendent Stuart introduced this item stating the ACPO Working

Party on the use of closed circuit television at football grounds has

cc~pleted its final report and will be published in the near future.
He said that a final draft Standing Order has been completed on the use

of closed circuit TV but because it makes reference to the Working Party

Report it will not be introduced until the report has been published.



He then referred to the survey of the existing closed circuit television

equipment in the South Yorkshire Football League grounds which was

carried out in November last year, by Mr Ford of the Police Research

Scientific and Development Branch at Sandridge, a member of the

Technical Committee assisting the Football Trust regarding the survey

and installation of closed circuit television equipment at Football

Stadia.



Mr Stuart said that the systems were examined in detail by Mr Fora end

faults were identified on all of them particularly the Sheffield Clubs

and Rotherham, Barnsley in the main was quite good.   He added that

Divisional representatives were present during the individual surveys

who notified the Clubs of the faults requesting that they in turn notify

the installer with instructions to remedy them.   Also as a point cf

interest it was established on the visit to the Barnsley ground that

they did not have a 'maintenance contract* and as they are required to

meet uainter.ance costs the division has adopted a policy whereby the

Club is notified of any faults and the Club are responsible for calling

out the engineers and paying the account.   If the Club fails td ciaintair.

a satisfactory closed circuit television system they do not fulfil their

ob.igation in accordance with Football League instructions and

objections could be made against matches taking place.
Me   concluded by saying that generally the systems are no better or worse

than most other grounds in the country.


Mr Stuart informed the meeting that the Football Trust has now

undertaken to purchase two full sets of tripod mounted/portable video

equipment at a cost of £3 0 ,0 0 0 . 0 0 and this will be operated by the

underwater search unit as previously arranged.       He said the equipment

will be delivered in the very near future.



Mr Stuart then referred to the use of closed circuit TV night starches.

He said that he had recently visited Ibrox, Scotland, where the whole

of the stadium, including stands etc. was fully lit before, during and

after the match and therefore the equipment could operate at its

maximum efficiency.    He said that he had asked the Club Secretaries to

raise this matter with their respective Boards.


Item Discharged



END OF SEASON PLAY-OFFS

The Chairman introduced this item staling that because of the problems
                                               i
encountered with the end of season play offs in previous years the

Secretary of the ACPO General Purposes Sub-Committee on Hooligar.ism at

Sporting Events has again written to the Football League regarding the

scheduling of matches at very short notice, which in turn causes

problems in raising the necessary Police resources.
He said that the Football Joint Management Committee had not given

a full undertaking to consult with the respective Police Forces before

finalising arrangements for matches.    However, they have been advised

that if matches are arranged without sufficient notice and with little

regard for Police resources it is open for Chief Constables to consider

whether the requirements of the Safety at Sports Grounds Act have been

satisfied.   If the provision of the required police resources cannot be

attained then the League would have to make alternative arrangements.



Item Discharged



USE OF CLOSED CIRCUIT T.V

Superintendent Stuart introduced this item and referred to the paper

previously circulated relating to the arrests following the

Barnsley v Bolton Wanderers match held on the 9 January 1988, which

highlights the benefits gained from the use of video equipment.


He said that during the game eleven Bolton supporters were arrested and

after viewing the video tape additional evidence was gathered against

them, also, as a result of viewing the tape a further six were arrested

in Bolton.   Of those seventeen only one individual pleaded ’not guilty1

but the case was subsequently proved.    At the conclusion of the cases

advice was sought from the CrowTi Prosecution Service about the system

adopted for presenting the video evidence and an assurance was given

that none of the evidence presented was challenged by any of the

cefence solicitors.
Mr Stuart said that one area of concern was the length of time that it

took for all the defendants to be dealt with, because the last case was

not dealt with until the 22 December 1988, nearly 12 months after the

incident.   He said that it had been suggested by the officer in charge

of the case that a joint charge of affray could have possibly ensured a

speedier conclusion to the case.



After discussion it was agreed that a joint charge of affray would often

prove to be a retrograde step when aiming for a faster conclusion to

cases, although each case must always be judged on its own merits and

the evidence available and the individuals charged accordingly.



Mr Stuart continued by saying that the lessons learnt as a res-alt of the

Barnsley incident were

1.          The use of the camera and recording facilities at the

             ground must be to the highest calibre possible in order

             that the evidence produced to the Court is of the best

             quality possible.

2.          Equipment of the highest quality must be available to
                                                  <

             view the tapes if it is to be considered as useful in

             evidence.

3.          The reviewing and use of the video tape (or its working

             copy) to provide sufficient evidence against those already

             arrested and those to be retospectively arrested is both

             time consuming and difficult.
            Officers must be deployed solely to this duty in the

            initial stages if it’s thought that the video tape will be

            produced later in evidence.



With regard to the third point it is intended that the Underwater Search

Unit have been suitably trained and will be responsible for reviewing

tapes.



Superintendent Simpson said that it was worthy of note that after the

game people had criticized the police action, but when the video was

viewed it showed that they had acted in a very professional nanner.

With regards to the video tape he said that if sound was included it

would greatly enhance its evidential value.   Mr Stuart inforced the

meeting that the new portable equipment also records sound.



Chief Superintendent Owen stated that the portable equipment had

already proved that it is a good deterent as on the occasion of the

Chelsea match when there was a great deal of jostling and pushing in

the crowd but when the equipment was brought into place all "he

disorderliness ceased.

RAISING OF MANPOWER AT FOOTBALL MATCHES

Chief Superintendent Nesbit stated that he had received criticism from

a Sergeant who regularly works ’football duty' regarding the

inconsistency of men on normal duty tiEe and those on overtime.     He

said that a match at Barnsley had been cited when officers had attended

from E Division in duty time to find many Barnsley officers on overtime

and when he has attended Sheffield matches again Barnsley officers were

on overtime.    Mr Nesbit said that he raised this as a point for

discussion.

The Chairman said that this issue has already been raised by the

Federation and as a result a Working Party has been formed to examine

the whole issue of raising manpower at football matches and invited

Superintendent Simpson, as a member of the Working Party to update

members.

Superintendent Simpson said the probles has arose purely because' soi&e

officers feel that when compared to others working a football duty they

are losing out in monetory terns.      Ke said general order 22/1957 sets

out clearly the method of raising manpower, after assessing the number

of officers required, the Divisional Coamander will calculate the nunbe

of officers which can be raised within his division, having 'regard to

inininum manning levels and the criteria is laid down in tr.s following

order;

               1.   Assess the number of officers to be paid for

                    by the Club on overtime.

               2.   From duty personnel

  Mr Simpson said that | | | % D i v i s i o n follow this criteri a and then the

  balance of manpower
                                             is requested from other Divisions.        He said

  that compared to      lasiTyear             they had been successful in raising more

 and some in ove r ti»e 7 but i- practice all are attending in overtime and

 that is when inconsistencies in the system occur.

The Chairman asked the views of Divisional Commanders on the use of

Community Constables for football duty and it was agreed that they are

convenient pool of manpower aailable on a regular basis.    However,

Mr Mole added that Community Constables do have many commitments in

their respective areas and these should always be considered prior to

deputing that officer to ’football duty'.



The Chairman thanked members for their comments and said the important

point that has arisen as a result of the discussion is that Divisional

Commanders should examine closely the status of the manpower they

supply to other Divisions for football aatches, in accordance with the

Standing Order and hopefully this will create some consistency

throughout the force.



The aspect of charges to the football clubs for the manpower used was

discussed and it was felt that clubs were not being charged sufficient

for the amount of resources they incur.     The Chairman stated that he

would pass on their views to Assistant Chief Constable Management

Services, Mr Watson, for his attention.

AMY   OTHER BUSINESS

Football Watch


The Chairman informed      members that details concerning ’Football Watch*

had been recently      received from the West Midlands Police and invited

Chief Inspector    Price to outline the detils of the Scheme to the
m eeting.




Chief Inspector Price      stated that early in December the details of

Football Watch    were circulated to all Divisional Commanders.                He said

the scheme is a    pro-active relatively low cost initiative to reduce

public disorder,    to set positive and consistent standards of policing

and positive and    consistent standards of crowd behaviour.                He said that

the West Midlands      Police have told all their fans through leaflets,
posters, tannoy messages and through the programmes which they buy at

the ground, what will not and what will be acccepted.



They are told that obscene chanting, obscene gestures, racist remarks,

racist chants, missile throwing, threatening behaviour and criminal

activity will not be allowed.


It is a combination of persuasion, education and control and through the

persuasion education to get information from genuine supporters, from

the Supporters Club as to who are involved in the gangs, as to who are

involved in organising racist chanting etc.



Mr Price said that at Bramall Lane just before Christmas, a tannoy

message was put out at half time, stating that they would not accept

this kind of behaviour and it was warmly applauded by the great majority

in the ground.   This then raised interest from Radio Hallam, Radio

Sheffield and the local press.   He said that concern had been shown

about racist chanting and requests had been made to the Chief Constable

to do something about it.   This may be one initiative to try and satisfy

-hem. From a Community Liaison point of %'iew they would be very      *

^.nteres^ed in line with a new policy of cffering whatever support    they

can give to the here and now problems of the community policing.

Community Constables can go into schools ana youth clubs with players

and put the message across, what will anc what will not be accepted.

■~e said it would obviously lead to more arrests and ejections , at leasi

-n the short term, out perhaps this is necessary as part of the overall

re-education and control to shew them that they cannot ger   away   with i" .
Secretaries   in South Yorkshire to put appeals in the programmes so that

when they go to Walsall, West Brora, Wolverhampton, Birmingham, Aston

Villa or Coventry, our supporters know they will be arrested if they

carry out any of this action.


After discussion the Chairman said that it is a new initiative which

should be developed by each of the Commanders with football grounds

within their Divisions and in order to ensure some uniformity and

consistency with the schemes operated, Headquarters Community Liaison

should provide administrative support, including posters etc. subject to

finance availability.


Superintendent Stuart suggested that the publicity to launch Football

Watch could be linked to the introduction of the tripod video equipment.

              For the attention of Superintendent Stuart
              Headquarters Operations

              Dear    Sir,


              Safety of Sports Grounds - Draft Revised Safety Certificate Conditions

              1 refer to your letter of 4th August 1987 In connection with draft Safety
              Certificate Conditions. I now enclose for your attention a copy of the final
f             draft of the new Certificate Conditions which take into account the observations
              •ade in your letter.

              Tou will however notice that there are no references as such to the Police
              within the Certificate. I have carefully considered this *atter and have c o m e
              to the conclusion that Conditions which purport to delegate the Council's
              functions to outside bodies are unenforceable as they are beyond the powers of
              the Council.        Therefore several Conditions which were Included In the first
                    ( e l a t i n g to for exaaple discussions between Certificate holders and the
#             Pplice) have bees deleted or aodlf led.

              1 am, of course, conscious of the very important Police role in
              connection with the safety of spectators at sports grounds and I have therefore
              taken two steps to ensure that this role is properly recognised in the
              certification system. Firstly the definition of "authorised officers” la the
              Conditions Includes Police Officers. Secondly there is also a n e w Condition
              th     relat£S t0 S u l d a n c e given by the Council on safety matters. A draft of
                 e proposed guidance is enclosed with the new Conditions and you sill see that
                  refers largely to Police/Certificate bolder relations.
                                                                                               N.



              Would you please let ae have your cossents on the draft Conditions in due

Dear Sirs
SAFETY OF SPORTS GROUNDS - CERTIFICATE CONDITIONS
Thank you lor your letter dated 30 March 1989 and enclosures detailing your
proposed revision of Safety Certificate Condons. I wili consider the proposals and
reply in more detail in due course.
Meanwhile. 1 am concerned to note that the conditions do not appear to require the
attendance of police officers at football matches, as provided by Section 2 of the
Safety of Sports Grounds Act 1975 {as amended by Section 21 of the Fire Safety and
Safety of Places of Sport Act 1987). I am forwarding a copy of your correspondence
to the Police Authority Legal Department for advice on the matter and wili contact you
when that advice is available.
 Yours faithfulty




 Chief Constable

Dear S ir,

Safety of Sports Grounds ~ C e rtific a te Conditions

Thank you fo r your le tte r of 5th A p ril, in reply to aine of 30th March; I also
re fe r to Chief Superintendant Dentons* subsequent telephone conversation w itli ay
Chief Licensing O fficer, Mr. Bownes.

I gather that you would find i t helpful fo r a condition to be included in the
C e rtific a te which provided fo r the attendance of police officers at foo tb all
Batches. I have no objection to such a condition being inserted and I would
lik e to subait the following draft for your consideration:-

       "Before the stadiua is used on any occasion for a specified a c tiv ity , the
       Holder shall aake arrangements with tbe Chief Constable of the South
       Yorkshire Police for the attendance of a su fficien t number of police officers
       fo r the purpose of aaintaining lawful and orderly behaviour aaongst
       spectators. The extent of the provision of police services is reserved for

        To:                                                     Date:
                  A/Assistant Chief Constable (Operations)                      22 November 1989
                  Mr. Broomhead

                SUBJECT:
                               NORTH WEST TERRACING - HILLSBOROUGH FOOTBALL GROUND
                               SWFC v SHEFFIELD UNITED - 21 NOVEMBER 1989


                  Approximately five minutes before the kick off at 8 pm I went to the rear
                  of the North West Terracing where I saw 200/300 people standing in the
                  gangways and at the bottom of the stairwells being unable to gain access
                  into the terraced area. Having examined the situation I realised that
                  there was no way this manber could safely be acccmnodated within that
                  terraced area and I made immediate plans to. have them transferred to
                  available seating within the North Stand.      Whilst carrying out this
                  exercise I was informed by Chief Inspector Beal that a further 100/150
                  spectators were still outside in Leppings Lane waiting to be adnitted.

                  On my instructions the turnstiles were closed and were not re-opened
                  until the people who had been unable to gain access to the North West
                  Terracing had been placed in the North Stand.         Having successfully
                  achieved this I then arranged for the spectators who had been waiting
                  outside to be also accommodated within the North Stand.

                  I am concerned that the present Safety Certificate allows 2300 people to
                  be accomnodated within the North West Terraces as a contingency, and
                  having discussed the matter w ith Superintendent Sleath and Mr. Mackrell,
                  Secretary of the Sheffield Wednesday Football Club, we are all agreed
                  that this figure should now be revised to 1500 maximum.

                  capacity of Opper Sorth West Terrace

                  Subsequent to a meeting at Hanraerton Road Police Station on 22nd November
                  to discuss various matters arising from the match between Sheffield
                  Wednesday and Sheffield United on 21st November, I have had cause to
                  revise the recccraended holding capacity for this area of the ground.
                                                                    «   ;■   ••

                  You will recall that the present capacity figures were produced within
                  hours, cn list August, 1989, ana therefore only a paper exercise was
                  carried out in that restrictive time.                -;
■f                                                                                :■: - ■
x                 A site visit earlier today revealed the extent of tte area of terrace
                  partially blinded by the screen between the North West Terrace and the
                  North Stand.

                  Accordingly that area has been emitted from the gross available area of
                  terrace.

                  The holding capacity of the regnalning areas has been re-calculated and
                  modified in accordance with the Taylor recomtendations,- giving a resultant
                  figure of 1,700.

                  Eastwood and Partners drawing mraber 1610/64E has been used for the layout
                  of this area. In a telephone conversation between Mr Strange of Eastwood
                  and 'Partners and my Principal Structural Engineer, late this afternoon, it
                  was intisated that this drawing xray not be accurate, and that the gross
                  available space nay be slightly smaller than is shewn on the drawing.

 ,                Until tbe area has been resurveyed and revised drawings received, I would
, ^               recontrend that the holding capacity for the Upper North West Terrace be a
                  naximxa of 1,500.

     before the evening of i:. i.overioer iVo? only a few nuudreo spectators had
     been accQrirtOuateC ir. the area referred to but or the evening nentioned ie:
<*   21 November iS<rj Sheffield Wednesday played Sheffield United at the H i l l s b o r o u g h
     btadiur .1 in the Zenitn Data Systems Cup. As w i l l oe appreciated, there was
     nuch local in te re st in tnis rcatch and witn the consent of the Local Authority
     Advisory Group, tne Upper North West Terrace was usee ic acconrwcate Sheffield
     Uni tea fans. I repeat that at th is tin e the autr.orisec capacity r.ac treen
     assessec as 2,3uu a no tuct anount of tic k e ts , or tnereacous, wer-j solo for
      .a is erea.
                :S yefore Ki ck off the area was fu ll and no Rore spectators coulo
     be safely acconraodatec. I t was seen that there was between 2uo anc iuo people
     standing in the gangways to the terrace and a t the bottom of the stairw ells
     waiting to gain access, but due to the density of the crowd they were unable
     to do so. The Chief Superintendent in charge, Hr Nes&it, concluded that
     no more spectators coulo be safely accocjwdatec *itnin tnis terrace area
     and those who were waiting to gain access were t;!<en to another part of the
     ground. Whilst this exercise was being carried out 1t was seen that a further
     100/150 spectators were s t i l l outside the turnstfles in Lepplncs Lane, waiting
     to be admitted.
During the game i t was n e c e s s a r y f o r s p e c t a t o r s comfort to remove a fu rth er
350 from t h i s t e r r a c e . Estim atio n s are t n a t once s p e c t a t o r s had been removed
about 1 , 7 0 0 p eop le remained but t h e y were s t i l l c l o s e l y packed.

As stated previously this was the f i r s t time since the Semi Final on 15 April
1939 when the area had been a t capacity, and i t was abundantly clear that
the number of spectators shown on the c e r t i f i c a t e , ie: 2,300 could not be
accommodated, but at the time of the Serai Final the fixed capacity for this
area was 2,800. Immediate discussions took place between Chief Superintendent
Nesbit and the Sheffield Wednesday Football Club Secretary, Hr Graham Mackrell,
and they agreed an emergency figure of 1,500 maximum. On 23 November 1989
I wrote to Mr H M Webster - copy l e t t e r enclosed - the Head of Sheffield
Administration and Legal Department advising him of our concern and a special
meeting of the General Purposes Panel was called for 2.00 pm on Monday 27
November 1989.
Between times, i t was discovered from an o f f ic e r of the Council, Nr John
D erricott, the Safety in Sports Ground O fficer, that the plans which the
Local Authority used to determine the capacity for the North West Upper Terrace
had been drawn to a scale which showed the terrace to be larger than i t actually
was.
At the meeting on 27 November 1989 an emergency iteni was introduced which
encapsulated the information contained in th is l e t t e r to this point. A copy
of the notes for th is meeting are included.
There was prolonged discussion a s ,to the revised capacity for th is area of
the ground and Mr John Strange, who was representing Eastwood and Partners
a t the meeting, suggested th at the capacity to be fixed a t 1,400 will allow
time fo r exact calculations to be made, but he was sure that the figure of
1,400, w hilst erring on the side of sa fe ty , would not be too fa r from the
exact fig u re. So, on 15 April 1989 we had a capacity of 2,600 which has
now been reduced to 1,400, a reduction of 100S!
At the meeting, the question was never asked, or indeed, considered relative
to the accuracy of the plans fo r the Leppings Lane Terrace on which the capacity
nad been calculated, a question which I have now addressee to the Local Authority
in my l e t t e r , a copy of which is attached.
I need not spell out the implications which surround the facts now brought
to lig h t, but i f I can be of further help to you in this matter, I would
be pleased i f you could contact me.

                Stadium.

                     I understand the words "scientific calculation'1 v<ere

                denlt with this natter by empirical jseans.
                     Ve assembled a small crowd of people In our drawing
                office to represent a sr.aple of a crowd stc-nding reasonably
                close to :et*ier. l-e then established a coefficient of 1.34*
                lineal feet per person on each step of terrace, each person
                beln^ allocated the full deptn of the terrace whatever its
                dimension.

                     We then referred to cur detniled surveys of the terrace
                tnd we also censured on site the known usable len^tn of the
                terrace steps, r^klrv; due allowance for s-urrways, "passageways,
                stairways, ecc. and tr.e length of eacn section was civided
                by the coefi'icieat to est?.'clish the capacity.
                     Ke re~ard the fore^.ir.^ r.s an interim approach to the
                problem, until such tine ao the coefficient could be checked
                by the use cf erod’d ccuntlrj; devices.

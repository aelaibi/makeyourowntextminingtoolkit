At 1.15pm I was           instructed b y PS 454 C h a p m a n to a t t e n d at the

location.         I saw a crowd I w o u l d e s t imate a p p r o x i m a t e l y 200 to 300

strong     in the y a r d and f o o t p a t h near to the "White H o r s e ” p ublic

seen to c limb f r o m the terracing                    into the L e p pings Lane s t a n d .                    I was

unable      to contact Ground Control                   by radio         to inform them of this

fact,     h o w e v e r , a short time          later this y o u t h wa s seen to jump dow n

At a p p r o x i m a t e l y 2 . 4 0pm I was        joined      in that       location by PC 2348

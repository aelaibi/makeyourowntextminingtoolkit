              N o r t h e r n General        Hospital.          I am trai n e d            in Major      D i s aster        Proc e d u r e s

              On S a t u r d a y    15th April        1969      {15.4.89)          (150489)         I was w o r k i n g        in

              a dmissio ns.          Sometime       in the afternoon,                  I c a n ’t recall          the time,           I

              became a ware          that    there was an          incident            o c c uring at        the H i l l s b o r o u g h

              Fo o tball       G r o u nd.    I was      not    informed      t ivyt it was a major                  disasters,           but

              to g e t h e r with                                              / my        supe rvisor,         we de c i ded to

              them to      come      to the     hospital.

              It soon      became a p p a r e n t        that a major         disaster             had o c c u r r e d and the

              Major    Di sas t e r P l a n was          implemented.          Some             patients     had a r r i v e d at the

              hospital         prior     to the    plan being           i m p l e m e n t e d and they had been

              r e g i s t e r e d on the     normal      A c c i d e n t and E m e r g e n c y        (A + E)       register.

           were      given      the job of          r e c ording and          documenting           p a t i e n t s as

These    details,          inc l u d i n g    the majax        number,        were    pas s e d to me an d           I

transferred          them onto         the Major C a s t a s t o p h e         (Disaster)       Reg i s t e r .          I

continually updated                the       register as f u r t h e r         information           became

available.

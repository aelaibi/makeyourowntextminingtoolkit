MR WRIGHT
LEAD DEPARTMENT FOR ACCIDENTS IN SPORTS GROUNDS
1.   I saw Brigadier Budd from the Cabinet Office last Wednesday
to discuss lead department responsibility for accidents in sports
grounds following the transfer of responsibility to this
Department for sports ground safety policy.
2.    We agreed that, notwithstanding this transfer, it continued
to make sense for the Home Office (or appropriate territorial
department) to be the lead department since action following any
accident would rest with the emergency services which remain
under the control of the Home Office. This Department would
however be kept closely involved. Brigadier Budd will be
proposing the continuation of these arrangements with the Home
Office. Given our obvious interest he will arrange that I should
receive any relevant papers coming from the Civil Contingencies
Unit.

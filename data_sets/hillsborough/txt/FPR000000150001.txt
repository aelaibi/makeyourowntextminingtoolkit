              NEUROLOGICAL DAMAGE DUE TO ACUTE CRUSH INJURY
                        THE HILLSBOROUGH DISASTER

                     The Staff of the Sheffield Hospitals

Summary

         On Saturday          15th April       1989     95 persons       were    killed at

the Hillsborough Football                    Ground     in Sheffield.          Twenty   seven

persons were           admitted         to     the      Sheffield       Hospitals        with

neurological         injuries.        Twenty two had signs suggesting acute

cerebral anoxia           and    six    had    peripheral        nerve     injuries;      one

person had both.               Two patients died shortly after admission,

two remain       in the persistant vegitative                     state and       four have

residual neurological              handicap.         Of particular interest are a

group of        seven         patients       who      were     recovering         and    then

deteriorated.          Six     became    unresponsive           and    developed       status

epilepticus. One developed delayed cortical                             blindness.      Other

than in        one      patient,        secondary           deterioration         was     not

associated with           a    poor     outcome.        The    management        of   these

patients presented immediate and unexpected difficulties.

Introduction

        Cerebral anoxia          occurring         on   a     large    scale    is    a rare

event,    but one which would challenges the resources                                of most

hospitals.      The Hillsborough disaster                     occurred on a Saturday

afternoon when,          fortunately,          the three        Intensive Care Units

in the city were             largely empty of patients making available

up to    28    beds.     Sufficient          nursing,       paramedical        and medical

staff were alerted by media reports of the disaster to permit

the allocation of at least one anaesthetist and trained nurse

to each       injured    patient        as    they    arrived     in    casualty.       Soft
tissue and      other        injuries        were          minimal.       These     and     the

logistic and       other      details       of       the    disaster       are    reported

elsewhere(l ).      Abnormalities of cardiac function have already

been repor t e d ( 2 ) .     This     report           details       the     neurological

injuries;     in particular we wish to draw attention to a group

of patients,        each         relatively           young      who,       having        made

significant recovery,              then deteriorated.

Patients

        Twenty seven        patients       with       neurological          injuries      were

admitted to       hospital.          Six    patients           had    peripheral          nerve

injuries and twenty two had central                         nervous     system injuries,

one patient      had       both.    Of     the       initial     twenty      two    anoxic

patients,     eighteen were intubated and artificially ventilated

in the    Accident      and      Emergency           department      or    the    recieving

ward.     The first patient was admitted at 1530 hours,                              by 1630

hours ten patients had been admitted followed by a later wave

of eleven more patients.

Neurological deaths

        One patient        was   declared        dead       shortly     after      admission

and another was declared brain stem dead after 48 hours.

Early recovery

        Six ventilated           patients            (including           four     who     had

secondary deterioration)              made       a    significant         recovery within

24 hours,     and were        extubated without               further complications.

Four patients required ventilation for up to 72 hours because

of persisting extensor posturing when sedation was withdrawn.

The remaining six patients required ventilation for up to 14

days.     Each had a severe neurological deficit at one month.
Two of these patients remain in the vegitative state one year

after the    injury,      the remaining four have major neurological

and cognitive       handicaps          including           one    who        is     cortically

blind.

Non Ventilated patients

        Two patients      recovered          consciousness             in    the    accident

room,    one without complication,                 the other developed a severe

pathological anxiety               state.          Two     patients          had        cortical

blindness,    one       was    known         to      be     blind           on     regaining

consciousness,      the       other     (see        below)        developed             cortical

blindness six hours after recovery.

Peripheral nerve injuries

        Peripheral nerve injuries in six patients included three

with brachial       plexus      injuries           and    one    each       with        sciatic

nerve,    lateral    cutaneous          nerve        of     the        thigh,       posterior

interosseous nerve and femoral nerve injuries. All have shown

significant improvement               suggesting           crushing              rather     than

permanent axonal         damage.      This     includes          the    brachial          plexus

injury in     the    patient          with     both        peripheral             and     central

nervous system injury.

Seizures

        Seizures occured         in     16     patients,           mostly          these     were

multiple tonic       clonic      seizures          associated           with      myoclonus.

Four patients were known to have had seizures before reaching

hospital,    12   had     seizures      in     the       accident        room      and     five

continued to        have        seizures            despite            large        doses         of

conventional anti         epileptic      drugs.            No    patient          who    made     a

complete physical          recovery          has     had     any        further          seizures
Patients with secondary deterioration

      Seven patients         showed           secondary          deterioration.            Five

patients within      two     hours       of    making       a    complete       or almost

complete recovery          suddenly           started       to        scream,     developed

myoclonus and a deteriorating level of consciousness and went

into status epilepticus.            One deteriorated after 48 hours and

one developed        cortical            blindness              seven         hours        after

recovering.     Short accounts of each patient who                             showed early

delayed deterioration are set out below.



Male 42. Known to be anoxic                 on the pitch. He was admitted at

17.00 hours     agitated          and       responding           to     pain.         He    was

improving,    but    after    45    minutes           his   conscious         level     again

deteriorated and       he    developed          status      epilepticus.              He    was

treated with        heminevrin          and      ventilated             for     until       the

following day. There were no later neurological                               complications

though he was noted to have                   small    pneumothorax.            No clinical

neurological deficit              on          review        after         six         months.



Female 26.    Admitted unconscious at 16.00 hours.                              By 1730 she

was irritable and       improving,            but then developed generalised

seizures with myoclonus.                She was treated with heminevrin and

was ventilated until the following day.                          During this time she

was noted to have a number of episodes during which her eyes

deviated upwards.           Apart       from being          slightly      disorientated

for three days there were no further seizures or neurological

complications after being extubated.                        Declined formal             follow

up,   but    reported        to        be       in      good          physical         health.
Male 21.     Admitted        unconscious            and     noted        to     have        marked
spasticity. By 18.00 hours he had improved and was alert. He

suddenly became restless and irritable.                            His conscious                level

rapidly deteriorated,             and    he   was     observed       to       have extensor

spasms and     a     generalised          seizure.          He     was        treated           withe

heminevrin and sodium valproate.Cranial CT was normal. He was

ventilated overnight.              The    following          day    he was          alert,       but

remained confused           for     three          days.     There        were        no        focal

neurological       signs.     When       seen        six     months           later        he     had

experienced minor       behavioural             problems,          but    there       were        no

neurological       sequelae.



Male 17 Admitted at          16.18       hours unconscious,               not localising

pain. He   rapidly      improved          and      was     admitted       to     the       ward.

Without warning at about                17.00 hours he became agitated and

disorientated and had a generalised                        seizure.       Cranial          CT was

normal. He    was    treated       with       benzodiazepines             and       ventilated

The following day he was found to be alert and was responding

normally. When        reviewed          after        eight       months         he     reported

difficulty concentrating.                Formal          psychological              examination

(Mr GA Baker)       showed that the patient was performing within

the mentally       impaired       range       on    four    out     of    five       sub test

scores suggesting       organic          impairment with respect to memory

functioning.



Male 20.   Admitted         intubated         at    15.47     hours.           He    regained

consciousness and       was       extubated         by     16.25    hours.           At     17.30
hours he     became        obtunded           and       had      several        generalised

seizures. He       was    given    benzodiazepines               and     was    reintubated

and ventilated until            the    following day.             During this time he

had further seizures.           Following extubation the next day there

were no     further        seizures       or        neurological              complications.

Psychological' assessment               (Mr     A       Moss)     after        eight     months

showed no evidence of any acquired organic impairment.



Male 16. Had previous history of asthma.                              He was unconscious

on admission       but    was     flexing          to   pain.     He     had     his    first

generalised seizures            1 hour        later,      and     was    then ventilated

and was     treated       with        thiopentone,            sodium          valproate     and

phenytoin.     His seizures continued for 24 hours,                              but he then

improved steadily.           By day 17 April              he had normal brain stem

reflexes,    was    self ventilating and able to                        obeyed commands.

The same day his          conscious       level         again deteriorated without

warningand he        had     more        generalised              seizures.        He      was

ventilated for seven days,               by which time he had normal brain

stem and    menace       responses.           By    day    25    he     was    walking    and

feeding with help and could saying a few inappropriate words.

There were no primitive reflexes.                        He remained spastic in his

limbs. When reviewed after eight months he was                                 speaking but

remained spastic,         there was       considerable             cognitive handicap.



Male 23     years.       Admitted       16.40           drowsy     but        responding        to

questions appropriately.               Amnestic           for     events.          At     22.30

complained of            diminshed        vision.               Was       confused         and

confabulating.       Normal       ocular       apparatus          and    anterior visual
pathway. Perception of            light    only.    No pursuit       eye movement.

By 17 April    could      detect     hand      movements.     Full    recovery          by
10th day.    He     subsequently          required        inpatient        care       under

section II     of     the     Mental           Health      Act.     Psychological

assessment after          eight       months         showed         severe        memory

dysfunction with specific damage to the right temporal                               lobe.

Six patients deteriorated with seizures and one with cortical

blindness.    One     patient         remains            profoundly           physically

handicapped and        two    have         significant        neuropsychological

deficits.

Discussion

     The syndromes         caused by acute cerebral               anoxia have been

discussed in      detail     by    Plum     and    Posner    (3).    Most       of    the

patients admitted          following           varying     periods       of     cerebral

anoxia followed       a   typical     recovery          period    with     40%       being

sigificantly physically disabled after six months.                             Two early

deaths are    included since they reached hospital                       and added to

the management burden of the episode. Of special                         interest are

the group of patients who,                having survived the acute                  event,

and having        shown     signs     of        significant       recovery,           then

deteriorated between 1 and 72 hours after the anoxic event.

All but one of these appeared to make an uneventful recovery

but each     caught    the   medical        team    off     guard    and      required

immediate intervention.             Detailed       neuropsychological             studies

in three patients have shown two of them to have significant

cognitive deficits          despite       an    apparent     full    recovery.          We

presume that this         is another response of the young brain to

prolonged hypoxia.            There        were     no     complicating           factors
causing cerebral         anoxia,    and      no   pathological           material      was

available. The       syndrome      did    not     resemble       the     early delayed

post anoxic    encephalopathy            described        by     Plum,    Posner       and

Hain(4). We    would      recommend       that     if    such    a disaster should

recur patients should be watched closely for this syndrome.

      Acute cerebral        anoxia       on this        scale    presents       enormous

management problems         for    the    receiving        hospital.       A    detailed

report of     the    management        policy      and     other       injuries       will

appear else where(l). The initial                 impression was that a large

number of     head       injured       patients         were     arriving        was     not

correct;    though by then         a     surgical       major    disaster       plan had

been implemented.         Sheffield had no provision                    for calling in

medical teams       in    its    major    accident        plan    and    this    has now

been revised.       Fortunately        the    consultant         physician       on    call

that day and sufficient anaesthetists and anaesthetic trained

nursing and paramedical            staff were           alerted through          national

and local      radio       and     television,            to     assist        with     the

unconscious and fitting patients.                       Neurologists are not part

of a major accident plan,                though may have useful                advice to

give about      the      management        of     acute        cerebral        anoxia    and

 seizures in this setting.

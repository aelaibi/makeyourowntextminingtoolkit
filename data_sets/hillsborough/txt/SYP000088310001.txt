               On Sa tu rd ay      15th April       1989     (130489),              I was at home and as a                      result

               of the     televi son      I be came aware              that there was                something          happe nin g fit

               Hospital      to see      if 1 was       required.               I spoke with the telephone

               receptio nis t and as a result                  of what            she said          I decided          to go to the

               hos pita i »

               I a r ri ve d at the hospital             at a p p r o x i m a t e l y 3 .33            pm and went         to

               casualty       I ap pr o a c h e d a ma tr on whse               name        I don't        know and she di re cte d

               me to the orthape dia c             plaster       room wh ich was                   being        used as a tempo rar y

               mortuary.

               As     I entered the        room    I saw a number                 of       bodies     lying on trollys
                                                                                                             PAGE         2

tables and some were                   even on the -floor I c a n ’t be              precise about            how

many    bodies were             there.        There were       no other     persons      present,

I came out of the                room and a p p r o a c h e d a police         o f f i c e r , I think he was

the    police        liaison officer.                I introduced myself and then a sked                      him    if

there was anyone who                   could assist me to document                 the bodies and

strip them.             I. am    not a ut ho r i s e d    to carry out this           procedure without

t h e p re s e n ee o f a p o 1 i c e o f f i ce r .

Six    police        officers were            given the job of ass i s t i n g me.               One       of the

police      officers a young              female was         placed on the door to stop

una uth o r i s e d en try.

T o g ether with         the     police       off/cers we started to doc urne n t a n d s t r i p

each body.            A female o f e r               made a record of the            personal      property

and a full          de s c r i p t i o n of each body          including a p p r o ximate         age,       height

and disting u i s h i n g mark.                The    personal      p r o p e r ty was kept with the

patients and            put     into a brown envelope and mar k e d with the major

d i s aster       plan n u rnb e r .

Once    the       system was        running      e f f e c tively    I left    the    police      officers          to

continue      documenting and                 stripping      the bodies.

I made my way over                to the hospital            m o r tuary and opened up.                I

contacted                                an u n q u a l i f i e d m o r t u a r y tech n i c i a n and a sked

her    to   come to the hospital                 to assist.          I a t t e m p t e d to contact another

t e c h n i c ia n but w ijm o u t success.

                                 j, the Chief MLSO           in h i s t o pa t,ino l A g y a r r i v e d at the

h a s pi ta 1 .       I assessed        the    space     i n the .m o r t u a r y and a s k ed

to assit          in the hospital             mortuary.                                   who     is an HLSQ

a 1 so ar r i ved at the hos pi ta 1 and                  I asked him to ass i st           i n the

mortuary.          I was      concerned that           the bodies       that   had a r r i v e d at         the

mo r t ua ry over the w ee k e n d did not become                     confused with the bodies

arri v in g f r om H i l ls bo ro ug h .

I went      back      to the      plaster       room and       continued to document and strip
the    bodies.        As the     bodies were         stripped each was         catalogued and

d o c u m en te d as far as       possible.          1 then a s k e d the    porters whose           names        I

d o n ’t know       I believe     one of them was                              to move      the bodies

from     the      plaster    room to the mortuary.               Before   they    left   the    plaster

room a leg of each body was marked                      in indeliable        ink with the major

disaster          plan number.       The     clothing a c c o m p a n i e d the bodies and           the

personal          property,     cash and jewellery          etc    remained with the           police.

This    process        continued until all            the boaies      in the     plaster     room had

been    removed to the mortuary.                    There was an additional           body     in a small

room across          from the     plaster      room.      This    body was docum e n t e d and

s tr ioped and then t r a ns fe rr ed to the mortuary.                                                 /      p°l

One    of the       bodies a female?          who    I now know to be one of t h e i-ya c k s

girls was          identified.       A second        body had a casualty          caro^jjj/S th a name

on it placed on his              chest,       I do not know where the             name on the         card

came    from and I cannot            remember at this            stage what      the name was.

Toget h e r with                        >■ the hospital          administrator,       the    police

liaison officer and two                <2)    other    police     officers     went   to the dining

room which was           being    used by the         relatives     of the     injured

stood on a table and              read out a list of the              injured     persons at         the

hospital          and a d e s cr ip ti on of the bodies           being   held by the hospital

together with any d is ti n g u i s h i n g marks              on each body,

F ol lo w i n g    the a n n o u nc em en t a large number         of people      came   towards

myself       and the     police     officer's asking        for further        i nf o rmat i on.      We

a s si st ed as      far as     possible      I went    back     to the m o r t u a r y and was

ac c om pa n i ed by a police         officer.         I was     informed    that some       relatives

were    at     the m o r tuary want ing        to    look at bodies with the view of

ideritfying them.             There was       no way that        I would allow anyone           to    2.0 0   k

at a body unless             the d es c r i p t i o n that they had given fitted the dead

pe rso n .

U pon my arrival            back at the m o r t u a r y    I disc o v e r e d that one of the
        Hicks      girl     had         been p o sitively identified.

        A decision was                  made       by someone to move            the bodies from the m o r t u a r y                 to

        the H il ls bo ro ug h ground.                    I do not know who made                  this d e c ision but

        w i t h i n a very short              time       it was      reversed.        A p p r o x i m a t e l y half an hour

        later,          received a t e lepho ne               call    from casualty to say that about                          six

        (6) ambulances             had a rr i v e d to take               the bodies        back to the ground,

        1 made my way across                      to    casualty to try and find out what was

        happening,           By time          1 got       ihere      the ambu l a n c e s       had alre a d y been sent

        round to the mortuary,                          I spoke with the           police        liaison officer and he

        c o n fi rme d t ha t the bodies                  were     to be t r a n s ferred         to the football

        ground on the             coroners             orders„

        I returned to the m o r t ua r y and                         informed the staff that the bodies were

        to be      removed. There were a large                        number     of   people       in         the m o r t u a r y

        including ambulance                   drivers,          police     officers,        mortu a r y staff and some

        social      workers who had a rr i v e d from the main                            part of the hospital,

       Three       (3)     or four          (4)    of'the       bodies were        placed        in the first

       ambulance,           I c a n ’t remember               the major disaster                plan number a l l o c a t e d

        to these          bodies and          I t r avelled          in the am b u l a n c e with these               bodies.

       U pon arrival a senior                      police officer asked me where                        the    police

        constables were.                    I said that          1 d i d n ’t know w hich officers                   he was

        talking about.              He       informed me that a number                    of police           officers       had

        been     sent to the hospital                     to a c co mp an y one body each,                to the ground,

        I said that          I    was       not aware         of those       officers and attempts                  were     then

        made     to contact         them by radio.                   Eventually        they were         contacted and

             w ri tt en on the       leg and that        officer     then became     responsible as       far as

             1 was    concerned for        that    body.     Each body was a c c o m p a n i e d with     the

             property      bag   containing       the    clothing and MDP       (Major Disaster Plan)

             records      in several      cases    there was        nothing   or very   little w r i t t e n on

             the   n ot es.When all       of the bodies        had a r r i v e d at the ground which        I

             believe      was around 9 pm my girlf r i e n d a r r i v e d and took me            back to the

             hospital.I       went   to the m o r t u ar y and       it was then that     I found out       that

             there was a body still             on the GITU waiting           to be transf e r r e d to    the

             ground.       Arr a n g e m e n t s were alre a d y    in hand for this     body to be

             collected by ambulance.               At    no stage     did   1 ever   see that    body.

             I was    told by the staff           that   everything was        in order and that         there

             was   little     else that      could be done.           I therefore     left the    hospital       and

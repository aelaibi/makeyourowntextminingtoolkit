          The     Appen d i c e s     contain details          of grants        to League         clubs and

          international              grounds.        As will     be a p p a r e n t   from    reading   the   te;;t,   the

P R O V I D I N G FOR THE BENE F I T OF F O O T B A L L

For many years Br i t i a n ' s                 three major         pools    companies      (Littlawoods,

V e r n o n s and Zetters)               have    c ontributed         large sums of m oney          to Brit i s h

Football.            Since      1958       (000058),        "copy     right"     payments,       now worth

a r o u n d £6      1/2(half)           mill i o n    per season,         have   been paid to the

football          a ut ho r i t i e s    for the use of their               fixture      lists    on the

pools      coupons.

In 1975           (000075)      the three            companies began to donate a significiant

p r o p o r t i o n of the        turnover           from their S p o t t i n g - t h e - B a l 1 c ompetition

to assist League                clubs       to meet        the    large    expenditure made         n e cessary

by the S a f et y of Sports Grounds Act                            1975    (000075).       The    contribution

from the           proceeds       of S p o t t i n g - t h e - B a l 1 was greatly        increased       in 1979

(000079)          to enable        financial assi s t a n c e             to be given to the game

g e n e r a l l y with      particular           emphasis         on tackling any a s s o c i a t e d social

problems.            This was           further       increased during           1984    (000084)    to

e s t a b l i s h a fund to assist League                        clubs wit h the        cost of    policing,

their      grounds,         and again at the beginning                      of 19SS      (000088)    to enable

a major           contribution to be made                   to the Oxford Centre            for Cr irnino logi c

R esearch.           The    total amount              donated from S p o t t i n g - t h e - B a l 1 to the two

Trusts       exceeded £60 m il l i o n by the                    end of 1987        (000087).       The total

given to B ri t i s h           football         since      1958    (000058)     now a p p r o a c h e d £120

•1.    L EA G U E CLUB G RO U N D S - SAFETY A N D            IMPROVEMENTS

The Safety of Sports Grounds Act of                        1975      (000073)    set    out   to implement

the    r e c o m m e ndations      of the W h e atley Committee,             which     investigated       the

disaster at            Ibrox Park,       Glasgow,    in 1971,         (000071)     in w hich 66

football        fans were         killed.     The Horne Office and the S c o t t i s h Horne

D e p a r tm en t   have      p u blished an a dv i s o r y     document      (known as the          "Green

Code").       Covering         such matters as       crush barriers,            exits and the slope

of terraces.             The Act      empowers     the Home S e c r e t a r y and       the S e c r e t a r y of

State       of S c o t l an d to     "designate" sports           grounds;      d e s i g nation means

that     the ground must             obtain a safety          certificate       from the       lcoal

authority.             The Act     covers all      sports       grounds with       crowd      capacities       of

more     than       10,000.

Fr o m the outset             it was apparent       that      very substantial          sums of m o n e y

w o ul d be needed            to bring B r i t a i n ’s football         grounds      up to the

n e ce s s a r y standards.           Many of them were           built      in the    early years       of

this     century,        whe n    crowd safety was a less              pressing       concern than       it is

today,       and even at m a ny of the better                   equipped grounds,          structure      such

as    gates and barriers              had   reached the end of their               safe    operational

lives.         In a d d i ti on    patterns of      crowd       behaviour      have    changed for       the

worse making            s eg re g a t i o n .structures    essential         at many    grounds.        The

disaster at B r ad fo rd C i t y ’s ground                in May      1985    (0005S5)     has also      led

to    the    i n t r o duction of more         rigorous       fire    prevention measures.

The    task     falling        on the two Trusts          has    therefore      been    considerable.

M a n y clubs        have     required expenditure            totalling       hundreds     of thousands

of    pounds.          Sums    of that magnitude          were    simply not a v ailable             for more

tha n a small           handful 1 of top d i v ision            clubs.       Fortunately       for    football

Litt l e w o o d s ,    Vernons      and Zetters     offered a solution.                They would make

a v a i la bl e a p r oportion of the turnover                   earned by this S p o t t i n g - t h e -

support w ith grants.

Out    of the      130 League Clubs              in England,       S c o t l a n d and Wales,        128 have

received grants              for a u t ho ri se d safety        expenditure.          A full       list of

these     clubs with details                of the grants        paid     is contained         in Appendix

C.     By F e b r u ar y     1988    (000288)       over £37 m i l l i o n had been          paid out          in

grants.          Sa f e t y grants are awarded e n t irely at the d i s c r e t i o n of the

Trustees.          P r o j ec ts are       carefully s c r u t i n i s e d by the F . G.I.T's

consulting         surveyors         before      grants are awarded.

£ 5 4 5 , 4 8 8 has       been a l l o ca te d by the Trust          for safety        projects at League

clubs      in N o r th er n     Ireland       (See Appen d i x F for          list    of grants).

Some     part     of the e xpenditure             on ground safety has               increased       the

comfort and a m e nities              of League        grounds,      e.g.    better     terracing and

more adequ a t e           lavatory facilities.              In a d d i t i o n   clubs have spent

c o m pa ra t i v e l y    large    sums     (totalling more         than £50 million)             on new

stands,         more      seating and other          improvements F.G.I.T.              continues            to give

available,         the T r u stees         have adop t e d a policy of grant-aiding                     ground

In 1978         (000078)          the Sports Council            wit h the aid of a special                  grant

f ro m the Gover n m e n t           lauched what          became      known as the Football                and the

C o m m u n i t y scheme.          P r o jects      to be financed under             it were        to be    closely

a s s o c i a t e d with League            clubs.       The aim was        to increase         the sporting

f ac i l i t i e s   in the are a and to              create      stronger       links    between         the club

a n d the       local       community.           It was hoped by bringing fans,                     particularly

the younger            ones,       into    closer a s s o c i a t i o n with the         club,      to    reduce

Under        its original           constitution,          F.G.I.T.       could assist         these schemes,

a n d made grants             totally £ 3 8 0 , 0 0 0 to eight            clubs.       The    power       is now

vested         in the Football             Trust w h i c h has made £1.1             mill i o n available.

The mass m e d i a        concentrate most             of their a t t e n t i o n on the League                    clubs

and     players.        But more young men and boys                      play soccer          than watch

League        games.      There are well             over 4 0 , 0 0 0    clubs    in the Un i t e d Kingdom.

Some     of these       own their           grounds and       indeed have facilities                  not below

those     enjoyed       by some League              clubs.       But    the great mass          depend on

v o l u n t a r y bodies.          There     is plenty of evidence               to show that with the

rising        popularity of the game there                    is a shortage            of pitches and that

To     help towards meeting                 this defic i e n c y the Football              Trust      has        in each

year     of    its existence          offered substantial                sums    to    local au t h o r i t i e s

5.   S P E CIFIC ANT I-HOOL I G A N I S M M E A S U R E S

The Football           Trust        has a special         responsibility       contained     in its

T rust Deed to assist                 projects which are a imed at tackling                  h o o l i ganism

a s s o c i a t e d w ith football.             Its first        initiative was to       convene a

m ajor      one-day       conference         in London      on “H o o l i g a n s i m and Football"      in

■1981      (000081).          A wide       range    of   influential     and e x p e r i e n c e d speakers

p a r t i c i p a t e d and    cast new        light on the        problem.     A prime    objective wa

to   identify areas where                   some of the Football           Trust's     substantial       fund

could be spent             to best effect.               A report    of the    proceedings      was;

published.           The      general       experience      of    recant years      has been that        the

incidence         of h oo li g a n i s m     inside      football    grounds    has diminished.

Wh e n     it does     occur,        the s eg re g a t i o n and safety measures          u n d e r t a k e n at

most       grounds      (with the help of substantial                    funding    from F.G.I.T.)

have made          it easier         to    control.       There    has   been much for the Football

Tr u s t    do do in this area,               however,

S p e c i fi c   projects       to be granted a ided have                included the     i n s t a llation

of   close       circuit       t el e v i s i o n for    police    used at all major League

grounds,         assi s t a n c e    towards       transport      improvements      (railway

stations,          coach      parks,       etc),    commissioning        of research     by Leicester

a grant         of £ 2 5 0 , 0 0 0    (again for a three-year                 period)      was made           to the

e s p e c ia ll y football,              can play in tackling             the    problem.

It    is the Trust's               intentio n that all              grounds     in the Football               League,

B e lf a s t    should be offered grants                    (in nearly all           cases     of 100 per            cent)

for    the          ins t a l l a t i o n of   close circuit         television.          A total       of £2.3

football        grounds,        the Trust        gave     the     club a grant           of £25,000.           It also

A further          initiative        has    been the establ i s h m e n t             of a specific          fund to

ass i s t all       clubs     in the S c o t t i s h and Football Leagues                       with the       costs

of    policing       their      grounds.           For    the     1984-85       (000084)-(000085)              season

a    little     under £1 m il li on was              spent      in this way,            w hich as sufficient

to    pay 35 per         cent of the          police      charges        far League matches.                 The

same       percentage       grants were           paid in the           1985-86        (000085)-(000086)               and

1986-87       (000086)-(000087)               seasons and the total annual                       cost     of the

scheme       has    risen to £1.3 million.                    The Trust         is also making a

si g n i ficant      c on t r i b u t i o n towards       the     cost of the B r i t i s h Transport

Police Football Intelligence Unit.

Wh i l s t all      these     specific        initiatives are             clearly        important and

valuable,          the T r u s t ’s work        in helping         to    provide more           playing

facilities          for the y o u t h of the             country may           in the     long     run    prove most

beneficial          in tackling anti-social                   behaviour.

CROSS REFER TO ACTION

ON FRIDAY 031189 I SAW MRS DEVONS IDE''THE MOTHER OF THE DECEASED CHRISTOPHER

DEv u N S I D E , IN THE PRESENCE OF A SOCIAL WORKER                     ] AT THE SEFTON

HELPLINE OFFICES IN LIVERPOOL. WHILST MRS DEVONSIDE HAD PREVIOUSLY INDICATED

THAT SHE DID NOT WISH TO VIEW ANY VISUAL MATERIAL,                SHE DID IN FACT DURING THE

COURSE OF THE CONVERSATION,           VIEW THREE PHOTOGRAPHS SHOWING HER SON BEING

CARRIED ACROSS THE PITCH. THIS TYPE OF CHANGE OF HEART HAS OCCURRED BEFORE,'

DURING THE COURSE OF THIS MR DEVONSIDE             <F ATHER OF THE D E C E A S E D ) ARRIVED

UNEXPECTEDLY AND VERY OBVIOUSLT TAKEN ABACK BY THE FACT THAT SHE HAD AGREED TO

SEE ANYTHING.       I WENT TO GRAET LENGTHS TO EXPLAIN THE PURPOSE OF WHAT WE WERE

SEEKING TO DO AMD BY THE END OF THE CONVERSATION HE ADOPTED A MORE

CONCILIATORY T O N E » HE REITERATED THAT HE DID NOT WISH TO VIEW ANY MATERIAL BUT

DID RAISE THE FOLLOWING ISSUES WHICH HE REQUESTED THAT I BRING TO THE

ATTENTION OF A SENIOR OFFICER.

•1. HE HAS REQUESTED VIA HIS SOLICITOR A COPY OF THE VERY FIRST STATEMENT THAT

HE MADE TO A SOUTH YORKSHIRE CID OFFICER. HE HAS NOT HAD A REPLY TO HIS

REQUEST.

2. HE REQUESTED A COPY OF A SECOND STATEMENT WHICH HE MADE TO THE WEST MIDLAND

S POLICE,     POSSIBLY TO A PC                 1

3. HE WOULD LIKE THE RETURN OF THE MATCH TICKET WHICH WAS IN HIS SON'S
                                                                                  PAGE


P O S S E S S I O N . IT DOES APPEAR ON THE PHOTOGRAPH OF HIS CLOTHING.

MRS DEVONSIDE RAISED THE FOLLOWING ISSUES.

4. THERE IS A 3" DIFFERENCE IN HEIGHT AS SHOWN ON CHRISTOPHER DEV O N S I D E ’S

POST MORTEM REPORT.    SHE WOULD LIKE AN E X P L A NATION.

5. A GOLD RING BELONGING TO CHRISTOPHER        IS MISSING. SHE THINKS IT IS HALL

MARKED AND BUCKLE SHAPED AT THE FRONT.       SHE WOULD LIKE A SEARCH MADE FOR IT.

MR & MRS DEVONSIDE OBVIOUSLY FELT VERY STRONGLY ABOUT ALL THESE MATTERS.

WHILST HE UNDERSTOOD THE AMOUNT OF WORK GOING INTO THE C O R O N E R ’S INQUIRY HE

WANTED TO KNOW IF THE SAME EFFORT WAS GOING INTO THE CRIMINAL INVESTIGATION.

HE GAVE THE IMPRESSION THAT HE WILL BE APPEARING IN A TELEVISION PROGRAMME

WITHIN THE NEXT MONTH IN WHICH HILLSBOROUGH WILL BE DISCUSSED.

H^QfOULD LIKE TO BE CONTACTED O N P R E F E R A B L Y            IN THE MORNING RE THE

ISSUES RAISED,

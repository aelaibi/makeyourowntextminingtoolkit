  01.03                         roan.   I should explain to you at

                                this monent, at the, at the conclusion

                                of the interview I'll give you a

                               notice explaining what will happen to

                               the tapes.    Do you understand that?
             MACKRELL          I do.

             DSU61             On the 15th of April 1989 (150489)

                               a disaster occurred at Hillsborough

                               Football Stadium and 95 people died.

                               Following the public inquiry and

                               report, the Chief Constable of South

                               Yorkshire Police consulted with the

                               Director of Public Prosecutions and

                               as a result West Midlands Police were

                               requested to do a criminal
01.32                          investigation.   So far as you are

                               concerned, arising from that

                               investigation, there are possible

                              criminal offences of corporate

                              manslaughter and that is against the

                              Club as distinct to yourself and an

                              offence of, a possible offence of

                              culpable malfeasance, which would be

                              against you as an individual.    I'll

                              explain the specific allegations to

                              you in interview, but do you now

                              understand the nature of this
02.04                         interview.    Before you answer that

                              I need to formally caution you, you
 MACKRELL              GRAHAM HENRY


                               do not have to say anything unless

                               you wish to do so but what you say

                              may be given in evidence.     Do you

                              understand?
            MACKRELL           I do.

            DSU61             I will now remind you that you are

                              not under arrest and that you need

                              not remain here, in addition you

                              are entitled to legal representation

                              and of course you are aware of that

                              because Mr O'CALLAGHAN is here anyway.

                              Do you understand what I have said in

                              regard to the fact that you are not

                              under arrest?
            MACKRELL          I do.
            DSU61             Initially you gave evidence to the

                              inquiry held by Lord Justice TAYLOR.

                              I have here a transcript of the

                             evidence and you have a copy in your

                              folder which it m y be necessary

                             to refer to during the interview.

                             Are you content to accept the

                             contents of that transcript, or is

                             there anything in it which you wish

                             to clarify before we start?
        MACKRELL             No.
03.10   DSU61                You also submitted a written

                             submission to Lord Justice TAYLOR in

                             relation to the Semi-Final on the
 MACKRELL                  GRAHAM HENRY


                                   15th of April 1989 (150489).    I have

                                   here a copy of that document and

                                   you have a copy also in your folder

                                  which it may be necessary to refer

                                  to daring interview.     Are you content

                                  that we do that also?
             MACKRELL             Yes.

             O'CALLAGHAN          I think if we may, I should interject

                                  at this point just to put on record

                                  the fact that Mr MACKRELL has not

                                  reviewed his transcript of evidence

                                  word by word, line by line, for the

                                  purposes of this interview.     So

                                  the answer he has given is broadly

                                  correct no doubt, but there may be

                                  matters when you, when you take him

                                  through the transcript that he will

                                 want to clarify.
            DSU61                 I understand that yes.    Presumably

                                  that also relates to his written

                                 submission as well?
            O'CALLAGHAN          He has reviewed the statement, I

                                 believe, his statement.
            DSU61                Okay.

        O'CALLAGHAN              The written submission.
04.07   D5U61                    Fair enough then.   If we could move

                                 on Mr MACKRELL to deal with the

                                 situation as far as your employment

                                 is concerned.   As I understand it,
 MACKRELL              GRAHAM HENRY


                               you're the Secretary of Sheffield

                               Wednesday Football Club, you also

                               describe yourself as Chief Executive

                              you were appointed in December 1986

                               (001286) and you're answerable to a

                              board of seven Directors, responsible

                              for the inplementation of policy by

                              the Board.   Hew far did this extend

                              in relation to you authorising work

                              at the ground?
04.40       MACKRELL          All works of a capital nature of a

                              major capital nature were sanctioned

                              by the Board of Directors.
            DSU61             Yes, so in regard to, so the Spion

                              Kop, and the roof on the Spion Kop,

                              that's something that would have

                              clearly gone to the Board of

                              Directors, considerable financial

                              implications.
04.58       MACKRELL          Indeed, in addition to that

                             obviously works of a major nature

                             we employ EASTWOOD and Partners

                             as our consultants to initially

                             draw up schemes, obtain tenders,

                             costings, because a lot of the work

                             that is done at the football ground

                             is funded by way of grant aid or

                             assisted by way of grant aid and

                                Trust so there are obviously

                                set, definite procedures which one

                               must go down the path and obviously

                               that's why we've particulary mr *5*!

                               EAS1TOCD and Partners.
             DSU61             Yes.
             MACKRELL          For actually setting us up.
             DSU61             Can you talk about the canposition

                               of the Board Mr MACKRELL, I

                               understand that there are seven

                               Directors, we know that Mr ADDY is

                               one of the Directors with

                               responsibility for structural

                               safety work at the ground and we'll

                               come to that in a minute, but there

                               are seven Directors, as I understand

                               it, it's a non executive Board.    Can

                              you explain to me what that, what

                              that means, and you know what what

                              the structure is?
05.58       MACKRELL          Sheffield Wednesday Football Club

                              is a public limited company,     it has

                              seven Directors who basically are

                              part time in their operation, they

                              therefore meet on a regular basis

                              to direct policy of the company.

                               the company.     Basically the Directors

                               are, do not have a controlling

                               interest in the company and

                               they are appointed under normal

                              company law by the shareholders in

                              annual meetings.



06.29       DSU61             So they're responsible to the share

                              holders.

            MACKRELL          Indeed.
            DSU61             I see, yeah.     Can we deal with the

                              ccirposition of the Board.    I think

                              ccirposition, I'm right in saying

                              that, since your appointment the

                              Board's been comparatively same

                              Directors, the seven Directors.     Can

                              you name the Directors?
06.48       MACKRELL          Yes indeed.     The Board actually has

                              changed subsequent to the events of

                              15th of April 89 (150489) in, but I

                             will expand on that.     At the time in

                             question, Chairman was Mr H E McGEE,

                             Vice Chairman was a Mr Mathew

                             SHEPHERD, in addition the other

                             Directors were Keith ADDY, Ernest

                             BARON, Cliff WOODWARD, Stanley

                             SPATE and Geoffrey HULLEY.

                             Subsequent to that and at the present

                             time Messrs IVfcGEE, SHEPHERD and SPATE

                                have retired from the Board and we

             DSU61             Mm.     Those changes, I understand it

                               though, are post the 15th April...

             DSU61             1989 (150489).
             MACKRELL          That's right...
             DSU61             So where, where if - sorry to interrup

                               you.

            MACKRELL           It's alright, just making a point,

                               that sorry, that Mr GREARSQN and Mr

                               RICHARDS were appointed in

                               October 1989 (001089) and Mr

                               ASHTON was in March 1990 (000390).
07.73       DSU61              Right. So am I right in assuming

                               then that the, from your appointment

                              which I think was in December 1986

                               (001286), the Board of Directors

                              were as you described up until

                              after the 15th of April 1989

                               (150489)?
            MACKRELL          Indeed.
            DSU61             Are you aware of the, any changes

                              in the Directors, the Board of

                              Directors in the period from when

                              the Safety Certificate was issued

                              in 1979 (000079) to through to

                                1986 (000086)?
             MACKRELL           Only by reference to the statutory

                               records of the Company and I wasn't,

                               I wasn't familiar with personally

                               not caning from Sheffield with any

                               of the gentlemen who were previously

                               Directors of the Club prior to my

                               appointment.
08.41       DSU61              I see.    What type of decisions would

                               you refer to the Board.     I mean

                               we've we've talked about it, that the

                               major capital, the major financial

                               decisions would be referred to the

                               Board and we mentioned the roof on

                               the Spion Kop.    What type of

                               decisions would you (teal with

                              yourself?
08.59       MACKRELL           I would make it possibly minor

                              decisions, obviously there is an

                              ongoing discussion say with the

                              police on a matter of policing,

                              policing individual matches,

                              and the policy for individual

                              matches.    Obviously it's the general

                              activities of the Chief Executive

                              of any Company.
        DSU61                 Mn.   Was, would there be any sort

                              of financial constraint or
 MACKRELL               GRAHAM HENRY


                                limitation.   Was there any sort of

                                sealing put on what you could spend

                               or?

             MACKRELL           It wasn't an actual determined

                               sealing in that I had an x limit

                               of which I wasn't to spend more

                               than the Board, but obviously it

                               was a situation the Board had

                               strong financial controls and I

                               normally wouldn't spend large

                               capital sums without reference to

                               the Board.
09.40       DSU61              Mn.   What, what I'm getting out

                               can you, is there any definition

                               what would you consider to be large

                               can you give us a      ?
09.44       MACKRELL           I would, I would, I would anticipate

                               I would say large is five, ten

                              thousand pounds.
            DSU61             Was it the cost element that

                              controlled, you know what you

                              referred or was it the type of

                              decision?
        MACKRELL              I think basically, it's it's a

                              financial control element, not the

                              actual, because obviously I think

                              when one's talking about referring

                              to the Board they've obviously got

                              to monitor all expenditure not in
MACKRELL              GRAHAM HENRY                                   12


                             matter of to balance up for example

                             whether expenditure should be spent

                             on the sports hall or visa -v- the

                              lottery department and so it's a

                             simple one of that and I think

                             that they appraise the situation

                             and make their decisions accordingly.
10.21      DSU61             I see.   Would you make decisions

                             in relation to work identified as

                             necessary by either EASTWOODS, the

                             Working Party or Advisory Group

                             as you became later, the police or

                             groundstaff in relation to safety

                             matters or would you refer those to

                             the Board or, I mean does that go

                             back to how much money you're

                             spending?
           MACKRELL          I think it goes back to basically

                             items of capital expenditure

                            obviously if one commits over

                            a thing like the Kop, then one

                            would, one's talking about a large

                            near seven figure sum, one would

                            refer it to the Board, if one has

                            another item whereby say a barrier

                            to barrier repairs are needed that's

                            reported to me, obviously I would

                            instruct than to go ahead with that

                            work.




                                                                          727
 MACKRELL              GRAHAM HENRY


 11.03       DSU61             Mn.     How much interest generally

                               did the Board take in, in safety of

                               the Ground, I mean can you give us

                               seme sort of...?
            MACKRELL          Well the Boards obviously were were

                              interested in safety.     It was the

                              sit... it was basically a situation

                              whereby I was there and EASTWOODS

                              were there to draw their attention

                              to matters. That's EASTWOODS were

                              responsible from the time when the

                              Safety Certificate was issued by

                              South Yorkshire County Council and

                              obviously they were instructed by

                              the Board at that time to basically

                              do what work was necessary to get

                              the certificate.
            DSU61             I see.    What, we'll ccroe back to

                             EASTWOODS actually shortly but what

                             what decisions, were, sorry, were

                             the decisions by the Board on a

                             majority basis.     You know in other

                             words was it a diplomatic sort of...
         MACKRELL            Quite honestly...
         DSU61               decision, majority decision?
12.00    MACKRELL            No, it never came to that because

                             matters of public safety I felt

                             the Board always went down, went

                             down the path, if one looks
MACKRELL               GRAHAM HENRY


                               statistically, there's only one other

                               Club in the British Isles under the

                               last statistics published by

                              Football Trust, that had spent

                              more money on or received more

                              grant aid in respect of safety

                              and improvement work.
            D5U61             Yeah.

            MACKRELL          And that's Glasgow Celtic.
12.22      DSU61              But how, I mean in regard to

                              decisions by the Board, how were

                              they made, generally?
           MACKRELL           Gen, generally, a a proposition

                              was put to the Board, and they

                              obviously mooted by the Board

                              and then a decision taken.
           DSU61              So if you've got something that you

                             wanted to deal with and seme work

                              that needed to be carried out, you

                             mentioned barriers, earlier,

                             what you'd do is put a proposition

                             up to the Board?

           MACKRELL          Something like barriers would be

                             on a routine basis, you know

                             routine situation if somebody, it's

                             it's it's almost an on going house

                             keeping situation of keeping the

                             ground up to scratch.
        DSU61                Yes.
 MACKRELL              GRAHAM HENRY


 12.56      MACKRELL           The Board would mainly be referred

                               to matters of direct policy or

                               capital expenditure.   I think

                              things like barrier repairs are

                              really an ongoing, an ongoing

                              cost.
            DSU61             Maintenance you regard it almost as

                              maintenance.
            MACKRELL          Yeah I would regard that almost

                              like a, okay as a safety element

                              but it's a you know, it's a

                              situation whereby something has

                              to be done on a, on a regular

                              basis.
            DSU61             So unless something, unless it

                              was a question of sort of

                              clearing out all the barriers

                             on the West Terrace or something

                              like that and spending twenty or

                             thirty thousand pounds on replacing

                             than, you wouldn't go to the Board,

                             you wouldn't expect to go to the

                             Board?
         MACKRELL            No that's right.
13.29    DSU61               Mn.   Mr McGEE was the, was the

                             Chairman of the Board, I appreciate

                             that he's he's now left, but did he

                             take a leading role in the

                             decision making process during
 MACKRELL               GRAHAM HENRY


                                the period that he was the

                                Chairman?
 13.39       MACKRELL          Well by the definition of the

                                fact that he was Chairman

                               obviously he chaired, yeah he

                               chaired the meetings.   But it's,

                               it was, it was basically a a

                               Board decision and not an

                               individual decision.
            DSU61              Mn.   Were there ever occasions

                               when the Board, members of the

                               Board sort of greatly differed.

                               Presumably you sit on all Board

                              meetings?
            MACKRELL           Of course, yeah.   No I've....
            DSU61             Was there a ___
            MACKRELL          No I've never, I've never known

                              a great diversity of opinion what­

                              soever.
            DSU61             No sort of animosity or anything

                              like that within the Board.    It..?
         MACKRELL             No.
14.13    DSU61
                              I see. Referring to Mr LOCK who who's

                              described as the Security, describes

                              himself in fact as the Security

                              Officer, according to his statement

                              and transcript of evidence, he

                             was responsible for the Stewards

                             the selection briefing and training
 MACKRELL               GRAHAM HENRY


                                and in fact the posting of than on

                                match day.     Is that ...
             MACKRELL           That's correct yes.
             DSU61              is that right?    I'll come back

                                to the role of stewards later but

                               so far as Mr LOCK'S concerned,
 14.44                         I think he, he mentions that he

                               was involved with general matters

                               of crowd safety and was of course

                               familiar with the Green Code. That's

                               what what sort of, I'm referring

                               for the audio tape to the statement

                               by Douglas John LOCK.    What sort of

                               involvment did he have in general

                               safety matters?
            MACKRELL           General safety matters visa viz ...

                               stewarding.
            DSU61             Crowd safety.
15.17       MACKRELL          Visa viz stewarding and he would

                              draw matters of possible attention

                              that, that would be, that he felt

                              might be, might be of benefit to

                              the Club.
15.26    DSU61                So how would that work then?    Would

                              he, you were the Safety Officer?
         MACKRELL             That's right, he would report to me,

                              he acted as the go betwsen, between

                              myself and all the Stewards etc

                              on match days.
 MACKRELL               GRAHAM HENRY


             DSU61              So if the Stewards or any member

                                of the staff, in fact, catering,

                                it might even be a member of the

                                catering staff presumably,

                                turnstile and any of those?
             MACKRELL          That's right.
 15.47       DSU61             When, he was responsible for the

                               Stewards, if, if one of those

                               went to him and said there was a

                               problem with a broken fence or...
            MACKRELL           Min.

            DSU61              something like that then he would, he

                               wouldn't actually deal with it, he'd

                               got no power to deal with it___
            MACKRELL           No.

            DSU61              or anything like that.    He would

                               come to you...

            MACKRELL           Yeah.

            DSU61              by virtue of your position as

                               Safety Officer or as Chief

                               Executive Secretary.
            MACKRELL          That's right.     I think really..
            DSU61             Both?

            MACKRELL          Yeah the two parts, two parts come

                              to that.   On a normal basis

                              actually just just to clarify
16.12                         a point, normally the Steward

                              would go initially to their

                              individual superior.    We have a




                                                                       733
  MACKRELL               GRAHAM HENRY


                                 Chief Steward say for the South

                                 Stand...
              DSU61              Yeah.

              MACKRELL          a Chief Steward for the North Stand

                                and that person would in fact,

                                usually normally go then to Doug

                                LOCK.

             DSU61              I see.    He wouldn't have authority

                                to spend any money ...
             MACKRELL           No.

             DSU61              without reference to yourself

                                at all?

             MACKRELL           No, that's right he wouldn't.
 16.34       DSU61              I see.    Can we now talk about

                                the role of Mr ADDY and I understand

                                that in private life Mr ADDY is a

                               builder developer, property developer.
             MACKRELL          That's right.
16.45        DSU61             But within the Club organisation,

                               he had all the, he had responsibility

                               for the ground and the premises,

                               the structural safety as I understand

                               it.    According to Mr McGEE, Mr ADDY

                               had responsibility for structural

                               safety as well,    is that how you

                               understand the situation?
         MACKRELL              Basically yes.    I think that one has

                               to look at the situation of the
17.13                          implementation of the Safety of
MACKRELL              GRAHAM HENRY                                 20


                              Sports Grounds Act.   Keith had,

                              when the Safety of Sports Grounds

                             Act was implemented in 78 (000078)

                              79 (000079), there was no, there

                             were no executives in football,

                             with any experience of it, because

                             obviously it never happened before.
           DSU61             Mn.

           MACKRELL          And as a result of that, Keith as

                             his, as you say his expertise in

                             the building development business

                             obviously was somebody who who

                             understood the technical nature

                             of certain of the work that was
17.38                        (tone.   Over the years, gradually,

                             there are people such as myself

                            at the Club as obviously different

                                 I would refer it to him just

                                 copy a correspondence over him

                                 to keep him fully briefed of the

18.21      MACKRELL             Exactly.     He was right involved in

                                the early meetings, with the

                                South Yorkshire, the then South

                                Yorkshire County Council over the

                                Certificate.

                                here to say that in those days I

                                believe that a Mr WOODWARD...

                               responsibility or special

             MACKRELL              ... at that point, but obviously

                                   an early aspect of___
             0'CALLAGHAN          He was a Director then certainly,

                                  but my recollection is that he did

                                  not take over that responsibility

                                  until later.

            MACKRELL              Basically WHITEHEAD is a gentleman

                                  who has left the Board, who left

                                  the Board early eighties I believe.
            DSU61                 He was a Director?
            MACKRELL              Yes he was.
            DSU61                 They're both Directors then?
            MACKRELL              They both were Directors yes, a

                                  chap called Roy WHITEHEAD.
            DSU61                 I see.    And the other guy is again?
            MACKRELL             WOOCWARD, but I'm not sure on

                                 that one, I have to refer...

                                  (Flicking of paper).    (Pause).
20.00       O'CALLAGHAN          Mr WHITEHEAD I think is the, is

                                 the man who was more involved

                                 with it in those days.
            DSU61                This is involved in the safety

                                 aspects ...

        O'CALLAGHAN              Yes.     In in structure of it.
        DSU61                    Before Mr ADDY?
 MACKRELL                 GRAHAM HENRY


             O'CALLAGHAN          In construction work around the

                                  ground.    It wasn't specifically

                                  just related to safety aspects.

                                  It was the Director who had a

                                  special expertise in areas of,

                                 he was in structural steel

                                 business as I remember and he

                                 had that particular task before

                                 Mr ADDY took over.
            DSU61                I see.

 20.31      O'CALLAGHAN          I believe Mr ADDY in fact dealt

                                 with it in his statement and

                                 referred to this.    Mr ADDY said

                                 in his statement that he joined

                                 the Board of Directors in 1975

                                 (000075) and at that time Roy

                                 WHITEHEAD was a Director of the

                                 Club with a structural steel

                                 business and he was regarded

                                 as Director with special

                                responsibility for structrual

                                matters at the ground, I took

                                over that responsibility from

                                him when he retired.
            DSU61               Oh, I see.    If we can cone to..
         MACKRELL               Sure.
21.04    DSU61                  the more recent period.     What

                                would Mr ADDY's, Mr ADDY

                                presumably by virtue of this
MACKRELL               GRAHAM HENRY


                               responsibility would have seme

                               sort of knowledge of the Green

                               Guide 1976 (000076) and then

                               1986 (000086), when that, when

                              that was issued?
            MACKRELL          He had a knowledge of it, but

                              predominantly the matters of the

                              ground safety and elements of

                              pertaining to it, were hand, were

                              held, were dealt with by EASTWOOD

                              and Partners.
           DSU61              Mn.     I'll come to EASTWOOD and

                              Partners if I may, later in the

                              interview and quite what their role
21.39                         is. Would, would, dealing with Mr

                              ADDY, would he have a degree of

                              technical knowledge, about, I'm

                              not talking about in the building

                              industry generally, I'm, he would

                              obviously have that from his

                             occupation but I'm thinking more

                             about the Green Guide, the Green

                             Guides plural?

           MACKRELL          Yes, no, sure I don't necessarily say

                             he would of, say he would have

                             technical knowledge of the Green Guide,

                             he had knowledge of the Green Guide

                             but I feel that it would, it would

                             have been a situation, it would be by
 MACKRELL               GRAHAM HENRY


                                point of reference as opposed to...
             DSU61              He wouldn't be able to pick up

                                situations like configuration of

                                barriers being...
             MACKRELL           No, that that would be a situation

                                that would be left to...
             DSU61             tunnel elevation and things like that,
             MACKRELL          to to EASTWOOD and Partners.
             DSU61             I see.    Did Mr, would Mr ADDY, again

                               because of this, have any function in

                               regard to decisions about building

                               work or would he just advise the

                               Board, assist you to advise the

                               Board if you like...
            MACKRELL           Sure.

            DSU61              on technical matters.
22.39       MACKRELL           I think that the situation often was

                               that may be EASTWOODS would consult

                               initially with Mr ADDY because he

                               had a technical expertise...
            DSU61              Yes.

            MACKRELL          by way of Partner and Son building

                              terms and it would be left that

                              then Mr ADDY might put EASTWOODS

                              proposals to the Board.
            DSU61             In the way that the Board can

                              understand...
        MACKRELL              Exactly.
        DSU61                 Non engineering...
 MACKRELL               GRAHAM HENRY


             MACKRELL           Yeah.
             DSU61              Laymen's type approach.
             MACKRELL           That's right.
             DSU61              I see.   So he I mean he wouldn't

                               actually, he ADDY, wouldn't actually

                               be able to go off and spend money

                               again in regard to safety

                               independent of anybody else?
            MACKRELL           No.
            DSU61              He would be, to seme extent,

                               something similar to yourself, you

                               he'd help...
23.17       MACKRELL           That's right.    There is basically

                               the under the corporate structure

                               no person would have the actual

                               right to go and do it to no doubt

                               it would be referred back.
23.30       DSU61             How do you see Mr ADDY'S function

                               in relation to your own function?

                              How do do you equate the two?

                              You're, you are the Safety Officer.
            MACKRELL          Yeah Mr ADDY I feel, I feel gives

                              can give me seme technical advice

                              of matters which if I, if I require

                              it.
        DSU61                 Mm.

        MACKRELL              I can ask him, you know, can look at.

                              Again he's explained EASTWOODS even

                              though they write to me and hopefully
 MACKRELL               GRAHAM HENRY


                                in reasonable layman's language,

                                sometimes on occasions you know,

                                I've asked Keith.
             DSU61             What type of, can you give me an

                               example of what type of work you're

                               talking about, Mr MACKRELL the ...
             MACKRELL          Basically there was a dispute

                               regarding the final payment on the

                               Kop roof ...
             DSU61             Mm.

            MACKRELL           with the main contractors and it dealt

                               with sub contractors and it rep, dealt

                               and the sub contractors then

                               approached us to to for additional

                               sums of money.   And obviously this was

                               like on a, on a basis of a building

                               contract with a main contractor and a

                               sub contractor and quite honestly

                               I don't know, I'm the first to admit

                               I don't know a great deal about

                              you know the technicalities of

                              building contracts.
            DSU61             Mm.

            MACKRELL          And it was something where I've

                              showed the correspondence to Keith

                              and then he advised me said no, on
24.41                         in this particular instance, no, we

                              have to leave that to EASTWOODS,

                              they were the Consulting Engineers
MACKRELL              GRAHAM HENRY


                              they were the people who instructed,

                              it must be left for them to decide.
           DSU61              So they, they weren't really safety

                              aspects, they they were. (Overtalking)
           MACKRELL          More technical function.
           DSU61             Building function than a safety

                             function.
           MACKRELL          Indeed.
           DSU61             Can you give us an example in

                             regard to safety how'd you'd,

                             you know in regard to the safety

                             his safety role, your safety role?
25.02      MACKRELL          Well basically if EASTWOODS were for

                             exanple, you know, I'm I'm I'm

                             trying to actually think of, think

                             of a specific term.   It was

                             predominantly, I must say I can't

                             recall a particular matter on safety.

                             It's mainly in relation to other

                             capital expenditure, Keith, we...

                            over the last, since I've been the

                            Company, the Club have re-roofed the

                            North Stand which was a considerable

                            capital cost and ended up being

                            one hundred and fifty thousand

                            and there was seme dispute, or not

                            dispute, seme discussion with British

                            Steel over the pitch of the roof,

                            now again I have known nothing about
 MACKRELL               GRAHAM HENRY


                                the pitches on flat roofs.
             DSU61             Mm.

             MACKRELL          And it was that, that he was able to

                               give us a little bit of advice and

                               advise me and the Board on that

                               matter.
 25.50       DSU61             If we talk, you know the barrier 144?
             MACKRELL          Yes.

             DSU61             That was reduced.    I don't want to

                               care in to this into, at this

                               stage again, in too much detail but

                               would would you have any conversation

                               with Mr ADDY, would you seek his

                               advice in regard to that or would

                               you simply take the advice of

                               EASTWOODS, I mean EASTWOODS were

                               there anyway?
            MACKRELL          Well I have to say that that barrier

                               144, is before I joined the company,

                              the removal, the removal of barrier

                              144.
            DSU61             I used that as an example...
            MACKRELL          Yeah, of course, of course, I would

                              have thought on something like that,

                              one would have relied upon our

                              Consulting Engineers.
26.26    DSU61                Okay.    Perhaps this is an appropriate

                              place to to deal with the role of

                              the EASTWOODS who are your Consulting
 MACKRELL               GRAHAM HENRY


                                Engineers.   Can you tell me about

                                their, your understanding of their

                                terms of reference?

             MACKRELL           Sure.   Their terms of reference are

                               basically as the advisors to the

                               Company on safety, on safe, ongoing

                               safety matters, and obviously for

                               capital projects that are required

                               at the Club, some of which obviously

                               are consequential to safety matters.
            DSU61              I see.   The role of EASTWOODS, in

                               actual fact if you could refer to your

                               I think it's in that book (let's just

                               have a look at this). If you could

                               refer to this document, this document.

                               This is a, for the audio tape, this is
27.21                          a copy of Dr EASTWOOD'S transcript,

                               Day 27, Page 66, that we're referring

                               to.   At the top of that page ...
            MACKRELL          Mn.
27.33       DSU61             the transcript reads, and we say

                              this is to Dr EASTWOOD, can I now

                              turn to something a little

                              different, you were the Consultant

                              for safety, this is referring

                              obviously to Sheffield Wednesday

                              Football Club, and he answers, 'No.

                              no'. Another question somebody

                              repeats, 'No', and he replies, 'A

                   Consulting Engineer helping with

                   safety matters'. He goes on them, the

                   question is, put back to him, 'Yes I

                   am sorry it was not your remit, as it

                  were to wander round and round and

                  cane up with suggestions' answer,

                   'No'.   He then goes on, 'Let us

                  suppose that you have been taken by

                  the Club Secretary and shown the

                  Leppings Lane end, and supposing

                  he said to you, Dr EASTWOOD, we are

                  a little concerned, we have just

                  been to a ground abroad where there

                  are vast spaces around, round the

                  stadium.   We are very worried about

                  this area, where there is a narrow

                  restricted entrance to the ground,

                 would you then have considered it

                 within your remit to think up ways in

                 which the turnstile areas could be

                 made safer or would that have been

                 outside your ccmpetance and remit'

                 and Dr EASTWOOD replied to that,

                 'I didn't, I did do that with four

                 schemes' and in fact the questioning

                 does go on but the the point that I

                 want to put to you Mr MACKRELL is, is

                 that your understanding of Mr

                               role so far as the Club is

                               concerned?
 29.06      MACKRELL          Well I, you know, I I can't quite

                              understand the great difference

                              with the Consultant for Safety

                              or the difference between the

                              Consulting Engineer helped in

                              the safety matters, I think it's a,

            DSU61             ... ?
 29.18      MACKRELL          However, Dr, as I understood it,

                              Dr EASTWOOD and EASTWOOD and

                              Partners were responsible to the

                             the local Authority is from

                             EASTWOOD and Partners as opposed

                             to the Company Secretary whoever

29.46                        of tune, EASTWOODS were responsible

                             testing, the confirmation that

                             certain regular, the regular
 MBCKRELL              GRAHAM HENRY


                               inspections have been dealt with.
 30.00      MACKRELL           Following on from that, the

                               annual inspection that was taken,

                               undertaken by the Local Authority,

                              any points that were drawn up fran

                              that, EASTWOODS would actually

                              monitor on the Club's behalf.
            DSU61             Yeah.   If we can sort of go back

                              over that, I appreciate that they

                              were there, at the bi-annual

                              inspections initially and that

                              more recently they became annual

                              inspections.
            MACKRELL          Mm.

            DSU61             And that during those inspections

                              which were attended by members of

                              the Officer Working Party, your

                              Advisory Group.   And yourselves,

                              and EASTWOODS, they they vrould and

                              they would advise as necessary but

                             on work that was being proposed, but

                             the point that I'm, I'm trying to
30.48                        get to is, would they have advised

                             you, where you didn't week advice,

                             in another words, did they take a,

                             an active role or a pro-active role,

                             would they, for example, have pointed

                             out that the barrier configur...,

                             would you have expected than to point
 MACKRELL               GRAHAM HENRY


                                out the barrier confirguation wasn't

                                as it should be, in accordance with

                                the Green Guide?
             MACKRELL          Well I can only say, obviously, the

                               barrier configuration was set prior

                               to I joined the Company and I 'm you

                               know more aware of the fact that

                               there was annual inspections from,

                               with the Local Authority and as a

                               result of that the the Green Guide is

                               a guide as such.    And the configur­

                               ation of the barriers, to use an

                               example as you did there, is, was, was

                               accepted by the Local Authority and

                               not canmented upon by the Local

                               Authority.
            DSU61              Right, I don't want to go again

                               into that in too much detail.
            MACKRELL           Mn.

31.44       DSU61             At this point but, would you

                              generally speaking now, would you

                              have expected EASTWOODS as your

                              advisors to have advised you where

                              your ground, or any part of your

                              ground, didn't accord with what

                              was laid down in the Green Guide?

                              And I accept the Green Guide

                              isn't mandatory?
        MACKRELL              No, sure.     I think, I I I I say
 MACKRELL              GRAHAM HENRY


                               yes, but with a qualified yes

                               obviously after their negotiations

                               or conversations with the Local

                              Authority, as the Licensing

                              Authority.
             DSU61            But that they, they're not

                              employed, EASTWOODS are not

                              employed by the Local Authority.
            MACKRELL          No.

            DSU61             They're employed by you or the

                              Club, you and the Club.
            MACKRELL          Yeah.
32.23       DSU61             They relate direct to you, and they

                              are the people that you presumably

                              would depend upon for technical

                              advice?

            MACKRELL          That's correct.
            DSU61             They and possible Mr ADDY, from what

                              you say, depending upon what you're

                              dealing with?

            MACKRELL         Yeah.
32.37       DSU61            You'd obviously have some knowledge

                             of the Green Guide yourself, again

                             I'll cone to this later, but, what I'm

                             getting at is, ap... with these

                             inspections that were held, for

                             example, by the Local Authority.    At

                             those inspections would you have

                             expected EASTWOODS or, I mean it
 MACKRELL               GRAHAM HENRY


                                wouldn't necessarily be EASTWOODS,

                                I'm talking about EASTWOODS as a

                                company.

             MACKRELL           Yeah.

             DSU61             Not specifically Dr EASTWOOD.
            MACKRELL           Yes.

            DSU61              When I'm saying EASTWOODS, would

                               you have expected their

                               representative to say to you,

                               well this part, this part of the

                               ground doesn't accord with the

                               Green Guide, but it's okay, we

                               can, you know, it it's, it is the

                               Working Party are aware of it,

                               and we can___
            MACKRELL           I would have expected to have been

                               advised to look at it, yes, I think

                               these sort of issues, yes.
            DSU61             You would have been.    So, if we can

                              summarize then the role of,

                              EASTWOOD'S role.    You regard them

                              as what?
33.34   MACKRELL              I regard them as the Consulting

                              Engineers who handle our affairs,

        DSU61                 I see.    As, coming beck to

                                just mentioned.

 34.04       DSU61             Generally how did you, how did you

                               liaise with EASTWOODS?    I appreciate

                               that they attended the inspection.
            MACKRELL           Mn.

            DSU61              We've already mentioned that.     How

                               would you liaise with them, over

                               safety matters?
34.16       MACKRELL           Well by telephone, by correspondence

                               I think there is, in the in the

                               records I have unlike treasury

                               documents they were obviously copies

                               of telephone conversations I had with

                               EASTWOODS and correspondence I had

                              with EASTWOODS.
            DSU61             Yeah.    Would they ccme to the ground,

                              they...

            MACKRELL          Yeah.
            DSU61             One of the members of staff or Mr

                              EASTWOOD cone to the ground?
34.46       MACKRELL          Yeah they are, they're often at

                              the ground, they because in their

                              role as Consulting Engineers,

                              they're obviously at the ground
 MACKRELL              GRAHAM HENRY


                               by way of monitoring works that

                               are done.

             DSU61            Again we, you've already mentioned

                               the Officer Working Group and the

                              Advisory Working Party as it later

                              became.      I mean how, how would you

                              liaise with them, you'd be present

                              part of the time I know when they

                              carry out these inspections?
            MACKRELL          Yes, but it was impossible to

                              actually be present all the time

                              because they departed to all, all

                              parts round the stadium.
            DSU61             Yes, so would you make a point of

                              being there when, when they were

                              carrying out these inspections?
            MACKRELL          I'd made the point that...
            DSU61             As long as possible.
            MACKRELL          Of, being, of being there obviously

                             but you... as a result of those

                              inspections letters were written by

                             the local Authority, based upon

                             reports received from the various

                             constituent parts of the Advisory

                             Group.   Pointing the matters out, to

                             the, to the, to the Club.
35.34   DSU61                So at these inspections, you get the

                             Police, Fire, the Building Surveyors

                             Department...
 MACKRELL              GRAHAM HENRY


            MACKRELL           That's right.

            DSU61              frcm the Council, those sort of

                               people?

            MACKRELL          That's right.
            DSU61             You'd be there, Mr EASTWOOD would be

                              there, Dr EASTWDOD would be there...
            MACKRELL          Yeah.

            DSU61             or somebody frcm his staff.

            MACKRELL          Yeah.
            DSU61             They'd depart around to look at

                              different areas of the ground.
            MACKRELL          Min.

            DSU61             You'd be there and or a member of

                              your staff.

            MACKRELL          I would be there, they'd have a

                              member of my staff particularly

                              there to may be unlock areas,

                              caretaker person.   I would be there

                              really as a point of reference should

                              they wish to, kind of, clarify any­

                             thing or any any particular.     The
36.03                        Police on the annual inspections were

                             very very much there almost in a

                             courtesy aspect because they, they'd

                             policed the stadium on thirty times

                             a season, they really didn't need to

                             to wander, to wander around.     I think

                             it was really they were there almost

                             in the same brief as I was.
 MACKRELL               GRAHAM HENRY


             DSU61              Yeah.   Can you recall at any of

                                those meetings whether this

                                configuration of barriers or anything

                                like that was ever brought up...
             MACKRELL          Never brought up.
             DSU61             in your time in office?
             MACKRELL          No, no it was never brought up in

                               my time whatsoever.
 36.35       DSU61             What about seme of the, some of the

                               other things, the elevation in

                               the tunnel?
            MACKRELL           No.

            DSU61              Width of perimeter fences?
            MACKRELL           Not at all, no.

            DSU61              Nothing like that?
            MACKRELL           No.

            DSU61              So then, if they'd got something

                               seme work that they wanted carrying

                               out, would, who would actually come

                               to you, frcm the Working Party.

                              Would it___

            MACKRELL          Normally it would be in a letter...
            DSU61             or frcm the Advisory Group?
            MACKRELL          which would I think it was drafted
37.00                         by David BOWNES but it may have

                              ccme out in somebody else's

                              signature.

         DSU61                Yeah.

         MACKRELL             It may have ccme out under Roger
 MACKRELL              GRAHAM HENRY


                               PENSAM'S signature, as frcm the

                               Legal and Admin...

             DSU61             Yeah.

            MACKRELL           department of the Local Authority.
 37.12      DSU61             What would actually happen then,

                               the, they would identify something

                              that needed to be done, let's

                              supposing it's a crush barrier that

                              needs to be rewelded or something

                              like that?

            MACKRELL          Sure.

            DSU61             That would be discussed and

                              presumably if you were present they

                              would mention it to you that that

                              needs a new strap on it?
            MACKRELL          Yes but ...

            DSU61             Something like that yeah?
            MACKRELL          Obviously something along that

                              level, they would put in writing to

                              me.

            DSU61             They'd, but they would, would you

                              discuss it first, you'd probably know

                              about it would you?
37.37       MACKRELL         Poss, possibility, you know they,

                             they'd obviously were certain, if they

                             were going, literally if we had the

                             Health and Consumer Services, when

                             you're talking about those, some­

                             times there were six chaps frcm
 MACKRELL               GRAHAM HENRY


                                Health and Consumer Services turned

                                up frcm the Local Authority...
             DSU61              Yes.

             MACKRELL          Who kind of spread all over the

                               stadium, so there's no physical

                               way one could monitor everything,

                               that was, that was happening.
37.53        DSU61             And they wouldn't ccme back to you

                               and necessarily to say, this needs

                               doing, that surface is dangerous,

                               this is the case?
            MACKRELL           No.

            DSU61              They would go away.
            MACKRELL           They would go away, write a report.
            DSU61              And then you'd get a report back

                               frcm, through Mr BCWNES, or through

                               the...

            MACKRELL          Yes, that's right.
            DSU61              the Admin and Legal Services

                              Department.
            MACKRELL          That's right yes.
38.10       DSU61             So then you would would, you would

                              act on it.    Were there ever any

                              occasions when work that they wanted

                              carried out you were in dispute over

                              generally or, can you recall?
        MACKRELL              I can't recall, I I, on a couple of

                              minor matters you might have

                              been the opinion they were being a
 MACKRELL              GRAHAM HENRY


                               bit pedantic on one or two things,

                               because there is an element maybe

                               that to choose things you've always

                               got on every inspection something like

                               so many seats are loose in certain

                              areas.     Well you know that is an

                              ongoing situation the moment they are

                              the moment they are tightened up

                              there's three down the row that are

                              loose and it happens on a, on a

                              regular basis and so it's a thing

                              that's almost handled under normal

                              housekeeping basis.
38.53       DSU61             Mm.     You mentioned earlier about the

                              Police attendance and the fact

                              that they were there at thirty odd

                              matches a year anyway and so really

                              they were, I think your words were

                              courtesy?
            MACKRELL          Mn.
39.06       DSU61             Did they not take any involvement,

                              any direct involvement, presumably

                             this is Inspector CALVERT is it or?
39.13       MACKRELL          It was Inspector CALVERT on a

                             basis, but of, the Police were

                             there on a very regular basis.     The

                             Police wouldn't just ccme on match

                             days, the Police would ccme and see

                             me and discuss other things and
 MACKRELL               GRAHAM HENRY


                                other odds and ends, so it wasn't

                                really as relevant and the Police

                                spent more time at the ground

                                that any other constituent member

                               of the Advisory Group.

             DSU61              In policing the ground?

             MACKRELL          No in, in actually caning to look

                               at things, have a look around,

                               discuss, discuss things, not

                               necessarily just operational

                               things, procedural matters and

                               things like that.
39.38        DSU61             Would they cone to you to discuss

                               safety bits, safety matters

                               generally?

            MACKRELL           Yeah.

            DSU61              Would they have brought safety

                               matters to you.

            MACKRELL           Yes there was, there was a

                               situation that occurred I belive

                               it was in the first closed season

                               when there was a request to add

                              Gate number 7 at the bottom of

                              the...
39.58       DSU61             For the audio Mr MACKRELL is

                              talking about the Gate 7 into

                              the North West Terrace.

            MACKRELL          That's correct.

            DSU61             I see.

             MACKRELL           And at the same time there was over

                                the top of the tunnel that came down

                                into the centre of the West Stand,

                               there were, there were a few

                               brackets that were bolted with

                               spikes on to stop people climbing

                               and in fact the Police felt that

                               they were, and in fact an inducement

                               to people to climb, it gave them an

                               opportunity to people if they wanted

                               to climb up to actually do that and

                               they asked for those to be removed

                               as well.
            DSU61              So what we're talking about Mr

                               MACKRELL here, we're talking about

                               on the back end.
            MACKRELL           No. (Overtalking)
            DSU61             Back end.
            MACKRELL          No at the front, front on, front edge.
            DSU61             Out onto the, on the pitch side.
            MACKRELL          That's right, on the, yes on the

                              pitch side around in Gates,

                              Pens 3, 4.
            DSU61             For the audio Mr MACKRELL is

                              referring to the pitch side of
41.00                         the tunnel under the West Stand.

                              If we can move on again Mr MACKRELL.

                              As the Club Secretary and Safety

                              Officer you presumably examined the
 MACKRELL               GRAHAM HENRY


                                Club files on the Hillsborough

                                Stadium following your appointment

                                in 1986 (000086).   Is that correct?
             MACKRELL           Correct.

             DSU61             Can you tell me when this was

                               that you examined them?
             MACKRELL           It was the early part of 87 (000087)

                               I joined around Christmas just the

                               week before Christmas in 1986 (000086)

                               and it was in the early months of

                               87 (000087) I was obviously

                               ploughing my way through them.

                               There's a lot, there's a lot to

                               get your feet under the table and

                               when I found this when I say it was

                               in the file it wasn't hidden, but

                               when I came upon the Safety

                               Certificate, it obviously was a

                               Safety Certificate that was issued

                              by South Yorkshire County Council.
            DSU61             Mn.

41.50       MACKRELL           I contacted EASTWOODS and I think

                              I spoke to John STRANGE who is on

                              the basis is is this the current

                              safety certificate and because

                              obviously it was the current

                              safety certificate, there had been

                              fundamental alterations to the

                              ground that that hadn't been
MACKRELL           GRAHAM HENRY


                           amended under the Safety Certificate

                           and I wondered if it had been

                           amended by way of correspondence

                           or whatever.
           DSU61          Mn.     In fact this, there is a

                          copy of the next document in your

                          bundle, next but one, is the

                          Safety Certificate Mr MACKRELL.

                          Reference 55, the Safety

                          Certificate, if I can refer you

                          to Schedule 3, which deals with

                          the capacity.    Referring to the

                          West Stand, the capacity is

                          shown as four thousand four

                          hundred and sixty five, the West

                          Terrace seven thousand two hundred,

                         and the North West Terrace two

                         thousand nine hundred.     The total

                         capacity of the ground is shown

                         as fifty thousand one hundred and

                         seventy four.
        MACKRELL         Mn.
        DSU61            Is that correct?     (Buzzer)
        MACKRELL         Sorry, that was...
        DSU61            Can I, go on...
        MACKRELL         That was, that was correct under

                         the terms obviously my my

                         certificate is certainly the same
 MACKRELL              GRAHAM HENRY


                               as that, but it was obvioulsy

                               fundamental that since I joined

                               the Club, that the Spion Kop had

                              been extended.

             DSU61            Yes.
 43.24      MACKRELL          And as a result of that, the

                              capacity for the Spion Kop

                              by way of correspondence that was

                              on file between EASTWOODS and the

                              local Authority showed that the

                              capacity on the Kop was twenty

                              one thousand.

            DSU61             Twenty one thousand.   No that's

                              fair enough, I understand where,

                              what you're saying there.     I

                              think this is probably an

                              appropriate point to adjourn

                              the interview while we change

                              the tapes and then we'll resume

                              from where we are.   Okay?

            MACKRELL          Right.

00.10       DSU61            Yes the time now is twenty five

                             minutes to two (1335) and the

                             interview with Mr MACKRELL is

                             resuming.   The same persons

                             are present in the room as were

                              before the tape run out, about the

                              crowd capacity and you were

                              saying I believe that you

                             picked this up at or shortly

                             after the time that you arrived

                             at the Club and you recognised

                             that the capacity in the Spion

                             Kbp at the ground which had had

                             alterations done to it, didn't

                             appear, the Safety Certificate

                             didn't appear to reflect those

                             alterations, in that they

                             weren't increased to twenty one

                             thousand.   Presumably you noted

                             at the same time that you were

                             looking at the West Terrace

                             which is what I'm particulary

                             interested in, the capacity was

                             seven thousand two hundred and

                             that there were no capacities,

                             no separate capacities for

                            each of the pens on that

                            terrace?

           MACKRELL         Yeah.

           DSU61            Was that a matter that created

                            any sort of problems in your

                            mind, any, any, did it cause

                            you any concern at all, when you,

                            when you took over the job?

 MACKRELL               GRAHAM HENRY


 01.34       MACKRELL           I contacted EASTWOODS just to

                                clarify the situation on

                                capacities, because we had a

                                cormunication from the Football

                               Association to complete...
             DSU61             Yes.

            MACKRELL           which obviously required some

                               capacities that could have been

                               relied upon and that was

                               obviously, you know, that was,

                               that was why I contacted EASTWOOD

                               and Partners.

            DSU61              Yes. Is this the conversation

                               that you're referring to I

                               think           actually made the

                               enquiry on your behalf.
            MACKRELL           Yes, that's right on my behalf

                               that's right.    (Overtalking)
            DSU61              And this is the memo's in

                               actual fact.
            MACKRELL           I think they're copies of

                               telephone conversations...
            DSU61              That's right, if you can refer, for

                              the audio, to Director of Public
02.20                         Prosecutions, Document Numbers 72

                              and 73, they're slightly out of

                              sequence, cause you've gone out

                              of sequence ...

         MACKRELL             Right     ?
MACKRELL               GRAHAM HENRY


            DSU61              Okay.    You've obviously seen

                               these (fades away).
            MACKRELL           Yeah.

            DSU61              two memorandums of telephone

                              messages before and in in fact

                              what you're talking about is the

                              bit at the bottom of the page,

                              that, does that, is that the

                              one that arises as a result

                              of the query by the FA?
           MACKRELL           It's not a query by the way.
           DSU61              Or is this a query that you raised

                              on your own behalf?
03.00      MACKRELL           Well I raised the one subsequent

                              about the actual Safety Certificate.

                              This was, came as a result of

                              completing the form which I

                              refer to from the FA, regarding

                              capacities.    That's because it

                              refers to other matters like

                              locks, readings of floodlights.
           DSU61             Yeah.

           MACKRELL           It's a standard form which clubs

                             have to complete each year to send

                             in to the Football Association and

                             obviously we're looking for

                             confirmation on these figures from

                             them.

        DSU61                Yeah.     As a result of that query
 MACKRELL              GRAHAM HENRY


                               that, that was raised, the reply

                               that you got back from EASTWOODS,

                               not specifically Dr EASTWOOD, but

                               I think it, seems to suggest that

                              he was spoken to.

            MACKRELL          Mn.
 03.36      DSU61             And then the reply given by a

                              member of his staff to you, was

                              that providing the gates, providing

                              the police had the gates under the

                              West Stand open, so that people

                              can distribute themselves throughout

                              the terraces, there was no problem

                              with the capacities remaining.

                              Is that your understanding of

                              the situation?
            MACKRELL          Yes.

            D5U61             Did that not cause you, give you

                              any cause for concern, or were you

                             happy to accept that?
04.04       MACKRELL         Well obviously the situation had

                             been licensed by the Local

                             Authority, Dr EASTWOOD had had,

                             Dr EASTWOOD had handled the ground

                             for a long time, I'd only been at

                             the Club for under three, under

                             three months there and obviously

                             I accepted their their professional

                             advice.

 04.23     DSU61              I see, so you, you really are

                              taking it that the, so far as the

                              capacity is concerned that the

                              barrier configurations, tunnel

                              elevations, gate widths, elevation

                             on the terraces, all these sorts

                             of things had been considered by

                             both the Working Party or the

                             Advisory Group, had also been

                             considered by EASTWOODS.    There

                             was a lot of technical professional

                             people on those and and you actually

                             tend to accept EASTWOODS advice?
           MACKRELL          Yeah.

           DSU61             Given that they'd been involved

                             I think since 1978 (000078)?
           MACKRELL          That's, that's correct.
05.01      DSU61             Can you, it's probably an appropriate

                             point actually to mention to take

                             EASTWOODS role a little bit further

                            we we talked about it a short time

                             ago but, was there ever any kind,

                             is there any sort of written contract

                            between you and EASTWOODS?    Have

                            you ever, are there any sort of

                            terms of reference or work desc...

                            jobs description type of thing

                            in being as far as you're aware,

                            between the Club and EASTWOODS as
MACKRELL              GRAHAM HENRY


                              to what their role is?

           MACKRELL           I believe there was when the

                              initial setting up of the safety

                              of Sports Grounds Act was about

                             was about to be set up.
           DSU61             Yes.

           MACKRELL          Obviously when the Club became a

                             designated Club under the terms of

                             that act.     But subsequent to that

                             I, there hasn't been an ongoing

                             matter of actual record.
05.47      DSU61             Do you consider that that contract

                             or what ever you want to call it

                             still held good in 1979 (000079)

                             prior to the disaster?
           MACKRELL          1989    (000089).
           DSU61             Sorry 1989 (000089).
           MACKRELL          Yeah, yeah.
           DSU61             I'm sorry.

           MACKRELL          I I do obviously became of the fact

                             the way in that they particularly

                             led on if one is to read the files,

                             they led on certain matters with the

                            local Authority, by taking, by

                            acting on, on our behalf, often

                            without taking actual points of

                            reference back to myself because

                            obviously they were the technical

                            experts ...
MACKRELL                 GRAHAM HENRY


            DSU61                Yes.

            MACKRELL             they knew about matters of, you

                                 know, flow, flow of ext... of

                                 spectators and things like this

                                 obviously had greater technical

                                knowledge.

            DSU61               Can you refer me to the, to that

                                document in 1978 (000078)?
           MACKRELL             Em.

           DSU61                Presumably that's what you're

                                trying to find is it Mr O'CALLAGHAN?
           MACKRELL             Yeh there was, there was a ...

                                (Overtalking)

           O'CALLAGHAN          There was a reference if I remember

                                in the minutes and there was also

                                a...

           MACKRELL             Letter.

           O'CALLAGHAN          an exchange of letters.
           DSU61                Is that, was that referred to at

                                any time during the Inquiry, the

                                TAYU3R Inquiry, the document at

                                all?

           O'CALLAGHAN          The document was in I don't recall

                                it being specifically referred to,

                                the document was certainly in the

                                core bundle...

           DSU61                In your core bundle to the TAYLOR

                                Inquiry?

           O'CALLAGHAN         No I think in the treasury core.
 MACKRELL                 GRAHAM HENRY


             MACKRELL            I believe it's in the Treasury

                                  Room.

             DSU61               Yeah, that's the same thing.

            MACKRELL             Sorry.

            DSU61                Yeah.

 07.04      O'CALLAGHAN          There is a letter the 1st of

                                 December 1978 (011278), there

                                 were two people considered as

                                 it appears from the minutes, Dr

                                 EASTWOOD was appointed and there

                                 was a letter of the 1st December

                                 1978 (011278), which confirms

                                 that appointment.

            DSU61               i see, can I...

            O'CALLAGHAN         Yes of course.

                             that that encompassed what we

                             discussed earlier that that they



                             should have perhaps given you

                             advice where the ground didn't

                             conform to the Green Guide and

                             advised you as to whether any work

                             was necessary in regard to that?
09.40      MACKRELL          Well obviously the point of contact

                             this is long before my time, but one

                             would looks at the situation under

                             the terms of the Green Guide to be

                             negotiate with the Local Authority

                             on our behalf which was actually

                            which was done on a great deal,

                            on a great number of occasions.

                                    handed me a letter dated the 1st

                                    of December 1978 (011278) which is

                                    from the Club to South Yorkshire

                                    County Council which confirms that

                                    EASTWOOD and Partners would be

                                    acting on behalf of the Club in

                                    their application for a certificate

                                    Act.     Okay I think that deals

                                    with the situation, if we can just

                                    keep those separate.    As far as

                                    those letters are concerned Mr

                                    MACKRELL, obviously you would

                                    read through the, you've already

                                    talked about, that's what we

                                   were talking about it at the time,

                                   you'd obviously go through the

                                   file, the Club files, and those

                                   no doubt would be on the Club's

                                   copy of the files as far as the

                                   originals are concerned.




                                                                               774
MACKRELL                 GRAHAM HENRY


            MACKRELL             That's right.   I was aware of that
11.14                            obviously that the, that Dr

                                 EASTWOOD was acting on our

                                 behalf and correspondence he had

                                 he often led in to the Local

                                Authority and obviously it was

                                 implicit the other way because

                                often when the Local Authority

                                would write to me, they would

                                automatically copy to Dr EASTWOOD.

           DSU61                Yes.    Oh I see, that ..., that

                                explains something to me, yes.

                                Okay.   We talked, sorry ...

           O'CALLAGHAN          I wonder whether I should also

                                simply mention in relation to a

                                comment you made earlier.     The

                                one of the early meetings between

                                the Officer Working Party and the

                                Club, Dr EASTWOOD was present,
11.53                           and there is actually specific

                                reference in those minutes to the

                                fact that it was recognised that

                                entrances, exits, gangways etc

                                were not one hundred per cent in

                                keeping with the guidelines.    So

                                all parties including the, the

                                Working Party and Dr EASTWOOD

                                recognised that at an early stage.
           DSU61                Right, can you refer me to the date
 MACKRELL                  GRAHAM HENRY


                                   of the Working Party?

             O'CALLAGHAN           Yes, certainly, it was...
             DSU61                 Minutes?

             O'CALLAGHAN           it was a meetings, minutes of a

                                  meeting at Hillsborough Stadium

                                  Sheffield on the 13th of December

                                   1978 (131278).

            DSU61                 So that's before it's actually

                                  licensed?

            O'CALLAGHAN           Yes.     This was in the initial

                                  application for a certificate.
            DSU61                 Mm.     Did they resolve what they

                                  were going to do about it,

                                  within those minutes?
            O'CALLAGHAN           My understanding from having spoken

                                  to Dr EASTWOOD on these, on this

                                  subject in the past, is that the

                                  the guide was always recognised

                                  as a guide.
            DSU61                 Yes.

12.42       O'CALLAGHAN           Not as a statutory certainty

                                  as it were, and not something that

                                 had to be complied with in terms

                                 of the absolute strict level of

                                 the law.     He has views for

                                 example in relation to the height

                                 of barriers which don't accord

                                 with those in the Guide.    He

                                 believes his views ...
MACKRELL              GRAHAM HENRY


            DSU 61            That's alright.

                              Are better but it was clearly

                              recognised there are two, two

                              references to it in the meeting that

                             there were aspects of the ground

                             which didn't comply and they put at

                             one hundred per cent of the Guide.
13.08      DSU61             Yeah, well the Guide, I mean the

                             Guide as you say is not mandatory

                             it's also there, it talks about

                             reasonable safety, and that's

                             obviously what he's, what he's depend-

                             in on.

           MACKRELL          Yes.

           DSU61             But if, i'll accept what you're saying

                             we, we can perhaps move on from from

                             that area for the moment.   In reading

                             the files that you had Mr MACKRELL,

                             on the Hillsborough Stadium, can you
13.35                        recall seeing correspondence dealing

                             with the crushing incidents that

                             are alleged to have taken place in

                             1981 (000081), 1987 (000087) and

                             1988 (000088)?
           MACKRELL         No, only the one in nineteen eighty

                            eighty one (000081) was only by way

                            of of reference to me, I can't even

                            remember who mentioned it to me,

                                documents to study at that time.
             DS61               I see.    if I can refer you to the

                                a letter which was sent by your

                               predecessor I think, Mr ENGLAND?
             MACKRELL          Yeah.

                               which relates to crushing, crushing

                               and injuries in the West Stand

                               11th of April 1981 (110481).
            MACKRELL           Yeah.

            DSU61              Can you recall actually seeing

                               that letter?

            MACKRELL           I can't recall seeing the letter

                               but I was, I had it referred to me.
            DSU61              After the disaster, or before the

                               disaster, can you recall?
            MACKRELL           I'm afraid I can't on this occasion,

                               I I I believe it was after, after

                               the situation.
            DSU61             After the disaster?

            MACKRELL          Yeah.

            DSU61             I see.     If we move on from there

                              aware that paragraph 3 of that letter,

                              I think it is, sorry paragraph 2,

                             as you were, paragraph 2, refers to

                             the crushing in the Leppings Lane,

                             and overcrowding.     Have, have you

                             of the letter which I mean it talks

                             about the capacities that are laid

                             down for the ground and in particular

                             the capacities for the North West

                             that actually had been copied through

            DSU61              No, you're quite right, it did in

                               fact go to the Council but not, it's

                               not marked up.   If you can refer to

                              crushing in 1981 (000081) Mr MACKRELL.
            MACKRELL          Yeah.

                              So far as I can see this is not a DPP

                              Document for the audio but it's a
17.03                         letter, say, from from South Yorkshire

                              Police to Mr McGEE, Item B of that

                              letter talks about Leppings Lane

                              and it not being constructed to give

                              maximum aid to packing and the

MACKRELL              GRAHAM HENRY


17.50                         that Document does in fact refer

                              to crushing which occurred at the

                              Leppings Lane end of the ground in

                              1981 (000081), and goes on to say

                             making it more comfortable, it

                             being the terraces, presumably,

                             should be looked into.   Now that

                             Document is signed by Mr MsGEE.

                             Presumably, well the the Board minute

                             is pre, predates the letter to the

                             to Mr McGEE, but presumably both

                             those Documents would be on the

                             Football Club files?
18.28      MACKRELL          They should have been on the

                             Football Club, I'm not saying

                             they're not, I had, I didn't have

                             a copy of the correspondence, from

                             obviously one looks at the situation

                             at there'd been.   Mr ENGLAND was

                             Secretary at that time, who retired

                             in 84 (000084), Mr CHESTER was then

                            Secretary for a period of three

                            years, before I took over.   I have

                            not seen this document until after

                            the events.

           DSU61            I see. So, I mean, how how much of

                            an examination of the files would

                            you have carried out?
MACKRELL               GRAHAM HENRY


18.59       MACKRELL           I did an examination but quite

                               honestly an examination may not

                               have gone back, it got some of the

                               relevant documents was, were there,

                               but when one looks at it, I think

                               is transpired as a result of these

                               investigations, certain things have

                              happened like EASTWOODS had seme of

                              my copies of documents and it's been

                              an amalgam of the, of them both.     It

                              may be that this might have been

                              held personally by Mr MsGEE but it

                              wasn't something which I had a

                              copy of.

           DSU61              When we're talking about these

                              files, what what are we actually

                              talking about in terms of volume,

                              I mean are we talking about one

                              sort of...

           MACKRELL           We're talking about I would think

                              antici..., we're talking about

                              filing, filing cabinets, virtually

                              equivalent probably to a filing

                              cabinet full.
           DSU61             One filing cabinet four drawer

                             full.

           MACKRELL          That, I would anticipate that.

                             Because obviously if one's talking

                             about the correspondence that goes
MACKRELL              GRAHAM HENRY


                              for a simple, thing like roofing the

                              Kop.   You're talking about a massive

                              amount of correspondence by way of

                              tender documents and plans and

                              drawings and revisions to same

                             and such.
20.01      DSU61             I mean you obviously went through

                             the Safety Certificate...
           MACKRELL          Yeah.

           DSU61             you've talked about that?
           MACKRELL          Yeah.

           DSU61             And raising queries in fact from

                             it?

           MACKRELL          Yeah.

           DSU61             What I'm, what I'm really getting
20.14                        at is, seeing if you'd seen seme

                             of this or were aware of this

                             crushing in 1981 (000081)...
           MACKRELL          No.

           DSU61             Would that have sort of flagged

                             up to you that there, there was,

                             there had been previous problems,

                            but that that was an area that may

                            need to be looked at in the future

                            so far as you're concerned, and

                            again I'm thinking about your

                            role as the Safety Officer here.
        MACKRELL            Yeah.

        DSU61               You see, you've got, you've got
 MACKRELL               GRAHAM HENRY


                                a role which is laid down quite

                                clearly.

             MACKRELL           Yeah sure.      You're actually

                                obviously talking, having not seen

                                it, one could, I was in a situation

                               where this happened five and a half

                               years prior to I joined the Company.
             DSU61             I accept that.
 20.52      MACKRELL           As a, and as a result of that I think

                               it would be reasonable to assume on

                               a personal basis that items that

                               had transpired on that, had been

                               dealt with to the satisfaction of of

                               the relevant parties.
            DSU61              Mn.     If you had of seen them do you

                               think it would of, would of flagged

                               up a warning sort of in the back of

                               your brain would then, this is an

                               area I've got to keep an eye on.

                               That type of thing?

            MACKRELL           I can only conjecture on that, I can't

                               really state categorically from that

                               situation, I can only really see it

                              as I have seen it at the Club.
            DSU61             Mn.    I see.     Can we perhaps move on

                              to the next Document then Mr

                              MACKRELL.       For the audio, this is
21.36                         DPP Document 48, which is a report

                              dated the 30th of April 1981 (300481)
MACKRELL   GRAHAM HENRY                                    70


                   from Chief Superintendent HAROLD, I

                   think it's HAROLD, it may be HERALD,

                   of the South Yorkshire Police to his

                   Assistant Chief Constable, paragraph

                   4 of that, and I appreciate that it

                   is a Police camtunication so it won't

                   be on your files, I hope.   Paragraph

                   4 of that refers to the crushing

                   that took place on the West Stand and

                   the, the report reads, 'I've informed

                   Mr ENGLAND that our consensus view

                   is that the ten thousand one hundred

                   crowd figure specified in the Safety

22.18              Certificate is too high.'

                   Understandably he refutes this and

                   defends the position by stating that

                   the former capacity prior to the

                   implementation of the Safety of

                   Sports Ground Act, at Hillsborough

                   in December 1979 (001279) was

                   eleven thousand one hundred, and

                   that on a number of occasions in

                   previous all ticket matches the

                   terracings had acconmodated that

                   number.   Certainly at the 1980

                   (000080) Semi-Final when we had again

                   again had a capacity of fifty

                   thousand one hundred and seventy

                   four, he also had some hundreds of




                                                                785
MACKRELL               GRAHAM HENRY


                               forged tickets and he goes on to

                               talk about the forged tickets.     Was

                               that information reflected in the

                               files that are held by the Club and

                               I'm sorry to keep having to...

            MACKRELL           No sure I can't, well I can't, I

                               can't obviously if I can't, I didn't

                               see one, I didn't really see the

                              correspondence that related to the

                               1981 (000081) crushing.    I assume
23.16                         obviously and from reading of that

                              if the Police had thought

                              particularly strongly on the subject

                              it would have been raised with the

                              Advisory Group when one's talking

                              about the capacities as set down on

                              the Safety Certificate.
           DSU61              Unfortunately I mean, they, they do

                              appear to have written to the then

                              Council controlling the Group about

                              the safety capacity, sorry in the

                              crowd capacity in the West terrace

                              being too high, that's as far as they

                              were concerned, within the certificate,

                              but unfortunately the matter doesn't

                             appear to have been pursued then by

                             either party.   You, you're saying

                             you're not aware of that?
           MACKRELL          I wasn't aware of that obviously,
 MACKRELL                 GRAHAM HENRY


                                  I have been aware of it subsequent

                                  to the events of 15th of April 1989

                                  (150489).
            DSU61                Are you - sorry Mr MACKRELL?
 24.07      O'CALLAGHAN           I know, I was going to conment that

                                  I noticed that there was a a meeting

                                 at the stadium of the Officer Working

                                 Party on the 8th June when Mr HERALD

                                 was present among others, and there

                                 isn't any mention of anything

                                 raised at the minutes of that meeting.
            DSU61                This is June nineteen?

            O'CALLAGHAN          End of June 81 (000081).
            DSU61                I mean presumably this, this

                                 recorded date of the 30th of

                                 April, obviously it was dealt

                                 with preceeding that date, even

                                 according to the Board report, the

                                 Board minutes I should say, not the

                                 Board report.   It was dealt with,

                                was being dealt with very quickly

                                 after, if the, if the Sami-Final

                                was on the 11th of April

                                 (interruption) it may well not be

                                the case, you know, that they dealt

                                with it then. (Pause)

                                and I do accept that the evidence
 MACKRELL               GRAHAM HENRY


                                in regard to that crushing is

                                fairly tenuous.
             MACKRELL           Yeah.
 25.10       DSU61              It comprises basically of a

                               couple of letters from supporters

                               saying that they were crushed and

                               some statements from supporters in

                               particular areas on the West Tterrace

                               and of course that's after the

                               disaster had taken place anyway.
            MACKRELL           Yeah.

            DSU61              You were actually in appointment

                               at the Club at that time...
            MACKRELL           Correct.    Yes.
            DSU61              and I know it was put to you at the,
25.35                          the Inquiry, but do you have any

                               knowledge of any crushing taking

                               place in 1987 (000087) or 1988

                               (000088)?

            MACKRELL           None whatsoever.
            DSU61              You've got no letters written to

                              you by supporters who attended the

                              game...

            MACKRELL          No.

            DSU61             saying that they were crushed...?
25.50       MACKRELL          No.   I've dug through my files

                              and I've kept individual files

                              which I think obviously have been

                              seen by the individual, by yourselves
 MACKRELL              GRAHAM HENRY


                               in respect of each of the Semi-Finals

                               and I've kept correspondence on them,

                               that related and I've had a couple

                              of letters you know, come. I've

                              kept what letters there are, and

                              there's been like letters

                              complimenting stewards, somebody

                              complaining about progrartmes but

                              nothing about.
             DSU61            Crushing at all.   Not even elsewhere

                              in the ground?

            MACKRELL          No.

26.16       DSU61             Following these sort of matches,

                              I'm talking about O p Semi-Finals

                              now, big matches, do the Board and

                              yourselves have any sort of a deb...,

                              is there any sort of provision for

                              any debrief as to how it went, what

                             what we learnt.
26.32       MACKRELL          I normally debrief my departmental

                             heads after a big game and any

                             problem areas, anything that went

                             well, particularly well, might be

                             ineventive ...
            DSU61            Yes.

        MACKRELL             a few times, but we do have you

                             know, do try to, previously it was

                             on an informal basis obviously

                             subsequently after the events of
 MACKRELL              GRAHAM HENRY


                               15th of April 1989 (150489) it's on a,

                               it's on a slightly more formal basis

                               than that.    But quite honestly I had

                               nothing, I had no feedback whatsoever

                              and I was surprised, obviously but

                              maybe I shouldn't be surprised you

                              know when things like that crop up

                              after another event, you know.
27.14        DSU61            Yeah.    Do you keep any minutes of

                              those debriefs or are they sort of

                              an informal debrief?
            MACKRELL          Not as then, now I do.
27.30       DSU61             I see.     Were you or the Club ever

                              informed of crushing and injuries

                              by either the Police or staff,

                              St John's Ambulance or your own

                              staff or the St John's Ambulance

                              Brigade that occurred at those

                              matches?

            MACKRELL          No.
27.43       DSU61             So you, as far as you're concerned

                             up until Hillsborough happens and

                             the disaster in April 1989 (000489)

                             you've got really no, no knowledge

                             of of any problems on those

                             terraces at all?
            MACKRELL         That's correct.
            DSU61            You concede that the Club hadn't

                             knowledge within its system of,
MACKRELL               GRAHAM HENRY                                 76


                               that there had been problems

                               certainly in 1981 (000081) I mean

                               it was also suggested there was

                               a problem in 1956 (000056).    Do

                              your records go back as far as

                              that?

28.11       MACKRELL          Well they obviously the Club, the

                              statutory records of the Company

                              would go back from that, I can

                              only reiterate that I didn't see

                              the correspondence relating to 81

                              (000081), and having read the,

                              having read the correspondence

                              now with hindsight which obviously

                              I accept as perfect signs, if

                              there had been any strong feeling

                              on the matter or the police had had

                              perfect opportunity by way of the

                              Advisory Group to draw it to their

                              attention and ask for and usually

                             my experience with, with the

                             Advisory Groups or with ever in

                             within Football is if Police

                             are adamant they want something

                             done, they regard it as a matter

                             of safety, it usually gets done.
           DSU61             And of course they're licensed

                             to inspect the ground, anyway

                             aren't they and under the Safety




                                                                         791

                                of Sports Ground Act and in fact

                                they can go to the Council and,

                                in fact they can prevent you fran ...

                                open you, from opening if you're not

                               conforming with the Certificate.
28.59        MACKRELL          That's it and also by way of the

                               Police, if the Police for example

                               come to me, when the fixtures are

                               published and they don't want us

                               to play a particular team, they

                               want an early morning kick-off

                               for example on a Boxing Day

                               morning.   I can turn round and

                               argue the toss may be, I might

                               say, hang on that's being a bit

                               unreasonable for people who've

                               got to travel, but ultimately

                               I know that if push came to
29.21                          shove, the Police could go to

                               the local Authority and it could

                               be imposed upon me.
            DSU61              Yes.

            MACKRELL           So therefore you know the Police

                               are quite conscious of their own

                              conscious of their powers, should

                              they need, should they need to

                              need to utilize them.
            DSU61             Fair enough.   Do you think if

                              if you had of known about these,
MACKRELL              GRAHAM HENRY


                              I mean you obviously had a limited

                              knowledge of 1981 (000081) fran

                              what you're saying, but no great, no

                              great knowledge and it was before

                              your time anyway, you, you assumed it
29.48                         had been dealt with.   Do you think

                              if you had of known about the

                             crushing in 1987 (000087) and 1988

                              (000088), such as it was, would,

                             would it have flagged up that there

                             was a problem there in regard to

                             capacity or would you have I mean

                             expected the Police to highlight

                             that to you anyway or....

           MACKRELL          Well actually I can only, you know,

                             it sounds a bit simplistic only

                             saying yes I would see it, regard it

                             to capacity, you know, I could

                             obvious, obviously.

           DSU61             You might now, you wouldn't

                             necessarily then.

           MACKRELL          Exactly fran that point of view and
30.15                        also the fact is that the Police

                             after the 87 (000087) and 88

                             (000088) semi-final never at all

                             came to me and told me that there

                             were any, there were any problems

                             with the way that the, that the

                             actual, the great game had been run
MACKRELL              GRAHAM HENRY


                              for want of a better word.

            DSU61             Okay, that's fair enough.     If we

                              can move on now to deal with the
30.34                         Green Guide.   In your statement

                              and in your transcript of evidence

                              you've conceded that you have

                              knowledge of the Green Guide 1976

                              (000076) from your previous

                             occupations in Bournemouth and

                             Luton Town Football Club.      Is

                             that?

           MACKRELL          Yeah.

30.52      DSU61             Is that.   How far does that

                             knowledge extend, and to seme

                             extent we've, I know we've touched

                             on this earlier.

           MACKRELL          Sure.

           DSU61             in this interview but...

           MACKRELL          It extends, it extends obviously to

                             to certain elements that one regards

                             as, as you know the Club's

                             responsibility althought obviously

                             the Club ultimately is, you know, is

                             responsible for certain areas.

                             However in the same way at Luton

                             Town they employed a cons..., a firm

                             of consultants to to handle...
           DSU61             Safety Engineers?

           MACKRELL          On this occasion it was architects.
 MACKRELL              GRAHAM HENRY


            DSU61              Yes.

            MACKRELL           But you know on the same, same

                               principle obviously for that, to

                               actually handle the negotiations

                               for any safety work that was

                              required at, required at the ground

                              and I think you'd find that this

                               is quite normal amongst footballing

                              clubs.

31.36       DSU61             Yes, yeah.   But as a result of all

                              that work, how much knowledge

                              would you get of the Green Guide

                              and I'm talking about the 76

                               (000076) Green Guide at the

                              moment?   For example would you,

                              would you recognise that tunnel

                              elevations or elevations on the

                              terraces, barrier configurations,

                              heights, height of barriers, this

                              type of thing all had a bearing

                              on crowd capacity in that area?

            MACKRELL          Sure, I under... I understand what

                              you're saying, but I can only, risk

                              of sounding of repeating myself
32.14                         state that obviously we had

                              employed a company to handle this

                              technical, I'm not qualified to

                              judge the scale and the rate of

                              slope on the terrace.   I think
 MACKRELL              GRAHAM HENRY


                               you know, it would be beyond

                               my technical remit to to do so and

                               therefore as as a Club we employ

                               a Company to handle this on our

                               behalf.

            DSU61              I accept what you're saying,

                               that you depend, what you're

                               saying is you depended on

                              EASTVJOOD to advise you of that,

                              EASTWOODS the Company.

            MACKRELL          Yeah.

            DSU61             But, I mean you you, by virtue

                              of what you were doing with the

                              Engineers that you pre... in

                              previous, or the architects in

                              your previous employments, you

                              would, you would have read the

                              Green Guide, you would know what

                              the Green Guide said, and after

                              all you're the Safety Officer.
            MACKRELL          Sure.

            DSU61             As well as being the Secretary.
            MACKRELL          Yeah.

33.00       DSU61             Now what I'm seeking to sort

                              of pursue is, would you by

                              virtue of your own knowledge

                              of the, of the Green Guide have

                              seen the relevance of those

                             different areas, barrier configur-

                               ations the height of the barriers,

                               and those sort of things, in

                               relation to crowd capacity?
            MACKRELL           I'm aware of what obviously

                              the implications of the, of

                              barrier configurations etc

                              and what's obviously requirements

                              are for a safety matter but I

                              can only repeat there is

                              basically on that, that amount,

                              that type of work, the technical

                              aspects of the work, those are

                              handed over to Consulting

                              Engineers who handle that

                              matters on our behalf, and whilst

                              I hear what you say about the

                              Green Guide, the Green Guide

                              actually is still, at this

                              mcment in time a Guide to such,

                              and obviously matters then are

                              negotiated to the, to the

                              satisfaction, obviously of the

                             Licensing Authority, otherwise

                             the license would not, would

                             not have been granted.
           DSU61             No I accept that, but you see

                             what   i'm getting at is that

                             with the knowledge of the Green

                             Guide 1976 (000076) and with




                                                                         79 7
MACKRELL              GRAHAM HENRY


                              the knowledge of the crushing

                              albeit that it was a limited

                              knowledge in 1981 (000081) and

                              you have said in fact that you

                              assume that that had been
34.10                        dealt with.    Capacity and danger

                             of people on terraces, the dangerous

                             of people being overcrowded onto

                             terraces must be something that's

                             very much forefront in your mind?

           MACKRELL          Obviously crowd, crowd safety.

           DSU61             As safety officers.
34.25      MACKRELL          Safety, safety at the ground is

                             obviously paramount on anybody's

                             mind in re.. in resolve of that

                             situation.    And Sheffield Wednesday

                             have never been kind of slow to

                             actually spend a great deal of

                             money on safety and improving

                             their ground, but with regard

                             to the actual technical aspects

                             of it, I understand the

                             implications of the technical

                            aspects but I can only just

                            repeat that I had to leave that

                            to somebody who was more qualified

                            to deal with it.

           DSU61            Yeah but I mean the... okay then,

                            but did you ever say to that person
MACKRELL              GRAHAM HENRY


                              who was more qualified to deal

                             with it, look I have a knowledge

                              of the Green, this this, this is my

                              the extent of rrty knowledge of

                             the Green Guide.    Now it occurs

                             to me that there may be a problem

                             on the West Stand because of the

                             barriers, they're not spaced if

                             you like, if the spacing doesn't

                             accord with the Green Guide which

                             says, talks about maximum spacing of

                             one point one metre, for example.
           MACKRELL          Yeah.

           DSU61             Will you have a look at it, you

                             see...

35.17      MACKRELL          Yeah.    With respect, I you know, I

                             hear what you're saying but with

                             respect if I'm employing a company

                             of Consulting Engineers to do that

                             I'm hardly gonna go around with

                             the tape measure, measuring that

                             and the theodolite measuring

                            the slope, I'm taking a

                            reputable company of Consulting

                            Engineers to handle that on our

                            behalf.    They understood the

                            implications of what they were

                            doing, because they understood

                            that they were acting on our
 MACKRELL           GRAHAM HENRY                                 85


                            behalf to handle those matters

                            and previous correspondence

                            that I think is cannon to all

                            parties is there to show that

                            they were doing this, and you

                            know, I I think that really

                           you are expecting a lot to

                           say that I'm going to go down

                           and do, study technical matters

                           when I'm employing a company

                           to handle those on rrty behalf.

            DSU61          No, I'm not, let's be quite

                           clear, I'm not actually

                           suggesting that, that you

                           should have done that, what

                           I'm suggesting is that with

                           the knowledge of it.   You see

                           EASTWOODS seem to be acting,

                           reacting to to what you put

                           to them. In other words you have

                           to ask them, pro-active if you
36.20                      like aren't they?   So what the

                           point I'm making is, that unless

                           you went to them, it appears to

                          me that from what Dr EASTWOOD

                           said, although I accept that you

                           and Dr EASTWOOD do do vary slightly

                          in your understanding of what his

                          role was, the the matter would




                                                                      800
MACKRELL                 GRAHAM HENRY


                                 never have been brought to anybody's

                                 attention?
36.38      MACKRELL              Well obviously it would have

                                 been brought to the attention

                                 for the Local Authority, by

                                the way the Club was licensed

                                in the first place and the Club

                                are granted and granted a

                                licence under the Safety of

                                Sports Grounds Act to Sheffield

                                Wednesday under that configuration.
           DSU61                Okay then, well I think you'll see

                                the the relevance of of what I'm

                                talking about as we go into

                                the interview.
36.56      0'CALLAGHAN          I think it's right to say that

                                that EASTWOOD initially

                                calculated the capacities and

                                he alone calculated the

                                capacities in terms of, of

                                applying for a licence for those

                               capacities the under the

                               certificate but I'm not quite

                               clear, I must say, whether you're

                               referring to the spacing of the

                               barriers having regard to the

                               effect on capacity or whether

                               you're referring to for example

                               the height of the barriers not
MACKRELL                 GRAHAM HENRY


                                 being exactly as suggested in

                                 the Green Guide.
37.26      DSU61                 Well both, according to the Green

                                 Guide, have a bearing on the

                                 capacity that can be allowed in

                                 that pen.   But I mean we're not

                                talking about now, I I'm talking at

                                the moment generally, when the Club

                                got the certificate which is

                                before Mr MACKRELL'S time anyway.
           O'CALLAGHAN          Yes.

           D5U61                And this is part of the difficulty

                                if you like with this Inquiry,

                                that some of the stuff that I

                                have to put to him, is in fact
37.47                           before his time, but of course as

                                Safety Officer, when he takes

                                over this role in 1986 (000086),

                                to some extent he he has to accept

                                the responsibility that goes

                                with that and what was done in

                                the past.    Now in fact it would

                                probably be easier if we, if we

                               move on, because you'll see why,

                               why I was sort of concentrating

                               on that a little bit because in

                                1981 (000081) and 1985 (000085)

                               there were radial fences erected

                               in the West Terrace, those those
 MACKRELL              GRAHAM HENRY


                               fences in fact, the first ones in

                               1981 (000081), divided the terrace

                               into three, the 1985 (000085) ones

                               sub-divided the central pen into

                              what is now pens 3, 4 and the

                              void area, pen 5.    Now those

                               fences in effect, reduced again

                              the, the area that was available

                              if you like, the met... the number

                              of square metres that were

                              available on that terrace.     Do

                              you accept that?

            MACKRELL          I accept that, you know, they they

                              obviously must, in that it's a

                              matter of fact.
            D5U61             What what, what knowledge have you

                              got of that, I mean was that some­

                              thing that you would again, again

                              see on the ... (Overtalking)
39.11       MACKRELL          Only from the correspondence, yeah,

                              I was ... on the 85 (000085) it is,

                              it was that the radial fences were

                             put in at the request of South

                             Yorkshire Police to assist with crowd

                             control.

            D5U61            Yes.

            MACKRELL         Control measures.
39.24       DSU61            Yeah.    So that's 1981 (000081)

                             in fact I think you, you probably
 MACKRELL              GRAHAM HENRY


                               know that the 1981 (000081)

                               fences were put in, as you say

                               at the request of the Police and

                               to prevent the lateral movement

                               that they thought might have

                              caused the crushing in 1981

                               (000081) so that was, that was

                              what I was looking for earlier

                              on actually.   But, the 19... and the

                              1985 (000085) one was to, to do

                              with segregation and more so than

                              packing if you like in the terraces



            MACKRELL          Yeah.
            DSU61             but obviously they, they reduced the

                              the area that was available on

                              the terraces, now, I mean, it
40.04                         goes on from there, as it, as it

                              did reduce the, the area would you

                              have expected EASTWOODS, as the Club

                              Safety Engineers, to point out to

                              the Club the effects of the

                              erection of those radial fences

                             on the crowd capacity and the

                              fact that it had implications

                             in fact ultimately for the

                             Safety Certificate?
40.23       MACKRELL         I would expect a combination of

                             EASTWOODS and the Local Authority,
 MACKRELL              GRAHAM HENRY


                               rather like the ultimate

                               licensing authority who would have

                               had to have given permission for

                               that work to have been undertaken

                               in the first place.

            DSU61             And indeed they did.
            MACKRELL

            DSU61             I mean that, that's common ground

                              that they they did that, but at, at

                              the present moment, you see we've

                              got a situation where the, the

                              area was reduced and we're still

                              left with the, with the Safety

                              Certificate, Schedule 3 unamended

                              by the local Authority and I accept

                              that that's their problem but the,

                              the ground, the Club itself also

                              have some responsibility and again

                              when you take it over in 1986

                              (000086)...
            MACKRELL          Yeah.
41.04       DSU61            you take on those responsibilities

                             on behalf of the Club and it appears

                             that nothing was done about trying

                             to amend those certificate, no

                             nobody recognised it.
41.13   MACKRELL             Yeah, but a lot of capacities

                             that are on Safety Certificates

                             with respect, are not done to the,
 MACKRELL              GRAHAM HENRY


                               to the letter, to the actual letter

                               of the law.    There is an element

                               that's taken into account, because

                              when the Kop was done, they, the

                              capacity was technically they could

                              have had more then twenty one

                              thousand on the Kop, the Local

                              Authority chose at that stage not to

                              grant the capacity for more than

                              twenty one thousand on the Kop

                              because of the flows, but they weren't

                              quite happy with licensing as large

                              an area as that and so that it was

                              took, and in fact there's a reference,

                              I think again which we pointed at to

                              previously on when querying about

                              the capacity of the Kop, can this

                              be raised up, because it was in

                              at twenty one thousand, could have

                              been higher, so there is the element

                              obviously that within those type of

                             capicities, there is slack to be

                             taken up.
            DSU61            What you're talking about is an

                             inbuilt safety margin?
42.04       MACKRELL         Ind... an inbuilt safety margin

                             fran there.     Obviously I think it,

                             I think personally it's reasonable

                             to assume that if ones, it's done




                                                                       80 6
 MACKRELL              GRAHAM HENRY


                               at the request of the Police, it's

                               done on a technical basis by ones

                               Consulting Engineers, it's

                               approved by the Officer Working

                              Party and by the Local Authority,

                               it's reasonable to, to act on that

                              request, or on their actions.
             DSU61            And you're also sort of saying as

                              well, I understand, that you, this

                              may only have been taken up the

                              safety margin that there may have

                              been in that pen anyway.
            MACKRELL          Well that's right.    Well one, I

                              think one's entitled to assume that

                              that has been considered.
42.42       DSU61             Well fair enough.    Okay.   Can we move

                              on to deal with the mo..., the

                              reduction in the barrier 144 and again

                              we mentioned this earlier on, which

                              was just before you joined the

                              Sheffield Wednesday Football Club.

                              I accept that this was as a result

                             of the request from the Police, but

                             do you recall noting any

                             correspondence on the file in

                             relation to the work when you

                             arrived and examined the files?
            MACKRELL         No.
43.04       DSU61            So when was the first time it cane
 MACKRELL               GRAHAM HENRY


                                to your notice that this barrier

                                had been removed?

             MACKRELL           It, obviously, one looks at the

                                ground and sees the situation.    The

                                implications of the removal of the

                               barrier were obviously not dr a m to

                               one's attention until until after the

                               events of 15th of April 1989 (150489)
 43.23                         but it was right that one can see

                               that the request was made by, I think

                               it was Mr CALVERT, of the South

                               Yorkshire Police at the time, at

                               a meeting of the group on the ground

                               at which John STRANGE of EASTWOOD and

                               Partners was present and permission

                               was given by the Advisory Group to

                               to remove that that barrier. (Buzzer)
            DSU61              I see.   The buzzer's just gone for

                               the two minutes Mr MACKRELL.   This

                               may be a suitable point I think for

                               us to take a break from the interview

                               we'll turn the, Mr TOPE will turn

                               the tapes off now.   We'll terminate

                               the interview, perhaps have a break

                               and a cup of coffee and then we'll

                              resume at a time to be agreed if

                              that's okay with you.   Okay.

            MACKRELL           Correct.

01.22       DSU61              Are you aware of what consultation

                               EASTWOOD, or what part of the

                               consultation EASTWOOD had in regard

                               to the removal of that barrier.
            MACKRELL          As I understand it was a meeting of

                              the Working Party that took place

                              like a site meeting.
            DSU61             Inspection?
           MACKRELL           Yes, on the, on the terrace at at

                              the Leppings Lane end.
           DSU61              Yes.

01.41      MACKRELL           And following on there was a request

                              frcm as I understand it, Inspector

                              CALVERT, from South Yorkshire Police

                              for the removal of the barrier to

                              assist with crowd control.
           DSU61              So you, you actually played no part

                              in it, you're presented with a fait

                              accompli, as it were, when you

                              joined the Club, that barrier's

                              been reduced?
           MACKRELL          That's right.
           DSU61             You see documentation on it

                             presumably?
           MACKRELL          Yeah, and obviously the fact it had

                             been dealt with at an Advisory Group,

                             at an Advisory Group meeting and so

                             obviously one assumed that that had
MACKRELL               GRAHAM HENRY


                               been sanctioned properly.
            DSU61              You didn't, did you, any thoughts go

                               through your mind about that having

                               any sort of bearing on the capacity

                              at all?

            MACKRELL          No.

            DSU61             Of the terrace?

            MACKRELL          No.

            DSU61             No.     You assumed that had been

                              dealt with from what you said?
           MACKRELL           Obviously I felt that had been dealt

                              with because obviously all parties

                              were present.
02.35      DSU61              Yeah.    Do you accept that the fact

                              that the barrier 144 being removed,

                              has a bearing on the collapse of the

                              barrier 124a in the front of the,

                              in the front of that pen 3?
           MACKRELL           Well I'm not, I'm not a technical

                              expert and so obviously I'm not fully

                              aware, obviously I've seen the, I've

                              seen the the evidence that's been

                              produced, to kind of, that makes

                              that assumption, so obviously I

                             would concur with with that on the

                             basis but, you know, I don't have

                             any specialist knowledge on it.
           DSU61             You're talking now presumably

                             about the H.S.E. report are you?
MACKRELL               GRAHAM HENRY


            MACKRELL           That's correct, yeah.
            DSU61              As the technical...

            MACKRELL           That's right.

            DSU61              sort of thing.      So whilst you

                              you've got no, what you're saying

                               is you've got no technical knowledge

                              of it, you accept their interpret­

                              ation of it, that it does have a

                              bearing?

            MACKRELL          Obviously I I've seen the report

                              and obviously they're the technical

                              experts.

           DSU61              You've never seen the significance

                              presumably of the, of that?
           MACKRELL           No.     (Pause)
03.45      DSU61              Yeah.    So it therefore follows that

                              you did take it for granted that

                              this would have been taken into

                              account by the Officer Working Party

                              as it was then, the Officer Working

                              Group in consult... in consultation

                             with EASTWOODS, when the Club was

                              asked to carry out the work?
           MACKRELL          That's right, it was obviously

                             an actual meeting, it wasn't even

                             just a matter of like a letter to

                             the Working Party, actually was

                             they were physically present.
           DSU61             Right.     (Pause).
 MACKRELL               GRAHAM HENRY


 04.31                          Yeah the Club have a responsibility

                                to ensure that the safety of

                                supporters is a general responsibility

                                to ensure the safety of supporters

                                I think you, would you accept that?
             MACKRELL          Yes.

             DSU61             When they're on their premises?
             MACKRELL          Yes.
 04.44       DSU61             The reduction of that barrier,

                               without proper consideration, if you

                               like, for the safety implications,

                               and also accepting that there

                               was crushing in 1981 (000081),

                               1987 (000087) and 1988 (000088),

                               do you consider that the Club have

                               any responsibility for the disaster

                               because of that?
05.08       MACKRELL           No I can't accept that because I

                               feel that the Club acted upon a

                               request from constituent members

                               of the Officer Advisory Group and

                               relied upon the advice of its own

                              Consulting Engineers and as a result

                              obviously it was a, you know I and I

                              feel that the Club under those

                              circumstances don't have a

                              responsibility.
05.29       DSU61             Right.   Now the next question is,

                              do you think with hindsight that
MACKRELL                 GRAHAM HENRY                                     99


                                 EASIWDODS should have given better

                                 advice to the Club in regard to the

                                 West terraces?

           MACKRELL              Possibility in hindsight, you know

                                 one has to say if that is the

                                 causation then possibly that is,

                                 that may, that may be true but

                                 obviously it is a situation and

                                 not only EASTWOODS, it's the

                                 Officer Working Party, the Building

                                 Surveyor's Department, which, which

                                 also sanction that work to to take

                                 place.

05.54      DSU61                 So what you're saying is they all

                                 have a, is it, they all have a

                                 responsibility, seme responsibility

                                 for what took place?

           MACKRELL              I believe so, yes.

           O'CALLAGHAN           I think if I may say so, the

                                 question assumes that no

                                 consideration of the safety aspect

                                 was given and that doesn't

                                 necessarily follow and the question

                                 also assumed I think, did have an

                                 effect on causation which will also

                                 be a technical issue.   So I think ...

           DSU61                Mr MACKRELL is, is aware of the

                                contents of the H.S.E. report?

           O'CALLAGHAN          Yes and the TAYLOR report indeed.
 MACKRELL                 GRAHAM HENRY                                    100


             DSU61                Which is, and the TAYLOR report

                                  sort of amplifies that, that that

                                  it did in fact have a bearing on

                                  on the collapse of the barrier, so

                                  I think that's a reasonable

                                  supposition or assumption to make.

            O'CALLAGHAN          Yes. I think you may find that there

                                 will be experts who may disagree with

                                  it, it's the only point I I'm making.

            DSU61                Oh, I see.

06.45       O'CALLAGHAN          It's a matter which will no doubt

                                 be aired in court in due course

                                 in civil proceedings in any event

                                 but I merely make the point that

                                 I know, I believe that Dr EASTWOOD

                                 doesn't agree that his removal

                                 had had an effect on causation.

                                 Whether he's right or not is

                                 a different matter.

            DSU61                Oh, I see.

            O'CALLAGHAN          But, I mean, I accept that the

                                 H.S.E. report and the TAYLOR

                                 report do make certain comments

                                 about it.

            DSU61                Is there anything you want to

                                 say about that Mr MACKRELL?

            MACKRELL             No, certainly not.

07.14       DSU61                Are EASTWOODS still retained

                                 by the Club as Safety Engineers?




                                                                                815
MACKRELL              GRAHAM HENRY                                 101


           MACKRELL           Yes.

07.22       DSU61             Did you ever ask Dr EASTWOOD for

                              a full safety survey of the ground

                              or ever mention to the Board of

                              Directors that this was desirable

                             or necessary?

           MACKRELL          No.     Under the terms of the

                             Safety Certificate he has to

                             do a visual inspection of the

                             ground which he obviously has done

                             and lodged with the Local

                             Authority, done with the Local

                             Authority, so nothing further

                             than that was done.

           DSU61             As I understand it, in fact he

                             carries out an inspection pre­

                             inspection by the Local

                             Authority?

           MACKRELL          Yeah, a lot of the kind of barrier

                             testing work and things like that

                             which is obviously...

           DSU61             That's right.

           MACKRELL          required to be done is done in

                             advance of the annual inspection.

                             That as it was done new that the

                             situation has changed slightly

                             in that they've brought forward

                             the period, the inspection period,

                             to a more logical time, at the end

                              I can understand the reasons for

                             point that again, that I'm trying

                             to make is, we've got to this

                             situation over nine years, ten

                             years, when the disaster occurs.

                             It seems to me that nobody's ever

                             actually reviewed the, never

                             reviewed it annually or bi-annually,

                             within the inspections, within the

                             law.

           MACKRELL          Mm.

                             of said, look, where, where

                             does this ground stand, there's

                             no legal requirement for me,

                             let me make this quite clear,

                             I mean there's no legal require­

                            that as a Club, but nobody

                   of said, well where are we

                   at this ground in regard to

                   safety, shouldn't we have a

                   look at it overall again,

                   and review the situation,

                  carry out some sort of review.
09.10             Mr ADDY doesn't seem to have

                  sort of highlighted that that

                  may be necessary and it may

                  be that he didn't consider that

                  it was necessary, given what

                  was taking place, you as the

                  Safety Officer don't seem to

                  have done it, the Local

                  Authority by virtue of their

                  position have certainly not

                  if it had of been done, and

                  and it's an assumption I suppose,

                 and it may have, and it certainly

                 if it had been done by an

                 independent Safety Engineer, in

                               the disaster ultimately?
            MACKRELL           Sure, I appreciate what you say but

                               with respect I think it's a bit of

                               a conj..., it is conjecture, in that
10.02                         you know, in that the various

                              constituent parts of the Working

                              Party have been satisfied with the

                              configuration of the ground and and

                              I hear what you say about an outside

                              party but you know that is really

                              you know that that's some... that

                              that could be true or it could not

                              be true and I've really got no way of

                              you know of cornment..., catinenting

                              in the definitive.
           DSU61              Mm.     Presumably it would cost

                              a lot of money to carry out

                              that sort of....?
           MACKRELL           I I...

           DSU61              Would that be a factor?
           MACKRELL           No not at all, I wouldn't know

                              but I I would, I I'm not sure

                                 their performance.
           DSU61                 Mm.

10.46      O'CALLAGHAN           I think if I can comment here.

                                 Dr EASTWOOD'S evidence was

                                 that he carried out a thorough

                                 safety inspection every year.
           DSU61                Yes.

10.54      O'CALLAGHAN          And that he accepted that he was

                                responsible for the Club for

                                safe, for structural matters

                                on safety, in relation to the

                                Certificate and the Safety of

                                Sports Grounds Act...
           DSU61                Where he had carried out work, only

                                where he had carried out work or

                                generally?     (Overtalking)

           O'CALLAGHAN          No no, oh no, oh no, cert... no

                                generally, generally, he carried

                                out a detailed inspection of the

                                ground generally each year and he

                                reported to the Club and he

                                didn't for example just inspect

                                matters he'd dealt with before,

                                he inspected generally and

                                if he found something was

                               wrong he recommended it should

                               be put right.     I think his own

                               evidence to the Inquiry confirmed




                                                                            820

                                 that.   He was the only independent

                                 expert who was charged with that

                                 duty by the Club.   That's absolutely

                                 right, the Club would have had no

                                 reason to suppose that he wasn't

                                carrying out his duties properly,

                                particularly in light of the fact

                                that he was liaising, he was the

                                interface with the Officer Working

                                Party etc.   As to the otter than

                                structural and expertise aspects,

                                if you like, the general Green

                                Guide aspect, again I think if

                                you look at the evidence that was

                                given by Mr LOCK at the Inquiry.
           DSU61                Yes.

           O'CALLAGHAN          and in his statement, he was

                                quite clear that he was, he had

                                full knowledge of the Green

                                Guide, it was something in

                                which he had taken a particular

                                interest and he inspected the

                                ground and made certain

                                reccranendations after he was

                               appointed, matters relating to

                                fire extinguishers and that

                               accessibility to them etc,

                               so he was looking at it frctn

                               that point of view.




                                                                               821

            DSU61                 He also made some recommendations

                                  in regard to hoardings that

                                  were blocking the perimeter

                                  fences I believe and things

                                  like that.

            O'CALLAGHAN           Indeed he did, yes.
            DUS61                 I mean, his, his, his role was

                                 not as a Safety Officer, it was

                                 as a Security Officer.

           O'CALLAGHAN           Yes.

12.35      DSU61                 I mean, what, what that begs

                                 the question if he knew about

                                 the non conformation, non

                                 conforming with the Green Guide

                                 in relation to height and

                                 spacing of barriers and things

                                 like that, in relation to

                                 tunnel elevations, in relation

                                 to width of perimeter gates,

                                 why didn't he bring it to Mr

                                 MACKRELL'S notice, as an, as an

                                 employee, with knowledge?
           O'CALLAGHAN           I I would suggest this is an

                                 interview of Mr MACKRELL so

                                I hesitate to actually take

                                the dialogue too far but I would

                                suggest that the evidence points to

                                the fact that everybody considered

                                that those were technical issues,




                                                                            82 2

                                  the exact height of a barrier, Dr

                                  EASTWOOD had strong views about

                                  that.

            DSU61                 Mn.

13.18       O'CALLAGHAN           The spacing between barriers, the

                                  angle between barriers, all of

                                 these were regarded as technical

                                 matters on which Dr EASTWOOD

                                 was was the man to speak.

           DSU61                 Right.

           O'CALLAGHAN           And who had to negotiate and

                                 reach agreement with the Local

                                 Authority as to whether or not

                                 the, the parameters of the Green

                                 Guide were sufficiently met, if

                                 I can put it that way.
           DSU61                 Right yeah.

           O'CALLAGHAN           And that this appears as I mentioned

                                 earlier from the initial meeting

                                 with the Officer Working Party when

                                 it was clearly recognised that there

                                 were areas within the ground were

                                 not quite within the parameters

                                 laid down in the Guide, nevertheless

                                 a decision was clearly made that

                                 they were acceptable.

           DSU61                 Would you agree with that Mr

                DSU61                Yeah.    Okay.   Just as a matter of
    14.09                            interest then, did you ever, with

                                    your knowledge of the Green Guide,

                                    did you ever note that the tunnel

                                    elevation in the West Stand was

                                    one in six as against the Green

               MACKRELL             No, I haven't, I haven't got the tex.

               O'CALLAGHAN          Could I again, I hesitate to

                                    interrupt you, but could I just put

                                    on record the fact that the one in

                                    six calculation is one that we

                                    would challenge.     If you, if one

                                    actually___

               DSU61                It's an approximation?

               0'CALLAGHAN          This would, it is an approximation,

                                    and this was from Lord Justice

                                    TAYIOR's Interim Report, and it is

                                    is an approximation the exact figure
j
                                    is a little different from that but

                                   probably not a great deal turns on it.

               DSU61               Okay.     Weis that ever brought to

           MACKRELL          No, no.

           DSU61             i think we've talked about the

                              barrier type and configuration

                              at quite some length together with
15.03                         the height and spacing.   Presumably

                             you appreciated that that did have

                             a bearing, I think you've conceded

                             that already, but you did appreciate

                             that it had a bearing on the, on

                             the capacities in the pen, but again

                             you were dependent, you were

                             dependent on Dr EASTWOOD to...

           MACKRELL          On Dr EASTWOOD and obviously the

                             interpretation of it by the Advisory

                             Group.

           DSU61             Yeah.    We've already mentioned the

                             Safety Certificate, I don't know

                             That schedule 3 of the Safety

                             Certificate talks about the capacity

                             on the West terrace as being seven

                            that area given the turnstile

                            arrangements and the fact that there

            MACKRELL           Well I think it.

            DSU61              You as the Club this is?

16.07       MACKRELL           Sure, obviously the Club it can, on

                               the basis that one finds the level,

                               finds the level of support, level

                              of spectators that's there.     As a,

                              as a regard to that we knew the

                              optimum numbers that were able to

                              go into the, into the terrace area,

                              in total.

           DSU61              As seven thousand two hundred or?
           MACKRELL           That's right yes.

           DSU61              ten thousand one hundred including

                              the North West Terrace?

           MACKRELL           It was, it was seven, seven thousand

                              two hundred and plus the two thousand

                              one hundred.   Yes the ten thousand,

                              ten thousand one hundred, and then

                              what, because that wasn't the broken

16.41      DSU61              What you're saying I understand is

                              that you'd got the computerised

           MACKRELL           Yes.

                             there was, was your means of...

           MACKRELL          Knowing,

           MACKRELL          Yes.

           DSU61             But that you concede do you that

                             you weren't able to monitor any

                             capacities in individual pens

                             and particulary pens 3 and 4?

           MACKRELL          Correct.
17.19      DSU61             With hindsight do you think that

                             that you probably should have been

                             able to monitor those capacities?
           MACKRELL          Well, I think hindsight is again

                             is very difficult to comment in

                             hindsight, other than the fact is

                             one possibly would question the

                             becomes a balance again in

                             hindsight, which one looks at it,

           DSU61              Mm.    You see I mean it's difficult

                              you can't actually comply with

           MACKRELL           In respect of which way?

           DSU61              Well you, people can come in

                              through A to G and go through the

                              Stand.

           MACKRELL           Not without their tickets are

                              checked at the, at the point of

                              entry into the West Stand.

           DSU61              Yes.     What about going round if

                              they can't get into the North

                              Stand can they?

18.46      DSU61              I see okay.     If I can refer you

           MACKRELL           Conveyed by way of draw, there

19.31      DSU61              Yes.   Is that what you were

                                            to query?

19.39      MACKRELL           I was querying, I was querying the

                             whole aspects of of the, because

                             obviously one was, the Spion Kop was

                             of checking that at the same time.

                             But no I wasn't looking to to have, to

                             have the break down between individual

                             the fact that I it was, it was a

                             of address, that that the height, the

                             strength of the flood lights, the

                             size of the playing area, how the

                             ground capacity is divided up to.

                             It's a, it's a guide which basically

                             is used to, when they're looking

                             at the, for the competition

            DSU61              Yeah.

            MACKRELL           so that the team fills that in

                               and it's mainly for use at

                               teams lower down the scale in

                              may be non league but all Clubs,

                              all members of the FA have to

                               fill it in.   And its to say how

                              the ground is situated, do you

                              have number of stands and things

                              like this, so it's mainly for

                              they can look at it and say that

                              Club isn't eligible to play

                              in the FA vase or FA trophy but

                              it's, it's a, because obviously

                              in the Football League all

                              Clubs or pretty much all Clubs

                              flood lights are in, are of a

                              good standard, but it still has

                              to like to write down like, for

                              example, the flood lightings ...
           DSU61              Yes.

           MACKRELL           level and it was in order to

                             complete that regular form which

                             has to be submitted in the Spring

           DSU61             I see so...

       MACKRELL              It's like, it's like almost that the

                             information that's necessary for the

 22.05       DSU61              So when you got the, those capacities

                                back, yes it does accord with the

                                Green Guide, sorry accord with the

                                Safety Certificate?

             MACKRELL          Yeah.

             DSU61             And providing the gates are open

                               at the back ...

            MACKRELL           Yes.

             DSU61             and this was the gist of what ...
            MACKRELL           Yes.

            DSU61              what the reply was, providing the
2 2. 2 1                       gates were open at the back, it's

                               for the crowd to find their own

                               level, then the capacity is as per

                               the Certificate, seven thousand

                               two hundred, and there isn't

                               a problem?

            MACKRELL           Yes.

            DSU61              Is that right?

            MACKRELL           That's right.
22.33       DSU61              Did, did it strike you as being

                               unsatisfactory that that EASTWOODS

                               should say leave the capacity at

                               Leppings Lane as it, as it is

                               providing the Police leave the gates

                              open?

            MACKRELL          Not, not really because of the fact




                                                                              832

                              is one, I I had been at the Club

                              three months, four months, in

                              addition to saying EASTWOODS had

                              been there right from day one of the

                              ground being designated and that

                              had been in regular contact with

                              the Local Authority Police and

                              all constitent members of the

                             Advisory Group.

           DSU61             Yes.

           MACKRELL          So I obviously you know, I I felt

                             it quite reasonable to assume that

                             the matter had been dealt with

                             accordingly.

           DSU61             Fair enough.     You mentioned or

                             we discussed earlier your, the

                             extent of your knowledge of the

                             Green Guide 1976 (000076), but

                             do you have a similar sort of

                             working knowledge presumably

                             is how you'd describe it, is it

                             of the 1986 (000086) Green Guide?
23.27      MACKRELL          Yeah, I obviously read the Guide.

                             I have a copy to hand, it's not,

                             I can't say it's a thing one

                             remembers by way of, you know,

                             wrote so to speak, remembering it,

                             but it's down.    I'm acquainted

                             with the Guide, yes.
 MACKRELL              GRAHAM HENRY


             DSU61             Did, I mean the, this what I wanted

                               to talk about here was the width
 23.48                         of the perimeter fencing.    You may

                               be aware now, if you weren't aware

                               originally, that the Green Guide's

                               recommendation is one point one

                              metres whereas the gates in pens

                               3 and 4 respectively are point

                              eight five and point eight three of

                              a metre.

            MACKRELL          Yeah.

            DSU61             Was that something that was ever

                              brought to your attention at all?
            MACKRELL          I I was con, I was aware...
            DSU61             Before the disaster?
            MACKRELL          Yeah, I was, I was aware of the

                              fact that they were less than
24.16                         specification, however one the

                              local Authority had obviously

                              accepted them as being below

                              below specification and more

                              importantly they weren't a

                              designated exit, exit way from

                              the ground.

            DSU61             Yes.

            MACKRELL          And they weren't taken into

                              consideration with regard to their

                              size.

24.33       DSU61            Then you're talking about
 MACKRELL               GRAHAM HENRY


                                evacuation.

             MACKRELL           When one's looking at the

                                evacuation time which obviously

                                is a factor when cones to setting

                                capacity.

            DSU61               Yeah, you say that you were aware

                               of it, how were you aware of that?

            MACKRELL           Vis... visually, visually look you

                               were aware that it just looked a bit

                               smaller, you know, but obviously it

                               was a thing that had been there,

                               they'd been set up and the, the

                               perimeter fences had been, been put

                               up obviously to the satisfaction of

                               the Local Authority because

                               obviously anything of that nature

                               can't be put up without Local

                               Authority approval.
25.04       DSU61              Yeah.   Were you ever actually

                               informed about the fact that it

                               didn't conform, I mean, you say

                               you made a visual, visual check.

            MACKRELL           Yeah.

            DSU61              Can you recall...
25.12       MACKRELL           I can't, I can't recall, Mr LOCK

                               no, it would not have been Mr LOCK

                               did not draw it to my attention but

                               I can't recall whether it was

                              Dr EASTWOOD or any of his staff but
MACKRELL              GRAHAM HENRY                                      121


                              it was something that I was aware

                              of in, and I can't say how I became

                              aware of it unfortunately.

           DSU61              Fair enough.    The Safety Certificate,

                              again we've ...

           MACKRELL           Yeah.

25.34      DSU61             We've got that there, shows an

                             overall capacity of seven thousand

                             two hundred in the West terrace,

                             pens 1 to 5, but it does not show

                             individual capacities of pen 3 and

                             4.      The Health and Safety

                             Executive calculation was based on

                             recommendations laid down in the

                             Green Guide 1986 (000086) which

                             obviously was in force at the

                             time of the disaster, shows that

                             the present capacity of those pens

                             and this may be disputed, I accept,

                             pen 3 827 and pen 4 882 respectively.
26.12                        The plan from EASTWOOD shows twelve

                             hundred and a thousand in those pens

                             respectively which is something like

                             373 and 118 more than it appears that

                             there should be.    In view of that,

                             do think that you should perhaps have

                             done something about having those

                             pens checked, the capacity of those

                             pens checked or controlled better

                                than in fact there were?

 26.44       MACKRELL           Well ... sure.   Obviously but when it

                                ccmes to the capacities one's reliant

                                upon the again, our professional

                               Advisors EASTWOODS and also the Local

                               Authority, the Local Authority had

                                an annual inspection here, which

                               has obviously now cone up with

                               those figures subsequent to the

                               events, they had every opportunity

                               of checking it prior to the event.

                               I'm not saying I'm reliant upon

                               Local Authority to to advise us

                               on this, but they had an opportunity

                               to do so and were often coming back

                               on matters of minor things like

                               there's a step crumbling half way

                               up the Kop or something like that

                               and do something to it.     You know

                               so they did, they do have that

            DSU61              Yeah.   I should make it clear I'm

                               not, I'm not referring to anything

                               had put no constraints upon how

                               that North West terrace should

                              should have been sub-divided.
            DSU61             Mn.     Given the experience

                              within the Club, the existence

                              of the Green Guides, the two of

                              them and the Club files on work

                              carried out on the West Terrace,
27.58                         do you think that the Club should

                              have recognised the potentially

                              dangerous situation that existed

                              on the terrace?
            MACKRELL          I think the Club were entitled

                              to rely upon their professional

                              advisors who had drawn up the

                              schemes and had the schemes

                              approved by the Local Authority.
28.13       DSU61             Fair enough.    Your Club employed

                              EASTWOODS as Safety Engineers

                              and neither do they seem to have

                             recognised the potential for

                             disaster.    With hindsight do you

                             consider that they or the Working

             MACKRELL           I think that's a reasonable

                                assumption in hindsight.

             DSU61              You'd agree with that?
             MACKRELL           I believe so yeah.
 28.38       DSU61             Can we now go on to deal with

                               the situation at the turnstiles

                               Mr MACKRELL.   I know that you were

                               closely questioned on this area

                               at the disaster inquiry, but can

                               you tell me who was responsible

                               for the decision to use only

                               23 turnstiles for the admission

                               into the ground of the twenty

                               four thousand two hundred and

                               fifty six Liverpool fans.
28.56       MACKRELL           Yes South Yorkshire Police advised

                               me that they did not want to use

                               the, the turnstiles which accessed

                               the North Stand at the Leppings, at

                               the Penistone Road end of the ground.
            DSU61              This is for segregation purposes?
            MACKRELL           Correct.

            DSU61             Presumably.

            MACKRELL          Yeah.
29.11       DSU61             Did you ever advise them that to

                                X amount of time and that there

                                may be problems if people arrive

                                late?

             MACKRELL           Yeah but we were both of the

                                opinion I think it's in my

                               transcript that, comment, that

                                I discussed the matter with Mr

                               MOLE ...

             DSU61             Yeah.

             MACKRELL          of South Yorkshire Police and we

                               were confident that the, the flow

                               rate could be achieved, you know,
29.38                          that the South Yorkshire Police though

                               were adamant that they was not going

                               to to use the Penistone Road

                               turnstiles.
            DSU61              You're confident that the flow rate

                               could be achieved...

            MACKRELL           Yeah.

            DSU61              assuming that people came over the

                               period from when the turnstiles

                               opened at twelve o'clock (1200)

                               until three o'clock (1500)?
            MACKRELL          Correct.
29.54       DSU61             Did you ever take into account

                              the fact that they may arrive late?
            MACKRELL          Well one has to take into account

                              but obviously one has to look at

                              the, the probability factor, which I

                              might be what you state regarding

                               numbers to go through the turnstiles

                              segregation, it was felt that this

                              was path to go down, and particularly

                              in view of the fact that in 1987

                               (000087) and 1988 (000088), the

                              situation had had operated

                              satisfactorily.
            DSU61             I was just going to ask you that
30.26                         actually.    The situation you used

                              the same number of turnstiles in

                              1988 (000088) and 1987 (000087)?
            MACKRELL          Exactly in 88 yes, exactly the same

                              configuration was operated for both

                              matches.
30.39       DSU61             Fair enough.   Did anyone consider

                              the imbalance between Liverpool with

                              23 turn..., Liverpool fans with

                             23 turnstiles and twenty four

                             thousand, two hundred and fifty six

                             supporters and Nottingham Forest

                             who had 60 turnstiles with twenty

                             nine thousand, eight hundred

                             supporters?
30.53       MACKRELL         Well obviously that was, that was




                                                                            841
MACKRELL              GRAHAM HENRY


                              the, that was the, that is the

                              configuration of the ground, if you

                              know whichever it happened it

                             was that way, as again I can only

                              repeat that in 1987 (000087) and

                              1988 (000088) the situation was

                             satisfactory.
            DSU61            Cause it's obviously a matter that

                             the Liverpool supporters had

                             complained about in 1988 (000088)

                             certainly and in 1989 (000089)

                             to the FA I... (Interruption)
           MACKRELL          No they complained about their

                             allocation of tickets to the FA.
           DSU61             To the turnstile ...
           MACKRELL          About the, about the turnstiles,
           DSU61             you're quite right, you're quite
31.26                        right.   Liverpool have a reputation

                             for late arrival at football grounds

                             which certainly now seems to be

                             quite well documentated,

                             documented. Were you aware of that?
           MACKRELL         Liverpool have a reputation for a

                            lot of things at football grounds

                            and late arrivals is just one of

                            them.

                                starts to become a common factor

                                within football.

             DSU61             With other Clubs as well as

                                Liverpool or?   (Overtalking)

                                I think that one only has to go to

                               grounds and one looks at the number I
32.05                          think in the core document there is a,

                               there's a document I referred to

                               which monitors a home match with

                               Manchester United which I think was

                               in February of 89 (000089) prior to

                               the event only just shows the build

                               up of the supporters, how they

                               arrive at the ...

            DSU61              Yes.

            MACKRELL           stadium, they come late.   I think

                               like the control of alcohol acts

                               people going in for a long, long

                               discussion with this but the control

                               of alcohol situation hasn't helped

                               getting people into into stadia

                               faster.
32.34       DSU61             Knowing that, was that ever taken

                               into account in the planning so

                               far as you're concerned for the

                              the 1989 (000089) Cup Semi-Final?
            MACKRELL          Well the situation is obviously that

                              the opening hour, the opening of the




                                                                               843

                               turnstiles, the closing is obviously

                               the kick off time.   One can open up,

                               one it's very, it's very hard to,

                              you can't force people to cane

                              through turnstiles, you can't

                               force them to arrive, to arrive on

                              time.

 33.04       DSU61            Presumably the re... that why was,

                              why was sane of the turnstiles in

            MACKRELL          It was for segregation purposes.
            DSU61             And because presumably the Police,

                              the Police were controlling the

33.16       DSU61             That's right, Police did not want

                              visiting supporters say in

                              88 (000088) and 89 (000089) it

                              was Liverpool supporters in 87

                              (000087) it was Leeds supporters

                              coning onto Penistone Road because

                              then they would be mixing with the

                              other supporters which it was

                              Coventry in 87 (000087) and

                             Forest in 88 (000088) and 89,

                              (000089) mixing supporters on the

33.43       DSU61            When you and other members of your

                             staff realised that there was

                              still a large number of Liverpool

                              supporters missing from the

                              terraces, from the ground, not

                              necessarily the terraces, and you're

                              approaching the kick off time,

                              did you then not think of opening

                             or causing to be opened seme of

                             the other turnstiles, you know

                             I mean did you equate, did you

                             equate the fact that you're only

                             using 23 turnstiles and maybe ... ?
34.02      MACKRELL          Yeah, realistically I don't think

                             one could have done.   I can't speak

                             for the Polices, I can only speak

                             as I see it.   The Police would be

                             able to give you technical

                             information but in the same way as

                             they'v they've got the people to

                             carte into the Leppings Lane end,

                             they closed off all the, all the

                             side roads which is called the

                            triangle area that goes off from

                             fran Vere Road ...
           D5U61            Yes.

           MACKRELL         along along to the, to the main

                            Halifax Road and as a result of that

                            it there would have been, there

                            would have been no way of physically

                            getting those spectators externally

                                round to those turnstiles.
             DSU61              Yeah.

             MACKRELL           Because it was a conscious Police

                               effort to keep the supporters

                               away and you would have actually

                               broken down one system to try and

                               solve another.

             DSU61             Yeah, they could of, I mean there

                               are other, there are ways that the

                               Police could have achieved that,

                               had it been, been foreseen or or

                               noticed in time.     I accept that

                               it may have upset their

                               segregation plan but I mean that's

                               a matter for the Police anyway.
            MACKRELL           That's right, no request of us

                               for that.
35.05       DSU61              Did you ever notice, I mean you

                               did notice the, the uneven

                              distribution I think and the

                               fact that Nottingham Forest ...
            MACKRELL          I noticed that Nottingham Forest,

                              obvious Nottingham Forest people

                              had got there previously, were in

                              the ground.
35.21       DSU61             Okay.     Can we go on to deal with

                              the ticket markings.
        MACKRELL              Yeah.
        DSU61                 Again this is something which




                                                                          846
 MACKRELL              GRAHAM HENRY


                               was dealt with at quite scxne

                               length during the tribunal and

                               I don't really want to go, I can

                               go into it in detail but I don't

                              really want to go into it unless

                              you are unclear about what I'm
 35.43                        getting at.   Was the ticket

                              narking in 1988 (000088) and the

                              turnstile marking the same as

                              in 1989 (000089)?
            MACKRELL          Yes.
            DSU61             It was the same?

            MACKRELL          Yeah.

            DSU61             So we've got this business of the

                              turnstiles being marked A, C, B?
            MACKRELL          Yeah.

            DSU61             The diagram on the back of the

                              tickets being marked A, B, B, C,

                              D?

            MACKRELL          Yeah.
            DSU61            And the counterfoil on the ticket

                             being marked for the West Stand

                             anyway, B, which didn't necessarily

                             accord with the, with the diagram.
36.17       MACKRELL         But there was colour codings on

                             the ticket and outside the ground

                             there were signs in the same col...,

                             with the letters on, the A's, B's,

                             with the same colour as on the

                              ticket to go through.    So I hear

                              what you say but I think that with

                              respect as people go through the,

                              go through the ...
            DSU61             If we can refer for the audio to the
36.43                        photographs, Document 172 and

                             photograph number 7 ...

           MACKRELL          Yep.

           DSU61             Mr MACKRELL, does that illustrate

                             or indicate what you're trying to

                             show?

           MACKRELL          Yes.

           DSU61             I'm just looking as I'm talking to

                             you to see if I can see the colour

                             marking ... (Overtalking)
           MACKRELL          I'm looking at the red, the red,

                             the red w..., which appears as red

                             here...

           DSU61             Yes.

           MACKRELL          Or there and the kind of, the purple

                             ticket.
           DSU61            This is looking at the photograph

                             in, to the left-hand side.
           MACKRELL         Yeah.

           DSU61            The red markings by the door of the

                            turnstile marked C.    Presumably

                            the turnstiles to the left of

                            that are marked with a red sign

                            are they?
 MACKRELL               GRAHAM HENRY


             MACKRELL           No they're marked with the, the

                                North, the North Stand.
             DSU61             Which was different from.
             MACKRELL           I can't remember the colour of it

                               no.

             DSU61             That's fair enough.     The North

                               Stand.

             MACKRELL          Black.

             DSU61             Blue, red and brown.     Brown was the

                               West Stand.   Okay.    So what you're

                               saying is then that whilst they

                               they didn't exactly accord...
            MACKRELL           The colour coding...
            DSU61              the colour coding...
            MACKRELL           Yeah.
            DSU61              should have, but I mean that that

                               presupposes that the supporters

                               are gonna have enough intelligence

                               to to know which one to go down

                               if the...

            MACKRELL          Well yeah.
            DSU61              tickets are marked C and they're

                              trying to go through B.
            MACKRELL          Well the question on intelligence,

                              you know possibly question that

                              colour coding might be simpler

                              than the alphabet, you know and

                              I say that with respect.
38.26       DSU61             Fair enough.   I don't want to

                                go as I say into too much detail

                                about that because during your

                                cross examine of it, your

                               examination in chief I think

                                in the Inquiry you conceded that

                                I think that was done by

                               by                 your employee

                               at your direction?

             MACKRELL          That's right, but I say I take

                               responsibility of obviously her,

                               for her actions.
38.50        DSU61             Yeah.   I think you also concede

                               the way I read the transcripts

                               that it was less than desirable

                               the ticket markings was less than

                               desirable, the...
            MACKRELL           It may have been, I feel, but I I I

                               do believe it was a minor factor

                               and not something which was of

                               paramount importance.
            DSU61             Well that's that's something I'd

                               like to ccxne back on you, at you
39.16                         on...    I ... do you think that the

                              confusion and some of the situation

                              that arose in Leppings Lane was

                              contributed to by virtue of the

                              ticket markings?

            MACKRELL          I don't believe so.
            DSU61             You deny that?

             MACKRELL           Yes I do.
 39.33       D5U61              It must have had seme bearing on

                                the flow through the turnstiles of

                                people are moving between turnstiles

                                and not sure which turnstiles to

                               go in and the evidence does seem

                               to, seem to suggest, quite

                               considerable evidence, that people

                               were unsure about where they

                               should be going.

            MACKRELL           Well you know, I can only, you

                               asked me the question and I can

                               only answer it as I see it.
39.55       D5U61              Do you think it was a significant

                               factor in the Police eventually

                               losing control and having to open

                               Gate, exit gates A, B and C to

                               avoid injury?
            MACKRELL           I don't believe so but I can't

                               obviously speak for the Police's

                               reasonings behind their opening

                               the gates.   (Pause)
40.20       D5U61             Having regard to the fact that

                              all tickets for Leppings Lane

                              Stand area were marked B,

                              supporters with these tickets

                              would automatically make for the

                              area B and be allowed through

                              that, through that turnstile

                                that served the West terrace

                                tunnel,     is that a reasonable

                                assumption?
             MACKRELL           No because as people go through

                                the terrace, they they disperse

                               down there and I think that as

                               they normally go through a flow

                               through a turnstiles it acts as

                               a regulator so they don't go

                               through in large volume and so

                               people can then move around.        I

                               tear what you're saying obviously

                               regarding the opening of the gate

                               where there's an influx of people

                               but under normal circumstances in

                               which people go through turnstiles

                               it acts as a regulator as people,

                               to control...
            DSU61              I will accept that, I think that's

                               general...

            MACKRELL           Yeah.

            DSU61             you know we're on cannon ground

                              with that...
            MACKRELL          Yeah.

            DSU61             But what I'm saying to you is
41.12                         that, I mean first of all because

                              of the ticket markings, people

                              are likely to converge on, on

                              those turnstiles, so that creates
MACKRELL              GRAHAM HENRY                                138


                              I would, I would perhaps argue,

                              that creates a back log out in

                              leppings Lane and once they

                              get through then and they've got

                             a ticket marked B, which is for

                             the standing area, on the West

                             terrace, then the first thing

                             that they see is this signing

                             A and B to the left and right of

                             the tunnel?
41.41      MACKRELL          &it if you accept that premise,

                             then the situation never occurred

                             in 1987 (000087) or 88 (000088)

                             when it was a similar to

                             configuration of the ground and

                             tickets.

           DSU61             It was exactly the same was it in

                             1988 (000088)?
           MACKRELL          Yes.
41.58      DSU61             In 1988 (000088) there was seme

                             evidence again from members of the

                            public that in the fact the police

                            had had to put a cordon across

                            those, across that tunnel and

                            that's a matter that's certainly

                            very arguably...

           MACKRELL         Sure, but but following on from

                            88 (000088), the Police never

                            raised any ccmment to me regarding




                                                                        853

                              hew hew people got into the ground.

           D5U61              The fact that the, there is the

                              words 'Standing' in large letters

                              above the mouth of the tunnel

                              tends to confirm that the B

                              marking on the tunnel, marking

                              on the tickets, I mean that's

                              that's, they're all features

                              that the the central pens are

                              traditionally I understand

                              the best peak viewing area, the

                             best viewing area as far as the

                              fans are concerned.   You've

                             got a situation where you've got

                             a turnstile feeding directly

                             in to the concourse and

                             immediately opposite the

                             concourse is the tunnel marked

                             B and the tickets are marked B

                             there's the word 'Standing'

                             across the top of the tunnel,

                             and people would whether they

                             knew the layout of the ground or

                             not, would presumably want to go

                             towards that area?

43.11      MACKRELL          Yeah, but as ... I appreciate the

                             size was larger but there was also

                             a 'Standing' sign which I admit was

                             smaller to the right directing

                               people on to the pens in front of

                               the Police Control.    (Buzzer)
 43.26       DSU61             Yeah, this, the fact that other

                               signing indicating pens 1, 2, 6

                               and 7 is not very conspicuous

                              coupled with the fact that

                               supporters traditionally went

                              to stands, to the stand behind the

                              goals all increased the possibility

                              of overcrowding in the central

                              terraces, pens 3 and 4.     Am I

                              right?

            MACKRELL          Well you're right in obviously in

                              what happened on the day, but

                              one can only say that previously

                              that situation didn't occur.

                              Be it either previous two semi­

                              finals or league games where

                              there's a, a near to capacity

                              numbers on the terraces.
            DSU61             Okay.    The buzzer's just gone,

                              Mr MACKRELL.    If we can just

                              adjourn for a few minutes

                              while we load another tape in

                              then we'll resume the interview.

                              Okay.

            (1536)             the interview then, remember you're

                               still under caution and the same

                               people are still in the interview

                               room as previously.   Okay.

            MACKRELL           Yes.

            DSU61             We talked about the signing

                               indicating pens 1, 2, 6 and 7

                              not being very conspicuous and

                              discussed about the fans going

                              down the central terrace, that

                              area acting as a, a magnet if you

                              like.   In hindsight do you think

                              that the signing to other parts of

                              the terrace was inadequate and

                              likely to contribute to

                              overcrowding on those pens?
           MACKRELL           I think it's difficult to say in

                              hindsight, I think it, I think it

                              could be improved but whether it

                              was a factor I think is questionable.
01.03      DSU61              Fair enough.   Had the signing ever

                              been that the, what may be

                              inadequate signing, ever been

                              pointed out to you prior to the

                             disaster?
           MACKRELL          No.

                             about as well now.

                             now?

            MACKRELL           No.

01.15       DSU61              Is it something that you would

                               have expected EASTWOODS or the

                               Police or the Working Party

                              Advisory Group to have brought

                              to your notice, if they, if it

                              was inadequate?
            MACKRELL          If it was inadequate I suppose

                              I would have expected possibly

                              the Advisory Group to bring

                              it to my attention on the basis

                              that they bring matters which

                              if it's referred to you by

                              yourself as significant, they

                              bring through forward a great

                              deal of matters which are very

                              insignificant.
01.42      DSU61              Yeah.   As the Club Safety Officer

                              do you think that you should, you

                              should have foreseen this possibility

                              and perhaps done something about it?
           MACKRELL           It was something which obviously I

                             had seen, but you know, I can't

                             say now that I regarded it as of of

                             great importance.   I felt that what

                             was there was adequate, at that

                             time, obviously otherwise I would

                             have done something about it.

                               the courtyard in front of the

                               turnstiles I'm talking about now,

                              this is a comparatively small area

                              in which the whole large crowd, it's

                              shape which is like a bottleneck

                              does not help in that once people

                              are in it, and it becomes crowded

                              it is almost impossible to get them

                              out.     Was this ever a factor that

                              was recognised by the Club prior

                              to the disaster?
            MACKRELL          No, not, I can't say, I can't say

                              it has, you know when one looks at

                              the situation of comparing the

                              no better, no worse, than a lot of

02.49       DSU61             I see.    Did Dr EASTWOOD'S firm or

                             in the supervision ever point out

02.58       MACKRELL         There was, there was, there was a

                             scheme that was drawn up I think,

                               I think back to 1985 (000085) in

                               relation to changing the

                               configuration of the turnstiles

                               at Leppings Lane, but obviously

                              what, after that had been

                              completed and prior to any

                              implementation the Bradford

                              City Fire had occurred and

                              obviously there was a change

                              of emphasis of priorities.
            DSU61             Yeah.   Fair enough.   In fact you,

                              you're bringing me on to to the

                              next area.    If I can refer you

                              to your Document file for a minute,

                              the the plans that you're talking

                              about, to do with the rejigging of

                              the turnstiles in Leppings Lane.

                              For the audio I'm referring to
03.50                         DPP Document Numbers 63, 64 and 65.

                             Are these the plans that you're

                             referring to ...
            MACKRELL         Yes indeed.
04.03       DSU61            Mr MACKRELL?    Can you tell me were

                             those plans designed primarily

                             to achieve segregation or were

                             they designed to improve the

                             safety or both?
        MACKRELL             I think everything really is a

                             combination of both.




                                                                          859

            DSU61              Mm.    I noticed that, and in fact

                               you just made mention of it, that

                               in fact when this was put to the

                               Board, this, these various schemes

                               then, the Board turned the, turned

                              them down, they'd obviously turned

                              it down for financial reasons as

                              you mentioned given the Popplewell

                              that sort of was coming on top.
04.45       MACKRELL          That's right, there was a great

                              deal of expenditure and by

                              examining the records which

                              obviously I did when I made, gave

                              evidence to the Inquiry, that

                              year the Club spent two hundred

                              and forty three thousand pounds

                              on safety and associated works

                              in other areas of the ground so

                              it wasn't a matter of not spending

                              the money to keep or to spend on

                              something else, it was literally

                             the priorities obviously that came

                             up particularly in relation to wooden

                             structures whereas, where the main

                             stand at Sheffield Wednesday is, a

                             wooden structure.
           DSU61             So I mean the, the Club whilst they

                             employed Dr EASTWOOD'S firm as

                             Safety Consultants, they didn't

                                always act on his advice?
             MACKRELL           Well I can't quite actually mean ..

                                find another case when we didn't

                                actually act on his advice, this

                               was a situation here where a plan

                               and a scheme was drawn up and

                               obviously as a result of Bradford

                               City, the moment after that every

                               every Fire Service in the country

                               was knocking on Club's doors

                               regarding wooden structures.
05.50       DSU61              It does tend, I mean it does tend

                               to illustrate that they weren't

                               adverse to exercising their, if you

                               like independence when they needed

                               to of all ... (Interruption)
            MACKRELL           Well I think it shows also that

                               they weren't adverse to, to

                               spending money were they felt was

                               a, was a priority.
06.07       DSU61             Mn.   Do you think that erecting

                              dividing that court yard up,

                              improved the situation in ...?

                                  it's questionable in that you've got

                               other, you've got seme officers who

                              want speaking to on a policing

                              aspect who would prefer the turnstiles

                              to be right out on the road aspects so

                              there there's never any any element of

                              funnelling and you've got others who

                              want a larger configuration so that's,

                              it's not, it's not universal amongst

                              the Police when it canes to actually

            DSU61             I'm thinking really about trying

            MACKRELL          Yeah.

            DSU61             Something to organise.     I mean

                              some grounds, other grounds I've

                              seen, they've struck some things

                              like that, where they've got

                              barriers, steel barriers, similar

                              and 89 (000089) was that the

                              spectators tickets were checked, to

                              check to see if they had tickets

                              away from the ground by the Police.

           DSU61              Did you actually see that

                              happening?

           MACKRELL           No I had that reported to me by

           DSU61              Yeah.

           MACKRELL           that this was done and and I under­

                              stand, again I've only heard this

                              from other officers, maybe your own,

                              I'm not certain, or South Yorkshire,

                              that this did not in fact take place

                             this in the 89 (000089) Cup, in the

                              89 (000089) Cup.

           DSU61              In fact it did place, it may have

                             been to a more limited degree and

07.54                        I think it did take place.     Can

                             we now move on to deal with the

                              stage because it is already quite

                              in your transcript, but if I can

                             it was drawn up by Mr LOCK?

           MACKRELL          That's correct.

                             the Club.    Do you agree with that?

           MACKRELL          Yeah.

09.14      DSU61             That implies that they have

                             overall responsibility and to

                             that end they should, they should

                             ensure that stewards are properly

                             qualified.   Do you agree?




                                                                          864

                               how do you define overall

                               responsibility?

                              controlling or directing members of

                              the public who are entering or

                              leaving the ground.    Is that right?
           MACKRELL           Yes.

           DSU61              What do you understand by that?
           MACKRELL           Well I think it's as it says,

                              people coming into the ground all

                              the exits are manned by Sheffield

                              stewards and also directing people

                             to their, to their places,

                             particularly seating.
           DSU61             Yeah.    Do you envisage that it




                                                                            865

                                means that they would be on the

                                concourse at the rear of the

                               West terrace for example, sorry

                                the rear of the West Stand...
             MACKRELL           I think it...

             DSU61             directing people?
             MACKRELL           I don't think you can pick things

                               in isolation, I think you could say,

                               you know, as what what as required.

                               Because anything now with regard to

                               stewarding, stewarding is a, is a,

                               is a different, is a situation where

                               stewarding changes every every, every

                               game depending upon the opposition.
11.00       DSU61              Mm.    Can I now refer you to the writ,

                               the written instructions that were

                               issued to the stewards I think and

                               I'm referring initially to the

                               Director of Public Prosecutions

                               Document Number 1, which is a

                              hand book I think ...
            MACKRELL          Yeah.
            DSU61             Mr MACKRELL, that goes to the

                              First of all you find that there

                              are these in the instructions in

                              this booklet to your stewards and

                              then there are a series of other

                             what seems to be a series anyway

                             of other instructions to stewards

                             and on these are also stamped

                             DPP Document 1 for the audio.

                             Can you tell roe, I say there

                             seems to be two or three of these,

                             can you tell roe which one of those

                             is actually in force?
11.58      MACKRELL          The situation and it's an ongoing

                             thing, each time the year, the

                             year these were forwarded to

                             usually Inspector SEWELL of South

                             Yorkshire Police for his comments

                             of anything he wanted us on the

                             stewarding.
           DSU61             Yes.

           MACKRELL         The arrangements, it was basically

                            the situation that was the one that

                            was issued at that present time to

                            the, to the stewards.
           DSU61            This is the one...
           MACKRELL         This one for example here was...
           DSU61            From the hand book you're talking

                            about?
        MACKRELL            Yeah, yeah the one here you referred




                                                                         867
MACKRELL               GRAHAM HENRY                                 153


                               you before...

            DSU61              Yeah.

12.30       MACKRELL           Document Number 43 was purely a

                               Document issued by, to me by Doug

                              LOCK.

            DSU61             So it wasn't a, addressed, it seems

                              to indicate that it was circulated

                              to management...

            MACKRELL          That was issued only to me ...,
           DSU61              generally.

           MACKRELL           only to me.   I might have given it

                              to               but it was not

                              issued to any other other than me.
           DSU61              Would it go to the Chief Stewards

                              that Document or one of the

                              management?
           MACKRELL           No that was really, that was a

                              discussion Document, for me that

                              wasn't an implementation Document,

                              that was something he produced for

                             me.

           DSU61              It does seem to be something if I

                             may say so, a little bit more than

                             that, it seems to be.
           MACKRELL          I think that if you look at it, most

                             of it's cribbed out the Green Guide,

                             you know he's actually played with

                             a photocopy of it and put it

                             together.




                                                                          868
MACKRELL              GRAHAM HENRY                                   154

            DSU61             I'd certainly agree with it sane of

                              it's out of the Green Guide.

           MACKRELL           Yeah.
           DSU61              But I mean that's...
           MACKRELL          But that was it, that was, it was

                             produced for that and not

                             circulated like to other Chief

                             Stewards or other members of the

                             staff.
13.18      DSU61             So what are you actually saying

                             they were acting under the

                             instructions in the handbook?
           MACKRELL          Yes.

           DSU61             And those are the instructions.
           MACKRELL          Those are the instructions that

                             they were, they were issued with.
13.38      DSU61             It hasn't got a set document

                             number.   Okay none of those instruc­

                             tions so far as I can see in the

                             hand book that you're referring to

                            Mr MACKRELL seemed to reflect the

                            element of control and direction of

                            members of the public entering or

                            leaving the ground mentioned in the

                            management information Document

                            prepared by Mr LOCK.     Is that an

                            oversight perhaps on the Club's

                            behalf?

        MACKRELL            No I think it's not sir, I think that




                                                                           869

                               it's, the the parts are covered on

                               their duties.

            DSU61              Well it doesn't, it doesn't talk of,

                               I mean it talks about the managing,

                              manning gates?

            MACKRELL          Yeah.

            DSU61              In and out of the ground ... ?

            MACKRELL          Yeah.

            DSU61             and keeping them open.
           MACKRELL           Spectators sitting in correct

                              seats.

           DSU61              That's right in regard to

                              stewards in the stands...

           MACKRELL           Yeah yeah.
14.22      DSU61              but it doesn't actually talk about

                              directing people ... (Interruption)

                              to pens when they enquire, things

                              like that?

           MACKRELL           Well I I think, my interpretation

                              of that is implicit.
           DSU61              Fair enough.     I mean I would say

                              that those instructions are more

                              in the nature of an administrative

                              information sheet almost, to the,

                             to the stewards.

           MACKRELL          Yeah ... but but you got you got to

                             read there's also an instruction that

                             these are issued at the same time

                             as, and they go, then they go through




                                                                            870

                              and obviously I think they need, they

                              need to be regarded in conjunction

                             with those items.
15.05      DSU61              I think in your transcript you

                             actually talk about being present

                             at the steward's training.

           MACKRELL          Yes.
           DSU61             Can you tell me whether that was

                             reflected in the training, the the

                             business ...?
15.16      MACKRELL          I understood it to be.   I addressed,

                             I addressed the group in brief and

                             then it was left to Mr LOCK, then

                             a representative of South Yorkshire

                             Police which is usually Inspector

                             SEWELL then there was a gentleman

                             from the South Yorkshire Fire Service

                             and generally it was the St John's

                             Ambulance Brigade - it has been the

                             SYMAS.
           DSU61             Yeah, but I mean none, none of them

                             seem to be acting in a capacity

                            other than manning the gate or

                            manning, manning stands and and

                            assisting people to their seat.

                            And I do accept that I mean as far

                            as public order is concerned their

                            instructions are that they don't




                                                                            871

                                get involved in public order

                                situations and that the Police ...

                                have the prime responsibility to

                               deal with those.    (Pause).
 16.02       MACKRELL          Yeah, I hear what, I hear what, I

                               hear what you say you know, but I

                               I regard that, you know, I I regard

                               that they're reasonably clear

                               and that I don't think there's

                               any impression that they wouldn't

                               understood what their duties were.
16.18       DSU61              My, the management document also

                               mentions manning of the entrances

                               exits and other strategic points.

                               My enquiries show that there was

                               no stewards on the concourse area

                               behind the West Stand on the gates

                               between the concourse areas or

                               on the tunnel.   I see those

                               actually as strategic points ...
            MACKRELL          Well I___

            DSU61             key strategic points.   Can you

                              explain to me why w...?
16.38       MACKRELL          Yeah, they had stewards on Gate C

                              who were there and that Gate C is

                              the best situation within the

                              concourse to monitor, to monitor

                              the concourse cause you're at the,

                                situation, and also you've got,

                                there was a steward on the wall

                               which bisects the back of the

                               West Stand.

             DSU61              In the gate of, at the gate in

                               the wall?

             MACKRELL          Yes.

             DSU61             Giving access to the area of the

                               West Stand?

             MACKRELL          That bisects the the West Stand.
             DSU61             Can you just clarify that for me?
            MACKRELL           Yeah.
            DSU61              Can you, would you like to

                               indicate that?    Yeah Mr MACKRELL

                               is, is indicating the, the gap

                               in the wall, as he says bisecting

                               the concourse area behind the

                               West Stand giving access to the

                               entrance to the, to the West Stand

                               seating area.    Is that right Me

                              MACKRELL?
17.40       DSU61             There doesn't appear though to be

                              any other, other stewards in that

                              area, and I'll accept what you're

                              saying, that you've got steward

                              on the gate.

        MACKRELL              And you've got also stewards ...
            DSU61             The C Gate this is?

        MACKRELL              and you've got stewards also at the

                              bottom of the stair, of the stairs

                              that lead up into the West Stand.
            DSU61             Right, but there's nobody actually, on

                              on that concourse or indeed on any of

                              the other concourses with the general

                             responsibility which to me seems to

                             be implicit in the management document

                             at least, for direct, for the purpose

                             of direction and control of people

                             that are coming into the ground?
18.15      MACKRELL          Well I ... well with respect, in the,

                             a very small space you've got at least

                             seven people, three on gate, three on

                             Gate C, at least three or four at the

                             bottom of the West Stand, South West

                             entrance, and one on the gate.      I

           DSU61             These people are all dealing with

                             specific responsibilities in relation

                             to the gate, they're not dealing with

                             general responsibilities like

                            direction and ... (Interruption)
           MACKRELL         Well, I'm not, with respect I'm

MACKRELL              GRAHAM HENRY


                              are, they all are there to enhance

                              the viewing of the public, you know

                              they're all officers of the company,

                              however low down, low down the

                             scale and, they would be expected

                             to deal with reasonable requests

                             of asking for where toilets are,

                             whatever duties, because it's part

                             of the brief to familiarise them­

                             selves with the, with the area to

                             which they are located.
19.13      DSU61             They do seem to have congregated

                             as you say behind the gate, or

                             they are actually in the entrance

                             to the Stands.

           MACKRELL          Yeah.

           DSU61             They're together.   I mean is your

                             understanding of what they should

                             have been doing then?
           MACKRELL          No, what I'm saying that that

                             they're grouped to three.   We're not

                             talking about something which is

                            very far apart.   You know the

                            entrance from going through

                            those turnstiles to where the

                            C gate is and to where the

                            other chaps are, you you're never

                            more than ten yards away from

                            from a steward.

            DSU61              When you ccme through the

                               the tunnel and the West Stand.
            MACKRELL          Yes. (Overtalking)     You go past a

                              steward, you go past a steward.

                              Excuse me if I may.     You've you've

                              got stewards literally situated

                              there, which is on Gate C.
            DSU61             You're indicating C gate.
20.00      MACKRELL           I'm mentioning C gate.     You've

                              got another steward here, which

                              is on the gate which I referred

                              to previously, the hole in the

                              wall ...

           DSU61              Right.

           MACKRELL           and you've got more stewards here.

                              In addition to that you've got

                              prograitme sellers which are, which

                              are located in the area.
           DSU61             Yeah but the steward that's

                              in the gate in the wall.
           MACKRELL          Yeah.

           DSU61             Can be either side of that

                             wall.

           MACKRELL          No he's on, no the steward on

                             the wall is on the ...
           DSU61             Either side...
        MACKRELL             is internal.   Sorry... I'm sorry,



                                                                            8 76
MACKRELL               GRAHAM HENRY


                               the Gate C yes.   He can be on on

                               that situation but specifically the

                               people going through turnstiles

                              A to G have to walk past the three

                               stewards who are on Gate C.
            DSU61             Yeah, well they're off to their

                              right as they ccme through.
            MACKRELL          It's not very, it's not, it's it's

                              not actually a, it's only a bank

                              of seven turnstiles.
20.42       DSU61             Would you have expected those

                              stewards to be spread out on

                              that concourse as opposed to being

                              on the gate? (Overtalking)
           MACKRELL           No, because it's their, it's it's a

                              safety requirement and there must

                              be always a minimum of two, of two

                              stewards on that gate, so we put

                              three there as a back up in case

                              one wants to go to the toilet, one

                              is called away for seme other, seme

                             other reason, to pass a message or

                             whatever.

           DSU61             So in fact they're working, within

                             their terms of reference?
           MACKRELL          Yeah, they're working with their terms

                             of reference but they are expected

                             to do.

        DSU61                To fast ...?
 MACKRELL               GRAHAM HENRY


             MACKRELL           To be normal things, they are

                                kind of, you know, kind of

                                courtesy element that one has to

                                do with the job.

             DSU61              I mean the, the stewards on the bottom

                               of the stand.

             MACKRELL          Yeah.

             DSU61             on that concourse, that stand,

                               that stand area, was was that used,

                               that entrance to the stand off...



            MACKRELL           Yes, yes it was.

            DSU61              off the concourse fed by A to G?
21.32       MACKRELL           It, that was, people came through

                               there because people were

                               coming through 9 to 16 to go up

                               into the West Stand.
21.49       DSU61              Fair enough.    One last question

                               to do with that, I mean

                               presumably the Police approved

                               the number of stewards who were

                              working in these areas anyway

                               and you act in consultation with

                              the Police when you do that?
            MACKRELL          Yes.

            DSU61             Yeah?

            MACKRELL          Yes.

            DSU61             If stewards had been at the

                              strategic locations and aware of
 MACKRELL              GRAHAM HENRY


                               their responsibilities for

                               controlling or directing meanbers

                               of the public entering the ground

                               they would perhaps have been in

                              the position to recognise the

                              volume of supporters that had

                              gone down the tunnel and to

                              direct them away from it and

                              pens 3 and 4 round the wings

                              into pens 1, 2, 6 and 7.   Do

                              you agree?

            MACKRELL          I don't, I I it's difficult, I

                              can't, I'm not qualified to say,

                              at which stage, at what time that
22.34                         pen became overfilled.   If it was

                              in a situation which it became

                              overfilled after the gate had

                              been opened, after Gate C had been

                              opened, I don't think anybody

                              could have possibly have have

                             directed that, that group of

                             people.
22.46       DSU61            This is at 1452 (1452) when Mr

                             DUCKENFIELD gave the order to

                             open the gates?
        MACKRELL             Yes.
        DSU61                Yeah.    If it was before that, I

                             mean there is a suggestion that

                             the, those pens were beccrrming




                                                                   679

                              overcrowded before that?

           MACKRELL           Sure.

           DSU61              Let me say not overcrowding

                              necessarily, but there was an

                              uneven distribution.

23.03      MACKRELL           Yeah but the situation was, was

                              it was accepted that the Police

                             were on were stewarding pens.

                              The police had got the close

                              circuit television, the Police

                             Control Box is right above the

                              area where it took place. You know

                              I, I would regard that as being

                             the prime Police responsibility.

           DSU61             To monitor the pens.

           MACKRELL          To monitor, to monitor that

                             situation.

           DSU61             Yeah, I think you dealt with

                             that in seme detail again in

           MACKRELL          Yes.

23.30      DSU61             previously.   Did the stewards at

                             Leppings Lane end have any direct

                             responsibility towards the

                             supporters apart from opening gates

                             and manning the turnstiles and

                              supporters with tickets for seats

                              gained access to the West Stand.
            DSU61             Yeah.   I'm really, what I'm

                              really coning back to is this

                             direction and control and

                              interpretation of direction and

                             control?

           MACKRELL          No I think there's as I say it

                             goes on from what I said

                             previously.

           DSU61             I accept that the reason of no

                             stewards actually on the West

                             terrace because the Liverpool

                             supporters were likely to be

                             hostile, but dealing with gates

                             in the perimeter fence, there does

                             seem to be a dis, disagreement or
24.12                        at least a mis... misunderstanding.

                             Your management information

                             document does say that stewards

                             will man gates which are not

                             continuously open whilst the

                             ground is in use.   Is that

                            right?

           MACKRELL         My, iry management document yeah,

                            iry management document was an

                               said that the management document

                               to be fully implemented.    The

                              management document was, was states

                               that however the situation was that

                              the gates onto the track were always

                              manned by the Police.
             DSU61            I, I understand, was it the

                              position with the gates at the

                              front of the pen onto the

                              perimeter track that these be

                              manned by the Police and that

                              that's been, has that been the

                              situation for seme time?
            MACKRELL          That's been the situation indeed.
            DSU61             How long, how long has that been?
            MACKRELL          Ever since I've been at the Club.
            DSU61             So it's taken place before you...
            MACKRELL          Yes indeed.
25.06       DSU61             presumably.   Is there any

                              agreement, written agreement in

                              force as far as you know to do

                             with that, or is it just scmething

                             that's beccme a precedent?
            MACKRELL         The written agreement now that

                             we have with South Yorkshire Police

                             is considerably different to that

                             which was current on that day.
            DSU61            Was there one actually in force

                             a written agreement?



                                                                           832

             MACKRELL           No, no.

             DSU61              It was an understanding between

                                you and the Commanders, or

                               your your predecessors?

             MACKRELL           No it was an understanding,

                               understanding, exactly and it

                               was a situation, it was scmething

                               that the Police had never

                               approached me to say, why

                               aren't your chaps doing this job.

                               It was obviously that they

                               accepted that it was a job that

                               they did.
25.40       DSU61              Mm.     Fair enough.   Was that

                               agreement ever taken up with

                               Chief Superintendent DUCKENFIELD

                               when he took over from Chief,

                               Chief Superintendent Mnr.Fi?
            MACKRELL           No.

            DSU61              Or did you assume the situation

                               would be allowed to continue?
25.49       MACKRELL           I assumed the situation would be

                               be continued because Mr DUCKENFIELD

                              only had I believe might be one match

                              prior to the semi-final.      I believe

                              he took carmand on the 27th of...
            DSU61             March.

            MACKRELL          27th of March, I think he came to

                              the last match where Brian MOLE
                                                                               04




                                                                              0O

                               was commanding...   I stand to be

                               corrected, I, it's just an opinion

                               that I think that happened and I'm

                               not sure after that I think there

                              might have been one game at which

                              he was there.
 26.16       DSU61            But I mean it was never, it was

                              never put up that there may be a

                              problem about manning those gates

                              or who should man them at all?
            MACKRELL          Not at all, not at all.
            DSU61             This is the front perimeter gates.
            MACKRELL          Exactly, you know, quite honestly

                              the, there wasn't a great, there

                              wasn't a great discussion about

                              policing at all, it was a matter

                              of obviously following on from

                              what Mr MOLE had already already

                              set up.
            DSU61             It was a bit early for him to make

                             any changes in any case ...
            MACKRELL         I would have thought so because ...
            DSU61            until he understood what he was

                             doing?

         MACKRELL            he obviously wanted to get his

                             feet under the table I assume.
26.43    DSU61               What about the gates at the back

                             of the pens under the front of the

                             West Stand, it does, does seem to




                                                                    884

                              be some dispute about who was

                              responsibile for manning them

                              the Police or stewards or indeed

                              whether they should be manned at

                              all.   What's your understanding of

                              that situation?

           MACKRELL           Well the situation there is that

                              I understand, there were definitely

                              not Sheffield Wednesday stewards

                              on that area, it was left, it was

                              a situation that that was left to

                              the Police.   However, because of

                              the fact obviously that all the pens

                              have a mutual toilet, refreshment

                              facility, there always is going to

                              be seme flow between the various

                             pens.

27.19      DSU61              Is it, does it make any differences

                             as to whether the gates are closed or

                             open as to whether they're manned?

           MACKRELL           I think, I'm not aware of that,

                              I'm not aware of any difference.

                             But as I say because, because it

                             was a situation that was in the

                             hands of the Police.

27.37      DSU61             Yeah, fair enough.     Did you

                             appreciate that because of their

                             location towards the back of the pen

                             under the stand they were difficult
 MACKRELL               GRAHAM HENRY                                     171


                                to see and because of this when

                                the pens were crowded supporters

                                needed some assistance to achieve

                                any even spread?

             MACKRELL          Well I was aware obviously of

                               where the location of the gates

                               were, but again it goes right back

                               to what I say that the the pen

                               the configuration of it had been

                               approved by the, had of been approved

                               by the Local Licensing Authority.
            DSU61              Yeah, but the, that doesn't

                               actually answer the question.       Did

                               you appreciate that because of

                               their location towards the back of

                               the pen, in other words you

                               personally, under the stand, they

                               were difficult to see and because

                               of this when the pens were crowded,

                               supporters needed sate assistance

                               to achieve an even spread.    Did

                               you appreciate that?
28.24       MACKRELL           Yeah, I don't think it would have

                               made any difference where so ever

                               where the gates were, if because

                               by definition if the pens full you

                               hardly, you're going to struggle to

                               see the gates wherever they are.
            DSU61              So what you're saying that you did

                                appreciate but it wouldn't have

                                made any difference whether they

                                were there or otherwise?

                                (Overtalking)
             MACKRELL          The thing is I acknowledged where

                               they were when, when any ground is

                                full it's difficult, it's difficult

                               to move about and I don't think that

                               that really had a factor, had a

                               factor on it.
 28.50      DSU61              Was there, has there ever been any

                               other sort of problems with crowds

                               achieving the even distribution...
            MACKRELL           No.

            DSU61              through those gates?
            MACKRELL           No.

            DSU61              I mean, presumably the same

                               situation again applied in 1988

                               (000088) and 1987 (000087) did it?
            MACKRELL           That's right.    We didn't, it didn't

                              present a problem.
            DSU61             No problem?
            MACKRELL          No.
29.12       DSU61             Do you believe that there was a

                              failure between you and the police

                              to allocate responsibility for

                              unarming those gates?
29.19    MACKRELL             I I don't believe so in that

                              there was, it was a situation




                                                                             687

                                  that was in the hands of the

                                  Police, the Police never did

                                  anything to say that it wasn't

                                  their responsibility to do so.
             DSU61               Conversely you never did anything

                                 to clarify the situation with

                                 the Police?

            MACKRELL             No but having said that, there

                                 wasn't, there wasn't, there

                                 wasn't a written agreement

                                 between the parties and I

                                 inherited an arrangement which

                                 had obviously successfully

                                 worked and had successfully

                                 worked for the two previous

                                 semi-finals when I was in, when

                                 I was in charge.
29.46       DSU61                Wasn't there an agreement between

                                 the Working Party that the Police

                                would in fact man those gates.

                                Are you aware of that?

            O'CALLAGHAN          It was a condition of of the

                                radial fences being put in,

                                the Officer Working Party

                                inposed the condition that

                                there would be gates at the back

                                which would be manned by the Police.
30.06   DSU61                   Okay.    Do you believe that there

                                was a failure in 1989 (000089)
MACKRELL              GRAHAM HENRY                                174


                              to locate stewards on the

                              concourse area behind the West

                              Stand to direct and control the

                              supporters entering away from the

                              tunnel and around the wings into

                              pens 1, 2, 6 and 7?

           MACKRELL           No I think there was sufficient

                              numbers there.

           DSU61              Earlier in this interview we

                              touched on the monitoring of

                              the crowd in relation to

                              compliance with the Safety

                              Certificate, Schedule 3, and

                              I am still particularly

                              interested in the West terrace.

                             Given that there were no

                              stewards on either the terrace

                             or the concourse behind the

                             stand and the fact that the

                             Green Guide stipulates that

                             the Club oblique stroke

                             stewards should monitor the

                             situation in regard to crowd

                             capacity in the pens, how how

                             did you fulfil your obligations?

30.52      MACKRELL          There was an obligation taken on

                             by the, taken on by the Police

                             in that the Police were, the

                             Police had accepted that they




                                                                        889
MACKRELL              GRAHAM HENRY                                 175


                              monitored and stewarded the and

                              stewarded the West Terrace.
           DSU61              This is from the Control Box?

           MACKRELL           From the Control Box, visually

                              from the track because they they

                              looked after the perimeter gates

                             and by way of close circuit

                             television.

           DSU61             To be fair though, don't you think

                             that, don't you think that you're

                             abrogating your responsibilities by

                             saying, it's not, is it just as

                             simple as that the Police are

                             watching from the Box, therefore

                             they must be monitoring, they're

                             doing it be agreement?
31.26      MACKRELL          No, but at the end of the day the

                             Police are always adamant to me of

                             regarding close circuit

                             television refinements to the

                             close circuit television to be

                             done.   The Club has, we as a

                             Club probably spend more money

                            on close circuit television than

                            any other Club in the country in

                            upgrading, adding bits on to it,

                            and you know, I would regard that

                            as one of, one of the reasons why

                            we're doing that.




                                                                         610

 31.45      DSU61             But don't you think your stewards

                              should also have had some sort of

                              a function, the Green Guide, which

                              I accept isn't mandatory, does

                              lay down that they, that stewards

                              have a responsibility for

                             assisting the even distribution

                             of supporters, directing...

           MACKRELL          Sure, but on, but as, taking the

                             point that you ...
           DSU61             Also this general duty of care

                             of course that the Club has.

           MACKRELL          Of course a general duty of care

                             which one, which one accepts.

                             However, however it was a

                             situation where the Police and I

                             think it goes down if one refers

                             back to the transcripts that

                             the Police accepted that it was

                             their responsibility to steward,

                             steward that area of the terrace.
32.27      DSU61             Okay.   You mention in your statement

                             to the Inquiry, Mr MACKRELL, that

                             you notice the uneven

           MACKRELL          At that time I did not.     But

                             obviously as it, as it later

                             you know, kind of went onto

                             that time.

                             can have a look, for the audio,

                            a much higher level than you

                            would be when you went out to

                            get at is, is the difference in the

                            distribution on that terrace, pen

                            that's ... and particular on in pens

                               are opened on the authority of

                              the Police.    We're looking now

                              at 1445 (1445) for the audio

                              and we're looking at the North

                              panning along towards pens 3

                              and 4.    In fact we're now

                              looking at pens 3 and 4 at

35.12                         You can see there that there's

                              quite a considerable difference

                              in the density. (Fades away).

                              What I'm getting at is, when you

                              went in and out and I appreciate

                              that you're obviously doing other

                              things.

            MACKRELL          Yeah.

            DSU61             Did you notice that, I mean

                              distribution at all?
            MACKRELL          I didn't notice anything in

                             distribution until afterwards

                             no.
35.37       DSU61            Mr LOCK, I think came to you.
            MACKRELL         Yeah.

             MACKRELL           No, no.
             DSU61             He hadn't noticed anything like

36.50       DSU61             Yeah.   I mean the only point

                              I'm trying to make here is you

                              were together with Mr LOCK

36.56       DSU61            At a time when the pens, those

                             uneven distribution or there

                             seems to be from the film an
MACKRELL              GRAHAM HENRY


                              uneven distribution.    Nowall I'm

                              trying to point, the only point

                              I'm trying to make is...

           MACKRELL           It wasn't apparent from when

                             we had the conversation.
           DSU61             Okay and he didn't tell you

                             about it?

           MACKRELL          Well obviously he, he I I would

                             assume he hadn't noticed it

                             either.
37.23      DSU61             You were out on the pitch when

                             Mr IOCK told you of the entry

                             of the three or four hundred

                             supporters.   Did you look at

                             the terraces stand to consider

                             the effect of this inflow into

                             those terraces?

           MACKRELL          I, when Mr LOCK I thought with

                             regard to the numbers of people

                             who came in, I asked him how many

                             it was, and he thought about

                             three to four hundred.   Under

                             that basis I thought that

                            wouldn't have presented too

                            much of a problem if it had

                            been contained at that number.

                            Because statistically one always

                            gets a percentage of supporters

                            who don't turn up for matches.

                                three or four per cent. People

             DSU61             You can absorb it?

             MACKRELL          You you, I felt that the three

                               hundred we could have absorbed it,

                               you know on on that basis, that

                               three hundred to ten thousand we

                               probably at fair wind would have

                               been reasonable to accept that we

                               could have absorbed that.

38.20       DSU61              Fair enough.   Just one or

                               two quick points now Mr MACKRELL.

                              After the disaster happened, you,

                               I believe, accompanied members of

                              what was going to happen to the

                               went up there because I think it's

                               referred to...
40.40       DSU61              This is before you went back with

            MACKRELL          I just made the point there because

            DSU61             I think you've already mentioned

                              earlier in your ...
            MACKRELL          I don't mention by name in my

                              statement.
            DSU61             Mm.
41.27       MACKRELL          I know that there was the Chairman

                              of Nottingham Forest, Maurice

                              ROWORTH.

41.32       MACKRELL         There was the Chairman of Liverpool,

                             John SMITH.   Then there was Bert

                             McGEE and there was one or two

                             other directors from the, from

                             each club.

            DSU61            Yes.

        MACKRELL             and then there was frcrn the

                                Club Committee.   They were there.

                                Glen KIRTON and Graham KELLY with

                                regard to what was happening.
 42.05      DSU61               So what what can you remember,

                               what did, can you remember Mr,

                               Mr DUCKENFIELD addressing the

                               board?

             MACKRELL          No Mr DUCKENFIELD was addressing

                               them as I was speaking to Mr LOCK.

                               I don't, I cannot recount Mr

                               DUCKENFIELD'S statement, you know

                               his actual comments, comments,

                               he was talking, I was talking

                               to Doug LOCK because as I,

                               as he came in to the room to

                               say that Brian CLOUGH had told

                               him that his team were going

                               off.

            DSU61              Yes.

            MACKRELL           but I can, I was not sat in the

                               same way as I'm listening to

                              you, heard what Mr DUCKENFIELD

                               said to ...

42.31       DSU61             Did did Mr JACKSON address the

                              group as well in the boardroom,

                              yeah?

            MACKRELL          I believe one... Mr JACKSON

                              only addressed them in the way



                                                                           9

                                of the match and how that was

                                going to be conducted.
             DSU61              You don't, can you recall any

                               conversation about...

                                (Interruption).
             MACKRELL          I...
             DSU61             How the, how the influx

                               ocurred, the...
            MACKRELL           I only had that related to

                               me afterwards by one of my own

                               directors and I didn't hear it

                               third, first hand from Mr

                               DUCKENFIELD.
            DSU61              Can you tell me which director

                               that was?

                               (Pause).
43.05       MACKRELL           I think, I think it was the

                               Chairman, I, I just it's...
            DSU61             Mr McGEE?

            MACKRELL          Yeah, it's just very confusing

                              obviously you know cause I've

                              been...

            DSU61             It's a long time ago.
        MACKRELL              It's a long time ago from that

                              because obviously it wasn't

                              something that until the

                              following morning as it ended

                              up transpired that when I
MACKRELL              GRAHAM HENRY                                    188


                              actually played the tape myself

                              of the the shot that I think

                              everybody's seen over the

                              turnstiles A to G, I actually

                              saw what what had happened...

           DSU61              Yeah.

43.36      MACKRELL           and that, because the initial

                              situation of one was told was that

                              fence, the gates had been,

                              (buzzer) the gates had been

                              broken and you know people had

                              forced an entry.

           DSU61              Yeah, okay.     I think we're

                              probably at a suitable point

                             Mr MACKRELL to adjourn again

                             while we change the tape.        We'll

                              switch the... Mr TOPE will switch

                             the tape off and we'll change it

                             over and then we'll carry on

                             with the interview.

44.02                         (Tape switched off). (1620)

00.09      DSU61             Yeah to resume the interview now

           (1621)            that the tape has been replaced Mr

                             MACKRELL, just a few more points

                             to put to you then we'll be

00.20                        finished.      Is it the case that

                             the Club's systems of monitoring

                             both at the turnstiles and inside

                             the ground failed to identify
MACKRELL              GRAHAM HENRY


                              the uneven distribution in pens

                              3 and 4 by 1445 (1445) 1450 hours

                              (1450) and to warn the Police and

                              the stewards accordingly, in

                              order that they could take the

                              appropriate action?

00.40      MACKRELL           The Club's systems that on the

                              turnstiles are only capable of

                              actually monitoring the global

                              number of people that come into

                              the area.   Following on from that

                              it's a matter of dispersing people

                             within the, with the terrace area

                              and as stated previously that is a

                              function that has been left to the

                              Police.

           DSU61             Even so far as the concourse areas

                             are concerned and feeding, and

                              feeding it in and monitoring it

                              from that point of view?

01.17      MACKRELL          Well no I have, I have, you know I

                             did, as I stated previously, I did

                             have people on the concourse by way

                             of ex—     emergency exit C on the wall

                             bisecting the West Stand and on the

                             South and on the South West entrance

                             to the West Stand and I regarded that

                             as sufficient number of people.

01.40      DSU61             It does seem that the Club failed
MACKRELL              GRAHAM HENRY                                 190


                              to heed experience of crushing

                              oblique stroke injuries in 1981

                              (000081) and to learn from them by

                              adequately reviewing their

                              performance.   I accept that they

                              took advice from the Police and

                              in fact as a result of that

                             crushing in 1981 (000081) they
                                               I
                             put up the radial fences and

                              that but I, I I wondered whether

                             they did enough.

           MACKRELL          Well obviously I can't speak for

                             previous people's actions only to

                             say that I feel sure that it would

                             have, it was enough to satisfy

                             the Local Authority Working Party

                             otherwise the Police would not

                             have let the matter rest.

02.28      DSU61             Despite knowledge of the problems

                             in 1981 (000081) the Club failed

                             to ensure proper capacities for

                             all pens and a system to monitor

                             then in accordance with the Green

                             Guide 1976 (000076) and 1986

                             (000086) was in place.

           MACKRELL          Well the situation regarding the

                             Safety Certificate was that there

                             was, the capacities were a global

                             figure for that area and so there
 MACKRELL              GRAHAM HENRY                                  191


                               was, that was the way that the

                               Club monitored it by way of a

                               global figure and as as it was

                               required by us under the standards

                               of the Safety Certificate.
 03.02       DSU61             It also appears that the Club did

                              not provide adequate signing in

                              Pens 1, 2, 6 and, to 1, 2, 6 pens

                               1, 2, 6 and 7.   Do you agree with

                              that?
            MACKRELL          I think the signing possibly in

                              hindsight could have been better

                              but I don't regard it as a

                              significant factor.
03.22       DSU61             Neither do you regard the tickets

                              and the confusion that they may or

                              may not have been there?

            MACKRELL          I think the ticketing situation was

                              not ideal but I think it was

                              perfectly adequate in, particularly

                              in light of the fact that the

                              colour codings were put on, they

                              were put on to the satisfaction

                              and to the actual places where the

                              Police required then.
03.48       DSU61             I see okay.   I'd like to just leave

                              the room for a couple of minutes,

                             okay?

            MACKRELL         Fine.

                                   have to switch anything off because

                                  Mr MACKRELL and yourself are still

                                  and you can see that the tapes

                                  are still playing.

             O'CALLAGHAN          Yes.

                                  re-entering the roan for the audio.

                                  We've spent something like the

                                  last three hours or so Mr

                                  MACKRELL asking you a number of

                                  questions.   Is there anything

                                  that you feel that we haven't

                                  covered but we should have covered

                                  perhaps, that you want to talk about,

                                  is there anything that you feel

                                  you want to address, given the line

                                  of questioning that I've put to you?
            MACKRELL              I can't think initially myself.
            DSU61                Would you like to consult with

                                 your solicitor?

            MACKRELL             I think that's a valid point obviously

                                 that in relation to the 1985 (000085)



                                                                                907

             DSU61              Can you speak up a bit?
 06.00       MACKRELL           Yeah.   In relation to the 1985

                                (000085) alterations, it was never

                                never emphasized or make, or put over

                               that there was a safety element to

                               the actual work that was involved

                               in changing the configuration and

                               that if the Board had felt that that

                               was, had been a priority within the

                               the alterations then obviously maybe

                               a different tack would have been

                               would have been taken.

            DSU61              Who would you have expected to

                               bring that to your attention then?
            MACKRELL           I think if that's, it's an element

                               I think obviously initially it would

                               become a Police and Advisory Group,

                               an Advisory Group matter cause the

                               matter was drawn up to the, at the

                               request of the Police.
            DSU61              Not EASTWOODS?
06.43       MACKRELL          Well East..., EASTWOODS drew the

                               scheme up in response to a request

                               from the Police.

            DSU61             Yeah, that that was in 1981 (000081)

                              and 1985 (000085), you're talking

                              about post, post those periods.     I

            DSU61                 the West Stand?

            O'CALLAGHAN          The configuration for the Lappings

                                 Lane turnstiles, the consideration

                                 of altering that configuration was

                                 first raised by the Police who

                                 submitted to the Club a proposed

                                 sketch ...

            DSU61                Yes.
07.15      O'CALLAGHAN           that they said they would like the

                                 Club to consider with a view to

                                 effecting better segregation of heme

                                 and away supporters and it was as a

                                 result of that approach to the Police

                                 that EASTWOOD looked at the schane

                                 and produced his, his alternative

                                 schemes for increasing the number

                                 of turnstiles and having separate

                                 turnstiles for each area.     That was

                                 done following the initial approach

                                 to the Police who were concerned

                                 about segregation but the only

                                 issue that appears frcm the

                                minutes and the records at the time

                                was that the consideration was

                                segregation.
           DSU61                I'm sorry I think we're at cross




                                                                                909
 MACKRELL                  GRAHAM HENRY


                                   purposes there, I thought you were

                                   talking about the radial fencing

                                   on the pens 1 ...

             O'CALLAGHAN           No.

            DSU61                  sorry on the pens 3 and 4.   You're

                                   actually talking about the ...

            O'CALLAGHAN           The, the ...

            DSU61                 rejigging of the turnstile area.
08.06       O'CALLAfflAN          Yes when the, when the question of

                                  rejigging the turnstiles was first

                                  raised it was raised by the Police.,
            DSU61                 Yes.

            O'CALLAGHAN           who actually submitted a scheme

                                  saying they would like the Club to

                                  consider changing the configuration

                                  to achieve better segregation

                                  because at that time that end of

                                  the ground was being used for heme

                                  and away supporters.
            DSU61                 Yes.
08.26       O'CALLAfflAN          And it was as a result of that

                                  approach from the Police that

                                  EASTWOOD looked at it, produced

                                  his schemes and the Club were

                                  actively considering those

                                  schemes in connection with other

                                 matters at that end of the

                                 ground, sought planning permission.

                                 In fact as I recollect got
MACKRELL                 GRAHAM HENRY


                                 planning permission but then the

                                 the Bradford City Fire situation

                                 intravened and resources were

                                 switched elsewhere to dealing

                                with much greater expenditure

                                 in relation to the South Stand.

                                The point that's being made

                                is that the Board in considering

                                whether they could and should

                                proceed with the alterations for

                                the lappings Lane turnstiles, did

                                not consider it in the light of

                                it being a safety question.
           DSU61                Yeah.

09.11      O'CALLAGHAN          It was solely segregation of fans

                                and the Board have said to me

                                that had had it been put to then

                                at that time that it was required

                                for safety reasons then a

                                different complexion would have

                                been put on it and they would have

                                looked at it ... (Interruption)
           DSU61                I entirely accept that it was,

                               you know, it was put as a

                               segregation, to assist segregation.

                               In fact I think the safety, safety

                               benefits from it were probably a

                               spin off...

           O'CALLAGHAN         Yes.
MACKRELL                  GRAHAM HENRY


            DSU61                 in that, in that they enlarged the

                                  courtyard area, I mean that was,

                                  that, that would have enlarged

                                  fractionally the courtyard area.
09.42       O'CALLAGHAN           I think the major element with

                                 hindsight would have been that

                                 there would have been more

                                 turnstiles to allow people through.
           DSU61                 Yes.

           O'CALLAfflAN          And when you then have a large

                                 number of people coming late to

                                 get into the ground, you would get

                                 then in more easily and, and the

                                 flow through would have been

                                 multiplied by the number of

                                 extra turnstiles that you had.

                                 That I think in the context of what

                                 actually happened on this fatal

                                 day...

           DSU61                 Yes.

           O'CALLAfflAN          would have been the major benefit.
           DSU61                 I see.

           O'CALLAfflAN         And of course for a semi-final the

                                 situation was aggravated by the

                                 fact that the normal use of the

                                Penistone Road turnstiles to allow

                                people into the North Stand was

                                discontinued to achieve

                                segregation in that end so
MACKRELL              GRAHAM HENRY


                              it put a greater burden on the ...

           DSU61              That's canton ground, there's no

                              problem with that.     Is there anything

                              else you want to say Mr MACKRELL?

           MACKRELL           No.

10.32      DSU61             Anything.   I must now tell you

                              then Mr MACKRELL that the facts

                             will be reported to the Director

                             of Public Prosecutions who is

                             in fact in possession of a file

                             in any case on this inquiry.

                             Ultimately he will decide what

                             if any further action is taken

                             in regard to this matter against

                             either you or the Club.     Do you

                             understand that?

           MACKRELL          I do.
10.55      DSU61             Okay.   Can I now hand to you

                             as I'm required to do a notice

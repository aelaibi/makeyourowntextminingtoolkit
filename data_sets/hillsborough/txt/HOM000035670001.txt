        COMMENTS

         The only question really is whether further evidence puts an even worse complexion upon
        what the police were up to.”

          ..... I am afraid, you have to, I know you do, realise that my terms of reference are relatively
        limited. I may well be tempted to go outside them in order to try and establish in some cases,
        if I can, what happened where there is some confusion on the body files.” PI 7 25-29 (PH)

       “For what it is worth I agree with you that the Club were quite seriously at fault” p i3 (JT)

  ‘‘there has been a good deal o f misunderstanding of what the Coroner actually ruled about that
  ( 15             He did not say that everybody was dead at 3.15, he said that everybody had
  received their injuries by 3.15, which is plainly correct.” plO

As    we     arrived            at     this       end,       being          the    Nottingham Forest                          end,    there          we

radio            and       I was       not      given      any        instructions               on    ground        safety*             I di d

not        feel        I needed             any    instruction                as     I was       familiar           with     the        ground

generally,                  having          attended         at H i l l s b o r o u g h          seven        or    eight         times.

1 quickly                  familiarised myself                        with       the     immediate            vicinity            I was       in.

My        task        was     basically            to     ensure           people        had     tickets           and went         to       the

 correct              seats.           As     I entered           the       stand        there        d id    not    appear         to       be ma:

 people              in the       ground          so    I went         for       a   coffee        in the          refreshment               bar     i:

a      corridor             behind          the    West      Stand.              Having        had a         coffee      I returned                to

my         post       and was           kept       quite        busy.

About            2    pm     (1400)         I went        for     another            coffee        a n d m et               who     informed

 me        the       other        stewards          had    arrived            and      had      been     sorted        ou\, a n d        he    also

 commented                 on h o w       the      crowd        had     started          to     build        up    in L e p p i n q s        Ln.

 Looking              through           a window          in the           bar       I looked         outside         the    Leppings              Ln

 entrance              and        saw     indeed        that         the     crowds        were       no w a r r i v i n g        thick       and

 fast.

            returned              to    his     post      and        I to     mi n e .        I was      engrossed             in m y        task

     but    recall           at    about        2.45-      pm    (1445)           I surveyed            the       ground and            in

     oarticular              re c a l l      the    central           terraces             below      the W e s t       Stand       were           ver

     full,           I looked about                 and     saw       the      sides       were       st ill       looking         quite           emp

     and    in m y          opinion          there       was      room       for       hundreds         more.         This        particular

     surprised              me as       having         attended             the      ground       and     stood       in the        terraces

     myself,           1 have          always       found         the       s id e     views      are     the      be t t e r .

     Some        time       after       this                         came      up a n d        j o i n e d me       in the        West       Stand

     He              (

     chaos.            He     returned            down     the       stairs          and    returned           to me a b o u t          3     pm

was       drawn        to    the        terraces          below         us.           The    central              terraces        were           very

tightly          crowded            and       there        were        surges           f r o m the       back       to     the       f r o n t of

the       terraces.                The surges              a re    not       u n c o m m o n in a big                 crowd           but     I

noticed          and        pointed           out     to|              t hat      a    couple        of      supporters               were

Fearing           the       hooligan           element           might         have         been      rearing            its     head        1 went

with                  to    go     down       to    the     terraces,                 hoping        our       faces       and Liverpool

accents           may       have        been       able     to    dissuade              any        troublemakers.

We        made    our       way        down    th e      stairs         at     the         rear     of    the       West        Stand.            As       w

got        to    the       bottom        of    the       stairs         the       doors       were        locked          but        manned           by

tw o       lo cal      stewards.               The       stewards            unlocked              the    doors          and     let        us     out.

As        we    got     into       the    enclosure               to    the        rear       of    the W e s t          Stand         it w o u l d

    the    stand appeared                 to       be     locked,             I could          see       no       police        or     stewards.

    In fact,          in the           whole       enclosure             the       only       stewards             I saw w e r e            the       two

    on    the    stairs           to    the     seating           who       let       us    out,

    Both              an d m y s e l f         were       wearing           orange          stewards              tabards        and        as we

    walked       towards           the     tunnel          some        fans,           in a      shocked           s ta t e ,     came        to      us

    and    shouted           that       there        were        people           in the         t unn e l        being        crushed            and

    We    made        our    way        into       the    tunnel            and       again       t h er e     appeared           to     be       a    lac

people        were       being        crushed.

I saw      a youth            crawling,            obviously             distressed,                  towards        my    direction,

some         cases           struggling               for    life         but    they        were,       at     least,          ali ve.

Around            this          po int,       in the         vicinity            of        the    goal,        I noticed a                policemar

who        was        with       a young           lad,      no m o r e         than        IE-14 years              old.        The          lad w a s

 but        I thought,                as    apparently              did       the      policeman,              that     he w a s          s t ill

alive-                I realised              we      needed        oxygen            if we       were    to     be a b l e          to       save      the

 lad's           life.           I looked             about        and     s a w an         ambulance,           a St John                s    I thint

 direction.                     I beckoned             towards            the    ambulance              and     screamed             for       oxygen.

  It       seemed          to    take       an age           for     the a m b u l a n c e         to a r r i v e -         As       it       pulled       t

  him and              shouted          for       oxygen-            He    went        to    the       rea r    of    the a m b u l a n c e             am

  fumbled              with      his       keys.            We    got     into        the    ambulance            and       to m y         despair            :

  Again          the        driver         fumbled           to     undo        the    s traps,         I joined            in a n d          in

being         brought          out.        By    now a           police       sergeant,             a    big m a n 6 ’6,            was

giving         orders          and      appeared            to    be    the       only     person            taking        cha rge .

Everyone,              myself        included,          was        listening             to    him and acting                  on    his

instructions                 as    he    gave        them.         The       police        in the           area      had    got     rid       of

their         helmets          a n d we     were       all        just       helping          to     carry          the    bodies        out,

advertising                 hoardings           and making              them        into      makeshift              stretchers,               I

assumed           at    this       point        some        of    the    bodies          we    were          bringing        out     had

 I remember             specifically                  one    body       I carried.                 It wa s          of a    15-16 year

 old.         H is     h e a d was        back        and    he    had       dark       hai r.          I carried           his     shoulder

 and    a     policeman             carried           his    legs.           He wa s          limp      and     jelly       like.         We

 were        having          to    carry     the       bodies          further          and     further             because        the    area

 was     clogged             up w i t h     bod i e s .          There        was      nothing          we     co u l d    do w i t h     him,

  I helped             two    officers           carrying              another          lad    out.           Again       he was

to    worry,        nobody             would      be    looking.

I turned          and         returned          crying        to    fetch          another.              I remember                 at    t his

another          ambulance,               possibly           two,    arrived             on    the       pitch.           There           were

helping          out,         I could         not      say    if    they were             fans          or    nurses        as       a    lot        of

people        appeared             on     the     pitch       who       said       they       were       medical           persons.                  I

was    aware           by     this      stage        that     the       bodies          were       now       being        carried             away

the    far       end        of    the     North        Stand.

I returned              to       the    hole      in the       fence          to    the       terraces          where          a     large           ma>

again       presumably                 pronounced            dead,       was       being       brought          out.           He        was     a




five     of       us     to      carry      him.        Instead          of     leaving            him       I stayed           <■*•«» a n d

assisted           in       carrying          him      on h o a r d i n g s        all    th e      way       th e    length             of    the

pitch       and        leaving          him ar o u n d        the       bac k      of    the       North Stand                 at    the

gymnasium.

 I returned              back       down       the     pitch       where        I sa w                               We    both          embrace

 each    other           and      then      went       into      the      corner         where          we    had     originally                 com

 onto       the     pitch.             Looking         into      th e     West       Stand         we    sa w    our       sons          and

 gestured           to      them       to     stay     where        they      we re.

 I moved          on a n d        helped          carry      another           body      on a h o a r d i n g             to    the

 AO    to 5 0       bodies             lain     out     in the       vicinity            of     the      gymnasium.                      I also

F ro m        t her e ,     about            4    pm    ( 1600>          we    headed          to    the P l a y e r s        Tunne 1 -           We

were          allowed            in to           use    the       phone         as      I wanted         to     p h on e   my wife.               As       w

went          down        the       tunnel         we       had    to      quell         an a rgument              between Archie

Gemmell              and     a fan.               I do        not- k n o w w h a t            it was       about.          We     continued                o

a nd m a d e our                 call.

On     our       way       into         t he      tunnel           I remember                hearing       an      inappropriate              rnessa

o ver         the     public           address              urging         spectators               to    keep      t h eir      tickets          whic

would           be    honoured               for       the        re-match.

As     we       came       out        having           made        the     call         we    helped       look      about        the       ground

for        some       fans.             At       about        4.30       pm     (1630)         I remember            seeing           two    or     thr

police           officers               collecting                 belongings                left    behind         from        off    the

terraces.                  Two         policewomen                 were       in     tears      s ayi ng,          'What        can     we        do now

They were                 very         young       -        I tried        to      reassure          them.          About        this       tim e      we

met        with       our         children             and went            to      l ea v e    the       ground      consoling              one

 another.                 As     we     passed              the    rear       of      the W e s t        Stand,        I saw      the       Sheffie

 Head         Steward who                   had     employed              u-« .       He      thanked         us    and I told          him       to       p

 any money                owed         to    us        into a          fund       for    the    families.

 We      made        our         way    back           to    the       coach       leaving          the    ground          about       4.45        pm.

 (1645)              The         coach was              parked          in a n e a r b y m a i n            road.          On    the    way       we       ro

 other           distressed                 fans        we     knew       and would            have        been     on the        coach           by 5

  (1700)             because           I remember                 hearing            'Sports        R e p o r t ’ on       the    radio.            By

 5.20          pm     (1720)           all        our       coach        party        h ad     returned            physically               safe. We

 set          off     h ome         going         by w a y        of     the T r a v e l l e r s         Inn.

  I now          remember              that        whilst          carrying             the     bodies          on the        stretchers               I

  recall             seeing          a scuffle               going        on      between           fans      in the N o r t h S t a n d ,                 ne

  enouoh             at    the        half        way       line.          I did         not    pay      it a n y     attention              as     1 ha

     DUTCH REPORT ON RECOMMENDATIONS FOR SAFE FOOTBALL STADIUMS
I enclose two copies of the report by a Dutch Working Party on Safety
at Football Grounds which seems to take account of both Lord Justice
Taylor's final report on the Hillsborough Stadium disaster and your
revised Green Guide. It was sent to me by the Chairman of the Council
of Europe's Working Party on Spectator Violence.
I have also sent a copy to Keir Hopley informing him that I will also
provide you with copies.

Yours sincerely

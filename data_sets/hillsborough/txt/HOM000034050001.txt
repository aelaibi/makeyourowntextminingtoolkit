    DEAN PEPPLE: Presenter

         Well, as we were hearing in the news. Labour's demanding the answers to fresh
   ^     allegations surrounding the Hillsborough disaster.                                     The Shadow Home Secretary
         Jack Straw wants more details about the alleged video made of the fatal event,
         which was not available at the inquest or the disaster inquiry.                                               There's pressure
         from the families of Hillsborough victims for a new full scale public inquiry.                                                     But
         before agreeing to that, Mr Straw's written to the Chief Constable of South
         Yorkshire Police, Richard Wells, and the makers of the recent television programme
        Ion the disaster.              He told Robin Crystal it would be wrong to call for an inquiry
        [without the full facts.



    JACK STRAW MP: Shadow Home Secretary

         What I'm seeking from the makers of the programme about Hillsborough is specific
         indications of new evidence which they think is now available, and was not put
          before either the inquest or the Taylor Inquiry.                                 And from the Chief Constable of
          South Yorkshire, I particularly am interested in his observations on whether there
          was, as some alleged, a missing video which was not made available to the inquest
          or inquiry. And if there was an alleged missing video, whether that is now available.



       ROBIN CRYSTAL: Reporter

          Having seen this programme, and having looked at all the evidence that's now
          available, do you think the police did enough?



       JACK STRAW MP:

          Well, I'm not in a position to say that at this stage.                                  That's why I want to get this
          information from both the producer of the programme, and from the Chief
       (/ Constable.         And then sit down again, and discuss this with the people who, within

                                                                         Page: 2

          the Parliamentary Labour Party, are the most expert on this issue, namely, the
          members of Parliament for Sheffield and for Merseyside.



        lOBIN CRYSTAL:

          Now, there is also new evidence that some of the victims were actually alive, when
          the police certified that they weren't. What do you make of that?



       JACK STRAW MP

          Well, I certainly understand the very great and continuing grief and anger of many of
          those who were bereaved at Hillsborough.                                 And as a father who takes his own
          children very regularly to soccer matches, and which is a great joy of my
          relationship with my children, I just shudder, shiver, every time I think about what
          happened on that dreadful day.                      But what we mustn't do is to raise people's hopes
          about a new inquiry until we are clear that there is good grounds for doing so. And
          that's why, at the request of the Sheffield and Merseyside Labour members of
          Parliament, I'm taking this stage by stage, and initially writing these letters to the
          Chief Constable for South Yorkshire, and the makers of the programme.



       ROBIN CRYSTAL:

          But aren't you really being too cautious here? Shouldn't it be your role as a Shadow
          Home Secretary to call for a public inquiry now?



       JACK STRAW MP

           No, I don't think so. I think that it's very, very important to have good grounds for
          calling these years later for a re-opening of the inquiry, because to seek to re-open
           an inquiry without there being a proper basis to do so would least of all be to serve

       DEAN PEPPLE:

          The Shadow Home Secretary, Jack Straw.                                    Well, one of the men who has been
          advising Mr Straw is the MP for Sheffield Central, that's Richard Caborn, he joins us
          now. Good afternoon.



       RICHARD CABORN MP: Labour, Sheffield Central

          Good afternoon. Dean.



       DEAN PEPPLE:

          Your meeting with Mr Straw took place on Tuesday.                                       Was there any sort of call by
          the MPs present for an inquiry or another inquest on the disaster?



       RICHARD CABORN MP:

           No, not at that stage.              I mean, I think the advice that was given jointly by all of us
           to Jack was actually to, to actually get the evidence sent in. And we, we knew and
           we reported from Sheffield that the Chief Constable of South Yorkshire was, in fact,
           looking at the film in some detail to see whether there was any new evidence. And
           therefore we suggested to, to Jack Straw that he actually writes to the Chief
           Constable, asking for his report after they have, they have looked at the film to try
           and find out whether there's any new evidence. And equally so, that he was writing
           to the producer of the film, who had made some of the allegations about cover up
           and information not being available to the inquest and the inquiry.                                               So, Jack was

           going to write to Ian McBride [phonetic spelling], asking for that evidence and how
           he was substantiating it.                  And I think once he's collected all that together, he'll
           make a valid judgement as to whether he then calls on the Home Secretary to open
      ^    ... or it's just a new inquiry.



       DEAN PEPPLE:

           We heard it suggested there, to Mr Straw, that his approach might be seen as rather
           cautious. Now, taking in the public outcry after the drama documentary last week,
           can't more positive steps be taken by Labour?



       RICHARD CABORN MP:

           Well, I don't know what you mean by positive steps? I think it would be wrong, as
           Jack said very clearly there, to give false hope to these things.                                         I mean, yes, there
            was emotion.         One can very clearly understand that, and many of us, as Jack was
            saying from a personal point of view, when he takes his kids to the match, I went
            down to Hillsborough the Sunday after, and saw the trauma down there, and it was

          [ horrendous, there's no doubts about that.                            But I think the worst thing we could do
            is to start lifting hopes where there is no hope there. So, I think what Jack is doing
            on the advice on the Merseyside MPs and the Sheffield MPs is to take this step by
            step, and if there is a case to answer, if there is new evidence, then we will actually
            call in for an inquiry on very firm foundations, and not one that's driven by emotion.
            And I think that is the danger sometimes, that we ... when you get into these
            situations, that you can start lifting false hopes.



       DEAN PEPPLE:

            If it comes to light that evidence had gone missing, what action will you take then?

       RICHARD CABORN MP:

          Well, we'll go for an inquiry. There's no doubts about that.



       DEAN PEPPLE:

          Now, the Coroner's intimated that he, with hindsight, could have included more
          evidence during the hearing.                         Now, if that's the case, surely there's some
          justification for cause by the family for another inquest at least?



       RICHARD CABORN MP:

          Oh, I think he's got to put that clearly down.                                      I mean, you know, the broad
          statement's been made, you know, that evidence has been withheld, and there could
          have been more evidence. I think that's fine.                             But what we want ... the advice that
          we've given to Jack Straw is that he gets that very precisely quantified, and I think
          once that's in, then you can do a proper evaluation, so, for any quarter if people
          believe they've got new evidence that ought to be considered, then obviously from
          our point, let alone the Party's point of view. Jack Straw will be more than willing to
          receive that.        And based upon all that, he will make a valid judgement and, if it is
          necessary, will call for the re-opening of the inquiry and indeed, probably the inquest
          as well. But that will be done where there will be probably hope that they will get a
           different result to the one that has already been given.



       DEAN PEPPLE:

           Why a letter to Richard Wells, the producer of the programme? Wouldn't a meeting
           be more productive, bearing in mind the seriousness of the allegations?

       RICHARD CABORN MP:

          Well, there may well be a meeting after. I mean, this was only advice that we gave
          on Tuesday. Jack moved on that very quickly and wrote to the Chief Constable of
          South Yorkshire, saying that he understood that there was a review, not a review,
          but an evaluation of the film taken place, to see if there was any new evidence and
          if there was, would he please, would he please send it down to him. That may well,
          if there is new evidence, or, indeed, if Jack Straw believes it's necessary to have a
          meeting with the Chief Constable of South Yorkshire, I'm sure that can be arranged
          in very short time. So, I don't think that's a difficulty at all.

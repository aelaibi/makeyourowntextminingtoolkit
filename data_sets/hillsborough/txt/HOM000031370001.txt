    HILLSBOROUGH: MEETING WITH LORD JUSTICE STUART-SMITH


    I attach for the meeting at 5pm:


             (i)        Terms of reference. Lord Justice Stuart-Smith has a copy from my
                        meeting with him on Friday.

                        A note of the key issues which his examination would have to address.
                        I have explained to him the main areas for consideration (essentially
                        the headings in that note). You may want to mention some of the key
                        issues to reassure him that there are real issues of substance to be
                        answered.

 To   ascertain       whether any evidence exists relating to the disasteratthe
 Hillsborough Stadium on 15 April 1989 which was not available:



        (a)   To the Inquiry conducted by the late Lord Taylor; or



       (b)    To the Director of Public Prosecutions or the AttorneyGeneral

       for    the   purpose    of     discharging   their   respective   statutory
       responsibilities; or



       (c)     To the Chief Officer of the South Yorkshire Police in relation to
       police disciplinary matters;



And in relation to (a) to advise whether any evidence not previously available

is of such significance as to justify establishment by the Secretary of State

for the Home Department of a further Public Inquiry; and in relation to (b) and
(c) to draw to their attention any evidence not previously considered by them

which which may be relevant to their respective duties; and to advise

whether there is any other action which should be taken in the public interest.
    MAIN ISSUES RAISED IN RECENT r e p r e s e n t a t io n ^



               Video evidence

                           Was all the video evidence which is now available considered by the
                           Taylor inquiry and the inquest?



                           W as police video evidence deliberately withheld, or was a misleading
                           account given by the police witnesses of the significance of that
                          evidence?



                          W as evidence from the club's technician about the operation of the
                          video cameras covered up?



                          Were the inquest jury deliberately shown poor quality video evidence?



                         Some videotapes went missing on the night of the disaster:       is the

                         material now produced by Granada and the families this missing
                         evidence?



                         If any of those allegations are true, would the evidence have made any
                         material difference?


            Medical E vid en t


                        Is there new medical evidence that some of the victims were alive after
                        3.15pm?



                        Was medical evidence concealed from the inquest?



                        Does this evidence provide any grounds for questioning the coroner’s
                        findings?

   3.         Police cover-up


                          Is there anything to suggest that the West Midlands Police (who

                          investigated on behalf of the coroner and the Police Complaints
                          Authority) were biased or selective in presenting their findings?


  4           Ten allegedly unresolved


                         Granada suggested there were 10 unresolved questions (attached)
                         about police handling of the disaster: can we be satisfied that all those
                         questions were fully addressed by the Taylor inquiry?

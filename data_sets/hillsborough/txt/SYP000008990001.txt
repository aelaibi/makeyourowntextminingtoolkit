At a b o u t   2.35pm          I walked        up    to    the     football             ground       with    the L i v e r p o o l

team    driver,          it was       about       a mile      in d i s t a n c e .




Whilst       I was       walking       towards         the    ground         I saw a           l a rge     number     of

supporters            wh o    I believe        were Li verpool               fans        who    were       also    making

Amongst          these    supporters             I saw two           men       who     were       assisting          a third man

another          supporter       who     wa s     sitting          on     the     pavement           wTso was        vomiting

onto       the    roadway       it wa s      obvious             that     he    had also           been dr inking

heavily.               A small       crowd       of    supporters              ha d    gathered           around         him.

organised          queues       as    such,       just        a mass       of     peopl.e.

The    mounted          policeman was             in f r o n t       of    the        turnstiles           A/G      to    the        right

The    situation          in f r o n t      of    the       turnstile           looked           nasty and          I thought

’T h i s    is not       for    me'    and       I decided           to    enter           the   ground        via       the S o u t h

On     tak i n                               "at 2.. 55 pm         (1455)        I looked        towards       the    West      Stand

I saw         that        the    centre         part       of    the    terracing          below       the    stand was         packed

solid         a n d wa s        moving       slowly          backwards          and     forwards        it    r e m i n d e d me     of a

motion         similar           to     th at     of a jelly,                   I didn't        see a n y     crowd     surge        as

relatively                empty       compared          to      the    centre      of    the     terracing.




The     football            teams        had      j u st     g o ne    o n to    the    p i t c h as    I was       sitting        down.




The     football            match        kicked         off      at a b o u t     3.00pm        (1500)       and    I sat      b ac k

and     watched            the     football           game.




I saw a Police                   Officer          run out         onto      the     pitch       from    the    direction           of

the     West         Stand       in the         vicinity          of    the a r e a      in f r o n t    of    pen 2.           He

spoke         to     the    referee          in f r o n t        of    the N o r t h     Stand,        following        which        the

referee            stopped         the    game.




I could            see     people        climbing            up f r o m    the     terracing           in'      iShe W e s t    Stand

I left        th e    football             ground        at    about          4.00pm          (1600)       and      walked      back       to

the    coach         park.            I saw a          la rge       number          of       supporters            making      their       way

along      the       roads,        they       were       all       behaving           in a n        orderly         fashion.



On arrival            back       at     the      coach        park       I awaited             instructions              from    the

Police.

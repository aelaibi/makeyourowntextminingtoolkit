The    author of this technical opinion,                 S Thorburn, OBE FEng has                   been
requested by Reynolds          Porter       Chamberlain,           Solicitors,             Chichester
House,    278     High Holborn,       London WC1V 7HA to study the                       claims     made
against the Second Third Party Defendant, Eastwood and Partners by the
Chief    Constable        of the South Yorkshire Police and                    to        consider    and
define     the     actions    which        would    have        been   taken        by     the average
competent        engineer     in    respect of the layout and              structure           of    the
Leppings Lane End of the Hillsborough Football Ground.




This     opinion     is     based    upon     information          made   available           by     the
Solicitors named in para             1.1     and    by     Dr     Wilfred Eastwood, FEng.              A
visit has been made by me to the Hillsborough Football Ground in order
to gain an adequate understanding                  of    the layout and structure of the
Leppings Lane End of the ground.
PROFESSIONAL CAREER OF S THORBURN, OBE FEng


I     am     59 years of age and began my training as a                        civil   engineer     in
1947.


I am a Director of Thorburn PLC, Consulting Engineers, which I founded
in 1966.           The firm has offices             in     Glasgow,      Edinburgh and London and
has        about    one      hundred and fifty technical staff,                   including    seven
directors with a total staff                   of        about    one hundred and eighty.         I am
responsible for technical matters within the firm and for the training
of technical staff.              I am     a    Visiting          Professor of the University of
Strathclyde and lecture frequently throughout the UK and in Europe.


I have served on              technical       advisory           committees of the bodies listed
below:


1.     British Standards Institution
2.     Construction Industry Research and Information Association
3.     Science and Engineering Research Council
4.    Department of Environment
5.    Department of Energy


Practical          research     has     occupied          much     of    my   career   and I      have
investigated           the    fatigue     of    concrete           and    steel   on behalf of the
Departments of Transport and Energy.


My experience of the behaviour of structures and of their                               foundations
has led to          numerous     commissions             involving       diagnostic    and forensic
engineering.

Since      my    involvement with the redevelopment of the Ibrox Stadium                    in
1976 I have taken an interest              in    safety    at    sports grounds and have
given      lectures      on   this subject at events organised               by   the   Sports
Council.        I am a    member    of    the    committee      which   is    preparing the
Institution        of    Structural      Engineers’ Publication on           Appraisal     of
Sports Grounds.          The preparation        of this Publication has received the
support of the Home Office.


I   was appointed in 1988 to a Panel which advises the Chief                       Executive
of the Building          Research     Establishment       and Ministers on the quality
and relevance of the programme of the Establishment.


A   list    of     my papers and contributions to Publications is                  given    in
Appendix 1 together with a list of                my professional activities.            These
lists are preceded by an account of my professional career.
GUIDANCE ON SAFETY AT SPORTS GROUNDS


In     February          1971, the Rt.     Hon.      Lord Wheatley was requested by                   the
Secretary of State for the Home Department to make an appraisal of the
effectiveness             of the arrangements for crowd safety at sports                          grounds
and of       the        improvements     which       could    be    brought        about within the
framework          of     the law.     This inquiry followed the disaster                    at     Ibrox
Football Ground in January 1971.


It     became       obvious       to   Lord    Wheatley       in    1971     that     one     of      the
difficulties with which football                     clubs    were faced was that of making
alterations             and improvements to their grounds since neither they                          nor
their professional advisers had                   any     code, standards or guidelines to
assist       them in their work.              They could not be certain that                 the     work
done and the consequential expense                      were being channelled in the right
direction.


A     Technical Support Group was formed to review the state of knowledge
and     to    prepare        a    technical      report      in    support     of     the     eventual
recommendations of Lord Wheatley.


Broadly the functions of this Group were two fold; (i) to examine from
a technical stand-point                suggestions        which had been submitted to Lord
Wheatley and (ii) to conduct research to ascertain whether,                                  according
to the knowledge            and      experience      available       at     that time,       guidance
could    be     given       on the construction and lay-out of                     grounds     and     on
associated technical matters.


Lord    Wheatley defined the nature of the problem in his Report of                                   the
Inquiry and the            descriptive        text    which       follows     is     based upon his
observations.
                                                                                                                  5




      Football     grounds vary considerably in location, design and                                     standards
      of safety.        Many of them       were         constructed          in the first half of this
      century,        and their situation is such that the scope for                                manoeuvring
      when alterations are being contemplated is often restricted.                                        This can
      give rise to problems both inside and outside the grounds.                                     There are,
      however, certain factors common to all - at least in the higher levels
      of the game.        There the spectators are normally accommodated either in
      covered stands        or     in    standing         terraces          which     may     or     may not be
      covered.


      Lord    Wheatley      recognised           that important             factors      involved          in    the
      creation of dangerous              situations        in        standing terraces, and in their
      approaches and exits, were crowd pressures and gradients.


      Lord    Wheatley expressed the opinion that the problem of crowd                                         safety
      could not be        solved        simply     by     looking       at     part      of    the ground in
      isolation.         Each    part     had      to     be     considered         in      turn,        then    the
      inter-relation between the parts,                        and    finally the global situation.
      Deficiencies        in certain aspects could be off-set in whole or in                                    part
      by other aspects.




3.2   A   technical report was prepared by the Technical Support Croup and                                            a
      copy of this report has             been     incorporated              in Appendix 2 for ease of
      reference.


      This    Croup     of senior scientific and regulatory members of                                   the    Home
      Office,    Police,        and the     Department of the Environment observed from
      their     study    that the development of grounds over the years had                                     been
      somewhat     haphazard       in     most     cases,            much    depending        on     available
      financial resources and on the local experience available for guidance
      on structural       requirements.            As     a     result       there       were few standard
      features     in the composition of football grounds and even                                  in     various
      sections of the same          grounds.

                                                                                                                  6




          The     Technical        Support Croup recognised that the period                          of    greatest
          risk to crowd safety at football                     grounds         was at the time of leaving.
          Pressures        could develop within a departing crowd by impatient                               people
          and these incipient pressures had to be contained by careful attention
          to the design of barriers, staircases, gangways and exits.




    3.3   The     report        prepared     by     the       Technical        Support      Croup      recommended
          guidelines        which were based on the knowledge available in 1971 taking
          into account the           results        of    research        executed          to     supplement that
          knowledge. Recognition also was given to common usage which had so far
          proved to be safe.              It was assumed by the Technical Support Croup that
          their 1971 guidelines would be revised should more information                                     become
          available or in           the     event        of    a    change      in    the        pattern   of crowd
          behaviour.




    3.4   The     Technical        Support Group considered that implementation of                            their
          guidelines should help to ensure the safety of spectators.


          The     Croup emphasised,          however,          that the problem of crowd safety                 at a
          football match was complex and would not be solved by the provision of
          a     number     of    ground     components             each   of    which       were      individually
          satisfactory.


          The    Croup also recognised that departures from individual                                 guidelines
          were possible without necessarily                        detracting        from the overall safety
          of     the   ground      and drew attention to the                   need      for      flexibility    of
          approach.
The       report of the Inquiry into Crowd Safety at Sports Grounds by Lord
Wheatley was presented to Parliament by the Secretary of State for the
Home Department in May 1972.


The        report    incorporated           the     technical    report           prepared      by     the
Technical Support Group to the Inquiry in an Appendix A.


The guidelines were in               prescriptive        form and no technical references
were       given    to      enable    the     reader to        evaluate          the    basis    of     the
guidelines and to             determine       the     effects    of        any     variations to the
recommendations.




The recommendations in the report of                     the Technical Support Croup were
extended       to    include        fire precautions and means of                      escape   from     an
emergency situation and these                 formed the basis of the Guide to Safety
at Sports Grounds issued by the Home Office in 1973.


The       application of the guidelines set by the Technical Support                                 Group
of     the    Wheatley        Inquiry      revealed      the    need        for     amendments and a
separate       version        of    the    Guide to     Safety        at     Sports       Grounds      was
published in 1976 which had                 particular relevance to football grounds.
As    a    result      of     the tragedy at Bradford City FC ground                       in   1985     a
working party reviewed               the    1973     version     of        the Guide to Safety at
Sports       Grounds        and    their recommendations formed the                     basis   of     the
current version of the Guide (1986).                    The current version of the Guide
embraces the 1973 version and the 1976 football version of the Guide.
                                                                                                         8




      The various versions of the Guide to Safety at Sports Grounds provided
      voluntary guidance to technical                  specialists on measures for improving
      spectator       safety    at existing sports grounds and emphasised that                          the
      Guide was an aid to, not a                substitute for, professional judgement and
      commonsense.


      The    Guide    was      directed essentially to giving advice on                       safety    for
      spectators in existing sports grounds and attempted to taice account of
      the various constraints and difficulties which existed at the numerous
      grounds.




3.7   The Guide recognised that it would                      be   unreasonable,         even if it were
      practical, to seek the absolute safety of everyone attending a ground.


      When using the Guide to assess whether existing circumstances provided
      adequately for the             safety     of     spectators         it     was recommended in the
      Guide that one should seek to provide a reasonable degree ofr safety at
      existing sports grounds.                It was     stated         in the Guide that deviations
      from     individual        guidelines            were    possible           without     necessarily
      detracting      from      the    overall         safety      of     the    ground.    No technical
      references      were     given in the Guide to enable the reader to                        evaluate
      the     basis     of     the    guidelines.        One       must        make   a judgement of how
      best to apply the Guide in the case of existing football grounds which
      have    not     experienced problems in order to achieve the                          objective    of
      reasonable safety.

          In September 1981,           Eastwood &        Partners were requested by the Club at
          the     instance of the Police to make arrangements for the                           construction
          of two radial fences in the West                    Terrace.      The introduction of these
          fences     allowed     a greater control of spectators and also                           meant   that
          both home and visiting              supporters        could     be accommodated in the West
          Terrace     in    different         pens.     Eastwood &        Partners        incorporated       1.1
          metres wide gates at the              rear     of     these     two        radial fences to allow
          access     for police control and to permit lateral movement through                               the
          terrace,     when necessary.            Approval        for     the installation of the two
          radial fences was given by South Yorkshire County Council (SYCC) in                                     a
          letter of 14 September 1981,                  subject to the condition that the gates
          at    the rear of the fences should be under Police control.                               The fences
          were constructed in October/November 1981.


          The installation        of     two     additional        fences        in the West Terrace was
          considered       in   1985     by     the Club,        the Police,            and   the    Licensing
          Authority (SYCC) and the two extra radial fences were installed in the
          summer of 1985.       Cates, 1.1 metres wide, were incorporated at the rear
          of these two fences.           The      provision        of     these two additional fences
          created a narrow radial corridor which could be used by the Police for
          crowd control and       divided         the    central         area        of the West Terrace in
          front    of the tunnel into pens 3 and 4.                  The perimeter fences had been
          constructed at an       unknown         time    and     prior         to    1978 when Eastwood &
          Partners were first appointed by the Club as their technical advisers.

      The introduction of radial fences complied with the recommendations in
      the Guide to Safety at Sports                   Grounds.            Para 206 of the Guide states
      that crowd movement on terraces should be strictly controlled in order
      to give the Police the fullest                      opportunity           for crowd control.               It is
      further stated in the Guide that less problems occur when terraces are
      sub-divided        as     far     as    possible            into     sections          by      use   of radial
      barriers.


      The Guide continues in                 para     206     with        the        recommendation that each
      section should ideally be self-contained and should be serviced by its
      own entrance/exit.              The     Guide        does     not express the view that radial
      fences        should     only be used if separate turnstiles are                                provided         for
      each section of           a     terrace        after        division           by     radial     fences.         The
      recommendation           of     the Green Guide in respect of crowd                             movement         was
      adopted by the Police and the Licensing Authority (SYCC) gave approval
      for     the     introduction           of radial fences in the West Terrace.                               It     is

      understood that           a     Chartered           Engineer        is     a        member of the Advisory
      Committee of the Licensing Authority and that this Chartered                                          Engineer
      deemed the provisions satisfactory.


      Subsequent         events       showed that the situation could be managed                                 safely
      and as a graphic illustration of control of the crowd I would refer to
      photographs        of     the    West         Terrace at           the     Cup       Semi-Final       in        1988
      (Appendix 3).           Eastwood & Partners                 could not have foreseen that those
      responsible for distribution of spectators within the West Terrace and
      for crowd control would fail to                       exercise those responsibilities on 15
      April    1989.          In the response to the fifth allegation later                                 in        this
      technical opinion,              it will        be     demonstrated              that recommendations by
      Eastwood       &   Partners for the provision of turnstiles to                                   control         the
      dispersal of spectators were                   not     pursued            by     the Club for financial
      reasons.
I am of the opinion that no    reasonably       competent engineer would have
resisted the introduction of radial fences in 1981 and 1985 because of
the lack of separate turnstiles.       Separate     turnstiles were the ideal
situation   but   in their absence there was no reason          for   Eastwood   &
Partners to have anticipated    that    those     responsible    for the ground
would   fail to exercise that control over the West Terrace            for   which
purpose the radial fences had been provided.
                                                                                                   14




The removal of barrier 144 (Amended Statement of Claim, Para 10 (c))


In August 1986 barrier               144   apparently          was removed at the request of
the      Police       in    order to obviate the tendency for the                   spectators to
enter the terrace from the tunnel and stand behind barrier 144.


This     viewing position was sought                    bysome     spectators because of           the
good     view    of the field of play and the Police considered                           that    this
situation formed an obstruction to access to the terrace and presented
a     hazard.    The Licensing Authority agreed with this request and                            gave
their approval.


The        removal         of     crush barrier144         eliminated          this      problem    of
obstruction and incidentally created a small 'reserve'.


The     removal of barrier 144 provided the Police with a strategic point
on the Vest Terrace               where    they        could     control    crowd    movements and
behaviour.        The small 'reserve' could be kept clear,                          if    necessary,
during entry to the terrace and the conditions of egress at the end of
a     match would be better through the provision of space for the                               crowd
to be manoeuvred before               entry       to     the     tunnel.     The decision by the
Licensing       Authority to accept the request by the Police was                           sensible
in the light          of    the     reasons    advanced          by   the    Police.      Eastwood &
Partners acted reasonably in not opposing this request.


The     removal of barrier 144 created a situation where there could be a
greater     number         of     spectators      behind       barrier      136A    if    the    small
'reserve'       was    allowed        to   fill and        pen 3      to    reach   the     capacity
permitted by the Licensing Authority.


It was     possible         that     the   removal        of     Barrier     144 could lead to a
greater     load being exerted on Barrier 136A,                       but there seems no doubt
that Barrier 136A withstood the                   extreme and unforseeable situation on
the day.

5.3   Width of the perimeter gates (Amended Statement of Claim, Para 10 (f))


      Paragraph 209 of the Guide           to     Safety      at   Sports Grounds states that
      "access       to the pitch must be made as difficult as possible in                   normal
      circumstances while at the           same        time   ensuring      that the Police have
      effective access to the terraces for the purpose of crowd control".


      This     paragraph     continues "and enabling the pitch to be                used    (where
      appropriate) in the event of serious emergency".


      The views of the author        are        well     known     and   have been expressed at
      conferences organised by the Sports Council.


      It is the opinion of the author that the provision of a high                         security
      fence to counter unruly behaviour and to prevent invasion of the field
      of     play     is   in conflict with the need for rapid and safe                 egress    of
      spectators at a time of panic and disaster.


      There is a conflict between the              need       to counter unruly behaviour and
      to ensure life safety in an emergency.


      The author is of the opinion that                 high perimeter fences should not be
      provided in order that spectators can leave terraces in an emergency.


      I    accept that my view is a minority view and that Lord Justice Taylor
      does not recommend        removal     of     perimeter       fences.      The conventional
      wisdom     at    the   time of the disaster was the provision                of   perimeter
      fences with narrow gates to ensure that Police had effective access to
      terraces for the purpose of crowd control.                   Narrow gates as      envisaged
      by the Guide to Safety at           Sports       Grounds      (para    215) would not have
      permitted       a sufficient rate of removal of spectators from pens 3                     and
      4.     It is, of course, a question of fact as to when the Police                      first
      permitted the gates to be           opened        and   how far the crisis had already
      developed by that stage.

        The   perimeter    fences     were     already in        existence   when     Eastwood    &
        Partners were first        appointed       by   the    Club   in 1978.      The Licensing
        Authority   had    approved     the     numbers       and widths     of   gates   in     the
        perimeter fence.     Eastwood &        Partners had no reason to challenge this
        decision and acted reasonably in accepting the situation.




        The author also is of the opinion that wide gates in perimeter                     fences
        can present a     hazard     since     the      sudden    removal    of   resistance      to
        pressure    of    spectators pressing against the gates               could    result     in
        spectators at the front of           the     crowd    falling   out of the gates when
        opened and being crushed by those behind.

5.4   The     testing    of    crush     barriers and the         collapse   of   barrier      12UA
      (Amended statement of Claim, Para 10 (g))


      The test device designed by Dr Eastwood is appropriate for the testing
      of crush barriers.


      It is not bad practice to test two               spans      together. The author is not
      aware     of tests being conducted in the manner suggested by the                     Police
      to be appropriate, and, in           particular,         where three spans were tested
      at the same time.


      British Standard 5950 : Pt 1 : 1985 states in Section Seven on Loading
      Tests,     para 7.3.2 "Prior to any test it may be advantageous to                       apply
      (and then remove) preliminary            bedding       down loading not exceeding the
      unfactored loads".


      The recommendations for testing of                  crush   barriers given in the Guide
      to Safety at Sports Grounds (Annex C) are obscure in this respect                          and
      para 5 implies          that    bedding-down     movements      are    acceptable.        Lord
      Justice     Taylor      accepted that the Guide was ambiguous               and   that     the
      interpretation of the Guide made               by    Eastwood & Partners was tenable.
      The     tests on barrier 12UA showed that it would support a load 20                      per     If/c«l*"

      design load stipulated in the            Guide       (and greater than the test lcjad)                       C**'*

    5.5   Adequacy      of     turnstiles used on 15 April 1989 (Amended                       Statement      of
          Claim, Para 10 (h))


          The report on the Inquiry by Lord Justice Taylor into the Hillsborough
          Stadium Disaster records that                      Eastwood and Partners recommended after
          an    incident in the 1981 Cup semi-final between Tottenham Hotspur                                and
          Wolverhampton Wanderers that separate access to Pens 3 and 4 should be
          provided through separate banks of turnstiles.                           This arrangement would
          have enabled the            numbers          of     spectators     entering    these    pens to be
          monitored so as to ensure its maximum capacity was not exceeded.                                   The
          plan was not adopted by the Club.


          By 1985,      Sheffield Wednesday had                   been promoted to the First Division
          and was attracting larger crowds.


          Modifications            were    made at the Leppings Lane entrance to the                      ground
          but no increase in the number of turnstiles was made.


          With reference to the figure in Appendix 4 the bank of turnstiles 1 to
          16 was divided from turnstiles A                       to C by the metal fence now in place
          and   that     division          was     projected across the            concourse      inside     the
          turnstiles in the form of a brick wall.                          A personnel gate was provided
          for   access through that wall and was enlarged to its present size                                 at
          the request         of     the    police.            Those   alterations      were     made     in the
          interests      of        segregation.             The more elaborate     divisions       which     Dr.
          Eastwood had suggested giving                       separate access to each sub-division of
          the accommodation were not pursued for financial reasons.


          Without      such    a     division the ground was still perfectly                      capable     of
          being operated           safely        but    the     onus   was    on   those responsible for
          exercising      control over the ground to make sure that it was                              operated
          safely.
                                                                               19




I am aware from the Pleadings (as       set out in the final appendix) that
in   preparation   for the match the decision was taken to divert          6,000
spectators from    the   turnstiles    in     Penistone   Road   to those at the
Leppings Lane end.


Eastwood & Partners were not consulted about this decision.


The decision created a major crowd problem at the Leppings Lane end of
the ground and proved to be     a     major    cause   of the congestion at the
turnstiles.    The severe problem of crowd management would           appear    to
have distracted attention from the          need   to close the entrance to the
tunnel and to distribute the spectators throughout the West Terrace.
5.6   Signs (Amended Statement of Claim, Para 10 (i))


      Para   57   of the Guide to Safety at Sports Grounds recommends              that   a
      comprehensive system of        sign-posting should be provided which clearly
      indicates    routes to the various parts of the ground and to the              exits
      from the ground.


      Para   29   of   the   Guide    includes      in a   summary   of   the   management
      responsibilities of a Club the requirement to provide signs.


      I would not regard it as part of the function of a Structural Engineer
      to advise or take any action in respect of signs unless so                instructed
      by the Club.     The signs     are   likely     to need to be varied to suit the
      requirement of individual matches.

              (J) and (k))




              Access     and egress from the portion of the terrace encompassed by pens
              3 and 4 were gained through the tunnel to the terrace. No evidence has
              been made available to the author of this report to indicate that this
              traditional route was unacceptable or hazardous.


              Clearly, Pens 3 and 4 are serviced           by    a major route which experience
              had shown to be adequate.


              Cates     were provided at the tops of the radial fences which             permitted
              spectators to egress from Pens         3    and    4 and leave in a Northerly and
              Southerly      direction   through the West terrace.         The   gates   were    1.1
              metres wide as recommended in the Guide to Safety at Sports Grounds.


              Spectators      in the corners of Pens 3 and 4 formed by the intersections
              of the radial and perimeter fences           wer£*16 metres from the wing walls
              in     front   of the tunnel.     The distance of 16 metres should         not    have
              presented a problem if the numbers           in the pen were controlled and the
              spectators in the lowest corners could make safe egress within about 7
              to 8 minutes.


              It is the time taken to travel to          a place of safety that is important
              and not distance alone.


              Para 21 of the Guide states that           barriers    not only serve to break up
              crowd    pressures   but   also assist in         controlling   movement    off    the
              terraces by regulating      the    rate    of     arrival   at exits to suit their
              capacity.
                                                                                                         22




It is     recommended              in     paragraph      56     that   exits      from    each area of
spectator accommodation should be so designed that all spectators                                        can
leave that area and if                    desired,      pass     into a free-flowing exit route
system in 8 minutes or less.


Para     48        draws attention to the fact that a period of great                             risk    to
crowd safety is at the time of leaving and it is important to design a
layout        of     barriers and exits to encourage spectators to leave in                               an
orderly fashion.


In order to achieve                 these     criteria         at existing grounds considerable
judgement           must be exercised and the best solution may be a compromise
of these desirable objectives.


In     the     situation           which exists at pens 3 and 4 it                 would     have        been
imprudent to           consider           radial     gangways      since    it is likely that the
spectators           would     stand        on the steps of the gangway and                 create        the
potential for dangerous forward movements.                             The layout of the barriers
which exist at the present time in Pens 3 and 4 as shown on drawing no
7507/1 in Appendix 5 would appear to have been found satisfactory from
common        usage.     No method would appear to exist which would permit the
optimum        layout        and        spacing    of    crush     barriers       and     exits     to     be
determined.


The gates in the perimeter fence were quite evidently not designed for
the     evacuation        of        the     terrace      and     indeed    were     not     included in
evacuation times.

    5.8   Certified capacity of              terrace      (Amended       Statement   of Claim, Para 10

          (I))-



          The selection of an allowable                  capacity is not the duty of a technical
          adviser but of the Licensing Authority.                    The Licensing Authority set a
          figure for the capacity of the West Terrace as a whole.




          It     is     not alleged by the Police or,              so far as I am aware,       by    any
          other party that            the    overall      number     of    spectators admitted to the
          Leppings        Lane      end of the ground was excessive.             The problem was     not
          one of capacity but of distribution.


          The     distribution         of spectators in the West Terrace would              appear    to
          have been controlled              adequately      at     the    Cup Semi-Final in 1988,     as
          shown on photographs (Appendix 3) of that event unlike that which                          was
          exercised on 15 April 1989 when an                     excessive number of spectators was

          allowed to enter pens 3 and 4.


          It     was unreasonable to expect Eastwood & Partners to foresee that                       an
          excessive number of               spectators     would     be allowed to enter the tunnel
          and     subsequently pens 3 and 4.               The loading on the crush barriers          in
          these pens, due to the excessive packing density which occurred on the
          day,        could   not    have been foreseen by a competent engineer               and    was
          greater than that loading stipulated in the Guide.

    5.9   Cradient of the tunnel (Amended Second Third Party Notice, Para 6)


          It     is correct that over part of its length the ramp had a gradient of
          about 1 in 6.


          The tunnel had been constructed as part of the West Stand                   development
          for the World Cup games in 1966.


          With reference        to the schematic       drawing     in   Appendix 6 Eastwood and
          Partners      have    carried out a survey of the levels within            the    tunnel.
          The measurements showed that on entering the tunnel from the direction
          of     the    turnstiles,      there   is an upward slope         for   about 4    metres
          followed by a         smooth transition       leading to      a   downward slope.        The
          gradient      of this slope gradually increases to about 1 in 12 at                 12.5m
          into the tunnel,           about 1 in 8 at    14.5m,     and finally at about 1 in 6
          for a length of 3 metres between 16 and 19m.                  The ramp then levels out
          to a quite gentle inclination where it passes between the gates at the
          entrance      to     the    terrace.   The ramp is steeper than 1 in 10           over        a
          length of about 6m.


          The minimum headroom within the tunnel is greater than that stipulated
          in the Cuide and the tunnel has an ample width of 3.65 metres which is
          equivalent to 6.6 unit widths.


          Five persons abreast of each other             would walk through the tunnel with
          ease    and    six persons could pass through with some degree              of    bodily
          contact.


          Since it is        generally    recognised     that     the   period of great risk to
          crowd    safety occurs at the time of egress from a terrace the gradient
          on the ramp in the tunnel tends to             reduce     hasty departure and should
          not present a danger to spectators leaving the terrace.

                                                                                     25




    The Licensing Authority which was            advised by a Chartered Engineer and
    by    the   Fire Service accepted the departure from the Guide over             this
    short length of tunnel.


    The tunnel had been designed          by    Husband   & Co, Consulting Engineers,
    and    had been constructed before 1966 and prior to the appointment              of
    Eastwood & Partners as technical advisers to the Club in 1978.


    The    local     gradient     of the tunnel did not cause the      disaster     since
    barriers 125 and       136A     withstood    any   loading   imposed   by the hasty
    arrival     of    spectators in pen 3 through the tunnel after         Cate C     was
    opened.     The pens were already          packed beyond the extreme allowance of
    density specified in the Guide to Safety at Sports Grounds.

6.    FURTHER ISSUES RAISED BY POLICE


My attention has been drawn to a "list of issues" prepared on behalf of the
Police.     One particular        issue   refers     to   heights of crush barriers and I
have been asked to comment on this aspect in case the pleadings are amended
to include reference to this issue.




6.1   Heights of Crush Barriers




      The     heights of the crush barriers in pens 3 and 4 at the West Terrace
      of the Hillsborough Football Ground range from 0.83 to 1.15 metres and
      the     lower     heights of barrier range from 0.83 to 0.95 metres                 with    a
      mean height of 0.90 metres.


      This mean height is 120 mm below the minimum height recommended in the
      Guide     to     Safety    at   Sports    Grounds      and   200   mm   below the height
      preferred in the Guide.


      The     extent     to     which heights of crush barriers can vary           from     those
      recommended in the Guide            to    Safety at Sports Groundsis examined              in
      the paragraphs which follow.


      The     University        of Surrey carried out, in 1971, a series of tests                on
      live subjects to determine the             tolerable forces that could be exerted
      safely by crush barriers on spectators in a crowd.


      In    one series of tests each            subject was pressed against a steel         tube
      located        horizontally     against      various     positions      on the   trunk as
      indicated on the figure in Appendix 7.

                                                                                                27




        The subjective levels of           discomfort defined for the purposes of these
        tests were as follows:


        Subjective Load         LevelA       The    first sensation of discomfort felt by
                                             the subject.


        Subjective Load         LevelB       Discomfort       which   was   estimated     by    the
                                             subject to be tolerable for about half              an
                                             hour.


        Subjective Load Level C              Discomfort       which   was     estimated   by    the
                                             subject to become intolerable after a              few
                                             seconds.


        It was found that if the steel tube was positioned at a level where it
        rested on bone         immediately    beneath        the skin the subject experienced
        local pain.         The two    sites at which localpain were felt were at Level
        1 and at Level 4 only for subjects of slim build.


        The more serious situation occurred when pressure was applied over the
        lower chest or upper             abdomen    which,     inshort subjects, occurred at
        Levels     2   and 3 andat a level of 1.05 metres             above     the   surface    on
        which the subjects were standing.


        Restriction         of breathing was experienced and many subjects complained
        that they found difficulty in              breathing and asked for the tests to be
        stopped.       In    most     cases the subjects contracted           their   respiratory
        muscles to support their ribs              and   these   muscles were then unable to
        provide respiratory movements.

                                                                                                        28




        Two important conclusions were drawn from these tests.


        i.      The application of        load    at        Level    4     enabled    most subjects to
                tolerate a higher load.


        ii.     The   mean    maximum tolerable force was increased by 12                       per    cent
                when the subject adjusted             his     own    position        and by 67 per cent
                when the subject was allowed to push against the barrier.


        The results      of    the     tests     on    thirty        six     male    subjects    who were
        subjected      to the application of loads at their particular Level 4 are
        shown in the form of a histogram in Appendix 8.


        The variations in the heights from                   the     surface on which the subjects
        were     standing     to     their     particular          Level 4     is    presented    on    the

        histogram.


        The heights varied from 0.95 to                1.15 metres with a mean value of 1.04
        metres.


        It     was concluded, therefore, by the University of Surrey                        researchers
        in 1971, that the "conventional"                barrier height of 1.05 metres was to
        be preferred.


        The Guide to Safety at Sports Grounds published in 1973 recommended in
        para 7.8.6 that the height of crush barriers should be between 1 metre
        and    1.2    metres above the nosing of the step immediately                       behind      the
        barrier, with a preferred height of 1.1 metres.
The   Football         Version     of    the        Guide        to    Safety        at    Sports Grounds
published       in 1976 recommended in para 7.7.6 that the height of                                  crush
barriers should be             between       1.02     metres          and     1.12        metres above the
nosing     of    the step immediately behind the barrier                              with a     preferred
height of 1.1 metres.


The current 1986 version                of     the    Guide           to    Safety at Sports Grounds
recommends        in    para 110 that in order to locate the top rail                                against
that part of the body most                   able     to        tolerate      pressure the height of
crush barriers should be between 1.02 metres and 1.12 metres above the
nosing of the step             immediately           behind        the      barrier with a preferred
height of 1.1 metres.


It would appear that the variations in build and heights of spectators
prevent an exact solution to the                      problem of selecting the best height
of    crush barrier and, therefore, the preferred height is a compromise
and will not suit every spectator.                          Crush          barriers are a rudimentary
solution        to crowd control and life safety and any improvement in                                   the
situation of the spectator                   should        be     derived      from the provision of
seats and not from the development of crush barriers.


On the basis of information currently available the minimum height                                         of
crush barrier which may be                   permitted is 0.975 metre above the surface
on    which     a spectator is standing.                   This height may be                suitable     for
small spectators, but the effect on tall spectators is unknown.                                         It is
possible        that    tall     spectators           would not            choose     to     stand    behind
barriers of heights which would make them feel uncomfortable.
It     is     understood          from   statements        made    by    Dr    Eastwood       that the
relationship           of     the horizontal rails of the crush                    barriers    to    the
steps beneath encourages spectators to stand on the steps on which the
vertical legs are supported.                   If the heights of the crush barriers are
taken from the steps on which                   the     spectators       stand rather than from
the     nosing        of the step immediately behind the barrier then the                           mean
height of the lower                barriers     conforms      with the minimum height which
may be permitted of 0.975 metre.


When        Eastwood        & Partners were first instructed by the Club                      in    1978
they observed that the crush                   barriers      were on average about 50 mm (2
inches) below the lower limit of the heights recommended in the Guide.
This matter was given careful consideration by the Licensing Authority
in     April     1979 and           the outcome       of    this        meeting and          subsequent
discussions was the acceptance of all crush barriers except one, which
was     replaced.           All     new barriers have been          designed         by   Eastwood      &
Partners to conform                with the    height       preferred         by    the Guide of 1.1
metres.         No     problems with the actual heights of the                       crush     barriers
would appear to have been experienced in practice.


The     view taken by the Licensing Authority not to require the                                  removal
of the other barriers seems reasonable.


It     has     been     suggested        on behalf of the          Police      that       these     lower
barriers failed to prevent the                      forward transmission of crowd pressure
to     spectators           in    front and to barriers in          front of them             including
barrier 124A which collapsed.


In a situation where the packing density of spectators in a terrace is
limited in accordance                with     the     recommendations         of     the Guide lower
heights of barriers would not present a problem.

    Common    usage       has   demonstrated that spectators in the                (Zest    Terrace
    accepted the heights of barriers.


    The photographs in          Appendix     3     show    the    distribution of spectators
    throughout      the West Terrace during the 1988 Cup Semi-final and                         there
    is no evidence         of   problems     resulting         from   forward transmission of
    crowd pressure at that event.


    A dangerous       situation      would       exist    on     the day in which bodies were
    pressed      together       under high packing pressures.             In effect,       at    very
    high packing densities, the            purpose of the crush barriers of division
    and protection would not be achieved.


    It   would     have     been unreasonable to expect               Eastwood &    Partners       to
    foresee the events of 15 April 1989 and the effect of the unacceptably
    high packing density on the crush barriers.
CONCLUDING REMARKS


Eastwood   &     Partners     inherited a situation developed      prior   to     the
introduction      of   guidelines      and   used   professional   judgement      and
commonsense       in situations where there were departures from the            Guide
to Safety at Sports         Grounds.    Recognition    was given to common usage
which had so far proved to be safe.


Having had the opportunity to           study   the facts related to this case I
am of the opinion that the disaster resulted from the lack of              control
by ground management over the           distribution   of spectators in the West
Terrace    and     the excessive number of spectators crowded        together      in
pens 3 and 4.

 Sam Thorbum was educated at                                     md the Royal Technical College,
 Glasgow ( 1948 —1953 ) and is a Visiting Professor of the University of Strathclyde.


 Career:




Thorbum Associates                                                      1966-1990
         Director                                                       ( founded Company 1966 )
Thorbum PLC                                                             1990 - to date
         Director


Over a period of seven years he was responsible for the design and construction of heavy civil and
structural engineering works, mainly concerned with the Steel Industry. He was responsible also
during this period for research into heat transfer in furnace foundations and the durability of building
materials, including high alumina cement.

Involvement with earthworks, roadworks, bridges, deep excavations, rock and soil tunnels, shallow
and deep foundations and river protection works - related to the construction of various major
industrial structures within the steelworks - generated an overall concern for geotechnical and
foundation engineeering in the broadest sense.


His wider interests in general civil engineering prompted the formation in 1966 of a consultancy in
civil and structural engineering. His specialist background in ground engineering was adopted by
the Practice which developed its own geotechnical and foundation engineering divisions in parallel
with its main activities in the fields of civil and structural engineering.
 Sam Thorburn has written about fifty professional papers and articles and is co-author and editor
 of a book on Underpinning.

 He has served on technical advisory committees of the following bodies:
            1          British Standards Institution
            2.         CIRIA
            3.         Science and Research Council
            4.         Department of Environment
            5.         Department of Energy
 He hias acted as Chairman of technical committees of the Institutions of Civil and Structural
 Engineers and is Chairman of ^Technical Committee of the International Society of Soil Mechanics
 and Foundation Engineering.

 His involvement with heavy industry necessitated the development of solutions to problems of the
 disposal of industrial wastes.

 He has long experience of treatment of ground underlain by household and industrial wastes and was
 Chairman of the conference on Building on Marginal and Derelict Land held in Glasgow in 1986.
 The conference dealt with landfill sites and received the support of the Scottish Office and the
 Scottish Development Agency. He has specialised since 1972 in thedesign, construction and
 supervision of landfill sites regulated by the Mines & Quarries ( Tips )Act 1969.

His experience of old mineral workings within the Central Belt of Scotland is extensive and he has
designed special foundations for medium and high rise buildings to accommodate the ground strains
associated with mining subsidence. This experience includes consolidation of old mineral workings
by grouting techniques.

Practical research has occupied much of his career and he has investigated the fatigue of concrete and
steel on behalf of the Departments of Transport and of Energy.

In order to progress knowledge regarding the real behaviour of structures in contact with ground,
Sam T horburn formed a National Committee in 1970 with the support of the Institution of
Structural Engineers. A state-of-the-art report on soil-structure interaction was published in 1978.
This report stimulated interest in the subject and encouraged research into the behaviour of
full-scale structures.

The research directed by Sam Thorburn in conjunction with the Corporation of Glasgow and the
Building Research Establishment is recorded in several technical publications. In 1985 it was
deemed prudent to review the relevance of the 1978 document to current practice and the need for
revision and extension was identified.
The Institution of Structural Engineers with the co-operation of the Institution of Civil Engineers
initiated the preparation of a comprehensive guidance document covering most types of structures
and Sam Thorburn served as Chairman of the Review Panel, and edited and contributed to the 1988
document on soil structure-interaction.

His interest in and involvement with the design of concrete, masonry, timber, and steel structures
during his career have continued although ground engineering has been a dominant theme.

His experience of the behaviour of structures and their foundations has led to numerous
commissions involving diagnostic and forensic engineering.

Since his involvement with the redevelopment of the Ibrox Stadium in 1976 he has taken an interest
in safety at sports grounds and has given lectures on this subject at events organised by the Sports
Council. He was a member of the committee which prepared the ISE Publication on appraisal of
sports grounds.

Sam Thorburn designed and developed a seabed anchorage system for tethered buoyant platforms
which was patented by BP International Limited in 1980. He contributed to the preparation of a
reference document on the design of foundations for Offshore Structures financed by the
Department of Energy.

BP International Limited commissioned him to survey the blast wave damage caused by severe
explosions at two major chemical plants, Antwerp and Grangemouth, and to analyse the structural
responses of the various types of buildings to the peak overpressures.

The Home Office have sought his advice in relation to the protection of traditional buildings against
explosions using innovatory concepts and in the development and testing of blast resistant
structures. His experience also covers the dynamic behaviour of ground and structures.

Sam Thorburn was appointed in 1988 to a Panel which advises the Chief Executive of BRE and
Ministers on the quality and relevance of the programme of the Establishment.

Sam Thorburn is Deputy Chairman of the European Community Advisory Panel of the Institution
of Civil Engineers and represents the Institution as Deputy Chairman of the Joint Monitoring Group
on Eurocode Implementation. His wider professional involvement is indicated on the sheets
attached.

                                                            INTRODUCTION

            1.0    There are essentially three types of safety problem to be considered
        within a football ground and in its immediate surroundings.

              1.1 The first concerns hazards to individuals which cause tripping,
          slipping and falling. The guidelines for general contructional features of a
          ground, for surfaces and components are intended to deal with this type of
          problem.

              1.2 The second type is far more important and more specific to safety
          at football grounds. When large crowds are present and densities are high,
          pressures build up within the crowd either through motion or swaying which
         make it difficult, if indeed possible, for individuals to control their own
         movements. Under these conditions crowd pressures can escalate to a dan­
         gerous state and if a person stumbles or fails the crowd cannot adapt to
         avoid him or stop to help. Since this type of danger arises from crowd pressures
         its remedy lies in their removal or restraint within safe limits. These dangers
         arise in particular on the terraces during a match and in the exit routes follow­
         ing a match and so careful attention must be paid to restraining surges and
         similar pressures on the terraces and to ensuring free movement throughout
         the exit systems. Such free movement is dependent upon the capacity of all
         the various sections of the exit systems and interactions between them.
            1.3 The third type of safety problem cannot be divorced from the second
         and in some ways is an extreme version of it. The danger arises from emer­
         gency situations which can develop following an outbreak of fire or even
         hooliganism. This type of problem is not specifically dealt with in this report.
                                                                        20
tf




         2.0    This report recommends guidelines which are based on the latest
     knowledge available, taking into account research carried out to date and com­
     mon usage which has so far proved to be safe. It is assumed they may be revised
     should more information become available or in the event of a change in the
     pattern of crowd behaviour.
           2.1 Implementation of the guidelines should go some way to ensure the
       safety of spectators. The problem of crowd safety at a football match, how­
       ever, is complex and cannot be solved simply be linking a number of ground
       components each satisfactory by itself. The inter-relation of components is
       important: they should be compatible and combine to form a balanced unit.
           2.2 Deviations from individual guidelines are possible without necessarily
       detracting from the overall safety of the ground. Indeed, bearing in mind the
       needs of safety as a basic consideration, flexibility of approach has been the
       principle adopted.


                                          SITING

         3.0     Most grounds have existed on their present sites for many years—
     certainly before the motor car was in general use—and their immediate surrounds
     of buildings, streets and railways have prevented development at a pace in step
     with modern needs. The development of grounds over the years has been some­
     what haphazard in most cases, much depending on available financial resources
     and on the local experience available for guidance on structural requirements.
     As a result there are few standard features in the detailed composition of
     football grounds and at times even in various sections of the same ground.
     Inevitably in these circumstances a modern stadium can only be provided in
     the vast majority of cases by rebuilding at a different site where provisions can
     be made for adequate car parks, assembly points, entrances and exits.


                                 GENERAL CONSTRUCTION

         4.0 To meet the requirements of safety in a ground the components must
     have the strength and durability to carry out their required functions. Accord­
     ingly the design and construction of components should accord with accepted
     good engineering practice. The relevant sections of statutory Building Regulations
     applicable in the area in which the stadium lies and the relevant British Stan­
     dard specifications and codes of practice where these are consistent with the
     above regulations should be observed. All components should be carefully
     inspected for defects annually.
        5.0 The following features in sports grounds call for particular attention.
           5.1 When walls and fences are to withstand crowd pressures they should
       be designed to withstand such pressures in addition to wind pressures and
       incidental loadings.
           5.2 All parts of the ground used by the general public, and especially the
       exit routes, should have a minimum headroom of 7 feet or such height as
       required by the appropriate Building Regulations.
                                             21
*




           5.3 The provision of non-slip surfaces and durable edgings to steps
       stairs etc.
          5.4 The mounting of barriers and handrails.
           5.5 Existing loose-filled terracing and viewing slopes should be inspected
       at sufficiently close intervals with a view to ensuring that they maintain their
       sound condition.

          5.6 Precautions should be taken to prevent people from climbing on
       roofs, lighting towers, hoardings and the like. Where possible such structures
       should be provided with unclimbable devices e.g. stout barriers or close
       boarded enclosures. Spikes and barbed wire should only be installed above a
       minimum height of 7 ' from the base.
        6.0     In line with the current practice of many clubs, all football clubs should
    invite local Chief Fire Officers to inspect their grounds and to advise on fire
    prevention measures and means of escape in the event of fire. This would prepare
    clubs for any statutory requirements which may be imposed under the provisions
    of the Fire Precautions Act 1971.


                                   ACCESS AND EGRESS


        7.0 It is generally recognised that the period of greatest risk to crowd
    safety at football grounds is at the time of leaving. Pressures can be set up within
    a departing crowd by impatient people and these incipient pressures can and
    must be contained by careful attention to the detailed design of barriers, stair­
    cases, gangways and exits.
        8.0 Spectators should have a smooth and unimpeded passage through an
    exit route. This may be achieved by controlling the crowd flow at the entrance
    to the exit route so that the departing spectators are held back in a relatively
    safe place e.g. on the terrace.
          8.1      Recent research has indicated that when it takes more than 7 minutes
      to leave a ground the crowd flow tends to become turbulent. In these conditions
      individuals can lose control of their own movements and the flow rates may
      be reduced. It is therefore suggested that exits should be so designed that if
      desired or required the spectators can leave in 8 minutes or less.
       9.0 A comprehensive system of signposting which clearly indicates routes
    to various parts of the ground should be provided. Directional signs should be
    placed to encourage crowds to flow in one direction when leaving the ground.
       10.0 No kiosk or lavatory should be situated in such a way that it or the
    associated queue obstructs an exit route.
       11.0 Although the minimum width for any section in the exit routes should
    be 4 the required width for any particular section is dependent on the crowd
    flow it will be required to carry.(*)
       •See paragraph 36.1

                                            22
Turnstiles

   12.0 By their number and location turnstiles control the rate of admission
to a ground or parts of it and, to a large extent, the dispersal within of spectators
to their chosen sections. Turnstiles should be of such numbers as to admit at a
rate whereby no unduly large crowds are waiting for admission, and yet at no
faster rate than the arrangements for packing the terraces can handle. When
calculating turnstile needs an admission rate per turnstile of about 750 an hour
might be borne in mind.

    12.1 Where allowed, the use of barriers—even of the movable type—can be
  helpful in regulating the approach to turnstiles of people seeking admission.

Staircases Used By The General Public

   13.0 This is an area which calls for particular attention. The aim should be to
provide staircases which limit hazards to the minimum by such features as
uniform going, secure footing, not too steep a gradient, and a width sufficient
to allow free movement but narrow enough to provide everyone with access to a
handrail. The head of the staircase should be designed so that flow is uniform
across its width and crowd pressures cannot easily be generated. In addition
flights should not provide long, unrestricted paths down which crowd pressures
and surges can be created. The following points should be borne in mind.

       13.1 The “going” of stairs should be uniform.

     13.2 Stair treads should not be less than 11" wide exclusive of any nosings
  (and preferably at least 12'); the risers being not more than 1 \” (and pre­
  ferably 6* or less). (It is recognised as good practice to design stairs so that
  the sum of the tread width plus twice the riser height lies between 22£" and
  25*.)

     13.3 Staircases should be in flights of not more than 16 or fewer than 3
  steps.

     13.4 Preferably every person on a staircase should have access to a hand*
  rail. Accordingly the minimum width of a staircase should be 4 ' exclusive
  of handrails, staircases wider than 4 ' being divided as far as possible into 4 '
  channels and handrails provided at each side of a staircase or channel. Where
  a staircase is not divisible into 4 ' channels and so a compromise has to be
  reached, no channel should be less than 3 ' 6".

       13.5 Handrails should be fixed at a height of 2 ' 9 * and not project more than
  y.


    13.6 It is desirable that staircases should have not more than 2 successive
 flights without a turn and there should be a turn after every flight with more
 than 12 steps. The depth of the landing between flights, in the direction of the
 crowd flow, should not be less than the width of the staircase.

       13.7 The width of staircases should be uniform.
                                           23
•♦%

        14.0 To ensure a free flow of spectators, the access to the head of a staircase
      should be limited as follows.
            14.1 The approach to the head should be level and be from the front and/or
         the sides only i.e. not from behind and around the edges of the staircase.
           14.2 The extent of the approach in the same direction as the staircase
         should not be less than 4' and preferably not more than 9 '.
           14.3 Where the staircase is divided into channels access should be arranged
         with a view to securing a uniform flow down each channel.
            14.4 Where these considerations lead to the use of portal type(*) approaches
         to the head of stairs, the total width of the portals should be limited to 5 the
         minimum width of the staircase. This is based on the relative flow rates through
         portals, staircases and passages as given in paragraph 43.0.
            14.5 Exit staircases down from terraces etc should preferably feed into a
         concourse or passage. Exceptionally a staircase may feed straight through an
         exit gate, but only when the gate is wider than the foot of the staircase and
         does not lead on to a public thoroughfare.
         15.0 The provision of handrails and turns and the control of access rates, as
      in paragraphs 13.5, 13.6 and 14.0 to 14.5 above, should prevent excessive
      crowd pressures from building up on a staircase. Where there are open staircases
      and landings, however, balustrades should be provided to the same strength as
      the stronger crush barriers(t) and the sides of these balustrades should be
      enclosed where there is a dangerous drop to the side.

      Ramps

         16.0 The gradient should preferably be constant and not broken by steps.
           16.1 The shallower the gradient the better. The maximum gradient accep­
        table will depend on the particular ramp’s length, purpose and usage but a
        ramp subject to heavy crowd flow should preferably not exceed a gradient
        of 1 in 10.

      Exits From The Ground

        17.0 The ideal type of door is that which opens outwards with the crowd flow.
      Inward opening doors can be extremely difficult to open when crowds are
      present and are very resistant to forcible opening by a departing crowd in an
      emergency. Sliding or roller-shutter doors have the disadvantages of not being
      capable of being opened when pressure is exerted in the direction of crowd flow
      and of having mechanism and runways which are vulnerable to jamming.
          17.1 All exit doors should be secured in the fully open position before the
        end of play.
          17.2 When open, no door should obstruct any gangway, passage, staircase,
        or landing.
      * a passage or gateway of less than 10 feet in length leading from one open space to another
      t See paragraph 42.0
                                                  24
     17.3 There should be no obstruction in an exit e.g. no threshold provided
  at exit doors.
    17.4 All exit doors should be manned at all times while the ground is
  used by the public.
    17.5 Facilities should be provided to enable people to leave the ground at
  any time. For this purpose a number of reversible turnstiles or doors so
  operated as to limit the openings to the passage of individual persons might be
  considered.


                                    TERRACES

   18.0 In addition to the incidental dangers of standing for long periods on
steep terraced slopes, crowds are subject to excessive pressures generated by
spectators straining to see the game, by excitement or by surging deliberately
induced by a certain type of spectator. And so arrangements should be made to
encourage even distribution of the crowd on the terraces to provide ease of
access and egress, to facilitate movement particularly in the event of a local
emergency during the game, and to contain pressures before they reach dan­
gerous proportions. The requirements might be met by the following provisions.
   19.0 Failure to provide spectators with an unobstructed view invites them to
stretch and strain and so generate dangerous pressures within the crowd. For
these reasons it is desirable to provide a minimum distance between the front
of the terrace and the touch line or goal line on the pitch. This distance depends
upon the gradient of the terrace (see paragraph 40.0).

Terrace Steps

  20.0 A terrace step should not be less than 11* wide, the ideal being 14' to
15'.
     20.1 The height of risers should be within the limits of 3* and           the
  lower limit of 3 ' being related to the minimum width of 1 1 If the riser height
  is greater than       it is desirable that a crush barrier should be provided at
  the top of the riser.
    20.2 Excessive variations in the gradient of a terrace should be avoided.
  Steeper gradients than 1 in 2 could be dangerous.

Gangways

   21.0 The aim should be to ensure that every spectator on the terraces is within
20' of a gangway or of an exit. This may be achieved by a pattern of gangways
linked to the exit system, and the following points borne in mind.
     21.1 Spectators would be discouraged from standing in lateral gangways
  if they were sunk 4 ' to 8 ' and if crush barriers were provided behind but not
  immediately in front of them.
   21.2 Radial gangways which are relatively long and uncontrolled down­
  ward paths through terraces are difficult to keep clear especially when sited

                                        25
  behind a goal area. It is helpful to sink then 6 ' to 8 ’ and to interrupt an other­
  wise continuously descending gangway by turns along, say, lateral gangways.
  As with other forms of staircases the going should be uniform and the step
  dimensions as defined in paragraph 13.2.

Penning

  22.0 A ground should be divided into sections to prevent major migrations by
spectators e.g. each end or side of a ground should be self-contained with its
own entrances, exits and toilet/refreshment facilities. There should be no access
from one such major section to another except in an emergency.
    22.1 Each of these major sections should be sub-divided into pens by
  such means as gangways and crush barriers so disposed as to minimise sway
  and surge of spectators.
     22.2 Since danger could arise within a pen, e.g. from hooligans, it is de­
  sirable for the barriers to be so designed as to permit spectatois to move from
  one pen to another.

Crush Barriers
  23.0 Much of the hazard on terraces can be eliminated by the provision of
well constructed, correctly positioned and properly mounted crush barriers.
    23.1 The m a x i m u m spacing of crush barriers will be dependent on the
  gradient of the terrace or viewing slope. Paragraphs 41.0 to 42.2 give the
  spacing and design strength for crush barriers.
     23.2 Ideally crush barriers should be provided along the full width of a
  terrace with gaps only at the radial gangways.
     23.3 Where barriers are not continuous between radial gangways, the line
  of gaps on consecutive barriers on a terrace should form an angle of less than
  60° to the barriers. There should not be more than 2 consecutive gaps in any
  line of gaps.
    23.4 Where there are gaps in the line of crush barriers these should be at
  least 3 ' 6* and not more than 4 ' 6* in width.
    23.5 The height of crush barriers should preferably be^3' 6 ' above the
  ground. In all cases they should be between 3 ' 4 ' and 3 ' 8*.
     23.6 Crush barriers should be designed so that there are no sharp pro­
  jections or edges. Although a barrier with a top rail of 2 ' internal diameter
  tube has been adopted at many grounds, research has shown there would be
  advantage in the use of a flat rail of 4 ' depth.

Viewing Slopes i.e. mounds or non-stepped terraces
 24.0 The surface of this form of terrace should be covered with a non-slip
material e.g. packed ash.
     24.1 The desirable maximum gradient for a viewing slope is 1 in 6.
                                          26
     24.2 Viewing slopes steeper than 1 in 6 should have continuous crush
   barriers between gangways.
     24.3 Intervals between crush barriers should be the same as those for
   normal terracing, (see paragraphs 41.0 to 41.2).

 Pitch Perim eter Fence) W all

   25.0 This fence should be designed to keep spectators off the pitch but
gates or other access points should be provided for use in an emergency and,
at those grounds where a perimeter track is used as part of the exit system, for
the departure of spectators at the end of play.
     25.1 Access points should be controlled.
     25.2 If spectators can lean on this fence it should be deemed a crush
   barrier and meet the requirements of strength and height. If the fence is of
   solid construction, however, it need not comply with the upper limit of height.

                             SEATING ACCOMMODATION

  26.0 There is a less hurried exodus from stands at the end of the game and,
furthermore, spectators are induced by the layout of the seats to form orderly
queues. However, general safety considerations similar to the terraces apply to
seated stands and in this regard attention should be paid to the following
points.
  27.0 Seats and gangways should be arranged to provide ready access to
exits.
     27.1 All seats should be securely fixed in position.
     27.2 The minimum area allotted to each seated person should be 18* wide
  and 2 4 ' deep, but for comfort these measurements should be 21' and 30'
  respectively. To enable people to move freely between rows of seats there
  should be at least 12' between perpendiculars from the foremost projection
  of one seat and the back of the seat in front. (This minimum 12' is included in
  the 2 4 ' or 3 0 ' depth measurement of the seating area.)

Balustrading
  28.0 Those sections of balustrading which lie at the foot of staircases/
gangways within stands should be constructed as crush barriers of the stronger
category (see paragraph 42.0).

Steps or Stepped Gangways Within Stands
  29.0 Steps or stepped gangways within stands should be of adequate width
for the number of seats served but should be no less than 4 '. There should be
no projection to diminish the clear width of the steps.
   30.0 The overriding safety consideration in seating accommodation, however,
is likely to be the need for rapid evacuation in, say, the case of fire and as men­
tioned in paragraph 6.0 clubs should seek the advice of local Chief Fire Officers.

                       COMMUNICATIONS FOR CROWD CONTROL


Major Grounds(*)
  31.0     A central control point, preferably a room, should be set aside for the
use of the supervising police officer and the chief steward.
    31.1 There should be intercommunication between the central control
  and all turnstiles or banks of turnstiles, and all entry and exit gates used by the
  public.
     31.2 Metering systems to record all admissions should be installed at
  turnstiles and, so as to ensure ground capacities are not exceeded in any
  section arrangements made for central control to be informed immediately
  a predetermined number of spectators has been admitted through each turn­
  stile.
     31.3 Public address equipment should be installed so that broadcast
   messages can be heard under reasonable conditions by all persons of norm
   hearing in any part of the ground to which the public has access.
      31.4 Loud hailers should be available for the use of stewards and police
   in directing or instructing spectators.
      31     5 Any police radio facilities available for law and order enforcement
   purposes should augment and not supersede the club communications system.

 Other Than M ajor Grounds
    32 0 At such grounds the communications should be appropriate to the
 c ,r c u L u n^ of p ou n d structures, capacities and attendances. The require­
 ments should be determined after consultation with the police officers responsi
 for supervision.
                                              LIGHTING

                             ESTIMATION OF GROUND CAPACITY

Of calculating the number of people that can be safely accommodated when
taking into account interactions between these individual features and when there
are deviations from the guidelines.
    34.1 This method assesses
      (a) the holding capacity of a terrace (that of a stand being determined
          by the number of seats when the stand conforms to guidelines), and
      (,b) the capacity of a given exit route from a terrace or stand.
     34      2 The number of people that can be safely accommodated on a terrace,
  however, is either its holding capacity or the capacity of the exit system from
  it (as defined in paragraph 36.1), whichever is the smaller.
     34.3    A plan of the ground should be available with such details as exits,
  stands, terraces, staircases, passages, kiosks, seats and barriers. A scale o
  1:200 would be convenient for this purpose.

Terraces And Viewing Slopes
   35 0 The area of a terrace or viewing slope which is available for standing
is that area from which the whole of the playing area can be seen, but excluding
those parts which are intended or needed for use as gangways.
     35.1      The capacity of a terrace or viewing slope should be assessed from the
   area available for standing (as defined in paragraph 35.0) by allowing
        (a) 2 square feet per person when the terrace or viewing slope is in good
           condition, and
        (M 4 square feet when it materially deviates from the recommended
           guidelines so as to constitute a possible hazard to individuals closely
           packed.
   When gangways are not in existence an appropriate reduction should be made
   in the area available for standing.
     35.2 When crush barriers conform to the recommended                         [Jf*
   capacity of the terrace is calculated by dividing the area available for standing
   by 2 or 4 as appropriate.
     35       3 When the spacing of crush barriers does not conform to the f e l i n e s ,
   the capacity is calculated from the provision of crush barriers in the standing
   area” (as defined in paragraph 35.0) as follows:
        (a) Where a terrace contains either “peak viewing areas (*) only or
           ‘•other viewing aieas”C ) o n ly -b y multiplying the totri ta g th of
           crush barriers by the appropriate distance between te m e n as given
           in paragraph 41.2) or the existing distance, whichever is less, and
           dividing by 2 or 4 as appropriate.
        (b) Where a terrace contains both "peak viewing areas” and otter
           viewing areas”—by multiplying the total l e n g t h of bam ers by the
            appropriate d is ta n t between barriers in a ^ k ^ w m g ^ a «
            the existing distance, whichever is less, and dividing by 2 or 4 as
            appropriate.
            •See paragraph 41.1.

                                          29
      35.4    If a pitch perimeter fence or crush barrier is of insufficient strength,
   it should be replaced or an additional barrier installed to shield it.

 Exit Systems

   36.0 The aim should be to obtain a free flow of spectators from the terrace
 or stand to the street outside.
      36.1 The capacity of an exit system can be obtained by assessing for each
   element in the system the number of persons that can pass in 8 minutes.
   This calculation is made by multiplying the width of the element by the
   appropriate flow rate in paragraph 43.0.
     36.2 Where the width of an element in an exit system is less than 4 ' wide,
   that section should be omitted from the capacity calculation.
     36.3 Where there are gross deviations in design or construction from the
   recommended guidelines so as to create a manifest danger, that section of the
   exit route should be closed until remedial action has been taken.
     36.4 Kiosks from which queues may obstruct exit routes should be closed
   before the end of play.
  37.0 Where there is a simple exit route no element in that route should be
unable to carry into it the flow from the terrace or stand exit.
     37.1    For a more complex exit system with a mixing and/or choice of
  alternative routes to exits, however, the system should be analysed in the
  form of a network in order to check that the capacity of the exit from the
  terrace or stand is such as to ensure a free flow of spectators to the various
  exits from the ground. Where branching of routes gives departing spectators
  a choice of paths, the proportion of the crowd likely to use each path should
  be derived from local knowledge.
  38.0 A narrowing in the exit route is acceptable when it is preceded by an
open space or reservoir area where the holding capacity is sufficient to contain
the free flow from the terrace or stand exit into that reservoir area.
   39.0 Where there is not a free flowing system, the width of the restricting
element should be increased and/or the width of the exit from the stand or the
terrace reduced.

                           TABLES AND CALCULATIONS

   40.0 Minimum distance between the front o f the terrace and the touch-lines
and goal lines on the pitch
This is calculated by the following equation:
distance in feet**(5.75+H) cotangent A
          where 5*75' is the average height o f adult males
                       (Montegriffo V.M.E., Annals of Human Genetics, 1968)
              H       is the difference (in feet) between the pitch and the front
                       o f the terrace; the sign being negative when the front of
                       the terrace is below the level of the pitch, and
              A       is the angle of the terrace to the horizontal.
                                       30
    40.1 In no case, however, should the terrace be nearer than 10 feet to the
  touch-line or goal line.
     40.2 Examples of these minimum distances where the front of the terrace
  is on a level with the pitch i.e. H = 0 :
               Gradient o f terrace                  Minimum Horizontal Distance

Spacing o f crush barriers
  41.0     The location and spacing of crush barriers will be major factors in the
safety of spectators on the terrace. Column A in the following tables provides
the maximum distance between barriers when safety is the sole consideration.
To provide greater comfort for spectators, however, the interval between
barriers should be as given in Column B.
    41.1 A distinction is made between barrier intervals required in
      (a) “peak viewing areas” i.e. behind penalty boxes and other areas
         which will be known locally,
  and (b) “other viewing areas” .
  The reason for this distinction is that spectators in the “peak viewing areas”
  tend to become more emotionally involved in the game and their reactions
  cause additional pressures to be set up in those sections of the terrace.

Strength o f crush barriers
  42.0     All crush barriers which are spaced in accordance with the distances
in Column A above should be designed to resist a horizontal force of 340 lbs
per foot run of barrier static loading acting on the crossbar of the barrier at
right angles to the longitudinal axis.
    42.1 Barriers spaced according to Column B above should resist a force
  of 230 lbs per foot run.
    42.2 The foundations of barriers should be designed to withstand an
  overturning moment of twice the designed load on the bam er rail.

       Calculation o f exit route capacities
          43.0 The recommended flow rates are:
             (a) 35 persons per foot width per minute for gateways and portals(*), and
             (b) 25 persons for staircases and passages.
            43.1 Using these flow rates, in 8 minutes
               (a) 280 persons would pass through gateways or portals, and 200 persons
                  through staircases and passages for each foot width of these elements.
               (b) 7 ' 2 ' width of gateway/portal or 10' width of staircase/passage would
                 be required to pass 2,000 persons.




     "passages o r gateways o f less than 10 feet in length leading from one open space to another.

EXTRACTS FROM THE PLEADINGS SHOWING ALLEGATIONS

     (1)   The     introduction          of radial fences without                 separate      turnstiles
           (Amended Statement of Claim, para 10 (a) - (d)).




     (a)   Failed as     the       Second        Defendants          Safety     Consultant        to advise
           against the erection of radial fences without the installation of
           separate turnstiles to each pen created thereby.




     The "Second Defendants' Safety Consultant" is an incorrect description
     of the role of the Fourth Defendants, which was as stated above.


     At the relevant time the               conventional             wisdom regarding radial fences
     was   that     contained        in     the       Guide     to     Safety     at    Sports        Grounds
     (Football), 1976 Edition ("the 1976 Green Guide").                                This recommended:-


           "18.1      Crowd movement on terraces should be severely limited                                  in
           order to give           the     Police       the     fullest       opportunity         for    crowd
           control. Less problems occur where the                         terraces are divided              as
           far as possible into sections by the use of railings or barriers,
           both     radial     and        lateral.           Ideally,     each     section        should     be
           serviced by its           own     entrance/exits,             refreshment facilities and
           toilets."


     Accordingly,      separate                  turnstiles           were in     no way regarded as a
     pre-condition      for        the     introduction of             radial fences.          The    general
     recommendation of radial              fences in         the      Green Guide was reinforced in
     the case of Hillsborough              by the Police,             who urged their          introduction
     as a means of enabling               them    to     exercise        greater        control       over the
     terrace.       Their     introduction             was     first     advocated        by    the     Police
     following the     experience                of    policing        the 1981    FA Cup semi~final,
     during      which crushing occurred due (in the opinion of the Police)                                  to
     their inability to            exercise        sufficient          control over the movement of
     spectators,      and was supported and approved by the Working Party.                                  The
     Fourth Defendants were not                  responsible for the operational control of
     the   terrace.         Both     in    1981       (when the        first     radial        fences      were
introduced) and in 1985 (when more                   radial fences were introduced) the
Fourth    Defendants         recommended           schemes    which       would    have   provided
separate turnstiles serving each                   section of the terrace.            In 1981 the
Fourth    Defendants,           through       Mr    John     Strange,       prepared      for   and
presented to the Second Defendants                    through its then Club Secretary Mr
Eric     England, two alternative schemes for the installation of                           radial
fences and the re-organisation of turnstiles at the Leppings Lane end,
with     separate       capacity figures for the separate sections of                      terrace
which would be created by               the    radial        fences and separate turnstiles
for    each     section.        In 1985 the Fourth Defendants                 proposed     further
alternative schemes which would also have provided separate turnstiles
for each section of the terrace.


(b)    Failed         when     their    own    plans       for     new    turnstiles      had   been
       abandoned, to advise the               Second       Defendants       of the necessity
       remove the radial fences).


The    Fourth     Defendants           made   plain       their    preference       for    separate
turnstiles       in preparing and presenting their plans;                         but to term    the
provision of separate             turnstiles         a    "necessity"       if there were to be
radial fences, would have been an overstatement,                           and would have       gone
beyond     either        the     recommendations             of     the    Green     Guide or the
requirements of the licensing authority through the Working Party.


(c)    Accepted assurances that the Second Defendants and the Police had
       agreed a system of              monitoring        numbers     entering the pens at the
       Leanings Lane end, when on a proper analysis, it should have been
       clear that no such system could operate efficiently, particularly
       if the pens were not filled one by one.




This amounts to saying


(i)    that     the     Leppings       Lane end was incapable of being                 safely    and
       efficiently policed, and,
(ii) that the Fourth Defendants should have known this.




Both    premises       are denied.           Pens 3 and 4 were created in                   1985.        The
Fourth Defendants knew,                 because      they       were      so instructed,         that the
purpose       of    radial        fences was to enable the filling of                     pens      to    be
controlled individually and to                    enable individual pens to be closed as
and    when        those     in     charge judged it right to                do     so.      The    Fourth
Defendants         proposed         a    different          structural            approach     (separate
turnstiles),          which would have obviated the need for such                            monitoring.
They were rightly             not       asked   to    advise         on    how     the control of the
filling       of the pens was to be carried out, which was not a structural
matter but a matter for consultation between the Police and the Second
Defendants.           Such        arrangements were not the                responsibility          of     the
Fourth Defendants,                but    they   had       no    reason      to suppose that proper
arrangements          could not be made or that the arrangements made                              between
the Police and the                Second    Defendants          would be unsatisfactory or (as
happened on 15 April 1989) would not be carried out.


(d)    Regarded       the     pens       formed      by        the     radial      fences     as     spjjl
       constituting one individual terrace.




The     Fourth        Defendants           regarded       the    pens      for     what   they          were;
sub-divisions of a terrace which                      were      not self-contained (ie, having
separate       entrances,           toilets     and refreshment             facilities)        but       were
capable of being closed individually.




 (2)    The removal of barrier 144                   (Amended        Statement of Claim, para 10

       (*))•

 (e)    Failed to advise against the removal of barrier 144 and failed to
       warn the Second Defendants, the                         Officer Working Party and/or the
       Third Defendants of the dangers thereof.
On 18 June 1986 there was a meeting between Mr R H Chester, the Second
Defendants          then    Club Secretary,             and representatives of the             Police.
The matters discussed included the                       possible        removal of certain crush
barriers       at    the Leppings Lane standing area in order to                           assist    the
flow of spectators.                It    was    noted        in   Mr     Chester's minutes of the
meeting that the matter "would have to be taken up when the inspection
of the Ground relative to the                     issuing of the Safety Certificate takes
place." The Fourth Defendants were not informed.


At the Working Party                annual     inspection         on     7 August 1986 the Police
proposed       that,       inter     alia, two sections of barrier                   144    should    be
removed before the start of the                      next     season.      The Fourth Defendants,
who     were     represented at the inspection by Mr Strange, had                            no     prior
knowledge that the matter was to be raised.                             The Working Party did not
request        the presence or advice of Dr Eastwood.                          The reasons    advanced
by the Police          for     the       removal        of   barrier       144     were that in their
experience          it had proved to be a vantage point close to the mouth                             of
the tunnel for             groups       of   spectators,          who     refused     to move despite
requests       from        the Police to do so, thereby                   causing     congestion      and
backfilling of the tunnel with                       consequent         risk to safety and risk of
friction       and     disorder.         They were also concerned about the                   risk    to
safety if the spectators on                    the      terrace     had to be evacuated through
the tunnel in an emergency.


The     Police       wanted     the barrier to be removed before the                       first     hone
natch     of     the       season       against      Everton      on      25     August    1986, when a
particularly           large    crowd was expected because of the opening of                          the
new Spion Kop development.


Inspector Calvert put forward                     the    Police        proposal and their reasons
for it to the other members of the Working Party as they were standing
at the end of the tunnel and directly in front of barrier 144.
Mr Strange said that if barrier                  144 were removed, the capacity of the
terrace would theoretically be affected, because of the reduced number
of barriers.        Inspector     Calvert         stated     that in his opinion, from an
operational      viewpoint, the removal of the barrier would make the                            pen
safer and the control           of    spectators          easier.      Mr Strange raised the
possibility      of extending the barrier immediately in front of                        barrier
144 to the radial fence,              but       Inspector     Calvert was opposed to this
idea.    After discussion the Working Party approved the proposal of the
Police that the sections             of     barrier       should be removed and the Third
Defendants       (by their Chief Licensing Officer Mr Bownes) affirmed                           the
decision that the two sections of barrier 144 should be removed.


During the whole inspection 9                   items were identified where the Working
Party    required      work to be carried out by the Second Defendants.                              Mr
Strange reported to         the      Second       Defendants        accordingly.      Of    the 9
items,     he was instructed that the Second Defendants would                         themselves
attend to two items (nos 3                and      4 on the     list      of items made by Mr
Strange)      and he was instructed               to deal    with    the remainder       (including

barrier 144).


Mr Strange also reported             on     the     inspection       to   Dr Eastwood.          It is
denied that the Fourth Defendants were under any duty to try to obtain
a reversal of the decision made in relation to barrier 144.


In any event, Dr Eastwood did not consider the decision of the Working
Party    to    be    unreasonable.              To have left the two         sections      of        the
barrier in face of the experience                   of,    and risks to safety identified
by, the Police would have been irresponsible.                        The risk which occurred
on 15    April      1989,   when      the       Police     opened     Cate   C   to     allow the
uncontrolled        entry   of some 2,000 spectators into pens 3 and 4                          at     a
time when they were already                manifestly full, was not a risk which the
Fourth Defendants either foresaw or                  ought to have foreseen at the time
of the removal of barrier 144.                    It is also expressly denied that the
removal of barrier 144 caused the injury or death of the deceased.
(3)   Width of the perimeter gates (Amended Statement of Claim, para 10

       (£))•


(f)   Failed to advise the Second Defendants against the placing and/or
      continuing       to     have in place in the perimeter fence gates                        which
      were too small to            be   exit     gates        in    breach of the Green Guide
      and/or     failed properly to advise the Second Defendants as to the

      failings of the gates.


The gate to pen 3 was installed in                    1985.         It was .85 metre in width.
At    that     time    the Green Guide (1976 Edition)                   did        not   recommend    a
minimum width for           perimeter        gates.      The relevant provisions were as
follows:


       "7.9     Pitch perimeter fence/wall.


       7.9.1      This fence should be designed to keep spectators off                               the
       pitch but gates or other access points should be provided for use
       in     an emergency and, at those grounds where a perimeter track is
       used as part of the exit system,                  for the departure of spectators
       at the end of play.




       7.9.2      Access       points        should be controlled, so                that    immediate
       access to the          pitch     or    perimeter        track        can be ensured in the
       event of an emergency.




       18.3     Access        to   playing pitches must be made as                       difficult    as
      possible        in     normal      circumstances             while,     at     the    same time,
      providing        the     Police        with proper access to             the       terraces    for
      purposes of crowd control                and     enabling        the pitch to be used in
       the event of serious emergency."
Gate 3 was not part of the exit system for the departure of spectators
at the end of play and,            without     it,     pen    3 satisfied the evacuation
time     required by the Green guide.            The width of perimeter        gates       had
been considered by the            Working     Party,     including the Police and Fire
Service, on various occasions prior to 1985.


The Green      Guide      (1986    Edition)     introduced        (in   paragraph   215)     a
recommendation that the perimeter gates should have a minimum width of
1.1    metres.      The   new     recommendations       were considered by the Working
Party,       who reasonably concluded that the existing perimeter gates had
in practice proved satisfactory               for their purpose and did not require
to be widened.


Further,       it   is    denied that widening gate 3 from .85              metre   to     1.1
metres would have averted            the     death     of the deceased.      The perimeter
gates     were neither designed nor intended for the evacuation of                       large
numbers in a short time, and a               gate    of 1.1 metre width would no more
have served that purpose that a gate of .85 metre width.


(4)    The    testing of crush barriers and the collapse of                  barrier     124A
        (Amended Statement of Claim,            para 10 (g)).


(g)    Failed nronerlv to test          the     crush        barriers   in pen 3 to ensure
        they were of adequate strength and/or failed to advise the Second
        Defendant of the weaknesses in the barrier which collapsed.
The barriers in pen 3 were properly tested by the Fourth Defendants in
July 1988 in accordance with Annex C to the Green Guide, 1986 Edition.
The   sections of barrier 124A which collapsed on 15 April 1989                          passed
the test.      Further, or in the         alternative,          if it be alleged that the
Fourth     Defendants interpretation of Annex C was incorrect, the Fourth
Defendants say that




      (a)    their interpretation was               reasonable and coincided with that
      of (inter alias) the structural engineer of the Third Defendants,
      to whom the test results were sent;


      b)    if it be contended that the section which had a 59%                         recovery
      at the     first     application         of    load,      74%   recovery     on     second
      application and 100% on third application, should thereupon                           have
      been re-tested, on a re-test it would have shown 100% recovery on

      each application.




Barrier 124A was capable of withstanding,. and did withstand, the load
for   which it was designed.            The cause of the collapse of two sections
on 15 April 1989 was that it             was        subjected    to substantially greater

load.


(5)   Adequacy     of turnstiles used on 15 April 1989 (Amended                    Statement

      of Claim, para 10 (h)).


(h)   Failed     to   advise      the    Second        Defendants     that    tfe— existing
      turnstile facilities at the Leppings Lane end were inadequate.. £o
      accommodate a crowd of 24.000 and that for such facilities...is— be
      adequate thev should include the matters set out in sub-paragraph
      (a)    above    of    the   Particulars           of   Negligence      and   Breach—    q£

      Statutory Duty against the Second D efendants.
It was never part of          the    Fourth     Defendants         retainer     to advise the
Second     Defendants       in relation to the number of persons who could                       be
admitted     through    their       turnstiles        in   any     particular time or what
number of turnstiles they ought to provide (or use for any                         particular
match).


Further     and more specifically,             the allegation in this            sub-paragraph
presumes that the Fourth Defendants knew, or ought to have known, that
24,000     spectators       were    to   be admitted to the           ground      through       the
turnstiles at the Leppings Lane end.                  This was not so.


The necessity        to admit 24,000 spectators through the Leppings Lane end
turnstiles arose from the decision                   (about which         the Fourth Defendants
were     not consulted, since it was none of their business) to close the
turnstiles in Penistone Road which normally served the North Stand, so
diverting     6,000 spectators from the turnstiles in Penistone                          Road     to
the Leppings Lane end.             If those     6,000      spectators had not had to use
the    Leppings      Lane end, there would have been no                    difficulty     at     the
Leppings Lane        turnstiles.         (At    about      2.45     pm the crowd outside the
Leppings Lane turnstiles numbered about 5,000).


The    Green Guide, 1986 Edition, states (paragraph 47) that the maximum
notional rate at which             spectators        can   pass     through turnstiles will
depend on a variety of factors (design and age of equipment, ticketing
arrangements, etc) but in general is unlikely to exceed 750 per hour.


Without the        additional       6,000     spectators,         there    would have been 23
turnstiles     at the Leppings Lane end to serve 18,000 spectators.                             At a
rate of entry of 750 per hour, the admission time would have been 62.6
minutes.     At a rate of entry of 1,000 per hour (because it was an                             all
ticket match),        the    admission        time    would       have been 47 minutes.           By
comparison     the     current      recommendation made by Lord                Justice     Taylor
following the Hillsborough Inquiry is that the turnstiles serving each
viewing     area     should be capable of admitting the intended                    number        of

spectators within one hour.
(6)    Signs (Amended Statement of Claim para 10 (i).


(i)    Failed to advise the              Second      Defendants    of their failure within
       the   ground to sign clearly the existence of and the way to                          pens
       one/two and six/seven.




Save    on      occasions       when     they     received      specific    instructions       (in
particular,        to provide certain fire exit emergency signs at locations
requested by the Fire Service,                  to    provide     advertisement      boards for
the     restaurant and to provide direction signs to the sports hall)                           it
is     denied     that        the    Fourth     Defendants        had   any   involvement       or
responsibility           in     relation to signing either inside or              outside      the
ground.      This would in any event be linked with other matters, such as
the     turnstile and ticketing arrangements and with which parts of                           the
ground were to be used for any                  particular       match, which were likewise
matters outside the scope of the Fourth Defendants retainer.


(7)     Exit routes and means              of   escape       (Amended   Statement of Claim,
         para 10 (j) and (k).


(i)     Failed     (i) to recognise the need to                 provide a sufficient         means
        of escape of the crowd from the pens                    in the event of emergency.


(ii)    To advise        the        First. Second     and       Third   Defendants     and     the
        Football Association               of   the need to       provide     such   means     of
         escape.


( H i ) To heed that the gates provided were not such a sufficient means
        of escape.


(iv)    To design a sufficient means of escape as above.
The    Fourth       Defendants       repeat        the     matters     pleaded      in     answer     to
allegation (f).           The pens       satisfied         the evacuation times required by
the    Green Guide.            The only practicable way of enabling evacuation                        of
the terraces in a significantly shorter time would have been to remove
the    perimeter         fence, so as to enable mass exodus on                      to    the     pitch,
which it was the purpose                of     the    perimeter      fence     to        prevent.    The
recommendations           of     the Green Guide in relation to                perimeter          fences
involved a balance between                   (1)     the   need   in normal circumstances to
keep     spectators in, and (2) the need for access or egress in case                                 of
emergency.          It   was     never       the     intention    of    the    Green        Guide that
perimeter gates should be used for a mass exodus on to the pitch,                                    for
which purpose the gates recommended would have been insufficient.


(k)    Sanctioned the use of crowd enclosure which was in fact a tray.




The history of, and reasons for,                      the introduction of the pens are set
out    in sub-paragraphs (a) and (c) above.                       The function of such              crowd
enclosures was to limit                 crowd      movement,      as recommended by Paragraph
18.1     of     the      1976 Green Guide and Paragraph 206 of                   the       1986     Green
Guide.        It is denied that           the      pens    were     intrinsically dangerous or
constituted           a trap.     Danger arose only because those responsible                        for
filling        them      caused    or        permitted       them      to     become       dangerously

over-crowded.


(8)    Certified         capacity of terrace (Amended Statement of Claim,                           para

       10 ( 1 ) .


(1)    Failed to give adequate                  consideration and response to the Second
       Defendants’          enquiries         concerning       the certified capacity of th<g
       terrace in February. March and April 1987.
This    allegation and its relevance are denied.               The    certification        of
capacity was the        responsibility   of     the local authority.              The Fourth
Defendants had pointed out to them that the removal of barriers should
in theory lead to a reduction of         certified          capacity as calculated by
the    Green    Guide; it was a matter for their decision what,                     if   any,
reduction to make.        The decision not to do so was not unreasonable. In
any event, the matter is irrelevant to what happened on 15 April                         1989
because:-




(i)    the opening of Gate C meant that there was no way of limiting the
       number     on    the terrace to the certified          figure,       whatever     that
       figure might have been;


(ii) the       Health    and Safety Executive’s best estimate               of    the    total
       number who entered through turnstile A to G and Gate C was 9,734.
       The Fourth Defendants do not understand it to be alleged (and, if
       it be alleged,       the   allegation     is       denied)    that    the number of
       spectators       admitted to the terrace was excessive.               At    the    time
       when Gate C was opened, there was ample room remaining in pens 1,
       2, 6 and 7 for the spectators waiting to be admitted.

       flow in the tunnel to pens        3     and    4      with a gradient of 1 in 6
       instead     of    the 1 in 10 maximum recommended in the— Gregg— Gyidq
       paragraph 88.
(x)   Paragraph 6 of the           Amended   Second    Third     Party Notice is
      denied.    The tunnel and ramp were already in existence when
      the Second Third         Party    Defendant     was first instructed by
      the   First     Third     Party      Defendant in    1978,      having    been
      constructed         prior to 1966.      Over a three metre length          the
      ramp had a gradient of approximately 1 in 6.5.                   The average
      gradient      was     less than 1 in 10.        Where the      gradient    was
      greater than 1 in 10, it was             sloping downwards towards the
      pitch, whereas the most vulnerable time for use of ramps is
      at the end of matches when spectators are leaving.                     At this
      Stadium, spectators leaving the pitch would be on an uphill
      gradient which is safer than a downhill one.


(ii) The    Second    Third        Party     Defendant    gave       consideration,
      together      with     the    Licensing Authority        and     its   Officer
      Working Party, to the            gradient   of the ramp on a number of
      occasions, but is was considered very difficult, costly and
      unnecessary to make any alterations.

                   With regard to the above     incident    I have to report as follows!

                   At 0800 am Saturday,     15 April   1989,     (150489),    I commenced duty at

..   I    >1.      under Sergeant 840 W T ^ h t of Attercliffe Police Station™ Our duties

\)hr t(il{         included the transportation of the Liverpool              supporters from the

                   Midland train station to Hillsborough prior to the start of the

                   match,   stand by during the match,      returning the Liverpool           supporters

                   back to Midland Station at the conclusion of the match.

                   At 0900 am that morning     I attended at West Bar gymnasium for a
                                                                , iJ i * ?

                   provided, after which I made my way down to Midland Station in

                   company with Police Constable       1668 Lecky on foot.             We arrived at the

                   station at approximately 10Q0 am that same date.                Myself and other

                   officers were then deployed to form a line from the station entrance

                   to waiting buses so that all supporters           caught the buses provided.             I

                   made two trips down to the ground on the buses with PC Lecky.                    The

                   supportes on the buses appeared to be very quiet and.,w«re not any
                                                                                PAGE . 2,
                                                                          •     RS12 ::

         tVoubl'e at all.    Several of the supporters mentioned that they wished

         tp get to the g round as quickly as possible as they did not have any ,

        ■t i cket<».

        On arrival at the ground there were hundreds of supporters stood in

        the road at Leppings Lane.      Some were drinking,   some were quite rowdy

         others quiet.      I saw fans asking other fans if they had any spare

         tickets and several    tickets were sold near to the turnstiles.       The

        atmosphere was tense and fans were chanting football songs.            It was

         very noisy at that time but no more noisy than you would expect at a

        major football match.      There seemed to be no reason for fans waiting

         outside the ground as they were but they were not encouraged to enter

         the ground.

         Sergeant Wright     instructed PC Lecky and myself to go to the gymnasium

         for some refreshments and to stay with other officers on standby.

         This we did until about half an hour later there was a call over the

         radio for officers to attend at the Leppings Lane end of the ground

         as fans were trying to force their way into the ground.        I attended

         in company with PC Lecky, Sergeant Wright and other officers at Gate

         A in order to get out     into Leppings Lane but due to the crush of fans

         at the other side of the gate it was considered unsafe to open the

         gate as there might be a stampede of fans.      We then made our way to

        Gate C where after persuading a steward to open the gate we managed

             work our way out of the ground near to the turnstiles.       I believe

         that the gates were     closed to after we had got out.

        At this time there w e r e n ’t many people near to the gate.    The

jC- *   majority appeared to be pushing towards the turnstiles.         In my

         opinion peoples    lives were in danger due to the crush of hundreds of
$
         people trying to get into such a small area.      It was imposssible to

         push people b^ck away from the turnstiles as they did pot wish to miss

        the match.     I did not know at that time whether the match had started
                                                                                 page   ' 3


or not.     Gate C was opened and Sgt. Wright      instructed me to start

pulling people underneath some metal      barriers near to the turnstiles

in order that they might go through the newly opened gate,                so as to

ease the pressure on the people near to the turnstiles.                 I did this

but saw that other people from the back of the crowd were running

fbrward in order to get through the gate as w e l l .          There seemed to be

hundr^ds^of^pe^^^^ushin^t^^^g^^^^^e .                    Wh e n^lhe   pressure    on

the turnstiles had eased the gate was      closed a nd the crowd were

allowed to go through the turnstiles again.             I heard that the match

had already started and the fans outside the ground were still

rushing to get in through the turnstiles.          Tickets were still being

sold outside the ground at this time.          During the crush,        prior to

gate C being opened fans were climbing over walls into the ground in

order to escape the crush assisted by Police Officers who were on top

of the walls pulling fans over.

Just as the Leppings Lane end of the ground cleared there was a call

over the radio for officers to assist on the pitch at the Liverpool

end as Liverpool    fans were   invading the    pitch.     As myself and other

officers made our way onto the pitch I h e a r d an announcement over the

tannoy requesting that Liverpool fans      leave the pitch and return onto

the stand.     On arrival at the pitch I saw that there were no players

and the game appeared to have been abandoned.             I looked to the

 nelosures directly behind the football         nets.     The centre north

enclosure appeared to be full of people trying to escape.                 Some were

being lifted into the West Stand above,         some were climbing over

dividing fences    into the North and Central South enclosures and

others were climbing out of a small gate at the front of the

enclosure    in the tall barriers.

At first I did not realise what was happening and I started to ask

people ta move back towards the enclosure.          I then saw two injured

youths being lifted out of the small barrier gate.                  Officers were

stood up against the barrier trying to reach over and help fans t o ■ t

 limb out of the enclosure.            On realising that people were injured               i

behind t h e b a r p i e r   I climbed through a barrier gate in the Central

South enclosure and assisted fans and other                officers to lift    injured

over the dividing fence.           My efforts wlrt somewhat thawarted by

Liverpool     fans shouting abuse and stating that it ws all the Police's

fault.      I found this upsetting and shouted at the fans to either help

or stand back out of the way.

I helped to lift several           injured and unconscious       over the barriers

and out of the small gates,           none of whom I can remember.         After a few

minutes more officers attended my location so I then made my way onto

the pitch where the injured were laid out awaiting first aid.                      I

assisted a St. J o h n ’s ambulance girl to resuscitate an elderly

gentleman and then moved on to other                injured people who needed

assistance.        A man approximately in his thirties was           carried over the

gate and laid on the pitch.             He was unconscious.       I proceeded to give

rnouth to mouth, whilst another male officer unknown to myself gave

chest compressions.           This went on for a few minutes until a man who

identified himself as a doctor stated that he was dead.                   A friend of

the deceased agreed to stay with him for purposes of identification.

Following this I continued to assist and comfort the injured.

Bodies were carried out on wooden planks and eventually an ambulance

attended on the         pitch.    I found other members of my serial and we all

stood together        in disbelief.      Suddenly there was      a Charge of

Liverpool     fans towards the Nottingham Forest end             of the ground.        This

was thwarted by the Swift action of the Police who made a line across

the width of the pitch.           Tempers of tKe Liverpool        fans were frayed

and many shouted abuse at us stating that we were                 "murdering bas ta rd s1'

and that     it was all our fault.             Other s’ stated that they should have

         had the other end of the pitch as they had more fans.       Things

         quietened down and I stood with other members of my serial on the

         pitch.     It was then that we began to appreciate the true size of the

         disaster.    We all felt very emotional and found it difficult to fight

         back the teairs.

         We w e r e finally given instructions to escort the fans back to the

         train station on thfe buses and this we carried out with abuse being

         thrown at us by many fans along the way.        I later attended the de-brief

         at West Bar Police Station where I found out that 95 people had died

         as a result of the tragedy.     I could not believe this.

         From attending at Leppings Lane I could not hear my radio and took

         all my orders from Sergeant Wright.        I do not know whether there was

         a breakdown in radio transmissions as much of the time the noise of

         the crowd was too loud to hear any transmission.        I cannot comment as

         to whether the stewards were acting    correctly,    as I can only recall

         the steward at Gate C at Leppings Lane.

With regard to the above incident I have to report as follows*

At 8.GOam Saturday 15th April, 1f89 I commenced 4aty at Attareliffe Police Station
in foil Uniterm, as part of serial 13 aader sergeant 8*»0 Wri^tt of Attercliffe Police
Station* Our duties included the transportation of Liverpool supporters from the
Midland train station to Hillsborou^i prior to the start of the match, stand by during
the Match and returning the Liverpool supporters back to Midland station at the
conclusion of the natch*

At 0900an that morning I attended at West Bar gymnasium for a briefing about the
natch presented by Superintendent Bates and Chief Inspector King • Me were than
allowed time to eat the packed lunch provided, after which I made ay way down to
Midland Station in company with Police Constable 1668 Lecky on foot* We arrived at
the station at approximately 1000am that same date • Myself and other officers were then
deployed to form a line from the station entrance to waiting buses so that all supportess
caught the buses provided* I made two trips down to the ground on the buses with
pc lecky. The supporters on the buses appeared to be very quiet and were not as$
trouble at all* Several of the supporters mentioned that they wished to get to the
ground as quickly as possible as they did not have any tickets.

On arrival at the ground their were hundreds of supporters stood in the road at
Leppings Lane. Some were drinking, some were quite rowdy others quiet* I saw tens of
fans asking other fans if they had any spare tickets and several tickets were sold
near to the tirnstyles* The atmosphere was tense and fans were chanting football
songs. It was very noisy at that time but no more noisy than you would expect at
a major football match* There seemed to be no reason for fans waiting outside the
ground as they were but they were not encouraged to enter the ground*

Sergeant Wright instucted Pc lecky and myself to go to the gymnasium for some
refreshments and to stay with other officers on standby* This we did until about
half an hour later there was a call over the radio for officers to attend at the
Leppings Lane end of the ground as fans were trying to lirce their wa# into the ground*
I attended in company with Pc Lecky, Sergeant Wright and other Officers at gate A
in order to get out into Leppings Lane but due to the crush of fans at the other side
of the gate it was considered unsfe to open the gate as there might be a stampede of
fans. We then made our way to gate C where after persuading a steward to open the gate
we managed to work our way otzjctof the ground near to the turnstyles* I believe that the
gates werecclosed to after we had got out.

At this time there weren't many people near to the gate* The majority appeared to be
pushing towards the turnstyles. In my opinion peoples lives were in danger due to the
crush of hundreds of people trying to get into such a small area* It was impossible
to push people back away from the tumstyles as they did not wish to miss the match.
I did no$ know at that time whether thv match had started or not* Gate C was opened
and Sgt Wright instucted me to start pulling people underneath some metal barriers near to
the turnstyles in order that they might go through the newly opened gate, so as to ease the
pressure on the people near to the turnstyles. I did this but star that other people
from the back of the crowd were runnung forward in order to get through the gate am
well. There seeded to be hundreds of people rushing through the gate* When the pressure
on the tumstyles had eased the gate aws closed and the crowd were allowed      §# through




                                                                        i.

the turnstyles again. I heard that the match had already started and the fans outside
the ground were still rushing to get in through the turnstyles. Tickets were still
being sold outside the ground at this time. During the crush, prior to gate C being
opened fans were climbing over walls into the ground in order to escape the crush
assisted by Police Officers who were on tpo of the walls pulling fans over.

Just as the Leppings Lane end of the ground cleared there was a call over the radio
for officers to assist on the pitch at the Liverpool end as Liverpool fans were
invading the pitch. As myself and other officers made our way onto the pitch I heard
an announcement over the tanoid requesting that Liverpool fans leave the pitch and
return onto the stand. On arrival at the pitch I saw that there were no players and
the game appeared to have been abandoned.   looked to the enclosures directly behind
the football nets. The centcB north enclosure appeared to be full of people trying to
escape. Some were being lifted into the West Stand above, some were climbing over
dividing fences into the North and Cenral South enclosures and others were climbing
out of a small gate at the front of the enclosure in the tall barriers.

At first I did not realise what was happening and I started to ask people to move back
towards the enclosure. I then saw two injured youths being lifted out of the small
barrier gate. Officers were stood up against the barrier tring to reach over and help
fans to climb out of the enclosure.-On realising that people ware injured behind the
barrier I climbed through a small barrier gate in the Central South enclosue and
assisted fans and other officers to lift injured over the dividing fence. My efforts
were somewhat thwarted by Liverpool fans shouting abuse and stating that it was all
the Polices fault. I found this upsettingvand shouted at the fans to either help or
stand back out of the way.

I helped to lift several injured and unconscious over the barriers and out of the small
gates; none of whome I can remember. After a few minutes more officers attended my
location so I then made my way onto the pitch whcee the injured were laid out
awaiting first aid. I assisted a St Johns Ambulance girl to resusitate an elderly
gentleman and then moved on to other injured people who needed assistance. A fekm
approximately in his thirties was carried over the gate and laid on the pitch. He was
unconscious. I proceeded to give mouth to mouth, whilst another male officer unknown to
myself gave chest compressions. This went on for a few minutes until a man who identified
himself as a doctor stated that he was dead. A friend of the deceased agreed to stay with
him for purposes of identification. Following this I continued to assist and comfort the
injured.

Bodies were carried out on wooden planks and eventually an ambulance attended on the
pitch. I found other members of my serial and we all stood together in disbelief.
Suddenly there was a charge of Liverpool fans towards the Nottingham Forrest end of the
ground. This was thwarted by the swift action of the ^olice who made a line across the
width of the pitch. Tempers of the Liverpool fans were fraid and many shouted abuse at
us stating that we were murdering Bastards'* and that it ass all our fault. Others stated
that they should have had the other end of the pitch as they had more fans. Things
quietened down and I stood with other members of my serial on the pitch. It was then
that we began to appretiate the true size of the disaster. We all felt very emotional
and found it difficult to fight back the tears.

We were finally given instuctions to escort the fans back to the train station on the
buses and this we 8#$ried out with abuse being thrown at us by many fans along the way.
I later attended the debrief at West Bar Police ^tation wher I found out that 95
people had died as a result of the tragedy. I could not believe this*

From attending at Leppings Lane I could not hear my radio and took all my orders from
sergeant Wright. I do not know whether there was a breakdown in radio transmissions
as much of the time the noise of the crowd was too loud to hear any-transmission.I
cannot comment as to whether the stewards were acting correctly as   can only recall
the steward at Gate C at Leppings Lane*                            4

                 We     walked around               to     the S p L o n K o p           s i de      for     where         we    ha d      tickets          and

                 upon     entering            the     grounythe               thing       that           I noticed             immediately             was        that

                 the     area     behind           the     gjsrals at         Leppings            Lane       w as     full,          whilst          the     rest

                 of     the    Liverpool            end     was        relatively           empty.

                                                                                                                                     S2SS9

Th e     ground         began       to     fill    and       the     g am e     eventually             started.               I remember

Peter        Breasdley           hitting          the     bar w i t h a s h o t             and     it w a s n ’t         long       after

that       when       I saw w h a t         appea re d, to           be    someone          fighting           with       a uniformed

policeman             behi nd       the     Liverpool           goal       at    Leppings          Lane.            I then        saw

It w a s n ’t long             before        a Uniformed              Inspector             ran    o nto       the       p i t c h to

notify          the     referee          of w h a t     was     happening             and    initially              it a p e a r e d         that

the      fans      were       invading           the    pitch.            There       was    a    lot     of       hostility

created           by this       with        the    Nottingham              forest          fans    and        by    t hi s     t im e    quite

a    lot     of    peo p l e    were        behind        the >efoal.            It was          only wh e n            I saw     someone

giving          mouth     to m o u t h       resuscitation                 that       I realised              something           was

telling           peop le      to     cl y & r    the     playing          a rea.



Playing           staff,       I believe           from S h e f f i e l d            Wednesday,           then          ran    from      the

du g     out      area    and       towards        the       S p i o n Hop.           They       started           to    pull     away        at

the      advertising            hoardings.                I also          saw a m a n w i t h            a deep          cut    to      his

arm asking              a uniformed              Officer        to    help       him       with    one        of    the       hoardings.

By     t his      time    bodies           were    being        carried          towards          t he    Kop       end.




I also          s aw a r o u n d      this       time     s om e     ground          staff       carrying           a    bottle         of

oxygen          towards        th e L e p p i n g s       Lane       end.        A    large       number           of    uniformed

Police          officers        entered           via     the      Kop End           and    lined        up a l o n g s i d e        the

pitch w h i c h a p p e a r e d             to me       to    be     very       provocative              in the          circumstances

The      hoardings            were       still     being        ripped          up    to    be    u s e d as        makeshift

stretchers              and    th e      crowd     in the K o p w e r e               shouting           to    the P o l i c e

Officers           stood a l o n g s i d e         th e      stand        to    help       but    a Uniform              Inspector

told       the Of fi ce rs            to    turn       ar ou nd and            face    the       crowd.

                                                                                                                                              S2S89



               I then     saw        the     n e ts      being       ripped       down    from       the    Leppings             Lane       and

               several        fans      running             towards       the     half    way    line.




               The    line      of P o l i c e         Officers          t hat   were     stood       facing         th e    s ide      stand          were

               then    deployed             to    stand acros s            the     pitch.        There       was      a surge           of     the

               Nottingham            Forest           f an s    behind     me     in an a g g r e s s i v e     manner            so at       this

               point     I decided               to    leave.        However,         w h e n we      reached         the        main       gates       in

               order    to      l e av e     there          was    some    reluctance           to    open     them         by    the       stewards.

                 In f a c t     my    brother                     went    to     three    gates       and    each       time          the    stewards

               refused        to     open        the     ga te s .       It wa s     only when         we    shouted             to    the    steward

               about    the        Bradford            Fire       Disaster        th at   the    third       steward             decided          to

               open    the      gate.




               We w a l k e d      b a ck    to       the      vehicle     and made        our       way    b a ck    to m y          brother

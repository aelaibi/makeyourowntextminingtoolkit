                                           WARRINGTON

                                           19 April   1989

Dear Sir,
         Having been a spectator at the Hillsborough ground (Leppings
Lane terraces) on the day of the FA cup match between Liverpool and
Nottingham Forest on 15 April 1989 I feel I should write to you
outlining the the areas where I believe serious errors of judgement
were made.

1. After passing through the turnstiles at approximately 14.10. It was
my belief that the only entrance to the terracing was through the
tunnel leading to the enclosure directly behind the goal. There were
no stewards or policemen giving directions to any of the other
entrO?-es and there were no signs on walls to give instruction.

2. The entrance of the tunnel onto the terraces was congested when we
arrived so I moved to the right and ended up against the railing which
ran from the stand at the back to the wire netting at the front of the
goalmouth terrace. The whole terrace filled to capacity very quickly
with many supporters attempting to a spread out along the terrace, not
realising that there was a fence in the way untill they were very
cldse to it. At this point most supporters gave up, as I had done and
remained by the fence.         .
By 14.30 the area behind the goal was extremely congested any movement
in the crowd resulting in individuals being squeezed. At no time did I
see any attempt by police officers or stewards to check on the numbers
of fans behind the go al. Nether did I see any attempt being made to
divert fans to the terrace to the right of the fence which was still
relatively uncongested.

4. By 14.35 I was most uncomfortable as a result of the constant
pressure from the crowd. Looking behind me I saw a small gate open at
the     of the railing underneath the stand. I pushed my way to the
gate and entered the enclosure to the right of the goal.  This gate
did not appear to be signposted and could not be seen b/ anybody apart
from the fans standing right next to the fence.

5. As the disaster unfolded it became obvious that the police force
were acting in a totally disorganised fashion. Officers and fans
worked well as individuals but groups of officers appeared to stand
around doing very little, waiting for orders which were obviously not
forthcoming. This was in complete contrast to the discipline and
organisation of the fire service who moved around the pitch in a
purposeful mannner and who were obviously under the control of a
senior officer. The only time the police force appeared to act in a
coordinated fashion was in arresting the charge of some Liverpoool
fans after taunts from Nottinham Forest supporters obviously unaware
of the gravity of the situation.

6.   No attempt was made to communicate with the crowd. Except for a


                   r              PAGE 1
request for fans to leave the pitch.

7. Very few   stretchers seemed to be available for transporting the
injured.



Can I suggest the following changes to the way football games are
organised:-

          - For games to be played on neutral grounds all factors
should be carefully weighed when deciding which end a set of
supporters should be allocated. For example the relative size of crowd
attending home matches should be given a higher weighting than
inconvenience in organising the arrival of fans at grounds.

          - On entering grounds fans must be given clear instructions
abo- ;where they should go. These instructions should be verbal (given
by police and stewards) and backed up by written notices.This is
espescially important for fans travelling away from home.

          - Police and stewards should constantly monitor crowd
sizes/movements for any sign of developing problems. Police and
stewards should by trained to watch for any tell tale signs; such as
genuine and obvious distress shown by fans etc. Use of television
cameras/computers alone are not sufficient.

          - Both the fencing at the front and at the side of terraces
should be removed from all grounds.

          - All exits should be clearly marked and illuminated.

          - Senior police officers should receive more training in
coping with and directing their men during major disasters with large
numbers of dying and injured as opposed to dealing with major


          - Communications need to be improved, both between police
officers inside and outside the ground and between the authorities and
supporters via a good quality public address system.

          — More medical facilities should be made easily available at
grounds. Charitable institutions such as the St.John's Ambulance
Brigade should not be expected to provide all the medical
faci1ities/expertise neccessary during football matches attended by
large numbers of fans.


                      Yours Faithfully,

                     THE HILLSBOROUGH DISASTER

MY VIEW OF WHAT HAPPENED-BY A LU CKY RED


After waitinq eaqerly all week for my season ticket serial number
to be announced,     it finally got chosen on the 12th.   Why did a
season ticket holder have to wait to get a ticket for a crucial
match? This is so because there is so many season ticket holders
at Anfield- even     more than the Nottingham Forest   aver a qe home
attendance. This is why Liverpool sHould have received the larger
end of the qround.
Saturday morning arrived and I queued up in Lime Street Station
along with two o-f my mates.   I left on the first train,which left
at 11:15am.
On arriving at the station in Sheffield at approx 2pm,we got off
the    train and received     a police escort straight to          the
ground.   This'^qave the fans no time to have a drink in the pubs
that were open.
We reached the ground at about 2:20pm and the number of people
there was just like an average match day at Anfield at that time.
Once we reached the gates I said goodbye to one of my mates who
had a ticket for the Lepping Lane, seats.      My mate and     I then
proceded to look for our appropriate turnstile which was B. We
went to the turnstile with ease and* waited in an orderly queue.
At   this point we noticed      that  the police were      searching
everyone,this was just before you went through the turnstile.       We
qot searched briefly and this, was the first point where we were
approached by any.sort of official person.
Once through the turnstile we- came to a large, area before the
tunnels to the terracing where there were programme sellers.        We
bouq|ht a programme and'looking round we could see no official
person    directing   us    to any    particular   place     on    the
terraces.   Therefore we decided to go down the tunnel leading to
directly behind the goal.       The time at this point was about
2:30pm.
The terracing was already tightly packed but we struggled through
the crowd to reach about halfway down. Once we reached this point
my friend suggested that we should go back and go onto the wing
section of the terrace because here was too packed. After a short
discussion   I agreed(THIS DECISION PROBABLY SAVED US FROM BEING
INVOLVED IN THE ACTUAL CRUSH)
We again struggled through the crowd and finally reached the
tunnel,we then walked round and stood on the right side of the
Lepping    Lane terrace,underneath    the scoreboard and        police
box.   This section of the ground was not-packed- at all        so we
picked are vantage point in front of a barrier(AFTER THE CRUSHING
HERE IN THE SAME MATCH LAST SEASON WE THOUGHT THIS BEST).The time
now was approaching 2:40.




                                  1
f




       As the kick off time got closer the wing sections qot more and
       more packed, and it was soon shoulder to shoulder when the teams
       came out.     About 1 minute before the kick off there was the ONLY
       tannoy announcement telling people directly behind the qoal        to
      move back      because there were people gettinq crushed at the
      front.   The other tannoy announcements were after most of the
      traqically dead and injured were on the pitch and it was too late
     .'to do anything about it.
      The lonq awaited match finally kicked off and everyone who was
      not' involved     in the crush     did not have a clue what was
      happeninq.    Before the game was 2 minutes old people then were
      spilling    over the fence and onto the pitch.     I like many other
      Pe°Ple thought that it was a usual over spill(which happens at
      most of the b^g games at Anfield).There were soon a lot of people
      on the pitch in distress and after a lot of persuasion the game
      was stopped and the puzzled players were led off the pitch.
      At this point the police made the mistake of telling the crowd to
      move back(They coUldn,t because people were still coming into the
      ground unaware of what was happening inside the ground).Instead
      the police should have opened the.emergency gate immediately
      which they didn't until they saw 'the seriousness of • what was
      going on.
      At this point,lOminutes after the kick o f f ,people had started- to
      come into the section I was in and they were showing everyone
      their FULL UNCHECKED.TICKETS,they also told us t h a t ;IT; WAS CHAOS
      OUTSIDE AND THE POLICE JUST ^OPENED THE GATE AND LET EVERYONE ^ IN
      WITHOUT CHECKING THE TICKETS OR EVEN:IF THEY HAD ANY TICKETS.
      The seriousness of what -was taking place was soon clear for - all
      to see.   Once I saw the scenes n the pitch I seemed to have lost
      track of the time.
      There seemed to be ten times more            fans on. the pitch than
    ^ emergency services and they all. seemed to be doing more for the
      ^ans     distress than the people who are qualified to' help.     But
      we were all grateful for the extra police and ambulancemen and
      women   that were later brought in because they were greatly
      needed.
      The fans     in the middle section were trying to get out any way
      they could,over the spiked fence,onto the stand above and through
      the ONE NARROW EMERGENCY GATE.
      As this was going on I noticed then how the press photographers
      were acting.      I WAS DISGUSTED at the way they acted.  They   were
      running    around    like SAVAGES AND ANIMALS and taking         sick
      photographs of      the dead and injured.(When    I got home   I kept
      thinking how      could they stand there taking sick pictures when
      they could have been helping the people in distress).
      This went on for what seemed an age but when the crushing
      eventually stopped,although there were still people trying to qet
      revived or treated for injuries on the pitch. KENNY DALGLISH then
      made an announcement over the tannoy and this seemed to brinq a
      bit of order to the ground.
                                     2

    Police then attempted to move the people off the pitch but to
    everyones amazement      they continued to put them back     into the
    terrace (the fence was now wrecked including part where the wire
    mesh had been ripped off so that people could escape a little
    easie r ^-The stands on the side were now half empty and i t would
    have been easier and quicker to move the fans still on the pitch
    into this area!
    When      we thenheard the tannoy announcing     that  the game   was
    °^"^ *c * 1y abandoned (which   we knew would be) we left the ground
    and met up with our relieved mate and attempted to look for a
   phone,aithough people were being turned away from many houses and
    shops (not everyones case).We eventually got to use a phone from
   a very sympathetic QUEENSWAY store.
   We then made our way back to the train station.         We got on  the
   train       and we set off home at approx 5:20. By then we had heard
   that about 25 people had tragically died.            The train had a
   sickened atmosphere although some people were trying to brighten
.. UP are sad feelings in the usual scouse way
   As the train was travelling through Manchester we noticed         that
   some sick minded        people had sprayed on a wall SCOUSERS     DIED
   TODAY—HILLSBOROUGH 89.      A little -further towards Victoria station
   the train was under a barrage o-f bricks -from about 5 or 6
   hooligans. The train was now.in a worse atmosphere.
   When the train pulled into Lime Street,the people on it including
   myself ,still only aware of there being approx 25 deaths,we were
   shocked and devastated upon hearing the correct number of deaths
   94 by our relieved relatives.
   Since that day       I have not attempted to look at any of the
   sickening pictures'^^^papers »although I now realise how.
   valuable the live TV pictures where to families like my own to
   waiting for any news concerning their loved ones.
   Many arguments will arise from the .Hillsborough tragedy and         I
   have included a brief conclusion to the problems of the day and
   how they could have been avoided.
   PLEASE TAKE NOTICE OF A REGULAR SUPPORTERS VIEWS!

Dear Geoffrey,

I enclose a letter from                    of                   Lancaster,
setting out his experiences at Hillsborough,  You will wish to consider and
investigate what he has to say.

Whilst writing may I ask if you will enquire whether there is any truth in the
report which I have received to the effect that Stewards for a security firm
employed at Hillsborough were stood down from 3.00 p.m. in the interests of
economy?

Many thanks.     Every good wish for your Enquiry.

Yours sincerely,




Denis Howell.




                              Rt Hon Denis Howell M P

   Dear



      Enclosed with this letter is a photostat of my   ticket for
last Saturday's semi-final at Hillsborough. You will notice that
it is for the Leppings Lane End terrace. You will also notice
that like thousands of other tickets it is untorn.     I am one of
the luckier ones: I ’m sitting here writing this instead of being
dead: I didn't lose anybody: I didn't stand in the middle section
of the terraces. Having said that, maybe I'm not so lucky because
every two minutes or so my head gets filled with images that
nobody should have to live with in peacetime.
      I consider the photocopy to be evidence enough of my
credentials for writing this. My other credentials are 22 years
of watching football; 19 years of watching Liverpool.^ Saturday's
game was my ninth FA Cup semi-final and my third at Hillsborough.
Initially I just didn't feel like talking about what happened at
all, but as the buck-passing process seems to be accelerating my
anger and disgust has hit the level where I'm not going to keep
quiet about it.
      I went to Hillsborough on Saturday with my father and a
friend. The much publicised reason for the FA     and the police
choosing Hillsborough to stage the match was that the Liverpool
fans would arrive from the west and the Nottingham Forest fans
would arrive from the south and thus could easily be kept apart.
This was based on the assumption that every Liverpool fan would
use the A628 to travel to the ground.      In fact we, along with
 several thousand others decided to use the A57 , a less congested
 route. This meant that we parked in the same area as all the Not
tingham fans. When I walked about a mile to the ground at 2.00 pm
 I would quess that there would have been roughly two Forest fans
to every one Liverpool fan in the streets on the south side of
the ground.
     There was no sign of any aggressive atmosphere, no hint of
violence,   simply good natured singing and banter. Anyone who
knows anything about the game could tell you that there is no an­
tipathy between the two clubs, and that the chance of trouble was
minimal. Despite this there was a massive police presence in the
streets; clusters of officers on every corner, threatening mil-
tary looking vans, none of them smiling or making any attempt to
be helpful as they watched and waited for trouble.
     When we arrived at the Leppings Lane End    having literally
been sent round the houses by police seperating us from the
Forest fans who we'd justwalked the best part of a mile with, it
was imediately clear that there were difficulties.
     This was at approximately 2.25. There was a mob swaying and
surging to try and get to the eight turnstiles. There has been a
lot of talk about sixteen turnstiles   which simply isn't true:
there were eight gates for the seats and eight for the terraces.
The chaos came as absolutely no surprise because it was exactly
the same last year when it took me 50 minutes to get through the
turnstiles and to my seat in the stand above the terracing.
Everybody was talking about this, nobody could believe that the
police had done nothing to improve the situation. Despite the
hundreds of very visible police all over Sheffield, the only ones
in   evidence outside the turnstiles were three mounted policemen.
The situation had obviously    been going on for some time, and many
fans who had purposely turned up early were getting understand­
ably livid. We were quickly sucked into the centre of the crowd
and there was no doubt that    it was no normal crush. I simply
decided to get out. Having been in many a similar situation it
was clear from the pitch of the screams and shouts from those at
the front that the situation was deteriorating fast. I managed to
get out of the main crush to the side by some railings, and
shouted for my friend to do the same. We decided to wait there
whilst the situation eased. At this point one of the mounted
policemen completely lost his cool and barged his way out to the
back of the crowd.   I don't know if the fans in his way were able
to get their feet out of the way, but I doubt it. I don't know if
he did anything constructive when he got out of the crush, but I
 doubt it. Everyone was yelling at him. and I accept that
everyone is human, but his shouted response of " You can all go
crush youselves for all I care!" is something that he will have
to learn to live with.
       At this point many fans began to climb the gates in order
to qet out of the crush. Almost all of them were showing tickets
to police waiting on the other side. The crush wasn’t getting
markedly worse as kick off time approached, for the simple reason
that the area around the turnstiles was as crowded as conceivably
possible.    I find the stories of last minute arrivals of wild,
drunken    thugs so far fetched that they are quite contemptible.At
this point a small gate was opened in a side wall and before I
knew anything I had been pushed through with about fifty or sixty
others after which they managed to close it. Straight ahead was
a tunnel   leading into the ground. My friend suggested that we
went in      and stood behind the    goals. The area     within the
perimeter of the ground was oddly quiet and there was hardly
anyone going in through the tunnel.
      I told him that I had once stood there before in a semi­
final against Arsenal years previously and remembered that it was
a bit packed and the view wasn‘t great. And so it was that I was
one of the ones who made their way to the edge. Five minutes
later even our part of the ground had filled up very fast and the
incoming fans told of how a big gate had been opened or kicked
down. And the rest is history.

I would like to make the following points v.ery clear.

    There WAS a very major problem outside the Leppings Lane End
last year any anyone who claims otherwise is simply not telling
the truth.
2 . Everyone who saw the numbers of policemen who came onto trie
pitch, and for the most part stood aimlessly about as the dis­
aster unfolded could simply not believe why so few had been allo­
cated to steer 10,000 fans through 8 turnstiles which were fenced
in on three sides by an area little bigger than an infant school
playground.  ( Having said that, everybody also noted the few
policemen who unhesitatingly jumped into the middle of the crush
and showed extraordinary courage.)
3. The stories that are now being brought out about massive num­
bers of riotous, drunken fans causing the crush are gross exag­
gerations, which seem to be desparate attemmt to shift the blame.
4. Standard policy at other similar occassions is always to break
down the crowd slowly,to mass the majority in a wide open space
like a street, check their tickets and split them into a smaller
bunch,    then form them into queues which move quickly through the
turnstiles.    Above all the most important thing is to have the
policemen doing the job showing patience,     smiling and TELLING
people what is happening.       Had there been one articulate voice
talking through one efficient loudhailer outside the Leppings
Lane End on Saturday there may well have been 94 more people
alive today than there are.
        This in my opinion is where the root causes of the problems
that led to the horror of the weekend are to be found. I am 28, a
graduate and a company director, and like most people in England
    I'm    generally treated with politeness and courtesy. That is
until I go to a soccer match.    Once I an identified as football
fan      I am immediately considered to be little more than an
animal.    If I have a scarf out of my car window on route to an
away match the police will stop me and search me. When I get to
the game I get herded around by absurdly aggressive policemen,
pushed and shoved with never a word of apology until I, along
with the rest of the animals,    are safely   locked away in our
cage, under the scrutiny of both video cameras and hundreds of
policemen. Of course there are troublemakers at football matches,
lots of them. Anyone who claims otherwise is an idiot. But to
treat     two million football fans as if they were all a danger to
society is absurd. And now we are being branded as outcasts to
the extent we're going to be forced to carry an ID card when we
go to see a game. Even convicted murderers out on parole aren't
required to do this.
      If you distrust people to this extent* and insist on pushing
them round like cattle is it really any surprise that they don't
behave like perfect Edwardian Gentlemen? A standing joke amongst
Liverpool fans when they are pushed into a particularly tight
space is for them to start mooing at the top of their voices.
      I am convinced       that it was this ludicrous attitude that
more than anything else led to the tragedy of       Leppings Lane.
Whoever was running the show obviously felt that 98% of his
 resources needed to be deployed to stop fighting in the streets.
A crush at the turnstiles? Their problem. That was why nobody
told us what was happening as if they assumed that we were so
thick that we wouldn’t understand. That is why we are all haunted
by the sight of policemen beating desperate fans off the fences
when everyone but them knew that there was a very serious
problem.
     I work in the animal feed industry,   and I sometimes go to
cattle auctions. The cows are transferred from wagon to pen to
ring with the minimum of harshness. Were they treated or herded
around in remotely the same way that we fans are shoved around by
the police on a Saturday afternoon the RSPCA would have a great
deal to say about it. Which puts me in mind of the words of a
young poet called Wilfred Owen who 60 years ago wrote a poem
called ’’ Anthem for doomed youth." Its first line suddenly after
all these years seems horribly topical,

     "What passing bells for those who die like cattle."




                             Yours sincerely.

Dear Mr. Dear,

I have received a very compelling letter
from a constituent of mine. Dr. Colin
Flenley of                                    who
was present at tne tragic i o o t D a n match
at Hillsborough.   He was one of the doctors
who tried to recussitate injured fans.

You will see from his letter that he makes
some cogent observations which I believe may

                                                         17th April, 1989

Mr. R. Shepherd M.P.,
The House of Commons,
London.


Dear Mr. Shepherd,

     I am writing this letter, "both as a Liverpool supporter who was standing in
the Leppings Lane End of the ground where the tragedy occurred on Saturday the
15th April, and as a Doctor who tried in vain to rssucitate fans or? the ■pitch,
This is my view of the causes of the disaster and the inadequacies of the relief
operation.

     I arrived outside the ground at approximately 2.15 p.m. There were many
thousands of fans milling around and in the area of the turnstiles I     to enter
through (B. Section), there was no orderly queueing. There appeared to "be a total
lack of policeoocrdination in organizing the fans. In fact I witnessed two police
officers on horse back appearing to argue with each other. They retreated and
appeared to leave us to it. By this stage supporters were being squashed against
the turnstile walls, fans were desperately appealing to the police to create some
sense of order. Then I witnessed the police opening an exit to the side of the
turn stiles and we flooded in with the pressure of the supporters behind us, without
having to present our tickets. At the time I felt that the police had no option
but to open the gate as a dangerous situation was developing outside the ground,
where serious injuries were inevitable. The situation should never have got to this
stage, there should have been adequate crowd control with sufficient police numbers
outside the ground to ensure that the supporters entered the turnstiles in an
orderly fashion.

     Once inside the ground there was a lack of stewarding supporters to different
areas of the Terrace. I myself was initially channelled towards the central area,
as this appeared to be the only entrance onto the terracing, but I was lucky and
remembered the advice of friends and turned away from the central area to make my
way to the side of the Terrace which was not over crowded.

     When I reached the terracing it was obvious to myself and to many supporters
around me that the central area was seriously over crowded as fans tried to climb
over the barrier or climb up to the seating area above them*

SURELY, REALIZING THIS, THE OFFICIALS COULD HAVE POSTPONED THE START OF THE MATCH
TO ALLOW SOME SENSE OF ORDER TO OCCUR.

     What happened next, I am sure you are only too well aware of. The supporters
were crushed and killed because the only exit was a small gate in the perimeter
fencing. Surely a method could be devized where the fencing could be rolled aside
or collapsed to avoid such tragedy.




                                                                /Realizing
                                      -   2   -




Realizing the disaster, I made my way onto the pitch to offer some help. There
was chaos, with a total lack of facilities. The first ambulance did not appear
to arrive for at least 15 minutes. There was no defibrillator, no suction
equipment to clear the casualities airways, and there was an inadequate supply
of oxygen equipment and stretchers. Above all there appeared to be no one in
charge of organizing the disaster. I heard later that this was mainly done by
another doctor who was also there as a supporter. There was also no announcement
over the P.A. system for at least 45 minutes, during which time the Nottingham
Forrest supporters were obviously oblivious to the fact that a tragedy had
occurred and was simply accusing the Liverpool fans of rioting onto the pitch.
Many Police Officers appeared confused as to what they should do but I have
nothing but praise for individual officers and supporters who offered their help
in attempting to resucitate the injured and dead.

     In summarizing the causes of the disaster may I list -

     1) Lack of police co-ordination outside the ground.

     2) Lack of stewarding inside the ground.

     3)    Poor design for entry onto the terracing.

     4)    Inadequate exits through the perimeter fencing onto the pitch.

     I also feel that where such football matches are played again, serious
thought needs to be given to the resucitatian equipment available at the ground
and that a clearly laid down plan of dealing with such a disaster is known, and
a Senior Police Officer allocated to over look the situation.


                                                  Yours sincerely,

Dear Sir,

Policy Enquiry into Hillsborough Tragedy

I was a spectator at the Liverpool vs Nottingham Forest match and took up a
position on the terracing a few minutes after 2pm.  Whilst fortunately for me, I
was not in the middle "pen", I was standing only a yard or two to the right of
the southern boundary fence of the middle pen and a couple of yards back from the
fence separating the terracing from the pitch.  Accordingly, I was very close to
where the spectators in the middle pen were crushed and I am anxious to give my
eye witness account of the events which took place to both the Police and Public
Enquiries.

I understand that you would welcome statements from spectators at the match and
given my proximity to the events inside the ground, I would welcome the opportunity
of making such a statement.    I presume this will have to be done at an interview
rather than as a written submission.    If so, would it be sufficient for me to
arrange to make a statement to a local police officer at Surbiton, Surrey,
police station with^-fehat statement to be forwarded to you?

Dear Sir
I am writing this letter to yourself and to the The Lord Chief Justice,
Sir Peter Taylor.
I was at Sheffield on Saturday afternoon for the semi-final and I thought
that if I gave you my experience of part of Saturday afternoon it might
help in compiling your information.
I will introduce myself as being a forty three year old married man with
two teenage daughters. I am a Production Control Manager in a large and
modern                   in North Manchester.   I am also a football fan
and have been since I first watched Liverpool from the boys pen in the
mid fifties.
I travelled to Sheffield on Saturday with some friends; we met other friends
that we had previously arranged to meet at a city centre pub. We travelled
by road and the others by rail. They used the service trains from Liverpool
via Manchester to avoid the football specials.
Our general concensus was that there was a hostile and aggressive attitude
shown by the police to people if they thought they were football fans.
We disguised ourselves by not carrying any football favours; we also think
we are now too old for them. I will not tell you what was said by the
others as that would only be second hand gossip. I will only tell you
what happened to me.
We parked our car at about 2.25pm in Far lane, which is about a ten minute
walk from the gates in Leppings Lane.  We arrived near the gates just after
2.35pm and I can only say that the scene looked chaotic. To      get to the
turnstiles you had to go through a set of blue gates and into an area that
was surrounded by the perimeter walls of the ground and an iron fence.
There was only one way into this area and that was through the gates which
opened inwards. Then, when inside, because of the crowd coming down the
hill of Leppings Lane and trying to get through these gates, the only way
out was through the turnstiles. These gates acted like a valve. The
pressure inside this area was very heavy and with no organised queues it
was a total hit and miss situation as to how and when you reached the
turnstile.
It was 2.50pm when I went through the turnstile and I was going through
gates 'A' - these being the nearest gates, yet it took fifteen minutes
to travel that short distance.
Going through the turnstiles in front of me was a middle aged man. As
we got through you could see a number of policemen just standing round
in groups watching the fans coming in. The man shouted across, "You want
to get outside and sort that f         lot out before someone gets hurt."
Upon this a huge policeman who stood over six feet tall pounced at this
man. The policeman repeatedly threatened him, saying that he knew what
sort of person he was and what he would do to him if he opened his mouth
again. This seemed to go on. He was taunting the man to speak again and
my opinion was that if the man was to say anything else he would have been
evicted or arrested and labelled a soccer hooligan. The man cowered and
walked away. I then pleaded with another policeman that in the name of
God to do something about the chaos outside, at the same time trying not
to fall foul of the police like the other man. I hung around that area
a little longer so that I could get the other policeman's number. I did
this and the number i s H
Whilst I was standing there many more people came in and complained of
what was happening outside.      I then went to my seat reflecting the
threatening and hostile attitude of the officer. I decided then that I
would write a letter of complaint not realising then what events were about
to unfold.
I took my place in the north stand which was in line with the penalty area
at the Leppings Lane end.     You could see then that there was massive
crushing in the area behind the goal. At first, and this was around kick-
off time, one youth climbed over the fence. As he landed on the perimeter
track he was restrained by the police, and by their actions you could tell
that they obviously thought he was trying to invade the pitch. The young
man could be seen from the stands repeatedly pointing frantically into
the crowd.
The next    person to come over was also restrained by two policemen and
escorted away.    You could also see that this man was in some sort of
trouble. More came over and were falling to the ground once they were
over. With the crowd in the north stand shouting to the policemen who
were escorting the man that he was in trouble and that there were further
problems behind them. The police let go of the man and he fell to the
ground and then started getting some assistance.
The game was underway now and the crowd behind the goal was getting bigger
and spreading onto the pitch. People were climbing up into         the stands
and it was obvious from where we were that there was serious trouble behind
the goal.     When the policeman went onto the pitch and asked the referee
to stop the game     many more policemen went down to that end.     By their
actions they still gave the impression it was a crowd invasion. They were
turning people back towards the fence and off the pitch and seemed to be
indicating to them to get back onto the terracing. By now dozens of people
were lying on the pitch.
When the ambulance came on the pitch the seriousness of the situation was
really coming through.    I could see people giving mouth to mouth
resuscitation; police and firemen were leaning over people giving heart
massages.

It was now that I noticed that people lying on the pitch behind the goal
had their heads covered. The makeshift stretchers were now carrying away
bodies. All this time the tannoy was asking people to get off the pitch
as if nothing serious was happening.
There were taunts from the terracing at the Forest end of the ground and
the crowds started running down towards them. This was all we needed,
dead fans and people about to fight; thank goodness the police managed
to intervene.      I think then the Nottingham people realised what      was
happening and there was      silence. Still the tannoy blurted out for the
fans to get off the pitch. Only later did the announcer ask for those
not involved to leave the pitch so that those assisting could see who needed
help.

I saw a policeman carry a child. He had been helping him and he carried
him the length of the pitch - the poor man.
It was around 3.45pm now and I left, I just wanted to go home. One by
one over the next hour I met up again with my friends, some of whom had
gone in that section behind the goal and one of them had escaped over the
fence. We listened in disbelief when the radio said that the fans had
broken the gate down - we knew it had been opened.
I sat in the car saddened and annoyed. Saddened for what had happened
to all those people, saddened for that police superintendent who had opened
the gates. He had answered the pleas of the crushed fans to relieve the
pressure. That man needs the thoughts and prayers of everyone.
Annoyed at the hostile and aggressive behaviour of the policeman earlier.
This part of my letter is a complaint against that particular policeman,
again his number is            I had intended writing asmall letter    of
complaint after I had seen his behaviour.
If all policemen behaved like this then it is no wonder we have problems.
Older people can     use a wiser sense of judgement and turn their backs on
them, younger men who are less wise and maybe hot headed will respond in
a different way.
I do hope this letter is of some assistance in both your enquiries, I have
tried to keep the letter to my experience and thoughts of the afternoon,
not of others who will have their own views.
Yours faithfully

                                                   17th April 1989



Ule are a middle aged couple with two teenage daughters. We mere
both in the stand above where all the Liverpool Supporters were
killed.

Ule left our house at 11.00 a.m. and got into the ground at 2*10 p.m.
At 2.20 p.m. we went into our seats and then walked forward to look
over the balcony at the fans below. It was obvious to us that there
were too many fans in the area behind the goal and indeed many looked
distressed and many of them were chanting "no more room no more room"
"don't let anyone else in here".    Surely the Police must have had
their surveillance cameras focused on that area and surely if we
could see it was overcrowded at 2.20 p.m. they must have been able
to see it.    Why didn't they tell the Stewards not to let anyone
else into that area and to direct people to the two side areas
where there was room? Why did they allow people to keep coming
into that area in a steady stream from 2.20 p.m. to 2.50 p.m. UIHY ?

My husband went to the toilet at 2.40 p.m. and said there were
thousands outside and he could see a group of about 100 to 200
being allowed to run down the street as fast as they could towards
the crowds that were already there.

Then of course the event which if you wanted to be kind you would call
"gross incompetence and bad management" but if you were being really
truthful and honest you would call wicked, was allowed to happen.
The Police opened a 16 foot gate and let the crowd rush in as if this
was not bad enough, nobody had their ticket checked to see if they
had a correct ticket or in fact any ticket at all, this was at a
match that was supposed to be all ticket, I myself was frisked when
we went in and my bag was searched and my husband was also searched.
Then to make matters even worse the Police and Stewards allowed the
crowd to rush towards the first entrance they saw which was of course
the tunnel leading directly into the already overcrowded area.

Why was the gate opened to let everyone in irrespective of whether
they had a correct ticket or not ? Why were they allowed to rush
towards the most crowded area of the ground ? Why were they not
directed towards areas with more empty spaces ?

Now we have heard the Police opened the gate to alleviate pressure outside
which we just cannot comprehend was a valid reason knowing the
state of the ground inside.   Why was there so much pressure outside ?
Why couldn't the Police control it ? Isn't that what they are there for?
Why weren't there more Police outside ? Why were 100 to 200 fans allowed
to run down the road towards the rest of the crowd trying to get in
to the ground ? Why did Police on horseback not make the croiitjqueue in
an orderly fashion as the Police at Anfield do weak in and week out in
far worse conditions i.e. the alleways to the taop and the main road
outside the ground ? Why were the Police outside the ground if not to
control the fans ?    Why didn't the police inside communicate the position
to the Police outside ?
Lastly of course there is why were Liverpool allocated less tickets
than Nottingham Forest.    bJe have twice as many regular supporters as
NQttingham Forest and were given 4,000 or whatever less tickets than
them.    In fact people who got into the ground when the gate was
opened by the Police had tickets which they had bought from Nottingham
Forest fans.    The Police say it was easier to control us and the
traffic^ if we were given the Lickers Lane End.     This has been proved
to be totally untrue as there was no crowd control outside and most of
the people arrived late because of traffic problems, not to mention
Police holding up coaches and checking for alcohol, and being made
to walk dies from their coaches to the ground.     This has happened
many times to us, most recently at Coventry and prior to that at
Aston Villa when Liverpool played Arsenal in the Littlewoods Cup.
So there is no way giving us fewer tickets can be justified.

Ule will never forget the scenes we saw and people being dragged out
of the paddock below us and thrown on to the pitch and left to die.
People trying to get out through totally inadequate gates and being
pushed back by the Police at first.    People being carried away on
hoarding by the Fans not ambulance men, policemen or stewards.
Why weren't the stretchers there where were they ? Where were the
ambulances ? Why weren* t wire cutters used in the fence more quickly ?
Why didn't the Police react quicker to this terrible situation ?
Why were there no announcements over the loudspeaker made to inform
everyone who didn't know of the problem ?

WHY was this terrible thing allowed to happen ?

Ule will never be able to forget it anyone who was there and especially
those who have lost loved ones and friends until we gst some answers
to the above questions.

We are enclosing an article which we think answers those questions
but we hope and pray that some one can show us some other reason
to keep us sane.

HTTJ.SRORfXim DISflSTER

I am writing this account out of frustration at the needless loss of life
and in the hope that my observations and qpinions will, in some small way,
assist in your enquiry and help prevent any future occurance. I have
resisted writing until now in the hope that I will pen more objective views
but I readily acknowledge the emotiveness of the subject.

No apologies are made for repeating what you will have heard many times by
now and that is the senseless allocation of tickets by the Police. This
distribution should have taken into consideration the glaringly obvious
differential in average attendance plus the well known fact in footballing
circles of the fanaticism of the Liverpool fan and the Club's ticketless
travelling support.

I can possibly see the feeble logic of the Police in wanting to place the
bulk of the supporters in the end of the ground to which they approach.
However, having worked and commuted to Sheffield for 12 months, I, like
many other people, realise that one of the quickest and most pleasant
routes is via the Snake Pass which produces quite the reverse of what the
Police intended.

This is the route that I and countless others took. Together with my 12
year old son I parked my car at approximately 1.45 p.m. and, along with
other Liverpool supporters, approached the ground from the south side where
mainly Forest supporters were congregated. Having no idea where the North
Stand was situated I circled the ground anti-clockwise until I found the
South Stand and then proceded further round only to encounter Police
manning barriers obviously to segregate the fans. I was then about 50
yards from my destination but was turned back and had to retrace my steps
then walk past the back of what I later discovered was the North Stand and
then tramp about one mile past the ground passing side roads blocked by
barriers manned by Police preventing access to our entrance. From
initially reaching the ground at 2 p.m. and being 50 yards from my
turnstile I finally reached the total confusion which was doubling for a
queue at 2.35 p.m. Prior to reaching Leppings Lane I saw many confused
Liverpool fans going the wrong way and whilst the Police were extremely

curteous the lack of direction and organisation was becoming apparent. On
actually reaching the ground the situation was just chaotic and the Police
presence was conspicuous by its absence. In 40 years supporting at various
grounds I have never witnessed a scene of such disorder. People were
milling about every where as more people streamed towards the ground. I
remenber seeing one mounted policeman and one or two others. I am sure
others were there, but I was struck by their lack of nunbers, by being
allowed to push in through the main gates without any ticket check or
funnelling and by the haphazard attempt at queuing at I think, about 4
gates at entrance A. One officer was strategically positioned in between
them, utterly nonplussed.

Holding two, £14.00 stand tickets we shambled and jostled along in this
throng and all my instincts told me a crush was about to ensue and it
surely did. No doubt started by some mindless idiots at the back, but
within minutes we were a heaving mass. Despite trying to protect my son he
was forced from my grasp, had difficulty breathing and received injuries to
his neck. But for the kindness of two fans ahead, who forced him through
the turnstile I wonder whether he too would have ended up a statistic.

On reaching him inside the ground I found a boy suffering physical hurt,
severely distressed and in a state of shock. Having witnessed the scenes
outside and seemingly not being in the worst place i.e. entrance B, I
understand the Police decision to alleviate the pressure and open that gate
but, that such a decision had to be taken was nothing short of disgraceful.

I was not sufficiently well positioned to quote authoritively on many of
the events inside the stadium as we were seated between the halfway line
and penalty area at the Kqp end. When events began I thought it a minor
pitch intrusion, but it was soon obvious that it was something more serious
as several of the people the Police tried to eject from the pitch were in a
state of collapse. Incredibly a massive new Police presence then appeared
from the comer of the Kop and North Stand and positioned itself shoulder
to shoulder in front of us in the North Stand, presumably in the belief
that I, as a 48 year old and my 12 year old son were about to scale 20 rows
of seats, launch ourselves across the pitch and hurdle a 12 foot high
railing withough thought to our lower abdomen and set about 20,000 Forest
supporters who, like the Police, had not yet understood the severity of the
situation. To then witness of scores of Liverpool fans ferrying the
injured, dead and dying in constant streams across the pitch while the
majority of police stood aimlessly by frantically searching for the odd
hooligan was, to say the least, a painful anf frustrating sight. Let me
add that when the police either received some repsonsible direction or
indeed, used their initiative, they performed in a commendable and caring
way. I cannot speak too highly about some of their individual acts to save
lives. It was as if they suddenly realised we were all human beings
together, without a hooligan in sight, and we all needed each other.

    Both my son and myself have had strange reactions after Hillsborough,
    mainly the usual guilt in my case at both having been spared and being so
    bloody useless on the day.

    No doubt there were drunks in the crowd as there are each game but I did
    not see any, nor did I witness any misbehaviour by the supporters.

    I am at pains to point out that I am no Police "basher", in fact quite the
    contrary. I have every admiration for the difficult and dangerous job they
    perform. Nor, on this occasion, do I apportion any individual blame to the
    few curteous hapless officers I encountered. But somebody, somebody in the
    higher or-i-'oir>nc r.f 4-bo fnrcn in-iteiy got it oh so tragically wrong.

There was a huge crowd outside the Leppings Lane entrance at 2.55 pm.      The
police had formed a wall of two horses in front of the gates, preventing
the entry of arriving fans to the already congested turnstiles.            The
police assured us that there was nobody actually getting into the ground at
this end.     The horses moved apart creating a gap and we were instructed to
move to a side gate which had been opened to allow fans into the ground.
Mys e l f and three other members of my family passed in the direction
instructed and passed through the gates.      There were no groundsmen around
and all four of us passed through without our tickets being taken.          We
passed through a tunnel which overspilled into the Leppings Lane section
1B 1 segment.      We were packed in like sardines.    I lost both my parents
and grimly held on to my younger brother who was finding it very difficult
to breathe in the crush.     Nobody watched the game. We were more concerned
about keeping our feet firmly fixed on the ground.         A girl was getting
badly crushed and I helped pass her above the heads of fans towards the
narrow gate which had been opened by the police.          By now people were
struggling to climb ovar the railings and get onto the pitch.       The police
were telling us to move back but we couldn't, because people were still
coming in from behind.      People were falling down all over the place, many
were trodden on.      People were being passed to the people in the seating
area above and behind and slowly space was forming in front of us.      By now
my brother had disappeared and I considered searching through the blue
corpses which were piled three persons high in front of me.      I spotted him
on the railing, climbing over onto the pitch after he had climbed out of
section 1B 1 into the less densely packed area to the right of the goal.
Fans were weeping everywhere and we all comforted each other.       I found my
parents and escorted them out of the ground via the tunnel through which we
entered. My brother made his way off the pitch and we eventually met him
outside the ground.

   EYE WITNESS ACCOUNT OF EVENTS AT LEPPING ROAD STAND 15/4/89

On 15/4/89 I travelled to SHEFFIELD to see the cup semi-final tie at

HILLSBOROUGH.
Traffic delays, road works and diversions caused my late arrival into the

area near the ground and inadequate near ground parking did not help.

I parked some distance from the ground and joined a procession of mainly

Nottingham Forest supporters shortly before half past two in a walk/jog

to the ground.

I was directed by a policeman to the LEPPING ROAD end of the ground via

the MAIN STAND (SOUTH) only to be turned back and told I had to approach

from the other side (i.e. NORTH STAND side) (at approx. 14.55 hours).

A policeman at the KOP end was not able to direct me claiming he was from

the DONCASTER force and was not familiar with the area.
Another directed me via the "roundabout" stating that the kick off had

been delayed to allow all the crowd in.

The roar from the crowd some few minutes later belied this statement.

As I approached the LEPPING ROAD END I was met by a dozen or more police

proceeding away from the ground and a group of mounted police were leaving

the turnstile area.   Approximately 1 0 - 1 2 mounted police were paraded

in line to the right of the turnstiles.
There was little activity in this area with a few fans at the turnstiles

and some police standing by.
The gate at the right of the turnstile was partly open.
I entered through turnstile 'F' and went initially to the right hand stair­

way not seeing any clear directions and I was directed by a steward to

the tunnel.
No police were in evidence in the area between the tunnel and the turn­

stiles at this time about 15.08 hours.
I hurried down the tunnel together with other late-comers
                                      3.

14)   A single Merseyside steward stood within the tunnel who said the fans are

      on the pitch and the players had gone off.
15)   I had earlier heard a tannoy message for Liverpool fans to move away from

      the entrances because there had been some crushing.

16)   Movement in the tunnel was relatively free and no exceptional or expected

      crushing at the ground end of the tunnel.
17)   I was amazed on entering the terracing to find the perimeter fence almost

      covered with people endeavouring to climb out — some police assisting them

      and others forcing them back - some gesturing to spectators to push back

      - a difficult thing to do due to tightly packed bodies.

18)   There was much anguished screaming and shouting - mainly pleas to the

      police to restore order and help the injured.
19)   Some pressure was released with fans being hauled up into the stands or

      helped sideways into adjacent pens.
20)   Distressed and injured spectators forced their way back up to the tunnel

      and one man said some one had died.
21)   This caused much consternation and many fans left the terracing and more

      and more casualties were helped from the pen to lie on the concrete behind

       the stand.

22)    I assisted many back to the fresh air where the concourse soon filled up

       with semi-conscious casualties and others in varying states of distress.

23)    After one visit to the terracing I approached a senior police officer

       standing by the partly open gate near the turnstiles and pleaded with him

       to send some of his men down the tunnel to restore order and make easy

       egress from the terracing.   He turned away amd ignored my request.

24)   There was no police presence on that concourse until approximately 1530

       hours despite the mounting casualties and there was much relief when about

       five police eventually proceeded down the tunnel-returning at some speed

       with a prostrate body which was rushed to the waiting ambulance.
                                           4.

25)     I again approached the senior police officer "guarding" the gate and told

        him that a fleet of ambulances would be needed immediately as the

        devastation within was horrific.        Again he made no reply.

26)     Eventually more police began to arrive at approx 15.40 hours and relief

        turned to understandable anger when it was seen that the police were not

        involving themselves with resusitation and first aid or clearing a passage

        on the terrace to remove the casualties via the obvious exit - i.e. the

        tunnel.

27)     Most of the people lying on the concrete behind the stand required medical

        or hospital attention which was not available.

28)     They were attended by distraught friends and strangers who did their best

        to comfort and sustain.

29)     Eventually the concourse floor was cleared and some order was established

        mainly by a tall man who appeared to be an official steward but displayed

        no identification.   This would be about 1600 hours about the time

        Mr Dalgleish made his announcement to co-operate with the police.

30)     A little earlier firemen had arrived probably from the blue concertina

        gates and were directed by fans towards the tunnel.

31)     I had seen two ambulances on the field and two behind the West stand but

        no great flood had been observed although many were in evidence later -up

        and down the main (A61) road about 1630 hours.



CONCLUSIONS



A)      There were no police presence inside the turnstiles at 1510 hours although

         I had seen a large group leaving the area earlier.
B)      The one steward at the tunnel was powerless to organise or direct the faja

        within.
No large groups of fans - drunk or not - were in the roads leading to the

LEPPING ROAD end or entered the stadium after me.     I was in the vicinity

of the tunnel and concourse from just before 1510 hours to 1615 hours.

Police presence was slow in appearing behind the stand and the bemused

senior.police officer at the gate was inactive.     Unfortunately this was

a time for (i) leadership, (ii) clear directions, (iii) swift decision

and initiative was imperative.

When police eventually arrived - no doubt stunned by what they saw it was

clear for all to see the lack of intention to take action to revive,

comfort or administer to the injured.   This displayed either a lack of

training in first aid or emergency procedures, wrong briefing and

insensitivity.

There was a number of cases of anguished and near hysterical supporters

who had lost contact with friends and relatives and seen horrific sights

- being restrained from taking action against police for their apparent

lack of action and priorities.

Necessary equipment was sadly lacking in that area and the injured and

dying carried out lacked even the comfort of an advertising hoarding.

Communications between the various units on the field viewing the pen and

outside was either inaccurate or non-existant.    Hand radio sets were in

evidence but were they working?.Was the telescanner working -      what did

the monitor display and is the film available.

Control within the concourse was slow to materialise once the catastrophy

had occurred and then consisted mainly of police ranks observing the

distraught and injured supporters.

The elementary ploy of using theexit tunnel to ferry the casualties to

hospital should have been an instant decision by whoever was in charge.

A clear positive tannoy announcement to mobilise the medical expertisti

amongst the crowd would have had a salutory effect on the remainder oi

the spectators.                                                           _

OBSERVATION



On reflection the police concerted action throughout the afternoon indicated that

briefing had been:-



          i)   inadequate - Neighbouring forces brought in were not familiar with

         the stadium,   and


         ii)   designed for riot control not crowd control hence apart from a few

         notable exceptions who broke ranks or were specifically detailed and

         rendered valuable and heroic service, most completely misinterpreted the

         situation before them.



It should be borne in mind that the supporters entering through these turnstiles

were in the main, stand seat ticket holders and Anfield stand season ticket holders

issued ground tickets through the club allocation system.

CHAIRMAN'S REPORT
This is m y first annual report on the activities of the Football Trust
 1990. It covers an important and exceptionally busy year. The
former Football Trust and Football Grounds Improvement Trust have
been successfully dissolved and their activities combined and the
new Trust has formulated and implemented policies to meet the
tight timetable demanded by its new responsibilities.
    The Government selected the Trust as the vehicle for channelling
 grant aid to clubs in the Football League, the Scottish Football
League and to national stadia so as to assist in implementing the
recommendations of the Taylor Report. The amalgamation of the
two former Trusts and the consequent restructuring of our adm inis­
tration was necessary to discharge the responsibilities placed upon
us. Major changes were required and it is pleasing to report that they
were effected smoothly.
    The Chancellor's 1990 Budget released to
the Trust the proceeds of a 2.5% reduction in
pool betting duty to provide grant aid towards
capital works in line with the Taylor recom­
mendations. The reduction is expected to
yield about £20m per year for each of the five
years during which, under the present agree­
m ent w ith the Government, the reduction
 applies. Receipts from this source in 1990/91
 amounted to £18,730,000 and the interest
received was £906,000. Allocations to Foot­
ball League clubs and Scottish Football
League clubs during the year for major
projects from this fund amounted to
£ 10,589,000. A schedule of these major project grants accompanies
this report on page 8. Major projects include cover, seating, new
stands, ground sharing and relocation. The 1990/91 grants have
been allocated to support Taylor-related projects at League grounds
estimated to cost over £43m.
   The allocations reflect the Trust's policy that all football clubs in
both Leagues should be eligible to receive grant aid. A condition of
our agreement w ith the Government about the use of reduction
monies is that the Trust must treat each application for grant aid on
its merits, taking full account of the needs and resources of the clubs.
Each application has been the subject of scrutiny by our reporting
accountants and nom inated surveyors. Their reports have been
considered by the Licensing Authority Liaison Committee which is
responsible for making recommendations on applications to the full
Trust. The Trust has paid particular attention to the needs and




                                   1
resources of the clubs, notably attendance figures and available
financial resources. As a result, as the schedule of grants shows, the
percentage level of Trust support for major projects varies - from
15% in the case of Rangers Football Club to 75% for Hartlepool
United. This rigorous scrutiny and individual consideration will
continue to apply to future applications.
    The implementation of the Taylor Report is gathering m om entum
and the Trust has been pleased to be able to support so many projects
during the past year. We must, however, not lose sight of the fact
that football faces an enormous task in converting grounds to all
seated accommodation by the 1999/2000 season. The Trust
welcomes the Government's commitment to review the pool betting
duty concession at an early stage and hopes that the life of the
reduction may be extended to meet the size of                                          ,   /
the task and the timetable for completing it.                  '     ' ; f l 'f l    i-1        *#1
    While the Trust's primary task this year has                         Li U       —'-I   §T    ^
been to devise and implement policies to use
the reduction monies to the optimum advan­
tage of the game in implementing Taylor,
other important work has remained a prior­
ity. The Trust continues to be funded from the
Spotting-the-Ball competition run by the
Pools Promoters Association - Littlewoods,
Vernons and Zetters. This currently produces
 some £12m a year. As part of our agreement
w ith the Government £9m of this fund is
used to help finance essential safety and
 improvement work at Football League,
 Scottish Football League and Irish Football League clubs. In this
 context the Trust has continued to play a crucial role in assisting
 clubs in conjunction with the police to develop effective closed
 circuit television, to improve spectator safety and comfort and to
 strengthen the link between clubs and their communities. The Trust
 has allocated £4m to fund the National Football and the Community
 Programme, promoted by The Football Association, the Football
 League and the Professional Footballers' Association, £ lm of which
 was paid during the year.
    The remaining funds available to the Trust from the proceeds of
 the Spotting -the -Ball competition have been allocated to projects for
 the general benefit of the game in the Pyramid and at grass roots
  level. Grants have been made towards essential safety work at clubs
  in the Pyramid and non-League clubs and for pitch and dressing
  room improvements. The Trust has also continued to support the




                                     2
dual use of educational facilities, artificial floodlit pitches, hard
surface play areas, charitable playing fields associations, voluntary
organisations, youth and community groups and the supply of kit to
junior teams.
   There were two changes in the membership of the Trust during
the year: Councillor Brian Ludlam succeeded Councillor Hugh
McDonald as the joint nominee of the Association of County
Councils and the Association of M etropolitan Authorities and John
Vaughan succeeded David McDonald as the M inister for Sport's
Observer. We are grateful to both retiring members and their
successors for the valuable contribution they have made to the work
of the Trust.
   I would also like to take this opportunity to thank my fellow
Trustees and our Regional Representatives for their unstinting
efforts on the Trust's behalf. My particular thanks for their invalu­
able support go to my Deputy Chairmen, Richard Faulkner and to
Tom W harton, for chairing the Licensing Authority Liaison Com­
mittee which has had such a vital task to perform this year and to our
Secretary, Peter Lee, appointed in August 1990, and his small team.
The Trust is also grateful to the football authorities and Sports
Councils who assist with the implementation of our grant schemes,
to the team at the Sir Norman Chester Centre for Football Research
and to the police and civil servants who give us their advice and
support.
   It is fitting that my final thanks should, once again this year, go to
Littlewoods, Vernons and Zetters. The Trust was founded on their
initiative and without them its achievements would not have been
possible.

ORGANISATION
The Trust works through two m ain committees - the Chairman's
Committee and the Licensing Authority Liaison Committee. The latter
Committee is concerned solely w ith grant aid support to clubs in the
Football League and the Scottish Football League. The Chairman's
Committee deals w ith grants to all other levels of the game and to
other organisations. Both committees consider applications for
grant aid and make recommendations to the Trustees. Final
decisions about grant aid in all cases rest w ith the Trust.

Major Project Grants
The Trust can only contribute towards the finance which clubs must
find if major Taylor related projects are to go ahead. Resources can­
not be stretched to relieve clubs of their entire financial burden -
grant aid must be end funding, offered once all areas of finance have
been explored and tapped.
   In order to help clubs in putting together their financial packages,
the Trust published guidelines on the m axim um grant likely to be
available for major projects.--
FOOTBALL LEAGUE         £   ■      SCOTTISH FOOTBALL LEAGUE       £
First Division         2 ,0m       Premier Division             2.0m
Second Division        1.0m        First Division               0. 5m
Third Division         0.5m        Second Division              0.5m
Fourth Division        0.5m




                                   4
  These figures are guidelines, the Trust is responsible for consider­
ing grant applications on the merits of the individual case, taking
account of clubs' needs and resources.
  A schedule of m ajor projects grants is on page 8.

National Stadia
A national stadia sub committee has been set up to report to the full
Trust on policy and grant proposals for the national stadia in the four
home countries.

 Safety Grants
Essential safety work, required under the provision of the Safety of
Sports Ground Act 1975, the Fire Safety and Safety at Places of Sport
Act 1987 and, in England and Wales, the Football Spectators Act
 1989, remains a priority, eligible for grant aid of up to 75% of
approved expenditure. The Trust provided £4. 8m grant aid for safety
work in 1990/91 bringing the Trust's total support for safety projects
to some £42m.

Improvement Grants
 Various percentage levels of grant aid support are available for
 improvement projects including community projects, family areas,
 toilets, facilities for people with disabilities, transport improve­
 ments, closed circuit television surveillance equipment. Grant aid
 totalling £1.16m was allocated to improvement projects in 1990/91
bringing the total support provided by the Trust to some £9.9m.
   The Trust attaches great importance to developing community
 sports facilities based on League clubs and has invested substantial
funds in 'football and community' projects. The Trust decided to
make £4m available over two years to fund the joint Football
Association/Professional Footballers' AssociatioiyFootball League
National Football Development and Community Programme. £ lm
was allocated to the Programme in 1990/91.
   To recognise and promote clubs' efforts in this important area the
Trust introduced its own Community Award Scheme in 1988/89,
the joint winners of which were Millwall and Preston North End.
The competition was arranged for the second time early in 1991.
   CCTV has proved the single most important measure in the
campaign against football hooliganism. Its introduction throughout
football was a Trust initiative. In 1990/91 £2m over two years was
allocated for the installation of improved equipment bringing total
Trust grant aid for CCTV to £5.3m.
Police Charges
The Trust allocated £2.5m to clubs in the Football League, the
Scottish Football League and the GM Vauxhall Conference to help
meet the cost of police charges at league matches in 1990/91. Grant
aid was offered at a rate of 50% for the first £50,000 charged, 40% on
charges between £50,000 and £75,000 and 30% on charges between
£75,000 and £100,000. Police charges in 1990/91 amounted to
£ 7 .14m bringing the total grant aid extended by the Trust since our
support scheme was introduced in 1984/85 to some £8.32m.
   The continuing increase in policing costs and the emphasis being
placed on raising full economic charges is a concern for clubs and for
the Trust. It is important that clubs should develop the m axim um
use of their own effective stewarding arrangements.

A Guide for Clubs
The Trust has published a guide on grant aid policies for Football
League and Scottish Football League clubs. Copies are available
from our W alkden House office.

THE GRANT AID SCHEMES OPERATED
BY THE CHAIRMAN'S COMMITTEE
Pyramid Safety and Improvement Grants
Assisting clubs outside the Football League and the Scottish Football
League to carry out work at their ground in the interests of spectator
safety, required by the police, fire or local authority, remains a
priority. Grant aid is also available to help clubs w ith improvements 1
to the pitch and players' changing facilities. The Trust allocated I
£975,000 to Pyramid and non-League safety and improvement 1
schemes in 1990/91 bringing the total amount of grant aid made
available to these schemes to some £4.3m.

Dual Use of Educational Facilities
This scheme is available to assist schools and other educational
establishments install and improve football facilities, w ith a view to
their use being extended in the local community. Typical schemes
include the provision and floodlighting of artificial pitches,
remedial work to grass pitches and the extension of changing
facilities. The Trust allocated £50,000 to dual use schemes in
 1990/91 bringing the total amount of grant aid to some £1.2m.

Charitable Playing Fields Associations
Grant aid of £200,000 was made available for the improvement of
existing changing and pitch facilities and the provision of new ones.
                             Hard Surface Play Areas
                             Under this scheme, run in conjunction with The Football Associ­
                             ation, £100,000 grant aid was made available for the provision of
                             hard surface play areas and floodlighting. Facilities have been in­
                             stalled at Pyramid clubs, boys' clubs, local authorities and charitable
[5CGM 1SU6

                             Miscellaneous Grants
                             The miscellaneous grants scheme allows the Trust to consider any
                             application for grant aid which does not fall into an identified
                             category. Professional bodies in the game, voluntary organisations,
                             youth and community groups and charities can benefit from grants
                             ranging from £500 to £10,000.

                             Chairman's Discretionary Fund
                             The Chairman operates a small, discretionary fund. From it the Trust
                             is able to support clubs and organisations at the grass roots, particu­
                             larly clubs with junior sides, to purchase kit and equipment. Grants
                             range up to £2 50.

the state of affairs of the Trust at 5 April 1991 and of its excess of
expenditure over income and source and application of funds for the
year then ended.

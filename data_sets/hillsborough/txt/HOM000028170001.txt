INTRODUCTION

"VICIOUS SOCCER GANG RIOTS"
"ANIMALS ON THE TERRACES"
"SOCCER IHUGS SLASH BOY"


The British Public are sickened time and time again by headlines such
as these appearing in our national press.               Television news pictures
show us scenes of violence on a scale hitherto unprecedented in the
pursuit of what should be a pleasurable pastime - the attendance of
young and old alike at football grounds to enjoy the spectacle of our
national sport.


How many loyal football supporters; and I use that term in its truest
sense, can genuinely say that they can enjoy the game without the
slightest fear that they may be subject of attack or innocently caught
up in the fighting perpetrated by that breed of criminal we have come
to know as the football hooligan.


Social commentators have often posed the question "Why has football
become the host for the parasitic hooligan?         Why not other sports such
as rugby or cricket?"      The answer lies deep in the social fabric of our
society, but if we are to tackle the problem it is essential that the
hooligan is stripped bare of all trappings of football, the myths and
hype that surround him so that he can be examined in isolation.


The   word    "hooligan"   cannot   and   does    not    adequately   convey   the
criminality    of   persons   engaged     in   serious    acts   of   premeditated
violence, planned and executed with the precision and cunning of the
criminal mind.


If the hooligan is to be identified and his methods defeated, it is
important that society as a whole recognises the true nature of this
type of offender.
"Hooligan" - Origin of Word            (Oxford English Dictionary)


"The word first appears in print in daily newspapers police court
reports in the summer of 1898.             Several accounts of the rise of the
word, purporting to be based on first-hand evidence, attribute it to a
misunderstanding or perversion of Hooley or Hooley's gang,                  but no
positive confirmation of this has been discovered.                The name Hooligan
figured in a music hall song of the eighteen-nineties, which described
the doings of a rowdy Irish family."


"Hooligan" - Dictionary Definition


"A young street rough, a member of a street gang."




THE HOOLIGAN - THE MEDIA VIEW


The public's perception of the hooligan is governed by the reaction and
output of the media.        It must be said that the media, and the tabloid
press in particular have presented a picture of the hooligan which is
often distorted and over simplified.              Although coverage is clearly
condemnatory of hooligan behaviour,           it is often the case that such
incidents being newsworthy become sensationalised by the manner in
which they are reported.             Consequently,      a stereotype hooligan has
emerged.      He is depicted as a lager swilling "yob or thug".          Because he
drinks until he is almost senseless,             he finds himself involved in
trouble;      "spontaneous" clashes with rival fans or with the police.
This    simplistic    view of      hooliganism   leads    to   the assumption that
alcohol is at the root of the problem and that any subsequent violence
is solely a drunken brawl between two groups of opposing football
supporters who happen to meet              by chance on the street or in the
terraces.      Nothing could be further from the truth.


There    is    no   doubt   that    some    behaviour    dubbed   "hooliganism   is
opportunist and off the cuff.              There is much noise,       verbal abuse,
pushing and shoving that takes place on the terraces which to the
casual observer might be termed hooliganism.              A heated argument between
supporters is just as likely to break out and result in blows being
struck as in any crowded situation.
The insidious nature of the true hooligan is that his actions are
seldom spontaneous, but for the most part pre-planned and calculated to
create mayhem and disorder.




THE HOOLIGAN     -     A f.ARKER      PROFIT.T?


The career of    the typical          football hooligan begins atan early              age.It
is not uncommon for hooligan gangs to have members of the ages of
fourteen.      This    is the age at which the encounter with football
hooliganism is first made.           Once accepted as a gang member the new
recruit begins a career which will take him through the hierarchical
structure   of   the     gang.      Should   the       recruit   display     a   degree    of
intelligence,    cunning and         guile it may bethat he            will become a leader
of the junior section of the gang within arelativelyshort time.


The junior members of the gang, usually aged between 14 and 20, will
have been brought up in the locality of the club, although it should be
noted that at some football clubs whose hooligan followers are regarded
as notorious, young persons travel on occasions large distances from
their homes to show allegiance to a gang with such a reputation.


The young members of the gang usually work in packs as individually
they have neither the capability nor physique to attack rival fans.
Thirty is usually the minimum number who must be present within the
group before they will take any action.                 The younger element are keen
to carry out violent attacks in order to increase their status with
more senior gang members.


One of the primary roles of the junior section is to act as "spotters"
at railway stations.       They carry out this task by posing as legitimate
travellers waiting in foyer areas and on platforms until the arrival of
a train carrying rival supporters.                   Having identified such a group,
they will either attack the rival supporters a short distance from the
station, or will pass the information by means of a "runner” to the
senior members of the gang who will carry out an attack themselves.


Such   attacks   are     normally    well    co-ordinated        and   are       planned   as
ambushes, usually in quiet side streets well away from the eyes of the
police.



                                         -   3   -
As the young gang member grows older he will be improving his status
constantly within the group by the number of attacks, woundings, etc.
he is able to inflict on rival supporters, witnessed by his fellow gang
members.     He will eventually cross the divide from the junior to senior
section of the gang.         Again depending on "ability" he will rise through
the group and should he display sufficient leadership skills, may find
himself the leader of the gang or "General" as they are known in the
language of the hooligan sub-culture.


As the hooligan progressed through the various levels of the hierarchy
any    interest which       he   may    have      had       in     football   which   may   have
originally       first   persuaded      him       to       enter    a   football   ground    has
invariably changed to boredom.            He tolerates being present when a game
is played to enable him to use the support he lends to the football
club   as   an    excuse    for his behaviour.                   Hooligans will often give
themselves away to the informed observer by busily talking for long
periods amongst their group during the game, some with their backs to
the field of play.         It is not difficult to see through their pretence.


To some hooligans the game of football is such an anathema that they
will not even bother to go through the charade of attending matches.
Instead they will, during the course of the game, resort to public
houses close to the ground.            Their "sport" is before and after the game
in the street outside the ground and further afield.


It is a grave mistake to underestimate the intelligence of the football
hooligan.        Many are well educated and in full-time employment.                         The
tactics adopted by hooligan gangs are                        sometimes complex and often
require a degree of ingenuity.




HOOLIGAN TACTICS


Gang members will frequently endear themselves to police officers and,
whilst in conversation with them, glean intelligence and information
concerning the whereabouts of opposing groups of supporters and the
movement and tactics of the police.                    They will so far as possible seek
to carry out attacks on rival supporters out of sight of the police or




                                              -   4    -
where police manpower is limited and they believe they stand a chance
of overwhelming the rival supporters and the police by weight of
numbers.


Football scarves, hats or other club paraphernalia are not worn by the
hooligan.   He requires anonymity.       This enables him to infiltrate the
rival supporters' turnstiles.     An incident occurred at a recent derby
match between Manchester City and Manchester United where approximately
one hundred United supporters infiltrated the North stand at Maine Road
Football Ground.    This is a seated area and is frequented by families.
Serious disorder broke out within the stand when the United supporters
attacked spectators who were doing nothing more than watching the game.


Because of their deliberate policy of not identifying by dress which
club they supported, these hooligans succeeded on this occasion in
achieving their violent objective.           Bearing in mind that Manchester
United and Manchester City supporters are mostly Mancunian and speak
with the same regional accent, how is a gate steward or police officer
supposed to identify to which stand that supporter should be admitted?
Perhaps this is one example where the National Identity Card scheme
would have prevented such a confrontation taking place.


The football hooligan has in recent years, relied less on his fists and
more on the blade to fight his battles.            The carrying of offensive
weapons by gang members is now the rule rather than the exception.
Many gangs appoint an armourer whose responsibility it is to equip gang
members with offensive weapons prior to a fixture.            His armoury is
often awesome;     Stanley knives, knuckledusters, telescopic coshes, rice
flails, truncheons, the list goes on.


Various ingenious methods have been adopted by the hooligan for hiding
such offensive weapons about his person.          Recently though because of
the increased thoroughness of police searching at grounds, the hooligan
has relied increasingly on the adaption of everyday objects for use as
weapons.    Such weaponry is usually either home made or bought when on
holiday abroad.




                                     -   5   -
The ingenuity of the manufacturers of these articles knows no bounds.
Fountain pens when opened reveal a three inch dagger; a wafer thin
metal blade concealed inside a plastic card resembling a credit card;
and at the most basic do-it-yourself level, the sharpened coin, slipped
into the pocket amid loose change.


Another item which is standard issue to gang members is the "calling
card".     Designed on the lines of a business card, bearing the name of
the gang, it is left with the unfortunate victim so he is in no doubt
as to the allegiance of his assailants.


ORGANISATION AND PLANNING


When two rival gangs of hooligans meet, the violence that follows is
only the last link in a chain of events which have been meticulously
planned.


This planning often takes place in local public houses which the gang
have adopted as their "headquarters".                 Several weeks before a fixture
which is likely to lead to confrontation with a rival hooligan gang,
the leaders will use their knowledge of their opposition, gained over
many seasons,      to assess how many men will be required, where they
should be placed, and how best a successful ambush of the rival gang
can be achieved.


The rank     and   file gang members will              then be informed usually by
telephone that their services are required on the day of the fixture.
A further meeting will be arranged either the evening before or on the
morning of the day itself when final plans are discussed and specific

tasks allocated, be it as "spotter", "runner" or to take part in the
ambush itself.


The planning process takes on a further dimension when the hooligan
gangs    travel    to   away   matches.       They will      use whatever   means   of
transport is available to them be it car, van or train.                  Their major
concern is to avoid detection by the police to and from the game.                   To
do this they will exercise care in the timing of their journey.                     For
Saturday games, they may well travel the day before when they believe
their movements are likely to raise less suspicion from the police or
railway staff.



                                          -   6   -
The    gang will     also      be    careful      to   limit    their      numbers     travelling
together      and will split         up into smaller            groups.        This particular
deception is maintained particularly when the gang moves around town
and city centre areas so as not to attract attention.                             When necessary
on a given signal, these sub-groups will be brought quickly together
should the opportunity for fighting arise.


The violent      and     as    often described          animal      like     behaviour        of    the
hooligan      gang       belies the planning whichprecedes the violence.                              A
national    network provides           many    of      the    gangs with intelligence on
counter measures being adopted by the police.                       The same network is used
to arrange the time and place of fights between rival gangs.                            But it is
at    international      level       when   the     system     is    seen    to    work    openly.
Contacts      are made    between gangs who              at      league level        are   natural
enemies,      but under       the    banner    of      the      England team         unite.         The
intelligence network is used to make travel arrangements and plan
meetings of gangs once they are abroad.


So proud is the hooligan of his military style campaign that many will
keep diaries which give detailed and graphic accounts of their criminal
activities.      However,       even the hardened hooligan on reflection can
regret his actions.             I quote from the diary of such an individual
recently convicted of conspiring to commit violent disorder.                            The diary
was recovered by police on his arrest.                   These remarks were read out at
his   trial    and     caused       consternation       within      the     court,     mixed with
disbelief at the insight these words give into the callous mentality of
the youth concerned:


"I WAS STOOD BEHIND A BOY AND HIS PARENTS.                     HE WAS AGED ABOUT SIX YEARS
AND WAS CRYING.        HE HAD RECEIVED A PUNCH OFF SOMEBODY AND WHEN I HEARD
THIS I FELT SORRY ABOUT WHAT HAD HAPPENED TO HIM, BUT I DIDN’T LET ON I
WAS ONE OF THOSE VICIOUS SOCCER THUGS."


This pride in their chosen lifestyle is further demonstrated by the
frequent      occasions       when     hooligans       are     arrested      and     their         homes
searched.      Scrap books containing press cuttings solely related to
football violence are found.                It is rare to find magazines, books or
other literature associated with the game of football.
Not content with seeing photographs of their fellow hooligans in the
press,     many   hooligan     gangs   appoint       a   "gang     photographer"     whose
responsibility it is to photograph and so record the more significant
moments in the life of the hooligan.                 So brazen are these gangs that
they have even been photographed going into battle with one another
with fists and feet flying.


The hooligan craves publicity.          Having read of the sickening exploits
of his fellows the previous weekend, he will go out with the intention
of ensuring that the notoriety of his gang outshines those who have
gone before.      Consequently the media do to some extent provide oxygen
to the blood of the hooligan.


A sensationalised report on the havoc wreaked by one group of hooligans
will only encourage other groups to escalate the level of violence.
Responsible coverage by the media is therefore a crucial factor when
considering ways to bring the hooligans' activities to a halt.


THE SEARCH FOR A MOTIVE


Organised Football Hooliganism in its purest form is an apparently
motiveless crime.       There is no financial gain to be made and in fact no
advantage of any obvious nature to be had.                 It is not surprising that
society is often baffled by such conduct.                It is not until the hooligan
is confronted with the evidence of his crime when interviewed by police
officers and seeks to justify his actions that his twisted reasoning
comes to the surface.


The Hooligan sees his involvement in football violence as a hobby.
"Recreational Violence" is perhaps the best description of what may be
regarded     by   him   as   an   exciting       diversion    in    an   otherwise    drab
existence.    The motive for the crime would, therefore, appear to be the
grotesque satisfaction gained from the hooligans' participation in what
amounts to territorial gang warfare.                 The thrill of releasing naked
aggression without any of the inhibitions placed on the individual in a
civilised    society.        He does so in the knowledge that he has the
strength of numbers on his side, and because of the hit and run tactics
adopted, is unlikely to be apprehended by the police.




                                        -    8   -
Considerations       of   social   disadvantage   owing   to   poverty,     lack   of
education and unemployment would seem to be irrelevant in the case of
the Hooligan.        Many can be shown to have come from middle class
backgrounds where conditions normally associated with the seed bed of
crime do not apply.        The psychological rather than financial nature of
the motive behind hooliganism may explain this.           However, once involved
in one criminal activity in the company of felons it is not unexpected
that the middle class hooligan should become involved in other areas of
crime.


THE FOOTBALL HOOLIGAN - A WIDER VIEW


It is indeed sad that the words football and hooliganism have become
synonymous.     But the football hooligan does not return home after a
match, put away his Stanley knife and suddenly turn into a decent law
abiding member of the public.


By observations of the hooligan and his gang by police officers, it has
become evident that football related violence forms but a small part of
his actions.    Football occupies perhaps two days of his week.             For the
remaining five days he remains a violent criminal.


Police enquiries have shown that hooligan gangs continue to meet on
non-match days and during the summer months.          Without the diversion of
football the hooligan and his partners turn their attention to the
nightlife of our towns and cities.


During August, 1987 a group of hooligans known as the Horwich Casuals
and a group alligned to the Bolton Wanderers Football Club made an
arrangement to meet and fight with two other hooligan groups from the
town of Ramsbottom and the village of Tottington near Bury.               Tottington
village was the agreed venue for the clash.


The hooligan gangs numbering 50 - 60 persons confronted each other in a
public house and what may only be described as a full blown riot
ensued.        The    public   house   was wrecked.       Windows   were    smashed,
furniture broken up and used as impromptu weaponry, ordinary customers
fled for their lives.
When the gangs did eventually leave the premises, the licensee was
forced to barracade himself in to prevent their re-entry.


Once outside the premises, the village of Tottington was subjected to
scenes of violence reminiscent of the American Wild West.                           Shop fronts
were destroyed, cars damaged and fighting occurred on a scale never
before witnessed in a quiet rural Lancashire village.


After    an     extensive    police   enquiry,         22    persons   were    arrested       and
subsequently convicted of offences of riot.


In     public    houses     and    licensed   clubs          they   continue     with     their
preponderance for violence, and often combine it with offences of theft
and robbery.          The word "Steaming" has recently taken on a new meaning.
The tactic being for the gang to rush into a particularly crowded
street or premises and assault and rob as many persons as they are able
within a few short minutes.           Then they disappear into the crowd.


Another tactic adopted has been theft on a mass scale.                              A group of
hooligans have shown themselves capable of running into a Department
Store in a City Centre on a busy Saturday afternoon and boldly grabbing
hold    of any item of value and, with the speed and effect of the
blitzkrieg, cleaning an entire Department of stock before fleeing with
their arms loaded with booty, and leaving staff open-mouthed, unable to
stop them for fear of their own safety.


The same strategy has been used by hooligans                        travelling to and from
away matches when stopping on Motorway Service Areas.                        They will enter
the shop in a group perhaps fifteen to                      twenty strong and, in moments,
will steal as much in the way of food                       and drink as they are able to
carry and usually far in excess of what they would be able to consume.
Any person unwise enough to attempt to intervene would most certainly
suffer serious injury.


Other criminal methods are used by the gang to finance their trips away
on match days and further their notoriety.                    Theft, robbery and burglary
play    a     part.      Perhaps   more   surprisingly           the   use    and    supply    of
controlled drugs has been found to be most prevalent.                        The hierarchical
structure of the gang provides ideal lines of supply for such drugs




                                          -   10   -
which are not confined to those regarded as soft drugs, i.e. cannabis.
Thefull extent of this aspect        of the hooligan problem has yet to be
defined.


The discovery of extreme right-wing political literature in the homes
of persons subsequently convicted of offences of football hooliganism
shines a spotlight on another facet of the hooligan's persona and begs
the question, "To what extent are extreme political parties or their
followers    involved     in violence    on     the    terraces?"         There     are   two
possible scenarios.


1.   Owing to their aggressive disposition and personal prejudices the
         average football hooligan may feel that an extremist party most
         closely identifies with     his      own     set    of    values and beliefs,
         however distasteful they may be.


2.   That extreme right-wing political groups are actively engaged in
         the support of hooligan gangs and assist in the orchestration of
         violence perpetrated by them.


Only time and the. endeavours of the police will discover which scenario
is true.     What can be said at this moment from the experience already
gained in observing the hooligans is that racism is rife among their
ranks.


The baiting of coloured football players occurs all too frequently
during the game.         Even the top player of the highest international
reputation is not exempt.        If his skin is not white, a minority of the
crowd will seek to taunt him by the chanting of animal noises and other
forms of abuse against his race.


Racist attacks on individuals from ethnic minority groups is a popular
pastime     for    the   hooligan.      These       attacks       are    normally    totally
unprovoked    and    have   nothing whatever          to    do    with   football    or   its
supporters.       The attacks are cowardice in the extreme.                Often conducted
by a large number of the gangs against one or two innocent victims who
because of their natural terror and bewilderment find it hard to defend
themselves or even run away.
It should be remembered that injuries inflicted by the hooligan are
seldom minor.   They are not merely bruises as the result of a kicking
or even a broken nose, they are frequently serious woundings.         People
are maimed and scarred for life.        As we are all aware some do not live
to tell the tale.




CONCLUSIONS


It must be fully realised that the football hooligan is a violent
criminal who as part of his modus operandi avails himself of the
vehicle which football presents to further his violent ambitions.         He
relies on the presence of large numbers of persons attending football
matches to provide him with the necessary cover so that he may attempt
to operate undetected by the police.


Owing to the success in recent years of closed circuit television
operated by police within football grounds, the hooligan can no longer
rely on remaining an anonymous face in the crowd.        The very success of
this technology in detecting offenders has to a large extent displaced
violence from the terraces to other areas of public domain.         Town and
city shopping areas;      railway stations and streets to and from the
football ground are now more likely to be the scene of crimes committed
by the hooligan.      His potential territory of operations has therefore
grown immeasurably.


A worrying result of this is that members of the public going about
their daily business, women and children, shopping, walking down the
street are now more likely to find themselves caught up in the disorder
created by the hooligan.


There is also the danger which is inherent in ridding football of the
curse of the hooligan that he will concentrate his reign of terror
elsewhere, be it in the sporting or perhaps political arenas.


Perhaps the one criticism which has been levelled at the Homewatch
Scemes - that they are too successful in preventing crime and drive the
criminal from an area which has instituted the scheme to one that has




                                    -   12   -
not - may be said of the policing of football.                      That by driving the
hooligan away from football we lose sight of him, albeit temporarily,
until he surfaces to be the bane of another section of society.


Within the past month at Blackpool after the Birmingham City game
violence erupted within the ground.                    A swift police response quelled
this disorder but over the following twenty four hours the people of
Blackpool and visitors to that resort viewing the illuminations, were
put in fear by a marauding hooligan gang.




The   displacement      of   hooliganism       from      football   grounds   presents   a
challenge to the resources of police forces across the country.                      The
infiltration of hooligan gangs by police officers is one way forward.
It has proved to be an invaluable tool in gaining intelligence and
gathering evidence against organised violence associated with football.
It has also enabled police officers to study the hooligan at close
quarters and to analyse his motives and methods.


The Police Forces of England and Wales co-operate together as far as is
possible   to    beat   the hooligan and ensure that those who wish to
peaceably attend football matches may do so in safety.


A police football club liaison officer is assigned to each club in the
football league.        His area of responsibility includes regular contact
with the club and other liaison officers throughout the country to
ensure the smooth running of police operations at football matches.


The recent formation of the National Football Intelligence Unit also
provides   the    police     with   the       means      of   co-ordinating   nationally
information concerning        the activities of known hooligans and their
gangs.


The current problems associated with English football fans travelling
to international matches in Europe highlights the need for this level
of inter-police force co-operation to be extended across international
boundaries.




                                          -   13   -
The   removal   of border    controls   in 1992 makes          it vital    that    the
challenge   presented   by   the   hooligan   is   met    by    police    forces   at
international level.    If the hooligan knows no bounds, neither must the
arm of the law.


The people of Europe should be made aware that football hooliganism is
not just the English Disease; it is endemic throughout the continent.
The picture painted recently by the media of English fans rioting in
Sweden does not stand up to close examination.           English police officers
present on the ground are able to state quite categorically that the
vast majority of incidents of violence that took place were instigated
by Swedish hooligans.


The task of the police is to remain one step ahead of the hooligan, to
predict his movements and foresee his planned disorder.


The task of society is to find the means to loosen the millstone of
hooliganism from around the neck of football and this country.

                                                       24th April 1989




Dear Sir/Madam

I travelled to Hillsborough by car with four other people, three of
whom had been to the same fixture 12 months ago (including myself).
Traffic congestion meantwe arrived in Sheffield at 2 o'clock, having
left Liverpool at 11am.     Last year the same route took one hour less,
leaving plenty of time to park and get to the game.      We drove till
we saw signs indicating the ground was five minutes away, so we stopped
and went for a quick drink before going to the match.      A local told
me the ground was 20 minutes away; on hearing this at 2.15pm we decided
to drive closer to the ground.     We parked at what turned out to be
approximately 10 minutes walk from the ground, arriving at the ground
about 2.4^m.


Half a mile from the ground, people without tickets were asking for
spare tickets (indicating     few spare tickets).    On arriving at Leppings
Lane turnstiles there was confusion as to where we should go, as there
were no clear signs above the turnstiles.     There was a large crowd,
obviously anxious to get in the ground before kick off.      We held back
at the edge of the crowd because it was clear that people were being
crushed at the front, against the turnstiles, of which there appeared
to be pitifully few to give access to so many.      There were no signs
of drunkenness or disorder at all.     There was, however, a lot of anger
directed towward the mounted police because of their lack of ability
to control and organise the fans into orderly queues.      Twelve months
previously we arrived at the same time, to be met by a crush (though
not as big) but eventually got in through the appropriate turnstile.

 The police appeared to be nervous and in a panic, which is something
 I have never seen before, especially from mounted police.      At about
 2.55pm a policeman on a'horse said "Go around this way", directing
 us toward an open gate to our right.     At this point my group split
 up, a friend who had been with me 12 months previously, and his father,
 followed me to the left-hand side of the terracing.     I made my way
 there at once because twelve months previously I had been directed
 there by a policewoman who had explained that the middle section was
 full.     THIS YEAR THERE WERE NO POLICE OR STEWARDS DIRECTING FANS TO
 THE SIDE ENTRANCE.    To my knowledge, no signs or directions exist
 on the back of the stands at Leppings Lane to direct supporters.


 To get to the side entrances to the terracing, entrance through an
 unmarked side gate was necessary.     On entering the ground just in
 time for kick off, overcrowding was obvious in the middle section of
 the terracing, although there was still plenty of space available in
 the terracing below me (to the left of goal from Leppings Lane).
 At this point I spotted ontfof my group (who had been twelve months
previously) just behind me.      He said he had gone down the tunnel,
 then realised that was not the way he had been the year before, so
made his way to the left-hand upper.terracing, where he knew we would
be standing.



The first teenager to climb the fence and collapse on the pitch was
dragged off by a policeman, convinced apparently that this was a hooligan,
not a human being in distress.     It was obvious to most people in the
Leppings Lane end that something was seriously wrong.     The police,
however, seemed unconcerned, indeed physically knocking back people
who were climbing the perimeter fence.     Even by the time ambulances
arrived, apart from half a dozen or so policemen giving heart massage,
the majority of policemen stood watching, as teenage fans tried as
best they could, to revive the injured.     Policemen trained in first
aid watched as people with little or no training tried to save lives.
Policemen were still, it seemed, concerned about a possible pitch invasion.

Fans, mostly young men and teenagers, ripped advertising hoardings
down and used them as stretchers to ferry the injured to the other
end of the ground, watched by policemen supposedly trained in emergency
aid.     As someone who witnessed the Heysel stadium disaster at first
hand, I never thought I would have to endure again, watching people
die just yards away from me at a football match.      The depth of
helplessness I feel at not being able to help those people is matched
only by the depth of anger 1 feel at the incompetence of those organising
the policing/stewarding of the game.      This was a totally avoidable
tragedy, if ever there was one.      In simple terms a row of policemen
blocking the tunnel entrance, directing fans to the side entrances
would have saved 95 lives.       In reality, only better communication
withifjpolice ranks inside and outside grounds can ensure safety.


In conclusion, the facts as I saw them are these.—
1.       There was no drunkenness amongst Liverpool fans;
?.       There were inaccurate signs pertaining to the walking distance
         to the match along the roads in Sheffield,
3.       There was inadequate labelling of turnstiles and a pathetic

         number of turnstiles;
4.       Lack of effective policing outside the ground, insensitive and

         illogical policing inside the ground;
5.       No police or stewards inside the perimeter wall directing unknowing

         fans to safe parts of the ground;
6.       Police reacting (if at all) in contradiction to events unfolding
         before them? overcrowding obvious to everyone in the Leppings
         Lane end, was seemingly dismissed and evacuation hampered and
         even positively discouraged by policemen who were hitting people

         trying to escape;
 7.      Lack of help for the injured from policemen (firemen when they
          eventually came, were giving heart massage and mouth to mouth
          resuscitation from the moment they arrived).


 The fifth member of our group turned up after the match, having gone down
 the tunnel into the middle section of terracing, escaping with just a fright

   and bruising-      Significantly, he had not been to Hillsborough the year
   before and had presumed the tunnel was the only access to the terracing.


   QUESTIONS
   1.       Why no stewards, or police, inside perimeter walls?
   2.       Why no check on tickets half a mile from ground?
   3.       Why was kick off not put back half an hour?
   4.       Why was police reaction hostile and unhelpful?
   5.       Why were Liverpool FC once again given inadequate ticketallocation?
   6.       Problems of overcrowding were experienced 12 months   ago by   Liverpool
            fans, so why was Hillsborough chosen again?


   Yours faithfully




   (Hoping this evidence will be heard, or at least taken account of)




N. B.

I like everyone who I travelled with still have their full match tickets.
Many, many other people I know of still have theirs too, perhaps giving
lie to the theory that there were a lot of people without tickets outside
Lepping Lane. Also if the terracing was ' well under capacity ' ( accord­
ing to Sheffield Wednesday's computer ) and there were A-,000 (Police est­
imate) outside, where were all the ticketless fans ?

TO A LISTENER
It started on a bright and sunny morning, that fated Saturday
15th April, 1989.

journey down was as pleasant          Qn the Friday night
because we'd had quite a bit   -              talked into going
^ ' m a t L ^      ^ e ^ S f t M h t          before. Three of
us felt very rough to say the least.
After getting lost in Sheffield about 3 times we finallyparked
about a mile from the ground, up a very s^eep hi h;rd it would

match last time and just walked straight in. Not thi          -
As we rounded the bend you could see thousands of support
n o t yet in the ground, as we approached it must have been about
2.45 p.m. so there was still time to get in before the match
started.
 Outside there was no order. Everybody was just ™ v®£f*nfe^ d

 lost, unable to calm the crowd. As we approached the fen
 before the turnstile fences, the crush was            *   in<5 ide
 remember asking myself why there were four P ° ^ e horses inside
 those fences? They should be in the crowd sorting it
 orderly lines instead of hiding behind fences.
 We managed to get through the fence without 9 e t t i n 9 squashed
 aaainst it       Then, all of a sudden the pressure eased. We were
 directed through a large open gate by the                                      J

 while I had a wee. After a couple of seconds H                                   disappeared
  awav into the crowd. As I turned I was just swept away in a
  tide of people.        I remember thinking "look out for the eras
 barriers", there was one on my right but I couldn t have
  avoided it. It was as though I couldn't stop going forward.
  The experience of being pushed and squashed didn                               seem
  matter because if you have been to a match before there is
  always a push or a sway but it always goes back and the
  nrpssure is relieved and you feel O.K. It didn t happen.                                  I
  remember a person pushing hard on my shouJf®r® ^ s ^ a p ^ d
  lad out, he can't breath". To my horror his son was trapped
  between me and him. I pushed the person inJ ^ ° ^ e°fdeJperately
  screaming "there's a little lad trapped'».                               *ried d<esperate y
  to net him out but the pressure was so great in front, oenin
  a n d all sides. It was ?hen I realised something was wrong.
  People were shouting "Stop the game! Stop the game....
   It III   as though yoG w e r e talking a foreign language to the
   police. I remember seeing a lad c l » out and a B o U c e j a
   trying to push him back into the ground. The l ^dm ust hav
   been in the crush and he must have thought to himself
   man's going to kill me if I get put back in there .
 It seemed like an eternity before they stopped the game and
‘realised the full horror of what was happening.  I was directly
 in line with a gate that was opened onto the pitch and I saw
 about three people get out. There were several Police and fans
 trying desperately to pull the people in front out, but the
 pressure was unbelievable, you just couldn't believe that
 people's bodies could cause this pressure. There were a few
 people managing to get over the fence to safety. People at the
 front were screaming at the crowd to push back but you were
 just moving or being squashed forward.  It wasn't until there
 were no more people getting out the gate that I realised that
 although you could nearly reach the gate, 5ft. away might as
 well be 50ft.
People started to panic. Arms were flying all over, "Help me
the screams went "Help me".
A man's arm came down on my head as if to use me to push
himself up or to keep alive.   I had to push him away, I had to
move his arm, if I went downI was dead.    This seemed to   e
never-ending, pushing away people's arms. Our bodies were
rigid, necks stretching out trying to reach out of this mass o
flesh.
 The heat was unbearable. I was sweating heavily.    I remember
 losing my training shoes in the push but that is totally
 irrelevant now. We seemed to be locked together and the ^
 pressure didn't ease. My chest felt as if it was caving in.
 I couldn't fill my lungs with air. The heat became really
 unbearable.  I think it was then that I started to struggle to
 breath^ Short, sharp breaths were all I could take. It was
 about this time I think I was giving up. I started to think
 about how good life was going for me.   I had moved in my house
 3 weeks before, I was getting married in June, I was really
 happy with life and I didn't want to die.
 It became harder to breath. It was like h o l d i n g your breath
 for about 5 minutes.   It was then that I felt a buzz in my head
 and a noise came. The only way I can describe it is like being
 at the dentist and when the gas mask comes to your face and you
 fight to stay conscious.
 It was the end. I had realised what was happening.   I'm not
 brave.  I didn't pray to God. I didn't pray or cry to anyone.
 A strange thought came into my head that I would never sit on
 our couch again, isn't that weird?
 As my eyes closed and I couldn't get anymore oxygen into my
 lungs I said "Oh Shit, this is it".
I "fainted - or died - I don't know how long I was gone for. I
was woken by a man pulling on my arm. It was as though someone
was trying to get you up for work. Asleep one minute awake
next. They pulled one arm then the other arm. I fell sideways
onto a pile of bodies, my legs were still trapped as if in a
vice. They pulled with all their might.    I was free. I just
clambered over the bodies and in a daze headed for the exit,
coughing and crying my eyes out. I was free. I wasn t a hero,
I didn't help anyone out. If ever I meet those lads again i
owe them one.
I got outside the tunnel to what I can only describe as chaos.
There were Policemen, Firemen, Ambulancemen, St. John's and
fans everywhere trying to help anyone they could. It was
horrible.  I staggered to the floor outside the tunnel. There
were bodies with coats over them. I was sobbing
uncontrollably. A football match and you were lucky to escape
with your life!
I was comforted by a Policewoman but there were fans venting
their anger on the only ones they could, the Poiice._ The:re
were people taking pictures of the injured but why didn t they
just leave us alone?
I was moved from outside the tunnel to near the exist fence. I
was just relieved and glad to be out. Four of us out of
five were alright.        could not be found. His dad, brother
and cousin were frantic.        had been in there with me.

We made our way back to the car.        jwas safe! he was alive,
we were all alive. We were lucky, very lucky. We did try to
get that young lad out but so sadly we were unable to help him.
I hope with all my heart that him and his _dad got out of that
massacre but somehow I don't think they did-.

I would like to end this sad story by just saying "thank you" to
the people of Sheffield who were marvellous when we needed
them.

        19 April 1989


        Dear Sir

        I am writing to you regarding the events on Saturday 15 April,
        at the Liverpool v Nottingham Forest FA Cup Semi-Final, at
        Hillsborough, which resulted in 95 deaths.

        I attended the match and was involved in some crushing outside
        the ground, eventually taking up my seat in the north stand just
        prior to kick-off.   I was very concerned about aspects of the
        organisation of this match, primarily crowd control. Hopefully,
        a full independent enquiry will find the reasons for this
        tragedy, but I am concerned that the views of spectators will not
        be taken into account due to the large number involved and the
        fact that they are individuals and not from any 'body', hence my
        letter to you.

        To blame the fans is totally wrong and I feel that this could
        happen unless all points of view are aired. I would stress that
        I am not anti-police, but on this day they were the body
        responsible for crowd control and safety.    They were totally
        unprepared and their activities were not co-ordinated.     They
        failed in their duty and got it wrong on the day.

        The problems arose because a large number of people with tickets
        tried to gain admittance at the same time. Impulsive decisions
        were made and could have been avoided as the situation was
        clearly predictable

               a.   the traffic situation on the motorways was well
                    known

               b.   close circuit TV would show the position both in
                    and outside the ground

               c.   the computer controlled turnstiles showed the
                    number in the ground and the number still to take
                    their places

               d.   the problem was evident by merely looking at the
                    Leppings Lane end and was clear to all present.




                                            1
With the known shortage of tickets, the whole situation should
have been anticipated and panic avoided. At no time did I see
any disorderly conduct,    everybody was good humoured and
apparently in possession of tickets.

Why:

       a.   Why was there no filtering towards the turnstiles
            - as there was last year - to prevent the crowd
            build up?

       b.   Why was the kick off not delayed as has been done
            several times this season, including the match
            involving only 10,000 spectators at Tranmere.

       c.   Why having opened the gate were arrangements not
            made to stream fans to the sides and to evacuate
            those already packed in.

       d.   Why were no    announcements   made,   no   use   of
            megaphones.

I have heard it said that an unruly mob was responsible.  This
was not the case, the sheer weight of numbers, created by poor
organisation, created it.

I understand that a decision was made to open the gate to
prevent loss of life outside the ground.   I feel that this was
a real possibility.      However, the decision was made in
isolation, without regard to the serious problem which was
already clearly evident inside.   The problems could not have
been made clear to the police inside the ground by their
superiors as they were deployed in the wrong places and ill-
informed.   This was clearly illustrated by large numbers of
police with dogs guarding the stands (for the wrong type of
situation) when they should have been elsewhere.

There were plenty of police about (I understand in the region of
800) but in the wrong places at the wrong time. The lower ranks
clearly thought violence was taking place, their superiors would
have known that this was not the case, but failed to instruct
them properly. One young constable, frightened, criticised his
superiors in front of us.

There has been a great deal of media attention and whilst I can
be influenced by various debates or my own emotions, I can
clearly recollect three impressions on that day:-

       1.   On reaching the ground there was no filtering -
            merely all persons allowed to make their own way.

       2.   On entering the ground, one section was clearly
            overcrowded and two other areas fairly empty.



                                 2
     3.   A lack of medical facilities and only two
          ambulances were seen in almost one hour of panic.
          Volunteers did nearly all the work.

The police seemed very complacent and the lower ranks harassed,
unco-ordinated and lacking leadership.     There was a complete
absence of planning and direction and I am convinced that this
could have been avoided had a predictable situation been tackled
properly.   The Liverpool police have dealt with large crowds
over many years without incident.

I feel that the planning of such events should take into account
the views of supporters, including various "associations which
now represent them.   The recommendations of Liverpool FC were
rejected for this match.

I know a lot of people share my views who attended the match.
Should you feel that I can be of any further assistance, please
do not hesitate to contact me.
                                         ;
I would like to record my admiration for the fans who assisted
the casualties and the attitude of Liverpool FC over the last
few days.

Yours faithfully




P.S. Since starting this letter; I have heard comments emanating
     from the Police Federation alleging that drunken fans
     started this incident. THIS IS UNTRUE.

     There was no evidence of this, the        cause was their
     inability to,   on a gradual basis, tostream arriving
     supporters, as they had done successfully the previous
     year. For some reason, they failed to do so and this must
     be highlighted.  I am deeply concerned that one isolated,
     inaccurate statement from a recognised body outweighs the
     more accurate reports from so many witnesses.

     Football supporters, unfortunately, are perceived by those
     who do not attend matches as those few seen in newsclips.
     The fans last Saturday came from all walks of life.    For
     example, our party of 4 were 30/40 years of age, married
     with children.  We noticed no less than             paving
     difficulty - hardly a hooligan!

                                          A
                 Dear Sirs,


                 The feelings I have held after watching the deaths at
                 Hillsborough are of deep sadness for those who have lost
                 friends and relatives.


                 I was near to the incident and experienced the problems of
                 trying to get into the ground.


                 After listening to most of the coverage on Radio City,
                 Radio Merseyside and T.V. programmes on Sunday, I feel an
                 urgent need to inform someone of exactly what the basic
                 cause of the problem was.


                 There are only a few ;turnstiles in one corner to
                 accommodate all those who are in the North Stand, the \(est
                 Stand and the Lepping End terrace, and in that undesirable
                 situation, there is bound to be a build-up of people.


                 When there is a build-up of people in any situation, the
                 only course of action is to form queues to instill order
                 and establish a feeling of security for people that
                 everything is under control.       The forming of queues for
                 the turnstile when there is a large number of people, has
                 been done at all the big games I have attended over the
                 past 35 years at Anfield and most other grounds.

The notable exceptions have been last year and regretfully
this year at Hillsborough.


The police were either oblivious to the situation or they
were not interested.


As the crowd built up, I could see four police sat in a
Land Rover just watching, it was absolutely amazing that
not one policeman was interested in   crowd control until
there were people being crushed.


At that point on, I think everything has been said, but to
reiterate my reading of events, if the crowd had been
policed into queues before the turnstiles,   there would not
have been a tragedy.


I am afraid the police failed to perform a basic duty, the
ability to control a section of the   crowd at the
turnstile, a function for which they were    paid, not sit
around in vehicles.


Yours faithfully,

                                      20th April, 1989.




Dear Sirs,


     My name Is David Stephen Moore, I am 35 years old. I am enclosing
my account of the Hillsborough Disaster, please feel free to use or
publish any part of this. I am available at any time without notice
if required.




                                  Yours faithfully,




                                    D.S. Moore.
       On Saturday, 15th April, 1989, I attended the F.A. Cup Semi-Final at
Hillsborough.    My ticket was for the Leppings Lane Standing area, Entrance 'B',
and I was accompanied by eight of my friends who all had similar tickets.

       We arrived at the turnstiles at 2.30 p.m. to meet and exchange a Stand Ticket
with a middle aged family friend.At this time there were     a large number of
supporters trying to get into the ground through the four turnstiles 'B' directly
facing Leppings Lane.

       The police were making no attempt to supervise queuing for these turnstiles
and a good deal of pushing and jostling for position was going on, but, I would
stress, not more than you would usually expect.    A mounted policeman to the right
of the gates (as you face towards the ground) then drove his horse directly into
the crowd - he had merely been positioned among the crowd before this - causing      a
rush to get out of the way.

       We entered the ground at approximately 2.40 p.m.   However, myself and my friend
had become separated from the rest of our group and decided to wait in between the
rear of the turnstiles and the covered tunnel onto the terraces to see if we
could rejoin our friends.     Within the space of a couple of minutes we were joined
by                  who had travelled with us.   It was approximately 2.45 p.m. at this
time

       We decided to continue waiting for our friends and were surprised when the
side concertina exit gate was opened, it appeared to allow policeman in.      Within
minutes the gate had been opened again and between 100-200 came in, several falling.
One man stumbled in front of us and we helped him to his feet, then found a
policeman and told him he thought it was unsafe to open this gate in view of the fact
that some people had fallen - at no time was any disrespect shown and the policeman
abused him and ordered us away.

       We began to make our way towards the covered tunnel onto the terracing when the
gate was opened again and several hundred people poured in.     I would stress that they
were forced to rush into the     groundby the pressure of supporters outside once
inside, i.e. through the concertina gate, but before entering onto the terraces this
rush subsided considerably.

       We took up our position   on the terrace at 2.57 p.m., I can be sure of this time
because I checked my watch.Although the terrace was very crowded       at this time we
still managed to pass comments on the Liverpool Team changes.

       Within the next few minutes it became clear to us that the ground was becoming
overcrowded - I did not experience any sudden rush.

             then turned to me and asked me to help him support a girl who appeared to
us ,to be fainting, at this stage we had lost sight of our third friend.

     There seemed to be slight relief of pressure on us for a few seconds (this
must have been when the crash barrier broke).    We then tried to manoeuvre the
girl to safety but she had turned blue and had died.     I tried to keep hold
of A JPewnoftj hand but he was drawn down into the, by now, dead and dying people
and his hand slipped from mine.

     We shouted at policemen on the crash barriers at the front of the terrace
that people were dead, also dying, but the small "escape" gate at the front remained
closed.    Some people were trying to climb over the fence and were being pushed
back by the police.    However, once the police realised the extent of what was
happening they started helping people over the barrier, one policeman I saw was
sitting astride the barrier flattening the spikes with his bare hands.       The front
gate was open by now and          and I carried an injured fan towards it.    Police
by that time had climbed over the side wire fences (separating 'B' Section from
'A' and ’C M but several of them, most particularly the younger officers, did not
seem to know what to do, we physically dragged two policeman to help us carry the
injured man over the dead bodies at the front of the stand out onto the pitch.


     At this point both         and I looked around and saw the extent of the dead
and injured and broke down into tears, we were incensed at the apparent number
of police who were just milling about.     We decided to help as best we could,
we forced our way past the police back orTto the terraces, and became separated
from each other, I was about two yards from the point where the crash barrier
collapsed and could see the dead and dying lying about 5 or 6 deep for a width
of about 15 yards!,    I began checking for a pulse on the necks of people who were
not obviously dead (I appreciate I am not qualified in pronouncing people dead
but the ones I classed as dead were blue grey in the face, lips were blue and
vomit filled their mouths and noses).     I helped supporters and police pull injured
out of the heap of bodies and gave the kiss of life to about 10 or 12 people
          and I had now found each other again) one of whom recovered quickly and
asked the whereabouts of his son, we had to slap him to find out where he had been
standing, but when we eventually found the boy he was dead.     We dragged a policeman
to us and told him of this and he took the man away.     We carried the dead boy out
on advertising hoarding to the far side of the ground into the hall where the
bodies were taken, at this time there were about 5 or 6 other bodies in the hall.

     We continued to carry dead people from the terrace to the, hall, we must have
carried about another 4 or 5, and tried to go back onto the terracing to help but
were told by police that there were no more injured or dead in there

     We then had a drink of water from trays of cups that were being passed round.
Hovrever, I saw several people who were injured still lying near the edge of the
pitch and went to see if I could help. I knelt beside one man who had been crushed
so badly he appeared flat (without a rib cage), there was blood coining from the
corner of his mouth, no one else seened interested and I dragged a St. John's
Ambulance man over who examined the man, started crying and said there was nothing
he could do for him and left.    The injured man then regained consciousness and
said to me "I'm going aren't I", I replied "I'm so sorry mate, I think so".     I
shouted and shouted for a doctor but when I looked down again the man had died.

     I found)______ again and we then pushed our way back into the ground and
tried to look for our friends, I sat on the terrace where we had been standing
prior to the game and saw hundreds of shoes and scarves, articles of clothing,
spectacles and cameras.

     We then made our way out of the ground and eventually rejoined our friends,
at no time did we see evidence of any other than correct behaviour from other
supporters.   Afterwards there were angry outbursts at the police, most of which
were "where were you before".    I feel that if more police had been present prior
to the kick-off to control the queues outside, and that if these queues had been
started away from the turnstiles, i.e. in Leppings Lane itself, and more stewards
had been present in the ground to direct people to the correct standing area -
when the concertina gate was opened everyone went to the nearest entrance - but
most of all if the gate had not been opened, then this tragedy would have been
avoided.   The police simply    had topostpone the kick-off if they were concerned
about safety outside, it ismy belief there     were insufficient to do this.

     I cannot pass comment on whether there were fans without tickets but on our
way to the ground we passed     peoplewho were offering tickets for sale - surely
if fans did not have tickets thesewould have been snappedv up.

     I am prepared to swear that all of the foregoing is true and will travel
anywhere and put myself at the disposal of anyone if I can help in any way with
an enquiry or investigation.

Dear Sir/Madam,
                              The Hillsborough Disaster : 15th April 1989


Please find enclosed four accounts by members of my family                  each
independantly made on Sunday 16th April while the memory was fresh .
We hope t h i s evidence may be of some help so such a d i s a s t e r will never
happen again.



Yours f a i t h f u l l y ,

   Large crowd milling around - noisy but not menacing.
   No real crowd movement ; nobody appeared to be going in .

   Police announced side gates opened.

   Crowd walked through a t f a s t pace but not running.

   No t i c k e t s asked for or inspected.

   Funnelled through tunnel onto packed te r r a c e .

   My w ife and I managed to get to the pitch                         side        of ab a rr ie r but our two
   children (16 and 14} became separated.
   Game kicked o ff - massive surging of crowd, much                              discomfort but no         sign of
   trouble only obvious tremendous overcrowding.
   Noticed people trying to climb over b a rr ie r to pitch but police lined up on
   pitch and t r i e d to push fans back (verbally and p hy sically).

   Game then stopped by police due to number of fans on pitch.
   I was s t i l l unaware of seriousness of problem except people were trying to
   push back from fro n t and much shouting.

   Fans being hoisted up to te rra c e above.
   Fans then began to disperse more quickly as small door opened onto pitch
   (n o t aware of t h i s at th a t moment although c le a r ly fans were leaving on to
   pitch through t h i s opening).

^ A p p ro x im a te ly now 15.15 pm.
   H orror of incident now emerging - a mass grave was appearing some 2 metres
   in f r o n t .
   People dying in fro n t of us - ashen white and beginning to turn blue.

   Fans giving f i r s t aid - kiss of l i f e , chest thumping.
   P o l i c e and f i r s t a i d e r s now g e t t i n g t o d e a d / i n j u r e d ands t a r t i n g   to
   help/move.
   Elder son located us and was O.K. and then sawyounger sonclinging to side
   r a i l i n g s obviously O.K. but could not get back to usandendedup on pitch
   from righthand area.
People stunned with d i s b e li e f and began to f i l t e r out through entrance.

There i s no doubt in my mind the situ a tio n was completely out of control
from the time of opening the side gates.

Problem caused by too many people in too small a space.

No communications.
Police on pitch watching had no idea what was happening and when they
rea lis e d did not appear to know what to do.
Had fro n t b a rr i e r been quickly taken down (ie wire c u tte rs ) then would have
been no d i s a s t e r .

The solution however was so so simple :
                                                  «>
1        Should NOT have opened gates

2        Should have delayed kick-off
3        Should have keptthe crowd, both outside and inside informed of
         the'reason fo r the delay and there would have been no animosity
         or in jury .
                     - School Teacher
1    Due t o se v ere t r a f f i c hold-ups a t S to c k p o rt in p a r t i c u l a r we
     arrived about th ree -q u arter of an hour l a t e r than we had planned.
     Probably many more people were l a t e for the same reason.

2    We made our way t o Leppings Lane and Gate B, as s t a t e d on the
     tick ets.
3    Two la d s asked i f we had any sp a re t i c k e t s as we approached
     Leppings Lane end i t s e l f . When we tu rn e d th e c o rn e r we were
     co n fro n te d by a large crowd being held back by police on horses.
     By now i t was 2.50 pm.
4    Some of the fans were eager to get in fo r the kick-off and there
     were some challenges to the police but nothing serious - wanting to
     know why we weren't being l e t through.           One policeman said 'You're
     not going anywhere, so t h e r e 's no point in pushing forward' and
     w h i l e a few s t i l l t r i e d to g e t through most of th e crowd was
     standing p a tie n tly back from the horses across the road.

5    About 2.55 pm a policeman said 'Right lads th e y 're opening the side
     gate. You can go through t h e r e '.
6    We went through, but at th a t point the surge from outside was not
     so g re a t. I , f o r instance, was holding our 4 t i c k e t s , expecting to
     give them in before going into the stadium. My elder son to ld me
     t o put them away in case they were snatched and, without being
     j o s t l e d , I had tim e t o stand and put them in my younger s o n 's
     jacket pocket and secure i t .
7    We t h e n e n t e r e d a dark tunnel and i t was while we were going
     through t h e r e t h a t p r e s s u r e from behind, then from a l l s i d e s ,
     sta r te d to build up.
8    I was frig h te n ed but anticipated the crush would ease when we got
      on the t e r r a c e s , but when we got into the fresh a i r , we came up
      against another block of people and the crush was intense - swaying
      in every d ire c tio n .
9    I clung on to my husband, but we were separated from our sons.         I
      f e l l , but was hauled up and we found ourselves with our bodies to a
      b a r r ie r which was behind us.
10   Meanwhile the game kicked o f f, and supporters s t i l l coming in, made
     th e crush even worse.        They could not see what was happening in
     f r o n t - only th a t the match had s ta rte d and they were caught up at
     once in the furore of the game.
11   We j u s t clung on to the b a rrie r behind in desperation. Some people
     began to climb over the 'cage' fence and i t 'looked' as i f they
     were invading the p itc h , but they were only escaping.
                  c o n tin u e d /.. .



12   Then the game was stopped.         The police came to the 'cage' r a i l i n g s
     as they would to suppress a r i o ti n g crowd - in a s tra ig h t lin e
     y e l l i n g to everyone t o g e t back but we could not as b a r r i e r s
     p a r a l l e l to the pitch prevented i t .  Some supporters were dragged
     up to the seating area above, so as to leave more room below in our
     area.
13   Then the police opened the narrow gate through on to the pitch -
     only one gate - 3 ft wide atmost.
14   Gradually the crush in front of us began to th in to reveal many
     dead and dying people - many on top of each other up to about 5 ft
     back from the 'cage' r a i l i n g s and some furtherback j u s t in fro n t of
     us.
15   My elder son found his way back to us but had lo s t               Dur younger
     son, and was panic s tric k e n .
16   My husband was j u s t going f o rw a rd t o se arc h f o r him among th e
     people on the ground, w h e n s p o t t e d him climbing the 'cage'
     fence and y elle d to him to get over on to the p itch.

17   We saw him do so and knew he would be safe.

18   There were many people lying on the te r r a c e s in fro n t of      us - many
     a purplish blue colour and obviously dead or dying.

19   Friends were try in g to revive some people but there was very l i t t l e
     room to s tre tc h people out.
20   We t r i e d t o comfort two lads who had 'come round' without help but
     were injured and very shocked.
21   A f te r what seemed a long while the police came through and began
     checking the people on the ground on the te r r a c e s , but i t was too
     l a t e fo r many.
22   Ambulances s t a r te d to arriv e a ctu ally on the p itc h , by which time
     many of the victims were on the pitch receiving help.

23   We l e f t as soon as we could f i n d        a way o u t , to r e l i e v e th e
     congestion.

General comments
I feel t h i s was an avoidable accident.

1        Allocation of t ic k e ts inadequate
2        Liverpool fans housed in smallest section of stadium
3        Fans could not move across to less cramped te r ra c e s dueto b a rrie rs
          a t r i g h t an gles to p i t c h p re v e n tin g easy a c c e s s . Had we gone
         through the t u r n s t i l e s however, we would not a ll have been
         channelled into th a t central section but more would have gone to
         the less congested areas.
          No organised and audible communication with crowd outside wanting
         t o g e t in to see the kick-off. They were j u s t being yelled at to
          stay back by mounted police.
I asked a policeman i f kick-off had been delayed as i t seemed a sensible
i d e a . He said not as y e t.         One policeman said the large crowd outside was
t h e f a n s ' f a u l t fo r coming l a t e : unavoidable in some cases as explained :
but f a u l t was simply too many people who were i n e f f i c i e n t l y c on tro lled .

Some of the crowd were getting anxious to get in but i f they had been
properly informed of the overcrowding already on the te r r a c e s , the majority
would have waited especially i f kick-off had been delayed, and gone through
t h e t u r n s t i l e s and been channelled into t h e i r allocated areas. I query
whether communication was adequate with police inside and outside the
ground since there was already a bad crush inside before the gate was
opened as was evidenced when we were f i n a l l y allowed in.
As i t was the police crowd control went from f i r s t l y holding everyone back
t o q u i t e suddenly opening th a t large side gate to allow a ll and sundry in.
No t i c k e t s were checked.    Who can blame non-ticket holders fo r going in -
i f any did?        I t was a perfect opportunity. O ff ic ia ls had no. idea of the
actual numbers on the terra ce s - as a r e s u l t .
Equally, i t seemed the police were slow to react to prevent even more
coming through from outside, when the real d is a s te r was under way.


In addition, communication of events in the stadium were poor.                          At one
pont opposing fans were jeering the Liverpool supporters on the pitch -
unaware of the problem - they thought i t was a pitch invasion - there
should be a n a tio n a l/in te rn a tio n a l warning 's i r e n ' when a l i f e threatening
s i t u a t i o n has developed - ordinary public address i s a waste of time - i t
c a n ' t be heard in a l l th e n o i s e , but perhaps would be, i f used in
conjunction with sire n .
Hopefully t h i s would prevent other unnecessary incidents developing out of
f r u s t r a t i o n which demand even more police resources, which are required
elsewhere.

                  (Aged 16)


There was a huge crowd outside the Leppings Lane entrance at 2.55 pm.                       The
p o l i c e had formed a wall of two horses in fron t of the g ates, preventing
the entry of arrivin g fans to the already congested t u r n s t i l e s .                  The
police assured us th a t there was nobody a ctu ally getting into the ground at
t h i s end.        The horses moved apart creating a gap and we were instru cted to
move to a side gate which had been opened to allow fans into the ground.
M yself and t h r e e o t h e r members of my fam ily passed in t h e d i r e c t i o n
i n s t r u c t e d and passed through the gates.          There were no groundsmen around
and a l l f o u r of us passed through without our t i c k e t s being taken.                We
passed through a tunnel which overspilled into the Leppings Lane section
 ' B' segment.           We were packed in like sardines.            I lo s t both my parents
and grim ly held on to my younger brother who was finding i t very d i f f i c u l t
to breathe in the crush.            Nobody watched the game. We were more concerned
about keeping our f e e t firmly fixed on the ground.                    A g i r l was getting
badly crushed and I helped pass her above the heads of fans towards the
narrow gate which had been opened by the p olice.                       By now people were
s t r u g g l i n g to climb over the r a i l i n g s and get onto the p itc h .     The police
were t e l l i n g us to move back but we c o u ld n 't, because people were s t i l l
coming in from behind.             People were f a l l i n g down a ll over the place, many
were trodden on.            People were being passed to the people in the seating
area above and behind and slowly space was forming in front of us.                       By now
my brother had disappeared and I considered searching through the blue
corpses which were piled th ree persons high in fro n t of me.                    I spotted him
on the r a i l i n g , climbing over onto the pitch a f t e r he had climbed out of
se ctio n ' B' into the le s s densely packed area to the rig h t of the goal.
Fans were weeping everywhere and we all comforted each other.                        I found my
parents and escorted them out of the ground via the tunnel through which we
e n te r e d . My brother made his way o ff the pitch and we eventually met him
outside the ground.

                (aged 14)

Outside the ground th ere was a great deal of congestion but nothing s in s te r
as everybody could simply move back onto the road. The police on horses
c r e a t e d a lin e separating those going fo r the t u r n s t i l e s and those coming
late.        People were asking fo r the K.O. to be delayed as they weren't going
t o get in on time.         Suddenly the lin e of mounted police s p l i t and one of
the policemen said "Go to the r i g h t , a gate has been opened".
As we channelled through the gate, th ere wasn't any congestion u n til we
a c t u a l l y got into section ' B' . Once in the section I j u s t couldnd't move
and, as people were s t i l l coming in from behind there was no way back.
With th e constant supply of people I was gradually c a rried towards the
f r o n t of the section and, lu c k ily , to the side where I managed to climb
over the r a i l i n g s .
The s e c t i o n into which I climbed was at l e a s t h a lf empty and, as a r e s u l t ,
people were able to lay the injured down.
F i n a l l y , I climbed over the large r a i l i n g stopping people getting onto the
p i t c h , from where I managed to spot my family s t i l l in the ' B' enclosure,
which was beginning to c le a r , revealing the mass of bodies towards the
fro n t of the enclosure.

               v j
                                                      Telephone

                                                      l 6th April, I 9S 9 .

Dear Sir,

                 Nottingham Forest v Liverpool - lS.^.P^

           Yesterday it was my misfortune to attend the Notts Forest v Liverpool
F.A. Cup Semi-Final in Sheffield and the events I witnessed there, what I have
subsequently read in newspapers, and what I have seen on T.V. has prompted me to
write to you.

            I am not a supporter of either Club but over the last 30 years I must
have attended over 1,000 Football matches in over 50 grounds. I drove to Sheffield
with my 1 3 year old son who had purchased two tickets in Nottingham arriving on the
City side of Hillsborough shortly before l.JOpm. It was a lovely day. We had lunch
on grass by the car before setting out in what was a carnival atmosphere at l.^pm*
I have been to Hillsborough on many occasions before but never have I seen so much
drinking in the streets before the game. Crowds, all Nottingham Forest supporters,
had gathered outside pubs drinking from glasses, cans, or bottles they were
carrying with them. Many empty cans, bottles, and glasses littered the floor. I
suspect the same applied to Liverpool supporters at the other end.

           On arriving at the ground at 2.00pm we went straight inside to stand at
the very back of the Spion Kop - can I say at this stage if I had not got a ticket
I would nave not gone to Sheffield at all. I was suprised at this early time to see
the centre of the terraces at the opposite end of the ground tightly packed with
swaying supporters whist the wings were almost deserted. Even at kick-off time the
wings at the Liverpool end were not full which was most supprising as all tickets
had been sold. We were not aware of the mayhemoutside the ground at kick-off time
which was obviously caused by a) Ticket holders arriving late, and b) Many people
arriving without tickets at all. Could not the kick-off have been delayed or did
no one inside realise what was happening outside? Those on the terraces at 2.00pm
were obviously ticket holders. They were well behaved, patient, and not like those
who arrived at the last minute - worse for drink.

           What happened at 3»0?pra and subsequently is now history but it was
obvious that the Liverpool terraces had suddenly filled to full and overflowing
very quickly.

           Being aware that football supporters from the City of Liverpool have no
regard for authority or the need to purchase tickets in advance it comes as no
suprise that many thousands turned up at the turnstiles without tickets. I suspect
the common purpose was to gain admission for everyone especially as press reports
since the draw was made had made great play on the 'unfairness' to the 'loyal'
Liverpool supporters. Was there no Police intellegence from Liverpool with regard
to numbers travelling without tickets? As yet I have heard no condemnation of the
thousands who intended to gain illegal entry into the ground and my sympathy lies
with the Police commander who was faced with a riot outside the ground or risk a
crush ingide. In retrospect I am sure he/she will agree that it was wrong to open
the gates but I am also sure that had he/she not done so the supporters with and
without tickets would have broken down gates and gained admission.


                                                                  Contd
                                    2




             The truth of the matter is that the hooligan element have won again.
They have escaped criticism and at the same time as killing 100 true Liverpool
supporters who had sufficient foresight to arrive early and properly they have
managed to point an accusing finger at the Police.

             This is not to say that the Police are free from criticisn. No one
seemed to be in charge. Many of those officers who were rushed into the ground, like
me, did not appear to know what was going on or what to do. The least that could
have been expected was swift and truthful loudspeaker annoucements and appeals -
there was   none. Whether the maniacs pushing in at the back would have backedoff we
shall never know but it would have been worth a try.

             Where does this all leave us for    the future? I have heard criesfor
all seater stadiums, and it looks as though identity cards will be introduced.
Neither would have prevented the horrors of yesterday as those who intended to gain
entry would have done so. In fact matters may have been worse.

               I am sorry to be so negative but     I just don't know what to suggest.
I do make    the following recommendations which   may help:-

1. The building of a new and second National Stadium in the north so it and/or
   Wembley can both be used for big matches.

2. The use of more video cameras to monitor crowd movements in streets up to 200
   yards away from grounds.

3.    Perimeter fencing consisting of hugh swinging type gates which when unlocked
     andopened can allow easy access to the pitch (keep the small gates for the
     Police and stewards to enter the terraces).

4. Audible and efficient loudspeaker systems are essential both inside and outside
   all grounds no matter how small.

5. Better medical and first aid facilities are required by law.

6. Ground stewards and Police should be issued with personal radios on a ratio of
   1 radio to two persons so they all can be made aware at an early stage of what
   is required rather than passing messages by word of mouth.

                Thankvou for taking the time to read my letter.

Dear Sirs,

Hillsborough, April 15th 1989

I am writing to record my experiences and observations on the above, from the
point of view of a spectator in the North Stand.


The journey across to Sheffield turned out to be a difficult one.        The traffic
hold-up at the Stockport end of the M63 delayed us for 20/30 minutes, which
might have been longer if I had not taken a diversion to avoid the next section
of the jam.    It was clear that there were a number of cars carrying Liverpool
supporters in the hold-up, which I believe to be a relevant factor in the

subsequent events.


When we got closer to Sheffield we were running behind time, and at just after 2
p.m. were still some 8 miles or so from the city centre, and in a nose-to-tail
traffic queue.     We were lucky in finding a parking space at about 2.20 p.m., and
walked to the Stadium, arriving in Leppings Lane at about 2.40 p.m.        Although we
were behind time, there were still many people behind us, both on the road and

walking to the ground.


I attended exactly the same fixture last season, i.e. Liverpool v. Nottingham
Forest at Hillsborough in the Semi-Final.       On that occasion we were in the West
Stand seated accommodation and queued in an orderly fashion for 4/5 minutes to

go through the turnstiles, having arrived at 2.20 p.m.


I was surprised to find a milling mass of fans outside the ground.        We joined
not a queue,     but quite simply a crowd outside the entrance to the North Stand,
for which we     had tickets.   My party comprised myself, and three lads, one 15 and
two 14, both the latter being small and slightly built.      After 10 minutes it
became clear that the crush was getting worse and there was precious little

progress being made at the turnstiles.       X heard a policemen on foot nearby
shout that he wanted to "get a horse in here" to his colleagues.         I don't know

whether a horse was moved in or not.
                                                            Continued:
I was aware that a number of the fans around me were holding tickets for the
West Stand and apparently had been directed to this particular entrance by the
police.    The crowd was shouting and appealing for the exit gates on our
left-hand side to be opened to give entrance to the ground, and relief from the
crush.    At this point I was firmly convinced that the kick-off would be delayed
and mentioned this to one or two people close to me.
                                                                    i
                                                                    I
Shortly before 3 p.m. when the intensity of the crush had increased and the
crowd was moving around alarmingly, I decided it would be safest to send the two
youngest boys over the heads of the crowd, through the turnstiles and out of
harm's way.     I am very thankful to the Liverpool fans close to me for the help
they gave me in doing this, it was certainly not easy to release the lads from
the crowd.


Just after this the exit gate was opened and the crowd moved through this gate
in a reasonably ordered fashion, our party was re-united within the ground, and
we got to our seats to watch the match.     The rest of the events that day are

well-documented.


I have no wish to set myself up as an instant expert on crowd control, but I do
feel that there are a handful of observations I could make which I hope will be
useful in identifying what went wrong on that occasion and preventing such a

disaster happening again.


1.   The route from the North-West to Sheffield was extremely well-policed in my
     opinion, with officers, cars and motorcycles at every significant
     intersection, plus motorcycles on patrol on the A61 approach road into
     Sheffield.     Wouldn't the police have noted, with their many years of
     experience of staging Semi-Finals at Hillsborough, an early warning that
     the "convoy" was behind time, with the inevitable result of a surge of

     latecomers at the stadium?


2.   The entry arrangements through the turnstiles to the North Stand were
     chaotic.     In contrast to last year, there was virtually no direct police
     supervision of the queues and there was no sign of the queue demarcation
     tapes and barriers.     In addition, there was no attempt to search fans on
     nearing the turnstiles, as there had been previously.


     Added to this there were only 4 turnstiles attempting to deal with the

     crowd.     Can it be that the North Stand at Hillsborough, capable of holding

     (I would guess) 10,000 people is accessed by only 4 turnstiles?


                                                                    Continued:
,3.   I have already commended the Liverpool fans for their co-operation in
      getting my two youngest boys out of the crowd.     I was equally grateful to
      the police who opened the exit gate and so saved u s , in our position, from
      the very real danger of being crushed outside the ground.     This I believe
      to have been a strong probability as a result of the panic that would have
      ensued from the crowd surging forward when it realised the match had
      started.     The opening of that gate into the North Stand was very definitely
      ia sound decision .


 4.   I have been to football matches before, where, because of problems of late
      arrival of fans, the kick-off has been delayed.     The reaction to this has
      never been describable as positive, but is generally tolerated, particularly
      in a situation where there is good crowd segregation.     Why, oh why was this
      action not taken?


      By virtue of the monitoring of the movement of Liverpool fans into
      Sheffield, I believe that the writing was on the wall as early as 2.00 -
      2.15 p.m., and that the police, with all their experience must have seen
      it, and anticipated that surge of late arrivals.


      In the area where we were, it would have made a considerable difference to
      the demeanour of the crowd outside if a policeman with a loud-hailer had
      stood on top of the turnstile wall and told everybody that the kick-off
      would be delayed 20 minutes and that it would not start until everybody was
      in the ground.     As I suggested above, I do not believe that the
      announcement would have brought a bad reaction from the spectators inside.


 5.   One final point, not particularly related to this catastrophe, but
      nevertheless important.     In our seats, Row 39, seat numbers 31-34, we just
      could not hear the public address announcements above the general crowd
      noise.     Only when everybody hushed each other could the messages be heard.
      One day, that factor could be vital, in a different sort of crisis.


 This is a long letter, I hope you have found the contents useful.     Should you
 wish to contact me for any reason, then my address and telephone number are at
 the head of this letter.


 Yours faithfully.

fcp the E d i t o r , Liverpool Echo,

    ..              ^ am writing this letter to you and also the other people
listed below because I was at Hillsborough last Saturday and feel it is my duty
%P_,.**®P®^t what I had seen. I have approached this in an objective way although
^ ^ h a s been difficult after seeing the horrors leading u p t o , during and after
^'"disaster.

       w.In the light of various criticisms by the police and the press I wish
 lyjpoiftt out that Liverpool football fans acted, in the main, in an excellent
manner. I-, like so many other people, have been deeply saddened b y the disaster
and the apparently unfounded allegations that.have followed. I do not consider
myself or the vast majority of football followers at the match as hooligans and
feel strongly enough to air my experiences in court if need be.

Is*%         I would like to express my deepest sympathy to all the bereaved
Relatives and friends. I feel we have all been affected and share in this time
 ^|1.9re3-t sadness. Finally I wish those injured a speedy recovery and hope to
  ee them back at the match soon.


            Thank you for your time,

                                 MY OBSERVATIONS OF THE

                                   HILLSBOROUGH DISASTER

                                      BY



'My friend and I arrived outside the Leppings Lane entrance to the ground at
 1 4 , 4 0 hours. As we approached there were many people trying to gain entrance,
 1 noted that there were 2 policemen on horses (although later from I.V. films
 there were obviously more)who were trying desparately to control the crowd.
 There were other policemen on foot but the numbers seemed woefully inadequate.
 One senior policeman was trying to coordinate his men but wit h little success,

?The crowd was packed very tightly into the confined space from the road to the
"turnstiles. People were climbing the walls of the ground in an attempt to
 escape the crush. I was of the opinion that there was a serious chance of
 fatalities at this point outside the ground. The police presence was not enough
 to push the crowd back onto the road if that is what they were trying to do.
 I couldn't understand why the police hadn't chosen to stop people as they
 approached Leppings Lane and started their control from the road instead of
 attempting to do so at the turnstiles.

    Fearing that the situation could develop into a tragedy my friend and I moved
    away from the crowd and watched from the bridge opposite the ground. We felt
    that we would not get into the ground until 15.30 at the e a r l i e s t . From our
    vantage point we were able to assess the mood of the crowd. They seemed in good
    spirit      although some were unhappy with the aggressive attitude shown by the
    police on h a n d . I did see one or two drunken fans (who were not causing any
    t r o u ble) but I categorically refute any suggestion that there were "hundreds of
    drunken fans" trying to gain admission. Several fans were looking for tickets
    but were not trying to push their way i n .

 After watching the BBC cameraman get his 5 minutes of "glory" and quickly
  disappear we d e cided to see if the crowd had thinned o u t . By this time the
: teams were out on the pit ch as we had heard the cheer i n g . To our surpr ise the
  crowd had thinned out enormously (we did not realise that the gates had been
  opened or by whom). The police now seemed happy to get us into the ground as
: quickly as possi b l e .

  I gave a portion of my ticket to the gatemen (who said he didn't care what bit
. he   g o t ). The lad behind said "I didn't need this then,I" as he waved hi s
i complete      ticket in the a i r . By now the match had started so we wanted tofind a
’        'spot   to   ter. f-o~.. T ’o "-t ?   oo oc' ics   or   stewards   round   ‘ o t ?’*
    w-r.rvi ii.e entrances onto                   lei #.ers, I      nc: :>eo-




i
       though admittedly my main concern was to watch the m a t c h . We wenc to t.c .. » ~~
          followed the -crowd through the tunne 1 which appeared to be the only way
             te t e r r a c e s . I ventured up the steps at the end of the tunne1 which led

         the     terraces that were immediately behind the g o a l .
        One look told me that the numbers in this section were dangerously high and so
        we turned around to try and find another way onto the terraces. People were
        still coming down the tunnel and we had to push our way through. We noticed the
        entrance to the West Stand above the terracing where 2 stewards were standing.
        They told my friend that if we continued right we would find another entrance!
        This we did and once onto the terracing found that there was much empty space'
        around us.  We looked down on the sections behind the goal and could not
        believe the numbers in there. It was obvious that there would be many people
        hurt and we couldn t understand why the police had not moved people to our
        section. By then it was probably too late as I assume that people were being
        killed either as we first entered the ground or minutes after we had turned
        back down the t u n n e l .

^Like most people we thought that the first person onto the pitch was trying to
• cause t r o u b l e . It didn t take long to see that we were wrong. The police
.ghowever|cou1dn't see this and were trying to push anybody that attempted to
  climb over the railings back onto the terraces. When the match was stopped we
  expected the police who came onto the pitch to give immediate assistance. They
  instead concentrated their efforts on standing 2 deep across the half - way
  1ine \ J^}other 9 rouP        police did the same by the goal line.

        It was the fans who had escaped the crush who were helping the others and
        carrying the hurt and' the dead. Some police did help but most continued to
        stand around and watch. We felt helpless and sickened at what we saw but didn't
        try to get onto the pitch as We thought it would only add to the chaos,
        besides I still felt that the police being the professionals would help. Most
        did not. I watched photographers taking photos of people lying hurt or dying
        rather than helping. When we saw two or three bodies we did n't have the heart
        for any football so decided to leave. I estimate the time then to be between
        1545 and 1600 hours.

        I have never felt so upset, frustrated, angered-and sickened   than the... In my
        view the only people who came from this with any credit were   the fans who, on
        the whole, acted in a thoughtful, responsible manner. Again,   for the main part
        the police who showed little or no control inside or outside   the ground, did
        much to contribute to the disaster but little to help.

  One other major contribution to the disaster which should be mentioned is the
    cke^ allocation by the. Football Association. It was thoughtless and ill
3Cconceived to giv£ the Liverpool fans the smaller of the allocations which was
  obvious when looking at the spaces on the terraces at, the opposite end of the
  ground. -

    I have tried to be a’s 'objective as I could in writing -this ~nd wcu:- -
    prepared to stand up in any'court and give my account which as far a; _ - ■
    concerned is honest and accurate,

April 17th, 1989


Dear S i r ,
It was with h e a r t f e l t r e l i e f th a t I saw my law abiding, fanatical Liverpool
supporting, 19 year old son a rriv e home a short time ago.              This was a f t e r an
agonising three or four hours for myself and my wife.              I grieve for those whose
loved ones did not come home.
I, th e r e f o r e , write to complain b i t t e r l y about the organisation and control of t h i s
match;
1.    i t was the wrong venue.
2.    even i f i t was the right venue the t i c k e t allocation was ridiculuous.
3.    my son t e l l s me t h a t the police allowed people into the ground who did not have
     t i c k e t s , in f a c t , one of his f r ie n d s , whose t i c k e t had been stolen in the post
     and hoped to buy one a t the ground, was allowed in a t 2.50 p.m. by the police
     t o , "avoid trouble outside the ground".
4.   why was the gate which was opened or broken down not supervised when within a
     few minutes of the horror sta rin g some 250 police o f f i c e r s were on the pitc h,
     "to prevent fans getting to each other"? Inevitably t h i s meant t h a t Liverpool
     fans were having to care for t h e i r own injured and dead.
5.    my son t e l l s me t h a t people who were drunk were allowed into          the ground     and I
      can only shudder at t h e i r reactions in the panic s i t u a t i o n .
6.    a fireman who was on duty said to my son and his frien d ,              "I don't knowwho's in
      charge here, i t ' s a God awful mess".
The above words were scribbled on Saturday evening, shortly a f t e r my son arrived
home.
I have now had time to r e f l e c t and to stand with my son, his friend and countless
other grieving persons on the Kop. I, t h e re fo re , write with great sadness, much
b itte r n e s s and deep anger and commend to a ll who have anything to do with the
organisation or control of t h i s match, Dr. Ashton's comments on t e le v is io n
concerning r e s p o n sib ility and accountability and also the words of Simon Barnes in
"The Times" t h i s morning. This should not have been allowed to happen.

Yours f a i t h f u l l y .




The Secretary of Sheffield United Football Club,
Hillsborough,
Sheffield.

uetU ox ’                THE HILLSBOROUGH DISASTER
The day was Saturday 15th April, 1989, F.A. Cup Semi Final Day.      I
had never been to a Semi Final before.    I set off with three members
of my family, one was my thirteen year old son.     He thought we were
going to have a great day.    Two of us were Forrest Fans and two were
Liverpool Fans.   Two would come back happy and two would be a little
bit dissappointed. That was far from the truth.

What we encountered we had no idea.    We set off in plenty of time for
Sheffield arriving at 12.30p.m. the match did not start until 3.00p.m.
We had a bite to eat after we had parked about 15 minutes from the
ground.   As we walked towards the ground we were pestered by supporters
asking if we had any spare tickets.      I would not dream of going to
a football match    which was all ticket if I did not have a ticket.

We approached the ground, there was a barrier across one side with
Police patrolling.    We asked the Police which was our entrance, they
pointed about 10 yards beyond but because the barrier was up they would
not let us through, we had to walk all the way round.    Never mind the
exercise will do us good.

We got into the ground and took our seats, it was a magnificent stadium.
The crowd was beginning to build up, our seats were in the South Stand
near the Leppings Lane end, just in line with the by line.           To our
left, high up, was a Police Observation Post.         Three Officers were
situated with short wave radios and TV monitors.    The camaras positioned
around the ground and outside the ground.        All the time monitoring
the crowd behaviour.    At the Leppings Lane end, this section was split
into four in the standing area.      The centre two sections were quite
full at 2.30p.m. with the end two sections very sparse of spectators.
At 2.50p.m. we observed that there was quite a lot of swaying in those
two centre sections but the outer two were filling up very very slowly
indeed.    The game started with all spectators oblivious to what was
happening.    After a short time we noticed one or two Police running
along the touch line to the goal at the Leppins Lane end.    It was obvious
that they thought that there was trouble as spectators were trying
to get out onto the pitch.      The Police at first appeared to try to
deter   them from doing this but then the spectators swung quite
dramatically and started to climb up into the main stand and the
spectators there were trying to pull them free.      They were also trying
to climb over the divisional partitions into the outer two sections.
By this time, in between watching the match and observing the Leppings
Lane end the situation became out of hand and eventually the Police
started to help the spectators over the barrier which was quite high
and difficult to get over.   At this point nobody knew what was happening
or the scale of the problem behind the barriers.     The spectators helped
each other over the barrier onto the pitch and eventually there must
have been about 500 spectators who were on the cinder track behind
the pitch and there was so many in fact they started to go onto the
pitch but tried to keep close to the by line.       At this point in time
a Senior Officer raced across the field trying to catch the eye of
the Referee.    Play was still going on but obviously it was at the far
end of the pitch.    The referee turned and saw the Police Officer, went
towards him, made conversation and the referee, decided to take the
players off the field.    Once the players were off the field, at least
a hundred Police Officers came into the ground from the far side, from
the Spoin Kop. Totally unaware of what was going on they thought clearly,
that there was going to be a riot so they formed a barrier the full
width of the field along the centre line. Still the fans were coming
over the barrier, by this time they had managed to break free one of
the gates.    The spectators started bringing numerous casualties out
onto the green turf and laying them out.     Some of them immediately sat
up, others laid motionless on the ground.

At this point in time it must be noted that it was only the Liverpool
supporters who were actually carrying the spectators and helping them
to get free from the pressure on the Terrace.          The casualties were
laid on the floor and the spectators started on a number of casualties
to try to resuscitate them, obviously they were unconscious.          There
were two young girls near the corner flag, they tried to revive them
for a long long time and eventually they put a coat over their heads.
There was one boy who was as old as my youngest son ; 10, he was brought
right near the touch line, there was a young Police Cadet and a Lady
Police Officer assisting with mouth to mouth resuscitation.      They tried
for about ten minutes without any success.       Spectators in the stand
where I was, and in the terrace below watched helplessly. A big spectator
ran over, said something to the Police Officers and they moved out
of the way, he obviously must have been a First Aider or a Doctor or
somebody    with Medical knowledge.   He tried   frantically for another
five minutes or it seemed that long to me, eventually all the people
crowding round let out a great cheer, he had started to breathe.        All
in the grand stand and in the terraces below started to cheer and applaud,
our jubilance was short lived, within a minute the big fellow was down,
mouth to mouth resuscitation again, the little boy had stopped breathing.
He eventually started breathing again, they turned him into the recovery
position,   four spectators around this boy ran for a stretcher.       They
tried to    pull away a notice board around the perimeter.    Four   Police
Officerswent across,     and at first it looked as if they were      trying
to hinder, but after a few words they started to assist and pulled
this notice board away, it was then taken over to the boy, he was put
on and was transported right across to the far      side.   While this was
going on an ambulance had turned up behind the goal. A number of bodies
were put inside.      It was still not clear at this point in time what
the casualty situation was but it was obvious that there was a number
of fatalities.    Spectators in the front row of the West Stand, started
to dismantle all the notice boards which were beneath them, hand them
down carefully and eventually they found their way onto the pitch.
They were taken to each casualty and then transferred right across
the ground to waiting ambulances that could not really get into the
ground for the situation.

Whilst this was going on the hundred or so Police Officers still on
the centre line, still waiting for trouble, still waiting for a riot,
at this point a number of Nottingham Forrest      fans climbed over the
fence at the Spoint Kop and started to dismantle the sign boards behind
their goal and carry them to where they were needed.     They then joined
with the Liverpool fans in conveying the bodies across to the far side.
There were   only a few Police Officers helping   to carry the stretcher
bound casualties across and help them in reviving the injured spectators.
The control by the Police during this operation was absolutely negative.
No one seemed to be in charge at all, and it was the Liverpool fans
who took the     initiative  in dealing with the emergency situation.
Eventually a full half of the playing area was covered with distraught
Liverpool fans.    The Manager of Liverpool Football Club, Kenny Dalglish
came to the public address system, appealed for calm, there was no
need, they were completely calm, he asked them to move off the field,
those who were not in need of medical attention, they moved to the
side waiting for further instructions.    It is true there were a couple
of incidents, one involving a News Reporter trying to take photographs
of dead bodies.      Distraught and angry fans seized him.     The Police
protected him and separated him by escorting him away.        They should
have taken his camara away, I would have.

Another incident involving some of the fans near the players tunnel,
they congregated round the BBC Camara as you could see from the News
Report, they were not causing problems.   They were voicing their opinion
at the lack of control, why did it happen, who's fault was it, why was
it not averted?     After a very long time when most of the bodies had
been taken across to the waiting amulances and the terraces were nearly
empty it became evident of the horror of the incident.      Steel barriers
capable of withstanding 50 tons pressure were flattened, it was only
then that the injuries became apparent.      As the fans left the ground
the Police in the centre began to disperse slowly.        Behind the goal
all the personal belongings, shoes, boots, coats, scarves were gathered
in one big heap.   We left the ground at about 4.30p.m. passing spectators
in silence.   The Police outside the ground tried to make their prescence
felt   by stopping cars, asking them where they were going, stopping
groups of people, single people, asking them where they were going.
 Still they were     looking for trouble.    There was no trouble, people
were   too upset by the situation to think about causing trouble.       It
was not until I got back to the car and switched the radio on that
I heard the horrific number of fatalities, 74.        That must have been
everybody who was carried across the full length of the field.          As
the reasons for this disaster unfold,       the responsibility of crowd
observation and crowd control lies fairly and squarely with the Police.
 As they were situated in that control tower using the close circuit
monitors and using radios for giving instructions, it was obvious that
opening a gate and letting fans in would result in them getting into
the ground and seeing the game as quickly as possible.     With the centre
two sections of the Leppings Lane end being overfull it would have
been an easy instruction to deploy some of the Police Officers to the
tunnels leading into those two sections and directing the fans into
the end two sections.      Outside the ground at that particular end the
crowd    was building up, two Police Horses appeared to be doing very
little to try to relieve the pressure.    I believe those Police Officers
failed in their duty to ensure the safety of those fans in that situation
outside the Leppings Lane end.        I also feel that the observation
controller, overriding and overseeing every action and activity around
the ground failed to recognise the problem in the centre two sections,
and deal with it accordingly by averting fans into the end two sections.
The horrific irony is that we had a situation that the Police had no
idea how to control.       They are just clearly trained in controlling
riot and violence and they were totally unable to control human tragedy.
By being First   Aid   Trained,   they would have been able to make some
contribution to the situation.    Very few did.

Because this gate was opened, many who did not have tickets, gained
entry and contributed to the problem unintentionally.  I have been
to many football matches in my life and by being all ticket it is far
quicker to gain entry into the ground than it is being paying cash.
We now look at the consequences of having Membership cards.  In a situation
like the 15th April, 1989 entry to the ground would have been much
slower causing terrific build up .outside.     It is easy to say that by
being a member and having a membership card you must try to get to
the ground a little bit earlier.      We did because we travelled a long
way.   Not everybody thinks the same way as we do.      People get delayed
in traffic which contributes to late arrivals.      If this game had been
by Membership Card the same situation could have happened, spectators
outside without Membership cars, waiting to get in, the pressure builds
up, the gates are opened to relieve what is anticipated as a dangerous
situation and fans who have had their cards taken away from them gain
entry and cause great problems.

The Government must realise the tragedy caused at Hillsborough on Saturday
15th april, 1989 is due to interference by Government, Local Authority
and Police, in trying to restrict members of the public as spectators
from moving freely and safely around our grounds.       If the divisional
fences and the perimeter fences were not present today this tragedy
would never have arisen, as the spectators would have merely moved
to one side to avert the pressure. Penning in of spectators is a serious
breach of the Health and Safety at Work Act as far as Safe Access and
Safe Egress is concerned, in an emergency evacuation situation. Football
clubs must be left to manage their own business without interference
from outside bodies unless they request specialist advice and assistence.
It will be interesting to see how the Officer in charge of survelance
and deployment of his force will allay the blame for this tragedy.
95 passionate fans do not know the cause. Thousands do.




Yours faithfully,

Dear Sir,                 THE HILLSBOROUGH DISASTER

of dead bodies.      Distraught and angry fans seized him.     The Police
protected him and separated him by escorting him away.        They should
have taken his camara away, I would have.

Another incident involving some of the fans near the players tunnel,
they congregated round the BBC Camara as you could see from the News
Report, they were not causing problems.    They were voicing their opinion
at the lack of control, why did it happen, who's fault was it, why was
it not averted?     After a very long time when most of the bodies had
been taken across to the waiting amulances and the terraces were nearly
empty it became evident of the horror of the incident.      Steel barriers
capable of withstanding 50 tons pressure were flattened, it was only
then that   the injuries becameapparent.    As the fans left    the ground
the Police in the centre began to disperse slowly.        Behind the goal
all the personal belongings, shoes, boots, coats, scarves were gathered
in one big heap.   We left the ground at about 4.30p.m. passing spectators
in silence.   The Police outside the ground tried to make their prescence
felt by stopping cars, asking them where they were going, stopping
groups of people, single people, asking them where they were going.
 Still they were looking for trouble.       There was no trouble, people
were too upset by the situation to think about causing trouble.         It
was not until I got back to      the carand switched the radio on that
I heard the horrific number of fatalities, 74.        That must have been
everybody   who was carried across the    full length of the field.     As
the reasons for this disaster unfold,        the responsibility of crowd
observation and crowd control lies fairly and squarely with the Police.
 As they were situated in that control tower using the close circuit
monitors and using radios for giving instructions, it was obvious that
opening a gate and letting fans in would result in them getting into
the ground and seeing the game as quickly as possible.     With the centre
two sections of the Leppings Lane end being overfull it would have
been an easy instruction to deploy some of the Police Officers to the
tunnels leading into those two sections and directing the fans into
the end two sections.     Outside the ground at that particular end the
crowd was building up, two Police Horses appeared to be doing very
little to try to relieve the pressure.     I believe those Police Officers
failed in their duty to ensure the safety of those fans in that situation
outside the Leppings Lane end.        I also feel that the observation
controller, overriding and overseeing every action and activity around
the ground failed to recognise the problem in the centre two sections,
and deal with it accordingly by averting fans into the end two sections.
The horrific irony is that we had a situation that the Police had no
idea how to control.      They are just clearly trained in controlling
riot and violence and they were totally unable to control human tragedy.
By being First Aid Trained, they would have been able to make some
contribution to the situation. Very few did.

Because this gate was opened, many who did not have tickets, gained
entry and contributed to the problem unintentionally.  I have been
to many football matches in my life and by being all ticket it is far
quicker to gain entry into the ground than it is being paying cash.
We now look at the consequences of having Membership cards.  In a situation
like the 15th April, 1989 entry to the ground would have been much
slower causing terrific build up outside.      It is easy .to say that by
being a member and having a membership card you must try to get to
the ground a little bit earlier.      We did because we travelled a long
way.   Not everybody thinks the same way as we do.      People get delayed
in traffic which contributes to late arrivals.      If this game had been
by Membership Card the same situation could have happened, spectators
outside without Membership cars, waiting to get in, the pressure builds
up, the gates are opened to relieve what is anticipated as a dangerous
situation and fans who have had their cards taken away from them gain
entry and cause great problems.

The Government must realise the tragedy caused at Hillsborough on Saturday
15th april, 1989 is due to interference by Government, Local Authority
and Police, in trying to restrict members of the public as spectators
from moving freely and safely around our grounds.       If the divisional
fences and the perimeter fences were not present today this tragedy
would never have arisen, as the spectators would have merely moved
to one side to avert the pressure. Penning in of spectators is a serious
breach of the Health and Safety at Work Act as far as Safe Access and
Safe Egress is concerned, in an emergency evacuation situation. Football
clubs must be left to manage their own business without interference
from outside bodies unless they request specialist advice and assistence.
It will be interesting to see how the Officer in charge of survelance
and deployment of his force will allay the blame for this tragedy.
95 passionate fans do not know the cause. Thousands do.

    air,                 THE HILLSBOROUGH DISASTER

The day was Saturday 15th April, 1989, F.A. Cup Semi Final Day.      I
had never been to a Semi Final before.    I set off with three members
of my family, one was my thirteen year old son.     He thought we were
going to have a great day.    Two of us were Forrest Fans and two were
Liverpool Fans.   Two would come back happy and two would be a little
bit dissappointed. That was far from the truth.

What we encountered we had no idea.     We set off in plenty of time for
Sheffield   arriving at 12.30p.m. the match did not start until 3.00p.m.
We had a     bite to eat afterwe had    parked about 15 minutes from the
ground.   As we walked towards the ground we were pestered by supporters
asking if     we had any spare tickets.   I would not dream of going to
a football match which was all ticket if I did not have a ticket.

We approached the ground, there was a barrier across one side with
Police patrolling.    We asked the Police which was our entrance, they
pointed about 10 yards beyond but because the barrier was up they would
not let us through, we had to walk all the way round.    Never mind the
exercise will do us good.

We got into the ground and took our seats, it was a magnificent stadium.
The crowd was beginning to build up, our seats were in the South Stand
near the    Leppings Lane end, just in    line with the by line.     To our
left, high up, was a Police Observation Post.          Three Officers were
situated with short wave radios and TV monitors.     The camaras positioned
around the ground and outside the ground.         All the time monitoring
the crowd behaviour.    At the Leppings Lane end, this section was split
into four in the standing area.       The centre two sections were quite
full at 2.30p.m . with the end two sections very sparse of spectators.
At 2.50p.m. we observed that there was quite a lot of swaying in those
two centre sections but the outer two were filling up very very slowly
indeed.    The game started with all spectators oblivious to what was
happening.    After a short time we noticed one or two Police running
along the touch line to the goal at the Leppins Lane end. It was obvious
that they thought that there was trouble as spectators were trying
to get out onto the pitch.        The Police at first appeared to try to
deter   them from doing this but then the spectators           swung quite
dramatically and started to climb up into the main stand and the
spectators there were trying to pull them free.       They were also trying
to climb over the divisional partitions into the outer two sections.
By this time, in between watching the match and observing the Leppings
Lane end the situation became out of hand and eventually the Police
started to help the spectators over the barrier which was quite high
and difficult to get over.    At this point nobody knew what was happening
or the scale of the problem behind the barriers• The spectators helped
each other over the barrier onto the pitch and eventually there must
have been about 500 spectators who were on the cinder track behind
the pitch and there was so many in fact they started to go onto the
pitch but tried to keep close to the by line.        At this point in time
a Senior Officer raced across the field trying to catch the eye of
the Referee.    Play was still going on but obviously it was at the far
end of the pitch.    The referee turned and saw the Police Officer, went
towards him, made conversation and the referee, decided to take the
players off the field.    Once the players were off the field, at least
a hundred Police Officers came into the ground from the far side, from
the Spoin Kop. Totally unaware of what was going on they thought clearly,
that there was going to be a riot so they formed a barrier the full
width of the field along the centre line. Still the fans were coming
over the barrier, by this time they had managed to break free one of
the gates.    The spectators started bringing numerous casualties out
onto the green turf and laying them out.     Some of them immediately sat
up, others laid motionless on the ground.

At this point in time it must be noted that it was only the Liverpool
supporters who were actually carrying the spectators and helping them
to get free from the pressure on the Terrace.          The casualties were
laid on the floor and the spectators started on a number of casualties
to try to resuscitate them, obviously they were unconscious.          There
were two young girls near the corner flag, they tried to revive them
for a long long time and eventually they put a coat over their heads.
There was one boy who was as old as my youngest son ; 10, he was brought
right near the touch line, there was a young Police Cadet and a Lady
Police Officer assisting with mouth to mouth resuscitation.      They tried
for about ten minutes without any success.       Spectators in the stand
where I was, and in the terrace below watched helplessly. A big spectator
ran over, said something to the Police Officers and they moved out
of the way, he obviously must have been a First Aider or a Doctor or
somebody    with Medical knowledge.      He tried frantically for another
five minutes or it seemed that long to me, eventually all the people
crowding round let out a great cheer, he had started to breathe.        All
in the grand stand and in the terraces below started to cheer and applaud,
our jubilance was short lived, within a minute the big fellow was down,
mouth to mouth resuscitation again, the little boy had stopped breathing.
He eventually started breathing again, they turned him into the recovery
position,   four spectators around this boy ran for a stretcher.       They
tried to    pull away a notice board   around the perimeter. Four    Police
Officers    went across, and at first   it looked as if they were    trying
to hinder, but after a few words they started to assist and pulled
this notice board away,it was then taken over to the boy, he was        put
on and was transported right across to the far side.        While this was
going on an ambulance had turned up behind the goal. A number of bodies
were put inside.      It was still not clear at this point in time what
the casualty situation was but it was obvious that there was a number
of fatalities.    Spectators in the front row of the West Stand, started
to dismantle all the notice boards which were beneath them, hand them
down carefully and eventually they found their way onto the pitch.
They were taken to each casualty and then transferred right across
the ground    to waiting ambulances that could not really get into the
ground for the situation.

Whilst this was going on the hundred or so Police Officersstill on
the centre line, still waiting for trouble, still waiting for a riot,
at this point a number of Nottingham Forrest fans climbed over the
fence at the Spoint Kop and started to dismantle the sign boards behind
their goal and carry them to where they were needed.     They then joined
with the Liverpool fans in conveying the bodies across to the far side.
There were only a few Police Officers helping to carry the stretcher
bound casualties across and help them in reviving the injured spectators.
The control by the Police during this operation was absolutely negative.
No one seemed to be in charge at all, and it was the Liverpool fans
who  took the    initiative   in dealing with the emergency situation.
Eventually a full half of the playing area was covered with distraught
Liverpool fans.    The Manager of Liverpool Football Club, Kenny Dalglish
came to the public address system, appealed for calm, there was no
need, they were completely calm, he asked them to move off the field,
those who were not in need of medical attention, they moved to the
side waiting for further instructions.    It is true there were a couple
of incidents, one involving a News Reporter trying to take photographs
of dead bodies.      Distraught and angry fans seized him.     The Police
protected him and separated him by escorting him away.        They should
have taken his camara away, I would have.

We are a middle aged couple with two teenage daughters.  We were
both in the stand above where all the Liverpool Supporters were
killed.

We left our house at 11.00 a.m. and got into the ground at 2.10 p.m.
At 2.20 p.m. we went into our seats and then walked forward to look
over the balcony at the fans below.   It was obvious to us that there
were too many fans in the area behind the goal and indeed many looked
distressed and many of them were chanting "no more room no more room
"don't let anyone else in here".    Surely the Police must have had
their surveillance cameras focused on that area and surely if we
could see it was overcrowded at 2.20 p.m. they must have been able
to see it.   Why didn't they tell the Stewards not to let anyone
else into that area and to direct people to the two side areas
where there was room?   Why did they allow people to keep coming
into that area in a steady stream from 2.20 p.m. to 2.50 p.m. WHY ?

My husband went to the toilet at 2.40 p.m. and said there were
thousands outside and hs could see a group of about 100 to 200
being allowed to run down the street as fast as they could towards
the crowds that were already there.

Then of course the event which if you wanted to be kind you would call
"gross incompetence and bad management" but if you were being really
truthful and honest you would call wicked, was allowed to happen.
The Police opened a 16 foot gate and let the crowd rush in as if this
was not bad enough, nobody had their ticket checked to see if they
had a correct ticket or in fact any ticket at all, this was at a
match that was supposed to be all ticket, I myself was frisked when
we went in and my bag was searched and my husband was also searched.
Then to make matters even worse the Police and Stewards allowed the
crowd to rush towards the first entrance they saw which was of course
the tunnel leading directly into the already overcrowded area.

Why was the gate opened to let everyone in irrespective of whether
they had a correct ticket or not ?   Why were they allowed to rush
towards the most crowded area of the ground ? Why were they not
directed towards areas with more empty spaces ?

 Now we have heard the Police opened the gate to alleviate pressure outside
 which we just cannot comprehend was a valid reason knowing the
 state of the ground inside.   Why was there so much pressure outside ?
 Why couldn’t the Police control it ? Isn't that what they are there for?
 Why weren't there more Police outside ? Why were 100 to 200 fans allowed
 to run down the road towards the rest of the crowd trying to get in
 to the ground ?   Why did Police on horseback not make the croud queue in
 an orderly fashion as the Police a t Anfield do week in and week out in
 far worse conditions i.e. the alleways to the feaop and the main road
 outside the ground ? Why were the Police outside the ground if not to
 control the fans ?    Why didn't the police inside communicate the position
 to the Police outside ?
Lastly of course there is why were Liverpool allocated less tickets
than Nottingham Forest.    We have twice as many regular supporters as
Nottingham Forest and were given 4,000 or whatever less tickets than
them.   In fact people who got into the ground when the gate was
opened by the Police had tickets which they had bought from Nottingham
Forest fans.    The Police say it was easier to control us and the
traffic^ if we were given the Lickers Lane End.    This has been proved
to be totally untrue as there was no crowd control outside and most of
the people arrived late because of traffic problems, not to mention
Police holding up coaches and checking for alcohol, and being made
to walk tiles from their coaches to the ground.   This has happened
many times to us, most recently at Coventry and prior to that at
Aston Villa when Liverpool played Arsenal in the Littlewoods Cup»
So there is no way giving us fewer tickets can be justified.

We will never forget the scenes we saw and people being dragged out
of the paddock below us and thrown on to the pitch and left to die.
People trying to get out through totally inadequate gates and being
pushed back by the Police at first.   People being carried away on
hoarding by the Fans not ambulance men, policemen or stewards.
Why weren't the stretchers there where were they ? Where were the
ambulances ? Why weren't wire cutters used in the fence more quickly ?
Why didn't the Police react quicker to this terrible situation ?
Why were there no announcements over the loudspeaker made to inform
everyone who didn't know of the problem ?

WHY was this terrible thing allowed to happen ?

liJe will never be able to forget it anyone who was there and especially
those who have lost loved ones and friends until we get some answers
to the above questions.

lile are enclosing an article which we think answers those questions
but we hope and pray that some one can show us some other reason
to keep us sane.

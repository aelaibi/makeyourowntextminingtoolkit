           At 8.00am       (0800) on Saturday 15 AprilN3989            (150489),   I commenced duty

                 Bentley Section for Football duties a t \ h e            Hillsborough Football

           Ground.       I was instructed that I would be performing duties with

           othe>\of f i cers in se r i a l no 32, under the supervision _of_
                           t i ' l 11Q
           Sergeant                    , however Sergeant     was sick on this date and
                                                    A/ 7 t ZJ
           serial 32 was supervised by FS-* 2895 Thomas



           Having been br'if's^fed at the Hillsborough Stadium PC 2103 Frost and

           myself were deploye&^to the Niag ara Rd j unct iojn_ y i th Penistone Rd

           prevenTvqj unnecessary parking of vehicles and supporters vehicles

           from enteringN^he Niagara Sports area.                    We were still   in this

           position when shorfri^ after 3pm               (1500) a call for assistance was heard

           on a radio being carried by a local member of the Special Constabulary.
                                                                            PAGE        2
                                                                            S2245



 At thatN^ime PC F rost and mys el f went   immediately with officers to the

 Leppings Ln       of the football g r ou n d.       On arrival at the ground

 entrance I could see two ambulances      inside t h e ' g a t e s , towards the rear

 of the stand.     There were li>ftr ox 6 people lying on the ground in

 close proximity to these vehi c l e s ^ 4 of these people were being

 atteH4ed by at least two other persons\^Ambulance and Police

 personnel).                                     ^



 At this time there were numerous police officers           in the vicinity.

 Wllis^st we were there, which was only a matter of seconds we were

 instrucbad by a uniform Inspector to form a cordon at the front of the

 gates at theTs^ppir|gs Ln end to prevent other supporters from entering

 the ground and to leave access for emergency vehicles.             Whilst we

 were standing in this position PC Frost and myself were approached by

 a young boy approx 8 years old, who was in tears.             He told me he was

 frightened and asked if we could take him home.             I ascertained that

 his home was somewhere




 At this time supporters were beginning to come away from the ground,

Jf
 with the young boy, PC Frost and myself walked back along Leppings Ln

 where we met three other young boys approx           12 years who were friends

 of the 8 y'fc-ar old and at that time they escorted him back to his home,



 With PC Frost   I r esumechrkiiy on our static point at the Niagara Rd

 end,   supervising tt\e supporters coming away        from the ground.     We

 remained in this positi^ajn until we were stood down appr ox o . 5 Q p m

 (1750) and told to return to Claywheels Ln.

         At 7.00 pm (1900) we were H o o d   down from the detail and returned to

         our own division.

 I was in charge of aerials 61 to 6k (code named. Tango 7 to Tango 10) on mobile transit
 patrols. I remained with Tango Eight all the time on instructions from Supt. Chapman from
 the previous dates briefing.

it was obvious from the radio messages being passed that there was some form of trouble in^the
Lepx^ings Lane aid I decided to take ny serial into the ground.              We then reported to a senior
officer - I think i t was o r i g i n a l l y C/INSP Sumner who told us to remain w i t h other serials
between the Horth Stand and the Kop.             V/e eventually v/ere told to go on the pitcn and form a
cordon across the front of the North Stand. This instruction was given by Supt. Chapman.
As I gave the hand signal to a large contingent of men, 1 was pelted with cpins from the
crowd.    They were obviously very hostile and I believe they felt we the police should have be
been helping with the injured. Eventually 1 told control that I was moving the officers

to avoid further conflict.    Abkut this point, a large number of Liverpool supporters
ran from the Leppings Lane end, shouting and screaming obscenities at the Forest
fans in the Spion Kop end.    Under the command of C/SUpt. Nesbit and later Supt.
Chapman we immediately formed a long cordon across the half way line and prevented the
fans from climbing into the Spion Kop.    A lot of the Liverpool fans on the pitch were
very anti-police and continually came up to the police cordon and shouted obscenities,
blaming the police for what had happened.       I did lead a party of fans with a hoarding
type stretcher to try and assist but I was told by another inspector that there were
sufficient stretchers and everyone was being attended to.     I then returned to my cordon.
As the fans started to leave the Kop end, I was instructed to take about 50 to 100
officers into Penistone Road North where we formed various cordons to prevent aany
fans clashing.    I then resumed patrol in a transit when we received a call that
fighting was occurring in Hillsbro’ Park.
I make the following observations:
1*        Radio communication was not particularly good prior to the match and it
           worsened as the kick off approached.    During the incident the radio was
           even worse and I had difficulty hearing messages, notwithstanding that -
           understandably - everyone was trying to use it at the same time.
2.       As an Inspector I was never told over the air just how serious the incident
          was, or indeed what the nature of it was*
3.       She nature of the incident should have been relayed over the tannoy system
          a lot earlier.   If the fans had been told just how serious it was, there
          might not have been - what seemed to me - a great deal of anti police feeling,
          because they thought my cordon was not doing anything positive. My cordon
          was there to prevent fan s fighting each other.   Had we been able to assure the
          fans that we were needed for rescue and organisation, those two hundred or so
          police officers could have been used to fat better effect.   As it was we
          very concerned that there would be further invasions of the pitch.
k.       The use of messrs Clough and Dalgleish at a mmch earlier stage could have
          had an earlier calming *ffect on the crowds.
5.       Whilst the conduct of the fans who started to utilise makeshift stretchers to
          carry off the dead and injured was very laudable, had they left it to the
          police, the organisation would have been better.

            travelled              from       there            direct        to S h e f f i e l d        Central         Station arriving                     at

            on    th e     train         during            our       journey.              There       were       no    untoward           incidents.

            Upon      our     arrival            at        Sheffield             there          were     large         numbers        of      supporters

            at    th e     station,             both Liverpool                       and Nottingham Forest                         fans.         There        were

            also      a    large         number            of       police       officers             present          who    were       keeping         the

            two      sets      of       fans     apart              and    were       ’h e r d i n g ’ t h e m         onto    different              buses

            which         were      parked           directly              outside          the       station.           The       buses        were     for

            transport              to    th e    ground.

            My    father           declined            a       police        o f f i c e r ’s i n v i t a t i o n        to     get      on     one    o ^ r the

            buses         because         he     considered                  it too         early        to a r r i v e       at H i l l s b o r t

            Instead          of     boarding               a    bus       we w a l k e d        a short         distance           to a       public

            h ou s e ,     I d o n ’t k n o w              the       name       of    the       pub    or      its     location          but     it was

            only about              5 minutes                  walk       from       the    station.              We    went       inside        the     pub

            and      into     the        lounge            bar.           I noticed             about       15 L i v e r p o o l      supporters              in

            the      pub,     mostly            women,              the m e n w e r e           drinking          beer.        We     remained           in the

            pub      until         about        2.30           pm    (1430).

            Upon      leaving            the     public              house       we       walked       back       to    the    railway           station

            and      boarded            one     of     th e         buses.           We    had    to     get      on a N o t t i n g h a m F o r e s t

            bus      because            all     of     the          designated             Liverpool            buses        had    left.         We

to     the    turnstiles          first,           there      was      no     sort       or     orde r ,          it/^Jas        very

1 c o u l d n ’t see        any       police        officers           near      to      the     blocks              of    turnstiles

and     the    Police       t ha t      were       present         in t hi s        area w jr r e              standing          on    the

to     the    turnstiles.               I did       see      two m o u n t e d        officers                 above       the    crowd,

they were         both       positioned             n e xt    to    the       turnstiles                  and     by a m a i n         g a te

which        I believe        is m a i n       gate       "C ' .

We     c o u l d n ’t get     anywhere             near      the    turnstiles                so we            waited       for       a time

in L e p p i n g s    Ln    on    the        opposite         s i de     to    the       ground.                We    thought          that

the     crowds       would       die     down       but      everyone          just        k ep t         pushing          towards             the

turnstiles           and     it d i d n ’t s e e m           to    improve.              It w a s          just       a general                melee

and     there     was      no one        giving         any       directions,              at        no    time       prior       to

gaining        access       to    the        ground       did      I see       a ground               steward             outside.

After        about    10 or       15 m i n u t e s        of w a i t i n g       we      decided               to m a k e    our       way       to

           suffering          injuries                because             of    the    crush.

           Me    and my       father           made         ou r      way       to    the     left       of     the W S t a n d             and     to     some

           stairs,         there        wasn't             any       signs       a n d we       didn't          know w her e             we      were      going

           really.           We    had       tickets             for       s e a t s _______________ T h e r e                   wa s    no      indication

           stairs       at    the       back          of    the       stand          and    upon        reaching            the      to p     it    became

           apparent          that       the       seated             area       of    the     stand         was      packed         with         p e ople,

           mostly       standing.                 There          was       no w a y        that/we          could       have         found         our     seats

           remained          there          r i g ht       at    the       back       of    the      stand.

pens     below           us w h e r e       people          were       standing,                the       centre        two      pens       were

packed          full      of     people       and       I saw          the       crg^d         surge         forward          in t h e s e

centre          p en s    crushing           the       people          at    t^e          front       against           the      fencing,

P e o ple       then      began        to    climb          t h e fencing                 at   the        front       and     upon      reaching

invasion           and      that       people          were       being          crushed             at     the    front,         the       police

were     obviously               not    aware          of    this       initially.

After       a    short         time     people          began          to    pull          supporters              up      into       the    seated

area     of      the      stand        from         the          pens    be l o w .        We s t a y e d         in our         position        at

the     rear.              People       werecontinuing                      to       c l i m b the        fencing          at    the    front          of

the    pens        and      by    now       the    police          began             to    realise           t ha t     there         were

problems           in the         pens,       they          began       to       give          assistance             to    people          climbing

the    fencing            and     to    help       them          over.           A    lot       of    the     people          getting         over

the    fencing            were      being         carried          onto          the       pitch an d             they were            lying       and

sitting          on      the     pi t ch .        I then          realised                that       there        were      going       to    be a

lot    of       injuries          as    a    result          of    the       crush.

It m u s t       have       been       about       ten       or    fifteen                minutes           past      three       (1310)

or    (1515)          that       the        police          realised          that there were                      problems           and     g av e

assistance,               at     this        time      I also           s a w the          small gates             at      the     front       of

terrace          being         opened        by    police,             these          gates          ar e    built         into       the    fence

and    give        access         to    the       pit ch .         People             were       also        begiriing           to    pour

through          these         gates        and    onto          the    pitch.

As    time       went       on    I saw more                a nd more            people          finding           their         way    onto       the

             There        have        been       reports          of L i v e r p o o l         supporters           shouting          abuse        and

             After        having         stood       at      the       back       of    the W S t a n d        we    left       via       the    stairs

             at     the      rear at a b o u t            4.45         pm    (1645)         after      being        asked       to    lea v e      the

             I believe             that       the m a i n         c a u se    for       what        happened        in the          pens    in     the W

Liverpool             fans       in the          designated              a r ea,     and       I feel       that       had     the     match

Kop      en d    because          they          obviously           wanted          the    game       to    continue           but

thought          it     had      been       stopped           because          of    t his      invasion.              Liverpool            fans

was      going        on m u c h       before           the N o t t s         Forest       fans.           The    Forest        f ans

obviously             unaware          of       the     full       circumstances                began       to    taunt        Liverpool

number          of L i v e r p o o l        f an s      to    charge          towards           the P e n n i s t o n e R d         e n d whet*

the      Notts        Forest          fans       were        taunting          them.           This       initial        charge        was

forced          back       b y .P o 3.i c e Q f f i c e r s w ho              then    formed          a    c o r d o n a c r o s s the

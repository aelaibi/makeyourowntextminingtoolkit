RE CARL LEWIS

I refer to your letter of 16 October 1997, in which you state that Lord Justice Stuart-Smith has
asked for a signed copy of Leading Ambulanceman John Kevin Flack's statement of 5 May 1989
and ask that we supply you with a copy.

I have checked with the Hillsborough Scrutiny and should they require a signed copy of
Mr Flack's statement it would be requested directly from the South Yorkshire Police. In any event
on 28 August 1997, we provided you with a copy of the statement made by Mr Flack and will not
be forwarding a duplicate.

I would like to take this opportunity of providing you with an update on you request dated
1 September 1997, for four additional statements in connection with Carl Lewis. PC
declines to authorise release of his statement. Dr D A Lumb has failed to respond to our letter
seeking his authority. Leading Ambulanceman                 left his employment with the South
Yorkshire Metropolitan Ambulance and Paramedic Service on 30 November 1993, and we are
now unable to trace his whereabouts. Finally Ambulanceman                  ]gave permission for
us to release his statement and forwarded a copy on 1 October 1997.

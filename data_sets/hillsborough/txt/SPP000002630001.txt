Dear Ms, Heath,

Thank you for sending me a copy o f the item you did on Hillsborough following the
Jimmy McGovern film.

1 am however a little surprised by the second paragraph at least as far as my
contribution is concerned as I did not assign copyright to Yorkshire Television.


Yours sincerely,



S. L. Popper

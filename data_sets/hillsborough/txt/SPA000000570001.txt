      The d u b s are resisting payment of the full 50% increase for Cup and
      other games, arguing (in our view unreasonably) that the Authority’s
                        °nf Officer

                                    wrote    on this

      unable to recover costs from other parties such as the Football
      Association. The amount at stake is £27,136.
2.2 Future charging policy
      Hembers have been given copies of the recent Home Office Circular. A
      further copy is enclosed for convenience. There are two matters of
      significance:-
 (a)   the Home Office make it clear that charges should be set to
       recover the total costs (or "full economic cost" as it is often
       described). This represents the cost of pay, allowances, pension
       costs and all overheads. It does not represent the actual
       additional (or ’marginal’) cost of policing matches, which would
       ignore fixed costs such as Housing Allowances and take into
       account only those officers who are on premium hours.
 ^              Office recognise that local circumstances will vary, and
       that Authorities are entitled to take into account the financial
       position of Clubs. However, Authorities should set a target of
       achieving full recovery of costs within a 5 year period.
Policing for the 1991/92    season

An estimate of the total cost of policing league matches in 1991/92 has
been prepared. At present prices this amounts to £1.284m excluding
transport and catering costs. Allowing for inflation in 1991/92
(principally the Police pay award in September 1991) and for other
costs, the estimated total for 1991/92 is £1.510m.
It should be noted that these figures are provisional.       They are
dependent on two assumptions:
(a)    the number of matches played by each Club which fall into the
       categories A, B, or C, each of which has different policing
       requirements;                                             s
(b) the deployment for each category of match at each Club (ie there
    will be a separate schedule for each of the five Clubs).
The Chief constable’s Divisional staff are currently in the process of
meeting Clubs to determine both items. Dependent on the conclusions of
these meetings, the total cost could change in either direction. The
estimate is based largely on deployment patterns for the 1990/91
season.                                                      '
For information, Annex B sets out the figures based on 1990/91
categories and deployment, and shows how the figure of £1.284m referred
to above was built up. Both Sheffield Wednesday and Rotherham United
have changed Divisions since 1990/91, so it is probable that the costs
for the former will rise, and the latter will fall.
factors to be taken into account in setting the charges for 1991/92
The charges for 1990/91 represented a substantial real increase for
local Clubs. However, reference to statistics published by the
Football Trust suggests that compared to other similar areas of the
Country, charges levied to 1st and 2nd Division Clubs in South
Yorkshire have traditionally been low. The figures do not suggest the
same position for the lower Divisions.

                  MINUTES OF POLICE AUTHORITY 14 SEPTEMBER 1990



RESOLVED -
1   That the introduction of new deployment patterns based on the
    categorisation of matches be noted.
2   That the charges for the forthcoming season be set so that the total
    amount recovered represents an increase of 50% over last season.
3    That the future charging policy be based in principle on a «ove over a
    five year period to the full recovery of the costs of all officers
    chargeable in accordance with Section 15 of the Police Act 1954.
4   That the Authority records its view that in view of the financial
    situation of some clubs the achievement of the above objective requires
    significant changes and the following recommendations have this in
    view.
5   That the Chief Constable and the Authority discuss with each Club the
    deployment of police under the new categorisation arrangements, it
    being recognised that the numbers deployed at each match are an
    operational decision of the Chief Constable.
6    That the Chief Constable discuss with the football clubs and report to
    the Authority on the feasibility of training and increasing the number
    of ground stewards.
7    That the Local Authority Associations be urged to discuss with ACPO and
    the FA the arrangements nationally for providing police services within
    football grounds and for charging for these services.

    Dear Sir

    HOME OFFICE CIRCULAR NO 36/1991

    CHARGES FOR POLICING FOOTBALL HATCHES


    1.  Lord Justice Taylor's report on his inquiry                into    the
    Hillsborough stadium disaster recommended that:

              •'Police Authorities should review the charges they make to
              clubs for the costs of policing inside grounds so as to
              ensure that realistic charges are made.     The Home Office
              should take steps to ensure consistency of practice/ subject
              to local discretion and the need to have regard to local
              circumstances." (Recommendation 53)

    2.  The reasoning behind this          recommendation    was   given    in
    paragraph 210 of the report:

             "The temptation to the clubs to leave it all to the police
             is stronger if they are not required to make a realistic
             payment for police services. No charge is made for officers
             outside the ground since maintaining law and order in the
             streets is a normal public function of the police. At the
             present time, the practice as to recovering costs of
             policing inside the grounds from clubs varies greatly from
             place to place, different formulae being used.      In some
             areas, the charge made is the actual cost of the officers
             attending in the ground. At others, it is made on a sliding
             scale, dependent on whether the match is category A (high
             risk), B or C. At others, it is dependent on the size of
             the crowd attending.   At some, it appears to be entirely
             arbitrary and at one ground it is said to be nil.     In mv
             view a more consistent and businesslike approach should be
             made to such charges.      If clubs were to find it more
             economical to recruit efficient stewards than to delegate
     duties to the police, there could be a significant reduction
     in the number of police deployed at football grounds, to the
     benefit of the community at large".

The statutory position
3.   Section 15(1) of the Police Act 1964 provides that "the
chief officer of police of any police force may provide, at the
request of any person, special police services at any premises
or in any locality in the police area for which the force is
maintained, subject to the payment to the police *ut5°ri*J
charges on such scales as may be determined by that authority .
It has always been accepted that the presence of police officers
within football grounds falls within this provision.

4.   Safety certificates are required for stadia designated by
the Secretary of State under section 1(1) of the Safety of Sports
Grounds Act 1975.    They are issued by local authorities ana
contain such rules and conditions as the local authority consider
necessary or expedient to secure reasonable safety at the ground.
Where certificates require the holder to arrange for the
attendance of an adequate number of police officers within the
ground, the extent of the provision of police services must,
under section 2 of the 1975 Act as amended, be reserved for the
determination of the chief officer of police of the force in
question.

Extent of charges under section 15
5.    It has been the view of successive Home Secretaries since
1968 that the costs of special services should be paid in full
b y those using the service and that no part of these costs should
be allowed to add to the general level of police expenditure.
Charges should be reviewed and adjusted as necessary - at least
annually.    The aim in principle should be to recover the full
cost of those police officers who are deployed at football
matches on the private property of the football club (and where
officers are posted outside the ground for part of their tour of
duty and inside it for the remainder, the full cost of the time
 spent inside should similarly be recovered). 'Full costs' means
the total cost of a police officer including pay, overtime,
 national insurance, notional pension charges, rent allowance,
 compensatory grant, uniform, administrative costs, overheads such
 as costs of travel to and from the ground and so on.             m
 calculating charges, police authorities a r e recommended to follow
 the methodology set out by the Audit Commission in their report
 •Taking Care of the Coppers' (November 1990# sxtract at Annex A ) .

charging and deployment policies

 6.   If the full cost is to be recovered, there must be a direct
 link between deployment and charges: the more officers the force
 finds it necessary to deploy for duty on the club s private
 property, the more the club should have to pay. Under present
 charging policies this is not always the case.

 7.   One reason for this may be that some forces charge only for
 the number of officers mentioned in an agreement made with tne
                                                                          i
E.R.
       Discretion to Phase in full cost charging

       12. The Home Secretary hopes therefore that all police
       authorities will introduce arrangements for full recovery of
       costs incurred under section 15; he recognises that many
       authorities have already done this.    But where a club is not
       being charged on this basis and would have serious difficulty in
       meeting immediately the full costs of policing - particularly in
       view of the expenditure needed to         implement the other
       recommendations of the Taylor report - the Home Secretary would
       have no objection if a police authority used its discretion to
       phase in full charges over a period. This should not, however,
       exceed five years.
       13. Although this circular is directed at football as a response
       to the Taylor report, the same principles apply to other events
       and police authorities are recommended to use the same approach
       for special police services provided under section 15 for other
       commercial events.
       14. An additional copy of this circular is enclosed for the
       Treasurer.

club - even where the chief officer of police considers it
necessary, because of the nature of the match or the reputation
of visiting supporters, to deploy inside the ground more officers
than such an agreement provides for.     This practice should be
reviewed and any agreements should specifically provide for
special circumstances calling for the deployment of more officers
than usual.

8.   Other forces determine charges on the basis of a fixed
formula.  Where the same formula is used for both charging and
deployment, the economic cost may be recovered.    But where the
charging formula bears no relation to deployment (e.g. because
deployment is based on the chief officer's assessment of the need
whereas charges are based on 2 constables - with supervising
officers pro rata - per 1000 of actual attendance), charges are
likely to fall some way short of recovering the full economic
costs.

9.   Police and clubs should have full discussions on deployment
to ensure that the police can take into account any information
the club can provide which might help determine the deployment
operationally necessary; as far as practicable clubs should have
a good idea of the likely costs involved.

Local considerations

10. As Lord Justice Taylor acknowledged,      local circumstances
cannot be ignored. In particular -

     a.    The nature and location of the ground and the standard
          of   physical   aids  to   crowd   control  are major
          considerations in determining the number of officers
          to be deployed inside the ground. Facilities are often
          poorest at the grounds of clubs who are least able to
          pay the full economic cost of policing.

     b.      The financial plight of many clubs cannot be lightly
             dismissed.  Asking clubs to pay unrealistically high
             charges for policing could lead to problems with
             recovering debt and even to bankruptcy.

Stewardinq

11. There are, however, steps which the poorer clubs could take
to help themselves.    In particular, more, and better trained,
stewards would help to reduce the policing requirement. Manning
gates, directing spectators to the correct areas, keeping
gangways clear and monitoring the density of packing in pens and
enclosures are all mentioned by Lord Justice Taylor as examples
of duties which could be carried out by suitable ■, properly
trained stewards. The Association of Chief Police Officers are
willing to provide advice on the training of stewards and the
Home Secretary hopes that the standards of stewarding can be
raised co-operatively so as to reduce the burden on forces.

HAKE:       Leading Ambulanceman

VEHICLE:     R608

SHIFT:      1400 - 2200 hours


DATE AND TIME OF INTERVIEW:                18th April 1989 @ 1230 - 1420 hours




I received the call at 1515 hours from Superintendent R Clarke who told me
to   proceed       to     Hillsborough        Football         Ground,     Sheffield,        query     major
incident.        We set off and                             ~|drove.     When we switched to ERC we
immediately        realised      we    had       a    communications       problem,     we     maintained
reasonable communication on Sheffield Parkway.                         One problem could have been
the amount of air traffic at the time we were trying to transmit.                                    When we
established contact on Parkway, we told Control where we were and that we
were heading for Hillsborough.


Later,     towards       the   end    of   the       Parkway   a   message    from    Control      for     all
vehicles to proceed to the Leppings Lane end of the Ground was received.
We   proceeded      on    Middlewood        Road      and   entered      Leppings    Lane,    we     had    no
traffic obstruction on the approach at all.


We arrived at Leppings Lane and were directed by a Senior Police Officer to
proceed     to    other    Ambulances        parked      in Leppings      Lane.      As we     approached
behind approximately            three Ambulances which were parked up,                   I noticed          to
our left at least 36 casualties in various conditions, ie, conscious, semi­
conscious,       unconscious^ everything               appeared    to be     going well,       Ambulances
were being loaded with patients.                      As the Ambulances were loaded they were
leaving the scene in the same direction.



                                                                                                /continued

Once we had established a parking area for our vehicle there appeared to be
a lot more patients coming from the area of Gate 'C'.                                  I was the attendant
and was already carrying with me a resuscitator and portable radio.                                        I told
Ambulanceman                   that whatever he did he must stay with the vehicle in
the driving       seat   and       not    to       open    his   doors.     At    that moment            a Police
Officer possibly a Sergeant came up to our Ambulance and pointed to where a
casualty was       laid.       I         told Ambulanceman                  H to follow             the line    of
Ambulances until he gotto the one in front.


I left the vehicle and               went with            the Police Officer to thepatient,                    who
apparently was not breathing, he was a young male of approximately 16 - 17
years.      I    glanced    around           the    immediate       area   and    could       see   no    further
casualties laid about.               I attempted            to resuscitate the patient by Oxygen
therapy, which was forceably administered by the resuscitation unit.                                           The
second injection of Oxygen resulted in a gasp and the patient started to
breathe.        I shouted      to        the Police         Sergeant who had directed me to                    this
patient,    to go    to my Ambulance and                    fetch my colleague with a stretcher.
When he arrived back we                  immediately        loaded the patient onto our cot and
then proceeded to our vehicle and loaded him on.


Once we had loaded this patient, I was conscious of someone shouting at me,
whom I recognised a            s         a      n         off-duty Ambulanceman from Barnsley.                    I
continued       to maintain our              patient’s breathing and at                that    time was made
aware by someone,          of a further patient                    in severe distress          immediately to
the rear and side of our vehicle.                         I told                 and                     to bring
the patient onto my vehicle, and told                                      to stay with me and attend
to that patient, whilst              I administered to my original patient who was in
need of constant attention.




                                                                                                     /continued

I then told                         to close the rear doors and proceed in the direction
of     the     traffic      flow    to    the     Northern      General     Hospital          unless    indicated
otherwise.             As   we   arrived     at    the       Northern    General,          both     patients    were
breathing for themselves and their conditions were stable.


Immediately after discharging our patients,                             I drove back to the scene and
t     o    l   d   t    o     stay with us, and for him and                                    to have the rear
of the vehicle made ready for our next patients.                                     Whilst at the Northern
General a motor cyclist escorted us back to the scene.                                      Whilst returning to
the       scene    I    contacted        Control       and    told   them       of    our    position     and    was
instructed to return to Leppings Lane and contact the Incident Officer.                                           On
our approach a number of vehicles were parked in various positions and I
then      assumed      attendant duties            after parking my vehicle                   and    instructed
               as previously mentioned.


From my position at the rear                      of all the              parked vehicles it appeared that
there was some problem at the                     front of the line                   asno vehicles were moving
off.       I proceeded on foot with my handset towards a Leading Ambulanceman
who I identified as                J Flack      from Parkway         Station.         I asked him what was
going on up front and who the Incident Officer was.                                    He told me there were
more casualties and it was chaotic.                          The reason for this statement was the
vast number of walking casualties, which were difficult to assess due to
being mostly shocked.                    I estimated         the number at           200    to 300 people.         I
noticed        that     the      casualties       in    situ,    where      I        previously      noticed     the
unconscious casualties               on our        first pickup,         were now all             in a conscious
state.



                                                                                                       /continued

I then told Leading Ambulanceman J Flack that I would take charge of the
Incident until relieved by a Senior Officer.                                I then returned to my vehicle
informed _______________ |to remain where he was and instructed                                                to
be his      attendant and to follow the flow of vehicles as it proceeded.                                       I
went directly to the front of the line to ascertain what the problem was
causing the congestion.


I found that an Ambulance had been abandoned at the front of all the other
vehicles.         I found the rear doors open in the vehicle, the resuscitator was
still      in    situ     and    a    portable          radio    was   laid    on    a   stretcher.      In   the
attendants         seat    was       an    Ambulance       observer         travelling     with   this   vehicle
which was from Derbyshire.                        I asked the observer where the crew had gone
and she replied that they had gone into the ground.                                        I told her to stay
where she was as she appeared to be upset.                                  I told her we would be using
the vehicle to accommodate the walking wounded.


I   then    turned        to    direct      the    Ambulance        that     had been      obstructed    by   the
vehicle         away    from    the       scene    to    hospital      as    they were       fully   loaded   and
directed each vehicle to an alternative hospital.                                   I then returned down the
line and met up with ACMAO D Jones.                             He asked if my handset was ok, I told
him it was and we exchanged radios.                         I told him what was happening and what
I had done.            He instructed me to carry on whilst he went to Leppings Lane
and called control to inform vehicles to attend at the Gymnasium.


I returned back to supervise                       the    loading of patients onto vehicles.                   At
this time only one Ambulance remained that was the Derbyshire Ambulance.                                        I
loaded several patients onto this vehicle and I was assisted by a Nursing
Sister to administer oxygen and give general reassurance to the patients.
The     vehicle         attendant           then        returned,      he     was     an    extended     trained
ambulanceman who had obviously been employing his skills inside the ground.
I asked where the driver was and he replied that he did not know.



                                                                                                      /continued

At that point my own vehicle returned and I told                            to attend on the
Derbyshire vehicle and told the Derbyshire attendant to drive to the Royal
Hallamshire    Hospital.       This    vehicle    leaving    the   scene   cleared    Leppings
Lane.


I then returned to attendant duty on my own vehicle and was informed by
          that we were now to proceed to the Gymnasium on Penistone Road.
Whilst on Penistone Road we were re-directed to the Bus Depot on Herries
Road by a Senior Ambulance Officer.


We   liaised with    the other vehicles          at   the Depot and     stayed    there under
Station    Officer     Eason’s        instructions,      until     we      received     further
instructions    to   proceed   to     the   Gymnasium.      On arrival     at   the   Gymnasium
briefed by Mr    Jones as      to what was       to happen next,     we were     subsequently
released from the scene and told to contact Control and return to our own
area or Station.

              Dear Mr Wright

              In his statement to the House of Commons on 17 April about the
              Hillsborough Stadium disaster the Home Secretary said that he had
              asked for factual reports from the Police and other services, the
              local authority and the Football Association.  A copy of the page
              from Hansard which records the Home Secretary's statement is
              attached.

              We have           been in touch with you by telephone to request that a
              factual           report be provided to the Home Secretary and I am now
              writing           to formally confirm this request.  It would be helpful to
              receive           your report by 28 April.

              You are aware that the Home secretary has sought a factual repent
              of the part which your service played in the events of the dayt
              he does not ask that you make in the factual report judgments
              about the issues which arise from the disas^—

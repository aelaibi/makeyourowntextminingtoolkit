1^______ Purpose of Meeting

In view of the F . A . Cup Sem i-Final at Hillsborough on 12th April and following recent
v is its by the discip lin es represented on the Working P arty, the Chief Executive of the
South Yorkshire County Council had raised with the Club by letter dated 31st March various
m atters which apparently were s till outstanding.

A letter of reply dated 3rd April had b e e n received from the Club, as well as le tte r s dated
4th and 8th A pril from the Club's Consultants, M essrs. Eastwood and P a rtn ers, giving
details of the present position.

2.______Inspection of Ground

The Working Party inspected the ground in company with the Club's representatives.

 (i)     Training of Safety Stewards

         The Club had felt there was little point in pursuing the training of the Safety
         Stewards until the fire warning system had been completely installed, but with
         agreem ent the County Fire Service had instructed some stewards yesterday.
         A schedule specifying the duties and responsibilities was handed to the Club's
         rep resen tatives.

 (ii)    Exit Signs

          The Club's representatives felt that the exit signs generally had been sited where
          required and were of adequate size and/or illuminated.

          It was agreed that there were a number which could be more advantageously sited
          and/or illuminated, and some which might be more effective with larger lettering

                                                          1.
and/or direction arrow s. The County F ire Service undertook to lia is e with
M essrs. Eastwood and Partners.

Emergency Lighting in the South Stand

As was evident, com plete re-w irin g of the South Stand with separate circu its had
already com m enced, and the County Fire Service undertook to let M essrs. Eastwood
and Partners know their detailed requirem ents.

Fire Warning System

The Fire Warning System had been installed , except for the trickle charger and
battery equipment. These item s had been subject to delivery problem s, but the
sy ste m should be com plete by the end of the month.

It was agreed that as regards the F . A . Cup Sem i-F inal, the P olice Communications
base which would be at the ground would also be used for Fire Service purposes if
n ecessa ry .

Sealing of Fire R esistin g Fram es

The sealing of the fire resistin g door fram es against the supporting w alls had generally
been carried out, but there were a sm all number which were now showing signs of
sm all gaps.

Fire Retardent Paint

The Club pointed out that "Nullifire" fire retardent paint had been specified on the
partitions within the South Stand but, as the Contractors were on holiday until
14th A pril, it was .not possible to say with certainty at this time whether it had actually
been used.

Wired Glass

The Club pointed out that to the best of their knowledge wired g la ss had been used
wherever required by the County Fire Service.

The County Fire Service and the P olice were generally satisfied that the sm all panes
of g la s s in the upper half of the wooden partitions within the South Stand would not in
normal circum stances be regarded as a fire and/or safety hazard. The Club agreed in
the longer term to consider the fitting of wired g la ss and, in the short term , to
consider fitting wooden battons a s an interim m easure.

Sharp Edges to Steelwork on South-West Stand

Whilst there were a number of sharp corn ers on the supports, these were at a height
of at le a st seven feet. However, the Club undertook to round them off.

P erim eter Fencing on the Spion Kop

The Club pointed out that this had been tested where feasible and the resu lts forwarded
to the Chief Executive in January. A copy had been passed to the Building Authority on
30th January.
(X)    P ossib le Step Obstruction on Upper Exit Area on Spion Kop

       Whilst it was agreed that’the erection of the b arriers at the Upper Exit Area had left
       a sm all adjacent area of approximately one foot wide by four foot long at a lower level
       than the rem ainder of the e x it, it was felt that its position coupled with the crowd
       flow at that point meant that it did not unduly create an hazard. However, the Club
       undertook to give attention to it in the longer term .

(xi)   Mesh Fencing under North Stand

       In view of the normal crowd flow rates on the public side of the m esh fencing and the
       fact that there was no public a c c e s s to its rea r, it was felt that the tim ber framed
       m esh fencing under the North Stand providing security to storage areas was acceptable.

I ._____ Purpose of Meeting

The original Intention of the v isit had been to check that the outstanding m atters
referred to in the Note of the m eeting held on 12th November had been completed
or were In the course of completion p rior to the anticipated issu e of the Certificate
by the County Council this week.

2._____ Minor M atters

An Inspection of the ground showed that a number of minor m atters still required
attention, but the Club undertook to ensure that these were attended to In the tb xt ’
few days.

3!._____Major Matters

A.     E m ergency Lighting - South Stand

The m eetings which had taken place between the County Fire Service and M essrs.
Eastwood and Partners since 12th November on the South Stand Em ergency Lighting
had produced agreem ent on an interim arrangem eit which would be regarded as
acceptable for the duration of the existin g battery lif e . Further m odifications at
that tim e would rem edy the shortcom ings of the existing installation. D etails w ere
contained in the letter dated 12th Decem ber which M e ssr s. Eastwood and P a rtn ers
had addressed to the F ire Service.
     ✓
B.       South Stand Construction

The Building Authority expressed concern a s to what they saw a s a la ck of structural
Integrity in the South Stand. In their opinion, corrosion was contributing to the
p ro g ressiv e deterioration o f the Stand which, It was felt, could only be properly
determined by a full structural survey. The report forwarded by M e s s r s . Eastwood
and Partners In the la s t week was not considered to be sufficiently com prehensive
to provide ths required information, and the b asis o f calculation used could not be
agreed as appropriate. Whilst It was agreed that there had not been a sp ecific
written request for such a full structural survey of the South Stand, the Building
Authority felt that it had been inherent in the detailed d iscu ssion s which had taken
p lace that such a report would be forthcoming. The Building Authority were
concerned at the p ossib ility that the requirem ents of the Building Regulations and
the Code o f P ractice Safety Factors could not be met; In particular the Structural
stability o f the South Stand in conditions of gale force winds and heavy snowfall
was mentioned.

For the Club, Dr. Eastwood agreed that the Stand would obviously not be built to the
sam e specification or the same construction standards nowadays, but pointed out
that, for In sta ice, none o f the buildings In Sheffield built before 1970 could m eet
the la test wind p ressu re requirem ents. Even the Building B esea rch Station was n
evidently thinking In term s that these requirem ents w ere u n reallstlcally high. In
his professional opinion, the Stand was structurally safe and able In practice to m eet
the loadings demanded. In any ca se, the conditions which had been described as
being p ossib ly dangerous would mean In practice that a match could not be played
and consequently no spectators would be present.

Experience of the corrosion o f Indoors ste e l in the Sheffield area showed this to be
m inim al, and the Stand was regularly te st loaded by sp ectators. Structures such
as this would show obvious external sig n s, such a s cracks, w ell before there was
any p o ssib ility o f collapse, and would be readily apparent on even a superficial
visual Inspection. Even though he did not consider It esse n tia l, pla ting of the
front steel columns had been carried out as a com prom ise to try and m eet the
Building Authority’s concern. He agreed there might well be a continuing
maintenance problem with the stand, but this was a different m atter to saying there
was a structural problem . B eference was made to the Guide's advice that when
a s se ss in g whether existing situations provided adequately for the safety o f spectators,
the criterion to be used is that of a reasonable degree of safety. In Dr. Eastwood's
view, It would be unreasonable and un n ecessary to In sist bn a full structural survey
of the South Stand or to delay the Issue of the C ertificate. It was his professional
opinion (which he was m ost jealous of and would not put in jeopardy) that the South
Stand was structurally safe and that the b asis of the calculations provided was •
appropriate. He was prepared to advise the Club to u se the appeal procedure open
to them should this be n e c essa ry .
IT WAS AGREED that:

(a)    a s there was no obvious deterioration In the South Stand structure of such
       a nature as to be of imm ediate concern, no objection would be raised to the
       continuance o f the derby gam e with Sheffield United on Boxing Day morning
       provided that no extrem e weather conditions occurred In the Intervening
       period, and

(b)     a further meeting should be held as a m atter of urgency between the Building
        Authority and Dr. W. Eastwood to d iscu ss the structural Integrity of the
       South Stand and the appropriateness of the calculations used (Mr. D. Vaughan
       to be p resen t a t Dr. Eastwood's request).

NOTE As the d iscu ssion s on the South Stand Construction hinged on structural
     theories and p ra ctices, the F ire Service and P olice representatives felt
     there w as little they could contribute and left the m eeting p rior to its
     term ination.

         (b) replace a safety certificate.

     (2) A safety certificate may be amended or
         replaced either on the application of the
         holder or without such an application.

       now made a commencement order under section 50(2) of the Fire
       Safety and Safety of Places of Sport Act 1987 (the 1987 Act)
       bringing in Part II of the 1987 Act with effect from 1 January
       1988.
       2.   This circular, together with Annex A, introduces the
       provisions of Part II of the 1987 Act and gives advice on the
       effects and operation of them. Advice on those provisions of
       Part I of the 1987 Act (fire safety) which are to be brought into
       force by the first commencement order is the subject of Fire
       Precautions Act Circular, 14/1987.
                                        *

        Implementation of Part II (Safety of Sports Grounds)

        3.   Part II of the 1987 Act, consisting of sections 19 - 25,
        amends the Safety of Sports Grounds Act 1975 (the 1975 Act) in
        line with the Government's proposals contained in the
        Consultative Document published in June 1986 in response to the
        safety recommendations of the Popplewell Inquiry set up following
        the fire tragedy at Valley Parade on 11 May 1985. The*. main
        changes effected by Part II are as follows

        Section 19:- removes the distinction between sports "ground" and
        sports "stadium" with consequential modifications to section 2(2)
        of the 1975 Act dealing with the contents of safety certificates.


        Section 20:- empowers the Secretary of State to vary the
        designation threshold of 10,000 under section 1 of the 1975 Act.
 Section 21:- precludes conditions in safety certificates
 relating to police presence unless the extent of the presence is
 reserved for the Chief Officer of Police.


 Section 22:-   directs appeals under section 5 of the 1975 Act to
 the courts.

 Sections 23 and 24:- replaces the existing emergency procedure
 under section 10 by introducing prohibition notices in the case
 of serious risks to spectators; and provision to appeal against
 them.

 Section 25:- places a duty on local authorities to enforce the
 1975 Act and to arrange for annual inspections of designated
 sports grounds in accordance with guidance from the Secretary of
 State.

 4.   Annexes A and B to Home Office circular No 7/1986 which
 gives advice on the 1975 Act should be noted as necessary and
 cross referenced to this circular. Particular attention is drawn
 to the latest guidance on the new procedure for the issue of
 prohibition notices to deal with serious risks to spectators.
 Local authorities are asked to copy all such notices to the Home
 Office for information until further notice. To assist local
 authorities to draw up a prohibition notice a suggested format is
 reproduced at Annex B to this circular.

 Safety of Sports Grounds Regulations 1987

 5.   A copy of the revised regulations is also enclosed with this
 circular. The regulations reflect the changes brought about by
 sections 22 and 24 of the 1987 Act and lay down time limits for
 appeals. Provisions on procedures for applications for safety
 certificates, their issue, amendment, transfer and replacement
 are incorporated in the regulations which also authorise the
 determination of fees to be charged in respect of applications
 for the issue, amendment, transfer and replacement of safety
 certificates.

 Transitional

 6.   Under the provisions of Schedule 5 of the 1987 Act any
 existing court order made under section 10 of the 1975 Act
 remains in force. Similarly any appeal lodged prior to 1 January
 1988 and still extant on that date will remain subject to the
 appeal procedures of the Safety of Sportn Grounds Regulations
 1976 (SI 1976/1263).


Resource and manpower implications

 7.    The contents of this circular do not result in any cost or
•manpower implications other than those arising from the
 inspections to be carried out on designated sports grounds under
 section 10B(1) as introduced by section 25 of the 1987 Act.
 Circulation of Statutory Guidance under section 10B(2) of the
 1975 Act on these inspections together with any supplementary
advice is being done separately and will cover, as necessary, any
resource implications arising therefrom.


Supplementary
8.   The information and advice in this circular and in Annex A
on the 1987 Act are given in good faith but it should be
understood that ultimately only the courts can rule
authoritatively on points of law.

9.   Any enquiries about the contents of this circular should be
directed to Mr D Macnamara 01-213 7338.

                                         Yours faithfully

FIRE SAFETY AND SAFETY OF PLACES OF SPORT ACT 1987

Advice note by the Hone Office on Part II of The Fire Safety and
Safety of Places of Sport Act 1987 (The 1987 Act) amending The
Safety of Sports Ground Act 1975 (The 1975 Act)

Introduction

1.   The general background to the 1975 Act together with a
summary of local authority powers and functions under that Act,
and procedures for the issue of safety certificates is set out in
Annexes A - D of Home Office Circular 7/1986 issued 7 February
1986 (taken from earlier Home Office circulars 150/1975, 130/1976
and 187/1976). This guidance should therefore be read in
conjunction with Annexes A - D of Home Office Circular 7/1986
which will need to be cross-referenced.

2.   The popplewell Inquiry set up after the fire tragedy at
Valley Parade concluded that the 1975 Act had worked
satisfactorily at designated grounds but recommended changes to
improve its operation. The Government's response was contained
in a consultative document published in June 1986. Parts II and
III of the 1987 Act implement these proposals and introduction of
Part II as from 1 January 1988 is the first phase of this
implementation.

3.   The main mechanism for securing safety at sports grounds
remains the safety certificate.  Guidance on safety standards is
contained in the Guide to Safety at Sports Grounds (The Green
Guide) revised in October 1986. Local authorities are reminded
of the advice contained in paragraph 5 of Annex B to Home Office
Circular 7/1986 highlighting the need to maintain flexibility in
order to take account of the different circumstances at
individual grounds.

SUBSTANCE OF THE AMENDMENTS EFFECTED BY PART II OF THE 1987 ACT
Section 19: Application of the 1975 Act to all sports grounds

4.   Section 19, together with the textual amendments of Schedule
2 to the 1987 Act removes the distinction in the 1975 Act between
a sports "ground" and a sports "stadium". As amended the
provisions of the 1975 Act apply to all sports grounds as defined
in section 17(1) of that Act. The Secretary of State may thus
designate any category of sports groind witheut first having to
make an order extending the provisions of the Act to that
particular class of ground.

5.   In consequence of this wider power, section 2 of the 1975
Act (originally formulated with "stadia" in mind, particularly
football stadia) has also had to be amended, by section 19 (2) of
the 1987 Act, so that safety certificates are no longer required
to contain certain obligatory terms and conditions. The
Secretary of State is however empowered to stipulate by order the
contents of a safety certificate for any class of sports ground.
 In this way those grounds of a particular type, or grounds used
 for a particular sport need not be subject to requirements which
 would be inappropriate to them.

 6.   As there are no present plans to extend designation to other
 classes of sports ground it is not envisaged that an order under
this new power will be necessary. The discretion given to local
authorities under section 2(1) of the 1975 Act means that with
the possible exception of clauses in safety certificates relating
              Pres®nce
                     (see paragraph 9 below) the contents of safety
certificates will not automatically require amendment as a result
of the removal of the obligatory terms of section 2 of the 1975
Act.   Safety certificates should continue to specify maximum
spectators?   include terms and conditions as to size, situation
of entrances/exits to and from the ground and parts of it
 (including means of escape in the case of fire or other
emergency) plus means of access to any such entrances and exits;
teras and conditions should continue to require those entrances
exits and means of access to be properly maintained and kept free
from obstruction;   and terms and conditions should continue to
deal with the number, strength and situation of any crush
barriers.

7.   Section 19(2) also widens the regulation powers given to
the Secretary of State by insertion of a new subsection (1A) to
section 18 of the 1975 Act thereby enabling regulations to make
different provision for different classes of sports grounds.

Section 20s     Designation of grounds - variation in qualifying
                spectator capacity

             ?° i^®erts subsections (1A) and (IB) in section 1 of
the 1975 Act to give the Secretary of State power to vary by
order the numerical threshold above which grounds may be
designated as requiring a safety certificate.  The threshold is
at present set at 10,000 by the Act.


Section 21:     Safety certificates — police presence

9.    Section 21 adds subsection (2A) to section 2 of the 1975
Act.   Where the local authority includes in a safety certificate
a provision which requires the presence of the police, the
subsection requires that determination of their number is to be
left to the Chief Officer of Police. This is already the usual
if not invariable practice and this provision does no more than
give statutory force to existing arrangements.   Safety
certificate conditions which do noc comply with this provision
'f*11 however be void and local authorities are advised to ensure
that any such conditions comply with the new provisions.

Section 22:    Safety certificates — appeals

10. Section 22 of the 1987 Act directs appeals under section 5
of the 1975 Act to the courts instead of to the Secretary of
State as hitherto.  Such an appeal is to the Magistrates Court by
way of making a complaint (new subsection (3A) of section 5).
There is also provision for an appeal to the Crown Court against
an order made by a Magistrates Court on determining a complaint.
Such an appeal may be made by the local authority or by any
"interested party" as defined in section 5 of the 1975 Act.

11. Subsections (4), (6) , (7) and (8) of section 5 are repealed
in consequence of the removal of the Secretary of State's
functions in respect of appeals. However the Secretary of State
is given the power to prescribe by regulation the time within
which appeals under section 5 of the 1975 Act are to be brought.
These regulations will also come into effect as from 1 January
1988. There is however transitional provision contained in
paragraph 6 of Schedule 5 to the 1987 Act to preserve the
existing appeal procedures/powers in respect of appeals made to
the Secretary of State before 1 January 1988 and which are still
extant on that date.
12. Section 22(8) of the 1987 Act makes a number of
consequential amendments to section 7 of the 1975 Act
(determinations and appeals/supplementary). Subsection (8)(a)
amends section 7(1) of the 1975 Act so that it provides for an
application to be deemed to be withdrawn if the local authority
serve a notice under section 5(1) that an applicant is not
qualified for the issue of a certificate, once the time limit for
an appeal has expired. It also removes from the 1975 Act section
7(1)(b) which misleadingly implies that the local authority can
determine without an application having been made that an
existing holder of a safety certificate no longer qualifies to
hold it.   Subsection (8)(b) amends section 7(2) to make
provision to suspend the effect of the local authority decision
that an applicant is not a qualified person if an appeal is made
in the prescribed time limits. This suspension has effect until
the appeal is either withdrawn or determined by the court in
favour of the authority.  Subsection 8(c) amends section 7(3) of
the 1975 Act and subsection (8)(d) repeals the provision in
section 7 of the 1975 Act by which a court could, on the
application of the local authority, give immediate effect to a
term or condition of a safety certificate which had been
suspended as a result of an appeal.

Section 23s Special procedure in case of serious risk -
prohibition notices s and
Section 24s Prohibition Noticess appeals
13. Section 23 of the 1987 Act replaces the existing section 10
of the 1975 Act with provision for a system of prohibition
notices. Section 24 of the 1987 Act provides for appeals against
a prohibition notice.
14. A prohibition notice may be served in respect of any sports
ground as defined in section 17(1) of the 1975 Act or part of
such a sports ground. The criteria for issuing a prohibition
notice are set out in the new section 10(1) and local authorities
should not feel inhibited from using the new powers when
necessary. These powers are nonetheless potentially far reaching
(see also paragraph 20 below) and local authorities are therefore
asked to ensure that they are used with due discretion.  In
practice, the considerations leading to the issuing of a
prohibition notice are likely to be comparable to those which now
  apply to seeking a court order, and prohibition notices                                                                •

        i ? n J ° ^ cef issued under new section 10. as inserted by
section 23 of the 1987 Act. The bringing of an appeal does not
suspend the operation of the notice or of any amendment to it
(section 10A(6)) so, particularly if the notice is to apply to a
"one-off" fixture, it is important that it is served, wherever
possible, well in advance so as to enable the recipient to
exercise effectively his right of appeal. The appeal procedure
is by way of complaint to a Magistrates Court. On appeal the
court may cancel the notice or affirm the notice, either in its
original form or as amended, or with such modifications as the
court thinks fit. There is provision for a further right of
appeal to the Crown Court against the decision of the Magistrates
Court. Persons entitled to make such an appeal are listed in new
section 10A(7). "An aggrieved person" referred to in sub-section
(7)(a) is defined in sub-section (9).

Section 25:   Enforcement : Inspections and offence of obstruction

21. Section 25(1) of the 1987 Act adds a new section 10B to the
1975 Act which provides for local authorities to enforce the
Act's provisions and, for that purpose, to arrange for the
inspection of designated grounds at least once every twelve
months in accordance with any guidance from the Secretary of
State.

22. Section 25(2) updates section 12(6)(d) of the 1975 Act by
amending the term "wilfully" to "intentionally".

                          PROHIBITION NOTICE

NOTES

Offences
1.    Contravention of any prohibition notice or restriction
imposed by a prohibition notice is an offence provided by section
12(1)(e) of the Safety of Sports Grounds Act 1975 (the 1975 Act)
as amended by the Fire Safety and Safety of Places of Sport Act
1987 (the 1987 Act) and renders the offender liable, on summary
conviction, to a fine not exceeding the statutory maximum
(currently £2,000) or, on conviction on indictment, to an
unlimited fine, or imprisonment for not more than two years, or
both.
2.   Where any person is charged with an offence under section
12(1)(e) of the 1975 Act it shall be a defence to prove

(a)     that the admission of spectators in contravention of the
        notice was without his consent; and

(b)     that he took all reasonable precautions and exercised all
        due diligence to avoid the commission of such an offence by
        himself or any other person under his control.

3.   Section 12(7) of the 1975 Act provides that where an offence
under that Act which has been committed by a body corporate is
proved to have been committed with the consent or connivance of,
or to be attributable to any neglect on the part of, a director,
manager, secretary or other similar officer of the body
corporate, or any person who was purporting to act in any such
capacity, he, as well as the body corporate, shall be guilty of
that offence and be liable to be proceeded against and punished
accordingly.
4.   Where the affairs of a body corporate are managed by its
members, section 12(7) of the 1975 Act shall apply in relation to
the acts, and defaults of a member in connection with his
functions of management as if he were a director of the body
corporate.
5.   The validity of a prohibition notice served on any person
shall not be affected by a failure to serve another person
required to be served with such a notice.


Appeals
6.   Your attention is drawn to the provision for appeal to a
magistrates * court against this notice in section 10A of the 1975
Act as inserted by the 1987 Act.
Regulations made under section 10A(1) of the 1975 Act stipulate
that a person on whom a prohibition notice is served may appeal
to the court within 21 days after the day on which the notice is
served on him.
Where an appeal is brought under this section against a
prohibition notice or an amendment of it, the bringing of the
appeal does not have the effect of suspending the operation of

    Act (in which section 22 is contained) comes into force on 1st January 1988, the same date
as the coming into force o f these Regulations. Accordingly, these Regulations no longer
include provision corresponding to regulations 8 to 13 o f the 1976 Regulations and
regulations 9 and 10 o f the 1976 Scottish Regulations (the enabling power for which is, in
any event, replaced by section 22 (7) o f the 1987 Act) but provide instead (in regulation 6)

        FIRE SAFETY AND SAFETY OF PLACES OF SPORT ACT 1987 :
        IMPLEMENTATION OF PART II (SAFETY OF SPORTS GROUNDS)         SECTION 25


        INSPECTIONS UNDER SECTION 10B OF THE SAFETY OF SPORTS GROUNDS ACT
        1975




        Introduction

       Further to HOC/71/87 giving advice about the effects of changes
       brought about by implementation of Part II of the Fire Safety and
       Safety of Places of Sport Act 1987 (the 1987 Act) this circular
       introduces Statutory Guidance given by the Secretary of State on
       inspections of designated sports grounds under section 10B of the
       Safety of Sports Grounds Act 1975 (the 1975 Act) as inserted by
       section 25 of the 1987 Act.

       General

       The Statutory Guidance, drawn up following consultation with the
       local authority associations, has effect in respect of any
       inspection carried out under section 10B of the 1975 Act after 1
       January 1988 when, by virtue of the Commencement Number 1 Order,
       Part II of the 1987 Act comes into effect.

       Local authorities should bear in mind the mandatory nature of the
       Statutory Guidance on inspections carried out under section 10B
       of the^1975 Act whereas the supplementary, explanatory memorandum
       enclosed with the Statutory Guidance is not binding.
Resource Implications

Whilst it is not intended to restrict the time local authorities
may feel should be devoted to this task, inspections under
section 10B (when taken with existing commitments to inspect
designated sports grounds) should not result in significant
resource implications.  The scope of inspections under paragraphs
3 and 4 of the Statutory Guidance, together with associated
report work, are not intended to be as detailed or extensive as
that often required of the holder of a safety certificate, or
that which may sometimes be necessary prior to the issue of a
safety certificate.  In general, inspections are not expected to
take more than about 2 man days per ground on average.

To assist local authorities prepare a report and record of
inspections a suggested basic format which can be adapted
according to preference is enclosed at Annex A.

Supplementary

Any enquiries about this circular or the Statutory Guidance
should be directed to Mr Macnamara 01-213 7338.

                                        Yours faithfully

resistance, condition of hand-rails (see also (j) below), trip
hazards especially at the head of stairways, adequacy of lighting
and structural fire separation;

(e)  all egress routes used by the public, including emergency
exit routes, for obstructions, operation of exit gates, adequacy
of sign-posting and lighting, presence of any uncleared litter;

(f)  fire fighting equipment and fire warning system (if
installed);

(g)   for the presence of any accumulation of litter,

(h) the emergency lighting system including any generator or
batteries

(i)   first-aid facilities and equipment;

(j)   10% of any crush barriers, balustrading and hand-rails for
overt signs of weakness which might signal the need for further
testing,, remedial action or (additional) restriction on the
number of spectators allowed to occupy that part of the ground;

(k)  10% of the terraces or viewing slopes for general surface
condition, even-ness and slip resistance;

(1)   anchorage and fastening of 10% of any fixed seating.

(m)   any provision for the disabled.

Where the inspection of a sample as in paragraphs (j), (k) and
(1) reveals matters giving rise to serious concern for the safety
of spectators, the authority should go on to inspect all the
crush barriers etc, terracing or seating in that part of the
ground where the sample indicated that there were deficiencies.

Testing of equipment

4.   Tests should if possible be carried out to confirm that the
following is in working order:-
(a)   lighting, particularly on stairways and exit routes;

(b)   emergency lighting;

(c) public address system, including the proper functioning of
zoning where this facility is part of the requirements of the
safety certificate;

(d)   fire warning system (if installed);

(e) 10% of any metering system for recording the admission of
spectators to parts of the ground.

Supplementary advica and explanatory notes to the Statutory
Guidance to local authorities given by the Secretary of State
under section 10B(2) of the Safety of Sports Grounds Act 1975


Introduction

1.   The following advice does not form part of the Statutory
Guidance given under section 10B of the 1975 Act. The following
advice is given in good faith but it should be remembered that
only the courts can rule authoritatively on interpretation of
points of law.

Objective of Inspections

2.   The object of the inspections is to monitor the suitability
of the terms and conditions of the safety certificate (where
issued) in the light of any change in the condition of the ground
and secondly, to assist local authorities in enforcing compliance
with the terms and conditions of the safety certificate or other
notice served on the ground occupier.

3.   Local authorities may wish to note that the inspection is
not intended to shift responsibility for spectator safety away
from the holder of any safety certificate or ground occupier, but
rather to help see that he succeeds in achieving (and
maintaining) the safety standards intended to be set by any
certificate for the number of spectators authorised to enter the
ground for a specified activity.

General

4.   As the size, age, configuration, condition and usage of
designated sports grounds as well' as the attitude of management
can give rise to different inspection needs, the discretion of
local authorities to carry out more frequent or more extensive
inspections than is laid down by section 10B of the 1975 Act is
not restricted. The requirements of the Statutory Guidance have
been set at what is sean as the desired minimum likely to achieve
the objective described above leaving authorities free to add to
the content of the inspections or increase their frequency
according to locally determined needs.   In this context local
authorities may wish to bear in mind that inspections carried out
under section 10B of the 1975 Act are in addition to, not a
substitute for those required to be carried out under the terms
and conditions of the safety certificate by or on behalf of the
holder.

Inspection frequency
5.   As section 10B(3) of the 1975 Ac*: stipulates that an
inspection should take place of a "designated" ground at least
once every twelve months, this frequency must be observed even if
the issue of a safety certificate is delayed. Where a safety
certificate has not been issued, the inspections carried out
prior to its preparation and issue should be such as to fulfil
the requirements of the Statutory Guidance. Once a safety
certificate has been issued at least one further inspection of
the ground should be carried out either:-

within a year of its issue, or

within a year of the last inspection, whichever is the earlier.

Thereafter, inspections should take place at least annually from
the date of the last inspection.

Where an inspection of a sports ground takes place at the
discretion of the local authority for some other reason, for
example as a result of proposed alterations or an application for
amendment to the safety certificate, that inspection can be
regarded as ah inspection carried out u n d e r section 10B of the
1975 Act provided the criteria of the Statutory Guidance are met.

Inspection Team

6.   The Statutory Guidance allows the local authority to
determine how best to arrange and effect inspections under
section 10B of the 1975 Act and does not stipulate that they
should be carried out by a particular professional discipline.
As it is nonetheless important that inspecting officers are
qualified for that purpose, the guidance places an onus on the
local authority to be satisfied on this account.  (The Guide to
Safety at Sports Grounds (paragraph 36) envisages that
inspections arranged by ground management will be carried out by
someone who is professionally qualified.  Local authorities may
wish to consider whether inspecting officers should also be
professionally qualified.)

7.    Local authorities are also asked to bear in mind the
potential advantages of a team approach to inspections under the
Statutory Guidance and the role of the fire authority, building
authori-cy and the police.  Local authorities in London and
metropolitan counties may therefore wish to arrange at least one
inspection per year to be carried out with a representative of
the fire authority in attendance.   Elsewhere, local authorities
will no doubt wish to consider inclusion of a member of the fire
service as well as a representative of the building authority.
Local authorities may also wish to consult the Chief Officer of
Police so that the opportunity can be given for a police officer
to attend at least one inspection each year.   (It is not intended
that these considerations should interfere with any internal or
locally agreed arrangements between the local authority, fire
authority, building authority, police and any other agency with
an interest in safety at the ground.)

Scope of Inspections

8.   Where possible all the items listed in paragraphs 3 and 4
of the Statutory Guidance should be inspected and tested.   It is
recognised however that there may be occasions when one or more
of these elements cannot, for some reason, be inspected.  For
this reason there is a degree of discretion within paragraphs 2 -
 4 of the Statutory Guidance.   In this way it is hoped to avoid
the situation where the local authority has to pay repeated
visits to a ground in order to comply with the Statutory
Guidance.

9.   The Statutory Guidance does not require that an inspection
should take place at any particular time so the local authority's
discretion to carry out an inspection whilst the ground is in use
is not restricted. An "in-use" or "during performance"
inspection could therefore constitute part of t h e .inspection
required by section 10B of the Act even though it might not be
sufficient (having regard to the requirements of the Statutory
Guidance) to be an inspection itself.

Records

10. Local authorities will doubtless need to keep a record of
all inspections carried out under the Statutory Guidance and may
wish to consider whether a copy of any report/record should be
sent to the holder of the safety certificate.  Local authorities
are also asked to consider affording a reasonable opportunity for
any such report to be made available for inspection, if so
requested, by members of the public.

                        This report sets out our thoughts on the ground capacity
     which is attainable.
                        It deals in broad terms with the necessary strengthening
     and supplementation of the crush barriers on the terraces, and
s calculations are made of the theoretical exit times.
                        Calculations of exit times are also made for each of
      the stands and reference is made to the observations which were
     made at the end of the third round cup-tie on 6 January, 1979.
                        The green guide has been used as a basis foir our cal­
      culations, although as with probably all existing grounds,                                                             it
     will not be possible to satisfy all the recommendations in the
      guide.                Reasonable compromise will be needed on the part of the
      fire officer and the police.

              Standing Accommodation
              (a)    Spion Kop
                            The general layout of Spion Kop is good.              It
                     has a very adequate number of gangways, with spacings
                     well below the maximum laid down in the guide.           The
1
                     slope strikes a happy balance between the requirements
      ™              for good viewing and the requirements of safety.
                             ~The~orily questions therefore are the adequacy
                     of the crush barriers to justify a high number of
                     permitted spectators, and the capacity and nature of
                     the exits.
                             Where the barriers are adequate in strength
                     and spacing, the guide recommends that the number
                                                                    2
                     of spectators should not exceed 54 per 10m          of plan
                     area.      Disregarding the gangways the area of Spion
                                                  2
                     Kop is approximately 3120m       which would provide,
                     accommodation for 16,850 spectators.
                             Crush barriers can satisfy either of two
                     standards.      Category A must be able to withstand a
                     test load of 6kN/metre width (400 lb/foot approximately)
                     and Category B must withstand 4.3 kN/metre (290 lb/foot).
                     In 1973 tests were made on all the barriers by Toft
                     and Brocklebank Ltd.      Of the 101 barriers on Spion
                     Kop, 21 failed to carry the test load of 400 lb and
                     a further 15 carried the load but had some actual or
                     incipient defect which needed attention.           Most of
                     those which failed the test, failed so badly that they
                     would probably not satisfy category B standard either.
                     On the other hand, it was sometimes only one part of a
                     long barrier which was weak.       It should-be emphasised
                     that the general situation was satisfactory compared
                     with most grounds.
                            Clearly it would be advisable to bring all the
                                                                                SHEET   3.

          barriers up to a uniform category A standard.                   It
          should be kept in mind that it is now five years since
          the tests and there may have been some deterioration
          due to rusting.       Most of the barriers are made from
          2§" diameter tube which only has a thickness of 0.192
          inches when new.       Rusting is now very slow in Sheffield’s
          atmosphere, but certain parts of the barriers are subject
          to more rusting than others and it is possible that
          there will be an increase in the number needing attention.
                                                             ^        i

                    Provided a barrier can withstand 6kN/m, the
          maximum distance between barriers recommended ih the
          guide varies between 5m for slopes of only 5° to 2.9m
          for slopes of 30°.       These figures apply to ’peak viewing’
          areas.       Most of Spion Kop has a slope of about 17°
          for which the recommended spacing is 3.6m.             The slope of the
          upper part      changes to 25° for which the spacing is
          3. lm.
                    Whilst we believe it is arguable that parts of
          Spion Kop could be considered as not being ’peak
          viewing areas’ we are prepared to accede to the police
          view and use peak viewing area standards for all barriers.
          This also applies to the stands at the west end of the
          ground.
                    We propose that the existing barriers should be
          supplemented by new ones as shown in red on the attached
          drawing 1610/1X.       The green shaded area behind each
          barrier shows the area which can then be assumed to be
                                                                  2
          available for spectators.  This area is 2958m                   which
                           2
          at 54 persons/10m gives a capacity of 15,973.                    It
                                                         i

          should be kept in mind that as many as 20,000 spectators
          have been admitted to the Kop in the past.

                             Spion Kop has three exits, one near each
                    end and one at the top.           The total width of
                    these three exits at their narrowest points is 12.5m.
                    The guide assumes a maximum flow rate through such
                    exits of 60 persons per minute for each 550mm of
^                   width.       Thus the theoretical time to discharge
                    16,000 spectators from Spion Kop would be Ilf minutes,
                    compared with a maximum of 8 minutes indicated by the
                    guide.       We do not consider this to be a serious               --- ;/, o O .
                    matter.       Rapid evacuation (in say 8 minutes) is very
                    desirable for stands where there may be a risk due to
                    fire, or explosion, or structural failure.                 In the
                    case of terracing it is only the impatience 'of.spectators
                    which might create danger.           We believe that for an
                        interim period at least the evacuation time "of*Ilf
                    minutes should be acceptable.
                               The exits at each end of the terrace are

» >'                reasonably free from hazards, except the one at the North
                    end passes under a bridge with a headroom below the
                                                 Ci?' ic *
                    recommended value of 8ft.            This defect could -be
                    removed by lowering the floor level, but we believe
                        it is far from essential to have such a large headroom,
                    and the cost of modification is not justified in an
                    existing structure.
                               The exit at the back of Spion Kop would benefit
                        from handrails iividing it into lanes.        Some remodelling
                    of the approaches to the ramp may also be thought
            v       desirable.

   be made for circulation space as spectators have
   to move      quite considerable horizontal distances
   to achieve good packing.        The full area would
   justify about 8000 spectators, but we suggest it would
   probably be appropriate to allow 10% as the equivalent
   of gangways giving a capacity of 7200 spectators.
   The barriers should be designed to match this figure
   approximately.       Those barriers which cannot withstand
   6kN/m should be appropriately strengthened, and extra
   ones provided where necessary.
              The extra barriers required to achieve
   approximately 7200 capacity are shown in red on the
   attached copy of drawing 1610/2X.
              The three exits have a total width of about
   11.5m which would permit about 1250 people per minute
   to leave the ground.      Thus the terrace could be
   emptied in about six minutes which is very satisfactory.
              The guide suggests that everyone on a terrace
   should be within 12m of a gangway or exit.       There are
   no gangways and some spectators will be 25m from an
   exit.       But we feel this is of no consequence as
   movement horizontally along this terrace will be easy
   and quick.

   The North West Corner Reinforced Concrete Terrace
              This area is also illustrated in the drawing
   1610/2X.       The gross area available (there are no
                               o
   gangways) is about 565 m .        Thus if the crush barriers
   were adequate and the whole area is included the number
   of spectators could be about 3,050.
              Provided the existing crush barriers are
   brought up to standard and supplemented in red as
EASTWOOD & PARTNERS




           shown on our drawing 1610/2X, the area which can
           be used in calculating spectator capacity is that
                                                       2
           shown in green.   This area is about 535m       corresponding
           to about 2900 spectators.     This would bring the total
           standing at the Leppings Lane end to 10,100.
                  The exits serving this part of the terraces
           are very adequate in width and there will be no
           difficulty in emptying in eight minutes.


    Seating Accommodation
    (a)    The North Stand
                  The form of construction of this stand is
           such that it presents a minimum fire hazard.-      The
           exits are numerous and spaced so that they satisfy
           the recommendations of the guide.
                  The exits are very marginally below the,
          recommended 1-lm width, but we do not consider this
           to be of great consequence.
                  Gangways are only 640mm wide for much of their
           length (they widen round the exit).    This is well
          below the green guide recommendation.       However, it
           is clearly appropriate to take into account the
           general nature of the stand, the number as well as
           the width of the gangways, and above all the ease and
          speed   with which spectators can evacuate the stand.
                  On 6 January we counted the number of spectators
          leaving in successive minutes after the final whistle.
          The figures were 71, 72, 80 and 73.     Thereafter
          the number fell off as the spectators were in no hurry.
          This established that in an emergency the green guide
          figure of 80 per minute (relating to a l*lm gangway)
          can be achieved.    With 18 exits for 10,000 spectators
                                                                               SHEET   7.

        EASTWOOD ft PARTNERS
  I


                   the average is 556 per exit.    Thus the stand -would
                   empty in about seven minutes, which is within the
                   recommended limit of eight minutes.
                          Our observations in company with the fire,
                   officer^ staff on 6 January showed that everyone
                   had left this stand, apart from some people who were
                   in no hurry, in about six minutes, although we also
                   counted about 40 per exit who left before the final
                   whistle.    The overall picture appears very satisfactory
                   and we suggest that this stand should be accepted
                   jas not needing any significant modification.

            (b)    The West Stand
                          This stand is very similar to the north stand
                   in its construction.     We were not able to accurately
                   assess the time taken for it to be vacated on 6
                   January because there were many seats which were unsold.
                   However, there is every reason to believe that there
                   will be no difficulty in vacating this stand within
                   eight minutes also.     There should be no need for
                   significant modifications.

            (c)    The South Stand
                          The structure has been surveyed and appended
                   are prints of our drawings 1610/3, 4 and 5, which
                    show the plans and cross-section.     Also attached is
                   a seating plan, drawing No. 1610/6.
' /M

I 'll
                          The upper part of the stand (the covered area)
                    has 5710 seats.    These are served by 12 exits (excluding
                    those serving the directors box) so that an average
                    of 476 people need to pass through each exit.        The
                    count by the fire officer’s staff W       6 January showed
                    an average of about 70 per minute passing through one
                    exit which corresponds to an emptying time of about
                    seven minutes.    Indeed there were very few people
                                                          -
EASTWOOD ft PARTNERS




           still trying to get out six minutes after the final
           whistle.    A few had no doubt left early and a few
       x   were still standing around, but, the stand had
           substantially emptied in about six minutes.
                  Having left the top of the stand the spectators
           have to make their way from the first floor landing
           via one of three staircases.    Two of these are 3.6m
           wide and the other 2.4.    This is equivalent to 17^
           ’lanes’ of 550mm.   At 40 people per lane, 700 people
           pass per minute.    To discharge 5710 people (less
           those in the directors box) will therefore take almost
           exactly 8 minutes as permitted by the guide.
                  At ground floor level two of the staircases lead
           almost straight to the open air, through a compartment
           which is separated from the main part of the building.
           The third staircase passes through a wide lobby which
           will probably need three sets of self closing fire
           doors to separate it from the remainder of the building.
           The club intends to move the paint store from the
           space behind this staircase.
                  The front, open-air part of the south stand is
           well endowed with exits but these all discharge onto
           one passage.   This passage has a theoretical capacity
           of only about 150 people per minute in each direction.’
           This gives an emptying time of 11 minutes.        Because
           the stand is open to the air and there is very
           ready access to the pitch we do not think this rather
           long emptying time is of any great consequence.


   General Requirements                                       ?
           The police and the fire officer, and possibly the
                                                         *
   Building Surveyor, will no doubt wish to discuss a number of
   matters.    Prior to holding a further formal meeting they
EASTWOOD Er PARTNERS




    will probably wish to study the drawings and to pay a
     further visit.    We would like to be present when any
     further inspection is made and would appreciate contact
    being made with Dr. Wood during Dr. Eastwood's absence
    which will extend to 15 February.
            If the police would like to suggest the kind of police
     post they would like, this can be considered by the club
     and drawings prepared by us as a matter of urgency.
            A meeting to discuss all aspects of the application
    might be held around say 16 February.
            In the meantime Eastwood & Partners will be ^checking
     the various electrical services so that we shall be in a
     position to discuss these at the meeting.              j


     Future Ground Capacity
            Following the upgrading of the barriers and the carrying
    out of such other works as may be required it is hoped the
     ground capacity will not fall below 5 0 ,0 0 0 made up as follows
            Seating approximately                24,000
            Standing on Spion Kop                16,000
            Standing at Leppings Lane end
            (total including N.W. corner)        10,100

                                                  50,100

            It will be recalled that in recent years agreement
     has been reached with the police that 55,000 spectators might
     be admitted to the grourd.     This involved of the order of
     19.000 - 20,000 spectators being on Spion Kop.        Indeed, it
     is believed that in the days when crowds of approximately
     70.000 were accommodated in the ground, the figure on Spion
    Kop probably approached 30,000.
            It should also be emphasised that the ground has an
     excellent safety record stretching over very many years.

    1 ._____Purpose of Meeting

    Following the Working Party’s m eeting with the rep resen tatives of the
    Sheffield Wednesday Football Club Ltd. on 13th D ecem ber, 1978, the
    Secretary of the Club had (by letter dated 22nd January, 1979) circulated a
    Report, together with P lans, drawn up by D r. W. Eastwood of Eastwood
    and P a rtn ers. The Secretary had also suggested a m eeting on Friday,




.
    16th February, 1979, to d iscu ss the documents.
                                                                        -4.
    The purpose of today's m eeting w as to consider the view s which the Working
    Party should put to the Club on the 16th February.

    2.     Plans

    (a)     Whilst the "Notes for the Guidance of Applicants" stated that detailed
    plans at 1:100 sca le should be supplied of all buildings and other accommodation
    for spectators, som e o f the plans supplied w ere to 1:200 sca le . The F ire
    Service felt that the latter size w ere acceptable provided a ll of the plans w ere
    to the sam e sca le, and it was AGEEED that the "Notes for the Guidance of
    Applicants" should be amended to read plans to 1:200 sca le .

    (b)     The site plan at 1:500 sca le had not been supplied a s required by the
    N otes, but Eastwood and Partners had undertaken to prepare this in tim e for
    Friday's m eeting. The firm had also prom ised that a ll site fixtures would be
    indicated on that plan.
                                              1.
(c)       It w as AGREED that the plans supplied had inaccuracies and
Inadequacies. In particular, they lacked indications o f c r o s s section s,
p r o files, structural stability, position of handrails and balustrades, width
o f stairw ays, etc. Where appropriate, th ese could, a s an alternative, be

3.     Report

(a)    General

It w as recognised that the criteria set out in the Home Office ’’Guide to
Safety at Sports Grounds (Football)” required new work or reconstruction
to be to a standard not lower than the standard set out in the Guide, and that
In existing situations the criterion w as that o f a reasonable degree of safety.
A s the Guide stated, it would be unreasonable, even if it w ere practicable,
to seek the absolute safety of everyone attending a ground.

"With these factors in mind, both the F ire Service and the P olice felt that
the flow o f spectators w as the m ost important criteria to be adopted.
"Whilst not disagreeing with this viewpoint, the Building Authority suggested
It would be useful to know the reasoning behind the recomm endation in the
Guide that gangways should not be le s s than 1 .1 m e tres w ide. The County
Council AGREED to try to find this information out, and the F ire Service
AGREED they'would contact their colleagu es in other a r e a s who had been
Involved in the Certification p r o c e ss to ascertain how nearly the 1 .1 m etre
gangway recommendation had been observed in existing situations in their
resp ectiv e a r ea s.

At the request o f the F ire Service, the County Council also AGREED to try
and find out if there was any general recommendation on reduced
adm ission if a ground w ere used at a night tim e instead o f during the day
tim e.

                                              *

.Whilst it w as probably a typing m istak e, it w as AGREED that the wording
on the Front Cover should read "REPORT TO_ SOUTH YORKSHIRE COUNTY
COUNCIL" and not "REPORT OF SOUTH YORKSHIRE COUNTY COUNCIL".
(c )   •Spion K o p   (pages 2,3 & 4)

The Working Party agreed with, the Club's view that, with the existing three
e x its, there was no way that the recomm ended discharge tim e o f 8 minutes
could be m et. Where they disagreed w as that an evacuation tim e of I l f
m inutes should be regarded a s acceptable. If no m ore e x its w ere to be
provided, the Working Party AGREED that a crowd lim itation o f 1 1 ,040
on the Spion Kop should be im posed.

The existing exit at the North end passed under a bridge with a headroom
below agreed by the Club to be l e s s than the recommended value of 8ft.
A s this w as in fact some 6'6", the Working Party AGREED that the Club
be informed that in their view it is essen tia l that the floor be lowered to
rem ove this danger to spectators.                           ‘

The exit at the South side would a lso require widening, and possibly flow
b a rriers would need installing.

The area at the back o f the Kop would also require c lo se attention.

If new ex its were to be provided by the Club, it w as AGREED that at least
TWO would be required. The m o st econom ical way o f providing one would
be to u se the gates in the existing b a rrier, provided these w ere lined up with
the gangways, with discharge onto the pitch surround, and the other wDuld
require to be a com pletely new exit.

The Building Authority felt that the m ajority o f the crush b a r r ie rs would fail
the te s ts , and consequently any n e c essa ry r e -sitin g would probably not be
too much of a problem. Certainly the suggested additional b a rriers would
require careful consideration.

For the purposes of crowd control, the P o lice suggested thera should be som e
form o f lateral separation. The Working Party AGREED, and it w as suggested
that three m etal fences sited centrally in the blocks (as opposed to adjacent
to the gangways) should be provided, with a c c e s s between each lim ited to a
padlocked gateway under the control of the P o lice .

A s recent adverse weather conditions had proved, ice and snow on the Kop
could cause problem s, and it w as AGREED that Paragraph 11 (4) of the draft
Certificate should be amended so a s to require the Ciub to take steps to
clear the Kop of ice and snow before a game w as played.

The Building Authority pointed out that information w as s till required from
the Club on profile and step dim ensions and the slope of the Kop.
  (d)     The W est T errace    (pages 4&5)

  In view o f the lack of depth of this terrace, the Club's offer to reduce the
  spectator lim it to 7 ,2 0 0 , and the discharge time of 6 .6 m inutes, the
  Working Party AGREED that it would be unreasonable to in s is t that
  gangways or additional ex its m ust be provided.

  However, even if the existing crush b a rriers w ere to p a ss the te s ts , the
 •Working Party AGREED that the b a rriers would require sp ecia l attention
  In view o f the apparant sharp ed ges, corro sio n , etc.

  (e)     The North West Corner Reinforced Concrete T erra ce (pages 5 & 6)

  The Working Party AGREED there w ere no rea l problem s h e r e, but the
  Building Authority pointed out that a s w ell as the crush b a r r ie r s, the
  existing corrugated sheeting would require to p a ss the appropriate te s ts.

  (f)     The North Stand (pages 6 & 7)

  Whilst the flow rates and discharge tim es w ere probably satisfactory (the
  construction and width of the ramps being such that they could quite properly
  be regarded a s elevated roadways), the fact rem ained that the gangways in
  the North Stand w ere only 640mm wide for much o f their len g th , compared
  with the recommended width of 1 .1 m e tr e s.

   Additionally, observations had shown that tw o-thirds o f the spectators used
   the upper exit, w hilst the rem ainder used the lower exit. An ideal would be
. ,to provide additional ex its at the top of the stand but, in view of Its cantilever
   construction, the cost would be prohibitive.              '       -

  A s an alternative, the Working Party AGREED that consideration might be
. given to removing a row of sea ts from the top of the stand down each gangway
  to the upper e x its, with a physical ba -rier a c r o ss the stand below the upper
  e x its to ensure m ore equal u se o f both upper and lower e x its by spectators.
  If this would cause difficulties, a barrier in the gangways only below the upper
  e x its might be considered.

 So far as the Wire Mesh b a rriers under the stand w ere concerned, the
 Working Party AGREED that these m ust either be rem oved or made of a
 permanent construction.

  fg )    The West Stand

 Whilst the e x its w ere adequate and w ell spaced and the discharge tim es
 w ere acceptable in view o f the type of stand, the F ire Service felt that
the m eans o f escape w ere not adequate a s the only m eans o f e g r e s s w as
by way of two sta ir c a se s. The Working Party AGREED that it w as e ssen tia l
that another sta irca se be provided, and one on the south-w est corner w as felt
to be the m ost acceptable.

 (h)    The South Stand (pages 7 & 8)

So far a s the seating arrangem ents were concerned, the Working Party
felt that it w as the front, open a ir part which caused the concern. B ecause
of the bad in g r e s s /e g r e s s , the Working P arly AGREED that two additional
ex its would be required. It was suggested that the m ost econom ical way of
doing this was by m eans of one discharging at the Spion Kop end and the
other by breaking through the w all by the Tea B ar.

Additionally, the penning arrangem ents of the seating would need to be
looked at c lo se ly .

A s the balustrades and handrails w ere constructed of tim ber, the Building
Authority considered they would be likely to fail the appropriate te sts.
A lso , a s the staircase was a 24 Instead o f the maximum 12 r is e r recommended
In the Guide it was probable that this would have to be reconstructed.

Contrary to their initial reaction, the F ire Service felt that, provided that the
n e cessa ry Increased fire resista n c e m easu res w ere carried out, the stand
would not be the problem from a combustabiiity point of view that they had
anticipated.

The Building Authority expressed concern a s to the corrosion o f the steel
work o f the stand, and considered that this would require investigation.

The P o lice expressed concern about the u se o f the car park behind the
Stand. P erson s entitled to u se this car park frequently arrived ju st before
the start of a match and drove through the spectators attempting to gain
a c c e s s to the ground. A s they left im m ediately afterw ards, the sam e thing
occurred at the end o f a m a tc h .. This p ractice had to be stopped, either by
banning the use of the car park entirely on match days or Imposing some sort
o f tim e restriction on its use before and after a match.

 (h)    General Requirements

• T hese were not discussed by the Working Party at this stage.

1.       Purpose of Meeting

Following the postponement of the m eeting with the Club because of adverse
weather and the difficulty in agreeing a mutually convenient alternative
date, the purpose of the m eeting was to review the position since 12th February,
1979, prior to the re-arranged meeting with the Club which was now to take
place on 2nd April, 1979.

2.       Plans

The plans at 1:500 sca le and indicating a ll site fixtures w ere, it was s till understood,
to be supplied by Eastwood & Partners at the m eeting with the Club.

3.______ Report
(a)      General

The County Council had contacted the Home Office, but had been given little
information additional to that contained in their various C ircu la rs. B asically,
they had said that any new work or reconstruction had to be to a standard not
lower than that s e t out in the Guide. However, the maximum flexibility had
to be maintained in the case of existing structures and differences in such
m atters as age, siz e and mode of construction had to be taken into account.

The F ire Service had contacted four other Brigades with designated grounds,
and only in one case had the recommendations of the Guide been strictly
adhered to.

                                   1.
(b)      Spion Kop (pages 2, 3 & 4)

Additional to the points mentioned on 12th February, 1979, concern was
ex p ressed by the Building Authority as to the general maintenance of the Kop
and the lo o se and broken concrete at the bottom in particular. If attention
was not given to this, it was AGREED that it would be n e cessa ry to r e s tr ic t
adm ission to the Kop, additional to the restriction to 11,040 if the extra
e x its are not provided.

On the question of exits, it was again AGREED that it was e sse n tia l to line
up the gates In the existing barrier with the gangways. Of the existing two
ex its, concern was ex p ressed as to the effect of the right-angled turn on
the embankment at the ex it at the rea r . After discussion , it was AGREED
that the best com prom ise was to leave things as they existed, provided
handrails are provided on the stairw ays, taking into account the
desirability of maintaining a smooth flow.

The Fire Service queried the exact form of the latera l separation discu ssed
at the m eeting on 12th February, 1979, as this would naturally have a
bearing on the means of escape recom m endations. After d iscussion , it
was AGREED that the metal fences should not b e o f the clim b-proof type,
that it was not intended that they should obstruct the gangways, and that
in consequence the padlocked gateway recommendation should be dropped.
However, it was AGREED that it was s till desirable to seek 3 x 2 central
barriers but, if the Club really r e siste d the suggestion, 2 x 2 could
reluctantly be conceded. The Building Authorily str e sse d that whatever
barriers were provided would have to pass the appropriate s tia in te s ts .

The fact that the height of many of the existing crush b arriers was below the
recommendation in the Guide, in som e ca ses w ell below, was pointed out by the
Building Authority. The corrosion point mentioned at the la st meeting was
also reiterated. It was AGREED that these points must be drawn to the
Club's attention, as must the condition of the Score Board Structure.

(c)      The West T errace (pages 4 & 5)

A s w ell as the condition of the crush barriers mentioned at the la s t meeting,
the Building Authority drew attention to the poor condition in places of the
terracing in sm all areas near to the stand. The c r o s s -fa ll on the steps on
the north-w est corner ex it would also require attention as it tended to throw
people forward. The height of the crush barriers mentioned in regard to the
Spion Kop also applied. It was AGREED that all these points m ust be drawn
to the Club's attention.

(d)       The North W est Corner Reinforced Concrete T errace (pages 5 & 6)

Having now had the opportunity of having a clo ser look at the existing corrugated
sheeting, the Building Authority confirmed that it would require alteration to
m eet the requirem ents of the Guide.
(e )     The North Stand (pages 6 & 7)

The rem oval of a row of sea ts from the top of the stand down each gangway
to the upper exits and the rem oval of four sea ts at those exits was
confirmed as being a reasonable com prom ise to put to the Club.

A s the asbestos sh eets at the top of the stand were protected, the Building
Authority fe lt that these could be accepted, and confirmed that the glazing
at the ends of the stands was not g la ss and so would not shatter.

(f)      The W est Stand (page 7)
                        *
Consideration was given to the Building Authority’s suggestion of lateral
gangways and the segregation of exits but, after d iscussion , it was AGREED
that the additional sta irca se agreed at the la s t m eeting should be confirmed.
So long as it was of 4-unit ex it width, it was AGREED it was not necessa ry
to in sist it should be on the south-w est corner. Such sta ir ca se s could be
bought "off the peg" and, if not installed in the close season, it was
AGREED that a g- reduction in capaeily would be necessarj'.

(g)       The South Stand (pages 7 & 8)

As mentioned at the la st m eeting, the penning arrangem ents of the seating
and the numbers of sea ts in the rows caused problem s. Bearing in mind the
need for reasonaoleness and to make the situation better, it was AGREED
that, even though not strictly in accordance with the Guide, that the best
com prom ise was to seek the rem oval of the existing b arriers and their
re-alignm ent, together with the widening of the gangways at the position
of the wings.

The F ire Service pointed out and it was AGREED that F ire R esistin g Doors
would be required leading to the D irecto rs’ seating, and 1 hour fire
resista n ce would be required for all problem areas under the stand. This
could be reduced to § hour if automatic detection equipment were to be
installed.

For their part, the Building Authority reiterated their concern as to the
corrosion of the steelw ork of the stand, and a lso pointed out the concrete
spalling which was occurring. Again, the likelihood of the balustradirxg,
ba rriers and guardrails needing to be reinforced or replaced was mentioned.
It was AGREED all would need to be given attention by the Club.

(h)      General Requirements (pages 8 & 9)

A s w ell as the Fire Service pointing out that the present tem porary
structures used for police and fir st-a id purposes would need rem oval
from a means of escape point of view if the capacity of the North Stand
     was not to be reduced, the P o lice stated that they were ready to d iscu ss
     with the Club the fa cilities they would require. B riefly, they envisaged
     a permanent structure alm ost twice as large as the existing temporary
     structure, and expected communications, detention, toilet, parade room,
     e t c ., fa c ilitie s.

     So far as F irst-A id was concerned, the Sheffield Area Health Authority
     had confirmed their w illingness to provide advice on F irst-A id and
     Medical F a c ilitie s, but the person nominated (Dr. H. B ailey - Specialist
     in Community Medicine (Social Services)) was on holiday until
     2nd A pril, 1979. He had been invited to the meeting, with the Club on
     2nd April, but it was recognised that possible practical difficulties might
     prevent his doing so.

1.    Scope and Objectives of D iscu ssio n s

Mr. H. E. McGee welcom ed the rep resen ta tiv es, and str e sse d that the Club w ere
ambitious and wanted to make the Stadium the b e st in Europe. Crowds had been
averaging 11,000 this season and, viewed purely a s a football operation, the Club
had been losing money since 1967. C om m ercial ventures had made the Club
viable, and it was hoped to expand this side of the Club's a c t iv it ie s .. The Club's
eventual ambitions obviously had to be tempered by practical considerations.

IT WAS AGREED -

1.    That, w hilst Designating Orders did not specify time lim its for the issu e of
General Safety C ertificates, it w as essen tia l to aim for the C ertificate to be issued
by the start of the 1979/80 Season.
2.    That, a s the Club wanted to attract representative g a m e s, the aim should
be for the Stadium to be certificated for maximum crowds.

3.     That a s much work a s possib le should be carried out in the c lo se season,
bearing in mind that because of the recent continuous sp ell o f bad w eather, this
w ill be m ore restricted than usual. The Annual Jehovah's W itness B ally had
also to be borne In mind.

2.    D iscu ssion on Standing A reas

A.    Spion Kop

IT WAS AGREED -

1.    That the siting and angle of the new b a r r ie rs to be installed be the subject
of detailed discussion s between Dr. Eastwood and the Building Surveyor.

2.    That the Club consider the installation of sim ple lateral b a r r ie r s (not of the
clim b proof type) for crowd control purposes in the blocks on either side of the
central block (but not so a s to obstruct the gangways).

3.     That, in view of the clearance time of I l f m inutes compared with the
8 m inutes specified in the Guide, the m eans of escape be discu ssed in detail
between D r. Eastwood and the F ire Service (including the r e -sitin g of the gates
in the existing b a rriers and, possibly the widening of the existing g a tes and/or
an Increase in their number).

4.  That the headroom at the North end under the bridge be increased to the
maximum possible without going to the extent o f underpinning.

5.    That representative parts o f the concrete wall and boundary p o sts and fences
be tested to the appropriate standards.

6.   That the condition of the concrete at the lower end, the height of som e of the
crush b a rriers and the scoreboard structure be the subject of detailed discussion s
between Dr. Eastwood and the Building Surveyor.

7.       That the Club's longer term proposals for the improvement o f the m eans of
e g r e ss be unanimously welcom ed.

8.    That the maximum capacity of the Spion Kop be determined after the foregoing
points have been resolved.
B.    W est T errace

IT WAS AGREED -

1. ‘ That the Chib's proposals for the installation o f additional b a r r ie r s and the
reduction in capacity to 7 ,2 0 0 spectators without the need for additional gangways
should be implemented.

2.     That tiie question of the c r o s s -fa ll on the steps on the north -w est corner
exit, the height of som e of the existing crush b a r r ie r s, a s w ell a s their corrosion
and sharp edges in p la ces, be the subject o f detailed discussion between
D r. Eastwood and the Building Surveyor.

C.    North W est Corner T errace

IT WAS AGREED -

1.    That the Clubs proposals to bring the crush b a rriers up to standard and
supplemented by new b a rriers with a consequent capacity of 2 ,9 0 0 spectators should
be implemented.

2.    That the improvement or replacem ent o f the existing corrugated sheeting be
the subject of detailed discussion between D r. Eastwood and the Building Surveyor.

3.    North Stand

IT WAS A G R EED -

1.     That, in view of the obvious difference of opinion between the Club and the
Working Party a s to the appropriate steps (if any) to be taken over the width of the
existing gangways, both sid es be requested to consider a ll the points m ade; and
to re-co n sid er the m atter at the next m eeting.

2.     That the question of fire protection works to the Store Room and to the Team
Room be the subject of detailed discussion s between Dr. Eastwood and the
F ire Service.

3.     That the replacem ent (from a fire hazard point of view) of the existing P olice
and F irst-A id Temporary Structures under the Stand be accepted in principle, and
that the fa cilities required in the new permanent structures be considered later in
the Agenda.

4.     That the existing Wire Mesh b a rriers under the Stand be the subject of
discu ssion s between D r. Eastwood and the F ire Service.

5.   That the question of the provision of handrails be the subject o f discussions
between D r. Eastwood and the Building Surveyor.
4.    W e s t Stand

IT WAS AGREED -

That, w hilst the upper level of the Stand can be emptied in the required tim e,
consideration be given to reducing the congestion which may occur in the lower
level by examining the possibility of erecting an additional stairway at each
end o f the Stand (possibly of the Fire Escape type for em ergency u s e , rather
than for normal use).

5.    South Stand

IT WAS AGREED -

1.     That Dr. Eastwood and the Building Surveyor d iscu ss in detail the apparent
spalling of the concrete frame at high le v e ls, apparent corrosion of the main
steelwork colum ns, rem oval of the timber casing at base level fo r Inspection (2
only a s representative sam ple), and load testing of a representative sample of
single and double skin w alls.

2.    That, to overcom e the m eans of escape problem s in the upper part of the

          Authority) and H. E . Wright (South Y orkshire County Fire Service).

          The Note (previously circulated) of the m eeting held on 2ndApril, 1979, was considered
          in conjunction with a Note (circulated at the meeting) of a m eeting between Eastwood

        • M etropolitan D istrict Council Building Surveyor's Department held on 13th A p ril, 1979.

          am endm ents and additions in the light of the further investigations and d is c u s s io n s :-

          2A      Spion Kop

          P a r a s . 1 & 2 - R evised co p ies of drawing no. 1610/IX were circulated at the m eeting
          showing the proposed new crush b a rrier layout, including the two lin es of radial
          b a r r ie r s . T his was AGREED in principle.

          P a r a . 3 - A 16, 850 crowd capacity on the Kop a s existing would mean an unacceptable
          evacuaticn tim e of som e 1 2 | m in utes. L arger and re-a lig n ed g a tes in the b a rrier
          and im provem ent of the ex istin g upper exit could reduce this tim e to so m e 10 m inutes,
          but 8 m inutes could only be achieved by installing a new ex it of 3 m etre overall width.
          T his could be integrated Into the proposed future schem e for enlarging and roofing the
          Kop. The Club AGREED to g iv e consideration to the proposals.


                                                    1.

s till to be ca rried out, but was not expected to be a m ajor Item.

 P a ra . 5 - B ecause o f the difficulty in devising a suitable method of testing in places

 a fter further d isc u ssio n s between Dr. Eastwood and the Building Surveyor.

P a ra . 6 - The Club accepted that the concrete required attention and that the scoreboard
structure should be looked a t. It was AGREED that the question of the hsight of som e
of the cru sh b a r r ie rs be considered again after it was s e e n which of them failed on
te stin g .

P a r a . 7 - The Club s tr e s s e d that th eir proposals for the im provem ent of the m eans of
e g r e s s would hopefully be carried out in the shorter rather than the longer term future.

P a r a . 8 - The Club hoped that the testing of the ex istin g crush b a r r ie r s, together with. ’'
the installation of the new crush b a rrier layout and alteration of the g a te s in the ex istin g
b a rrier, could a il be ca rried out in the c lo se sea so n . T heir aim was to achieve a
16, 850 crowd capacity.

existin g corrugated sh eetin g, the Club fe lt they wished to con sid er whether to carry
out m ore exten sive works so as to bring the existing unused a rea into u se for an
additional 250/300 sp e c ta to r s.

3.     North Stand

P a r a . 1 - D r. Eastwood, the Building Surveyors and the F ire S ervice had reached
agreem en t on a sch em e which could be recom m ended to the Club. This would
involve the rem oval of 10 se a ts from each of the 9 gangw ays and 4 se a ts from in
front of each of the 9 upper e x its . The r esu lt would mean a lo s s of 126 seats
com pared to the 225 in the original p roposals. The Club AGREED to give
consideration to the proposal.

P a r a . 2 - The word at the end of the fir s t line should have been 'Tea* and not ’T ea m ’.

fir e protection works considered to be n e c e ssa r y .

       of w a ste paper, wood shavings and cigarette ends beneath the floor boards, the
       Club a ls o AGREED that the sp ace beneath the tim ber floor should be cleaned out.

       P a r a . 2 - Provided the penning b a rriers were rem oved en tirely , it was AGREED that

       Isolated from the Kop exit. It was AGREED that Dr. Eastwood and the Fire Service
       should con sid er p r e cise ly what m ea su r es could be considered sa tisfa c to ry s o a s to

       The Club s tr e s s e d they were thinking in term s of an upgrading of the existing public
       a d d ress s y s t e m . It was AGREED that the P olice should have an o v e r-rid e facility
       from th eir P o lice Room, and Dr. Eastwood undertook to look into the p ossibility of

 I refer to recent meetings with regard to the improvements required at the above
 ground ana now append a summary of matters, in relation to the Building Authority
 requirements, which require attention and have been discussed at the various

 1.      The downward slope of the exit steps to be corrected.

South Terrace

Provide new means of egress to South-East area as discussed in detail.

North Stand

1.   Radial gangways to he improved to 1.1 m in width for at least half.the
      gangway length above each central exit, and remove 4 No. seats immediately
     below each exit to allow for barrier erection.         . ... .

2.   Replace existing wire mesh barriers by suitable substantial barriers
      complying with guide recommendations.

It is noted that there are no handrails to the stairs from the stand, but in
view of restricted width and length it is not proposed t o .require .these?..,

North-West Terrace
                                                                       i
1.   Replacement of the corrugated sheeting at the rear is required.

2.   The removal of under-strength barriers and their replacement by new ones
      constructed to guide recommendations.

Spion Kop

1.   The arrangement for crush barriers as produced by the consultant, whilst
     not complying fully with the guide recommendations, is considered adequate
      if the other requirements are fulfilled. These other requirements include
     the 2 No. radial barriers indicated on Plan 1XA and the provision of an
      additional 3 m wide egress route to South-East area, and of gated openings
      to give access from the radial gangways to the ground perimeter.area.

2. ' Make good all broken and spalled concrete terracing. ;

3.   Increase headroom to North-East egress route to a minimum of 2.1 m.

4.   Check and carry out any necessary work to ensure safety of score-board
     building. -                                     -                             ,

5.   Replace corroded perimeter rails by construction complying with code
     recommendations.

6.   Improve egress conditions at rear by provision of balustrades, rails, etc.
      as indicated on the plan.

General

1.   All crush barriers, balustrade walls, fences and railings to be tested and
      replaced, or strengthened, where necessary.

2.   Provision of handrails and suitable headroom to egress routes to be re­
      assessed after re-routing of gangways etc. has been carried out.

3.   Fire resistance and restriction of flame spread to be improved to all areas
     as discussed; the consultant is to confirm the work proposed to be carried
     out. Arrangements to be made for the clearance of all combustible material
     from under stand areas.
With regard, to future meetings I think it is essential that all matters agreed
be recorded, as we are now approaching finality in many areas and it is necessary
that we have recorded exactly the agreed matters.

I .would also suggest that in view of the approach of certification it would,
perhaps, be advisable to hold future meetings away from the ground, and that
Mr. Vaughan, as the co—ordinator, should chair such meetings.

Yours faithfully,

Public A ddress System

The ex istin g public address sy stem to be upgraded, with the P o lice having an
o v er-rid e fa cility from th eir P o lice Room.

P o lice F a c ilitie s

A suitable permanent P o lice Room (with fa c ilitie s as shown on the sketch plan
marked AA ) to be provided in the 1980 c lo se sea so n .

F ir st Aid F a c ilitie s

(i)      Structure

          The existin g fa c ilitie s are considered to be below an acceptable standard
          and it is suggested the Club con sid er providing a m ore permanent
          structure which is not lik ely to require up-grading for a very long tim e.
          The internal fin ish , p articularly of the T reatm ent area, should be of an
          im pervious nature so that it can be e a sily cleaned and rendered fa irly
          ste r ile and require no decoration. This can be achieved by the u se of
          tile s o r form ica type finish e t c . . . .

(ii)     W aiting A rea

          The Waiting A rea could be arranged within corrid or space to m in im ise
          the co st, w here sittin g c a s e s could w ait fo r attention on c h a ir s .

(iii)    T reatm ent A rea

          The T reatm ent A rea should be sufficient to accom m odate two o r three
          patients at any one tim e, and consideration should be given to the needs
          for privacy within the treatm ent area, bearing in mind that the three
          patients may w ell be lying on couches.
        (iv)     Lighting

                 Good lighting is esse n tia l and strip lighting would be sa tisfa c to ry . The
                 provision of a power point would a lso be a basic requirem ent.

        (v)      Water

                 A supply of hot and cold w ater is essen tia l; the cold w ater suitable
                 for drinking. A hand basin and a large B elfa st type sink should also
                 be provided. The Club might con sid er w hether it would be cheaper in
                 the long run to provide sta in le ss ste e l basins which are not subject to
                 chipping.

        (vi)     T oilet Requirements

                 The d u b should provide at le a s t one m ale and one fem ale toilet, for
                 the u se of the public, and should con sid er w hether they should provide
                 an additional to ilet fo r the use of the sta ff.

        (vii)    Storage

                 Storage fa c ilitie s are required for s ix str etc h e r s, and fo r two s e ts of
                 w heels for str etc h e r s, blankets and other bed lin en . T his storage should
                 be lockable.

        (viii)   Equipment

                 The following is a minimum lis t to provide a basic s e r v ic e :-

                 Treatm ent couches with lift up ends, two or three in num ber depending
                 on space available an d /or number of cu b icles, if the accom m odation Is
                 cubicled.

'   x            Six S tretch ers.                                                                     ^
"                Two s e ts of stretch er w h eels.
                  20 Blankets .
                 Six P illo w s.
                  One Minute-Man R esu scita tor.

        (ix )    Telephone F a cilities

                 A telephone facility would appear to be basic in 1979. T his could be

  For the attention of Mr. D. Vaughan


 Dear Sirs,
                                          Sheffield Wednesday Football Club
                                            Emergency Lighting Installation
                   Further to our discussions with Mr. K. Jones, we would
 like to set down in detail our proposals for the upgrading of
 the emergency lighting facilities at the above Club.
                   At present there is a large central battery system
providing 240 volts D.C. which is arranged to serve the West
 and South Stands, and adjacent areas.                                                     This is achieved by an
automatic changeover on mains failure, from AC mains to the
DC battery supply for those circuits providing the essential
tungsten lighting.                                      For the North Stand and adjacent areas,
there is available a second YEB supply to act as a back up in
the event of a loss of the normal supply.
                   We are proposing at this stage that new emergency circuits
and fittings be installed to serve the Penistone Road exits,
Spion Kop, the North Stand, the North-West Terrace,, the West
Stand, the South-West Terrace and the Leppings Lane exit.
The existing normal lighting for the West Stand will be excluded
from the battery load, and the spare battery capacity made
available will serve the new emergency installation.

SAFETX A. -r’v-liJ GuOUtiDS AC* ^ ■<71>

Following a t-?.?t and -appraisal of the emergency procedure at w e 5p.: _-.‘field
•Wedn.escay         rseia iust prior to cue corsc.enceaent of the Mil!; Cup Hatch
on Tuesday      octooer* 1933, please find ,ty observations bslo-ws-

1.    On this occasion mo prio# warning was given by the Fire Service
      of the •intension to test the emergency procedure,   Inis-was   w»

      in oraer t;*at staff reactions could be observed when they thox
       that trie;/ were responding to a genuine emergency.

2.    The proceoure was initiated oy the announcement, over tne puoiic
       address system of the message “Will Hr. iters* Knight report to ‘c!ie
       Secretary's office". It was cancelled approciaately five minutes
     . later ay the announcement of "Mr. Derek Knight need not now a:, tend
       tne Secretary’s office*'.

3.. My Officers questioned a number of stewards manning tne exit gates
    at both I^eppings Lane and Penistone Road ends of the ground. In
    both instances the stewards had not heard the emergency procedure
    announcement and therefore had not carried out their duties in relation
  ■ to the evacuation procedure.

4.   Further investigation revealed that, in a number of areas, listed below,
      tns puDiic ac-aress system was not audible.

      (a)      Area between the .cop and Penistone jload exits.            <

      (b)      Area between the west stand and Leppings Lane exits.

      (c)      Walkways at ground and upper levels to rear of North Stand.

      (d)      Areas in South Stand.

      (e)      Parking area.

      There are speakers at tne rear of the west stand but these were not working
      on the night of the test. It is possible that speakers at the Penistone
      Road end may have been removed o r are not functioning correctly because of
        - f
Sheffield Wednesday F.C                -   2   -          7th October, 1953



       the alterations currently being carried out at that end of the ground.

5.    Because of the problem with the audibility of the public address system
      it was not possible for my Officers to assess the effectiveness of the
      emergency procedures. They did, however, report that the stewards they
      questioned would have known what to do if the message had been heard
      by them.

6.    A number of stewards were not wearing identifiable dress, i.e. fluorescent
       tabards, as required by condition 9 ( c ) of your General Safety Certificate.

7»    My Officers also reported that staff manning refreshment bars in the
       north and soutft stands did not know the position of fire alarm call
       points or the position of and how to use fire extinguishers.

I have informed Hr. D. Vaughan (Secretary Officer Working Party) c;' the
problems listed above and he will oe arranging a site neeting as soon as
possible to resolve the matter of the public address system. Iters 6 is
a matter which I think you can deal with yourself.

On the subject of staff training, which is a condition placed on the Club
by the General Safety Certificate, I am prepared to make my Officers
available to Instruct your stewards and staff members in the emergency
procedure and use of fire extinguishers.

Please contact Divisional Officer Johnson at the above address if you wish
to take advantage of this offer or if you require any clarification on the
contents of this letter.

Yours sincerely,

  Dear Mr. Wright,

  SAFETY OF SPORTS GROPSDS ACT 1975

  Further to your letter of the 7th October re your visit and
  appraisal of the emergency procedure at this ground on
  Tuesday, 4th October, when your Divisional Officer Johnson
  came to see me after the match and explained thatiin his
  opinion there were'dead1areas in our ground, as it appeared
  that stewards had not heard the emergency announcement, to
  say the least this surprised me, as only this last close
  season have we had the P.A. System further improved.

  I have taken the opportunity this morning to try out the
  system in all the areas that were supposedly 'deadj and
  I must report that everything that was said, was heard
  clearly and distinctly.

  I have informed Hammerton Road police of this, and it
  has been suggested to me that perhaps it would be a
  sensible idea for one or two of your officers to come
  to the ground at say 1.00 o’clock on Saturday, 29th
  October when we play Huddersfield Town and go around the
  ground with the police and hear the broadcasts for them­
  selves.

 Yours sincerely,




 Secretary.

                  Sheffield United - Building Surveyors Memorandum
                  of 11th April
       2   .
                  The contents of the memorandum were noted and it was
                  agreed that the situation should be kept under review.


                  Owlerton Sports Stadium - Safety Management Plan

                  Mr.         presented the Safety Management Plan which is
                  designed to be capable of amendment in appropriate
                  circumstances. The idea is to place a large scale plan
                  in the stadium control room. The plan itself would then
                  provide complete information as to lines of communication,
                  stewarding, fire extinguishers, etc., at a glance. It was
                  agreed th a tjth e plan was a most useful inovation.


                  Owlerton Sports Stadium - Access Around the Whole Stadium
      ST
                  After some discussion it was agreed that access should be
                  maintained around the whole stadium even on the top of the
                  old south terrace.: This particular footpath should be
                  restored to a suitable condition.

                  Owlerton Sports Stadium - Capacity

                  The Capacity ofr the stadium was again discussed at some                                  The Fire
                  l e n g t h ^ The Fiins .Service indicated that they could not                            Service -to
                  give advice off'exit widths until some idea had been                                      enquire
                  obtained from theCompany as to its future plans for                                       further
                  the stadiuou- The point was made that although exit                                       into the
                  widths could b£ recommended for a 4,000 capacity those                                    capacity
                  widths would need to increase if the capacity was to be                                   question.
                  raised at a subsequent time. It is therefore desirable
                  to set a exit width, etc., at appropriate levels to
                  prevent the need for expensive works later on.

I attach a copy of a Press Release issued by the County Council today,
in response to requests for information by the media on the situation
in South Yorkshire following Saturday’s trafic events at Bradford.

It is reasonable to assume that revised advice and/or requirements
will be issued by the Home office in the near future, and naturally
this will be taken into account at the forthcoming "sumaer* Inspections
by the Officer Working Parties.

In the meantime and recognising that the season has ended, 2 would
particularly stress the vital necessity for safety stewards to be fully
aware of and trained in their duties on the Banning and opening of doors
and gates on egress routes and in the use of fire fighting equipment.

                                                     Yours faithfully,




                                                     Chief Executive.

Dear Sir,

Guide to Safety at Sports Grounds - 1<>86 Fdition

I refer to the revised Guide which vaa recently published by R.M. Government
following the Poppelwell Report.  I would litre to draw your attention to the new
Guide and particularly to Chapter 2 entitled "Wanagenent Responsibility"*

This Chapter sets out in detail the sort    matter# which ground management
should be responsible for and I regard it as essential that the management of
designated stadia should be entirely faniliar with it and follow its guidance.

Would you please, therefore, confix* in writing:-

(a) that you have obtained and Intend to retain on the premises a copy of the
    Guide;

(b) that your Company and its Officers are familiar with the Guide and Intend
    to perform the nanageeent duties outlined in Chapter 2 of the Guide; the
    Company should also take immediate steps to appoint a Safety Officer as
    defined in Chapter 2 and confirmation of that appointment should be sent to
    the Council as soon as possible.

Yours faithfully.

 For the attention of Mr, D. Vaughan.


 Dear Mr.             Vaughan,

                            She f f i e l d W e dnesday F o o t b a l l C lub L t d .
                                R a d i a l Fences at Leppings Lane End

               We have bee n instructed by the Club to organise the
 ins t a l l a t i o n of two radial fences o n the terrace at the
 Leppings             lane en d of th3 ground.

               It is i n t e n d e d that these fences are so positioned
 that they divide this sectioij of the terrace into
 approximately three equal areas, eac h served by its own
 entrance.

               By dividing the terrace more control over supporters
 sh o u l d result.                   A visiting team w i t h only a few followers
 w i l l be allocated one section, w i t h the other two sections
 r e t a i n e d by the home supporters.

               Larger contingents of v i s i t i n g spectators could be
 a c c o m m o d a t e d in two or all three areas as their numbers
 dictate.

               A 1.15 metre wide gate is proposed at the rear of
 e a c h fence to give access for maintenance and also policing
 d u r i n g a game.                  The gate could be left open, but fastened
 back,          to connect               the areas during a game if adjacent ones


                                                       Registered in England -   No. 1134531
        EASTWOOD & PARTNERS




           are accupied by supporters of the same team.               When establishing
           the height we have c o nsidered that the views to the corner
           flags should not be r e s t r i c t e d any further than they are at
           present by the perimeter             fence.   We therefore propose that the
           top of the fence should be approximately 1680mm above the
           terrace.

                   T h i s may not prevent the odd spectator climbing the fence
           but sho u l d eliminate a mass invasion from one area to the other.
           Fences     this height appear to w o r k successfully at St.         James's
J          Park,    the home of Newcastle United.

                   We w o u l d be pleased if this specific point can be discussed
           w i t h i n the W o r k i n g Party and your comments forwarded to us.

                   Also to be included in the same contract are some gates at
           v arious    locations around the north stand.           Now the gymnasium is
           o pen to the general public security to ether parts of the ground
           irust be maintained.             It is propo s e d that gates are provided at
           the top of the ramps at both ends of the stand with additional
           gates at ground floor level at the Penistone R oad end of the
           stand.      A separate gate will be placed behind the west ramp to
           prevent people going r o u n d the rea r of the gymnasium towards
           L e p pings Lane.

Dear Mr. Vaughan,
                                       Safety of Sports Grounds Act, 1975
                                       Sheffield Wednesday Football Club
           Thank you              for your letter of 8 September.                                              I am grateful
to you for accepting our letter of 2 September                                                                as giving
 the formal 21 days notice under paragraph 5(2) of the
General Safety Certificate.
    Tenders have to be returned by 23 September and we shall
be reporting to the club shortly thereafter.                                                              Normally the
 contractor would commence on site in not more than about two
weeks from receipt of order.                                                    Thus work is likely to begin
in early October subject to there being no objection from the
County Council.
           We may be wishing to place the formal order for the work
on about 2 4 or 25 September so that if there is the likelihood
 of suggestions for major changes to our proposed scheme, I should
be grateful if I could have notice by that time.


                                                                                   Yours sincerely,

  For the attention of Mr. D. Vaughan

  Dear Mr. Vaughan,
                            Sheffield Wednesday Football Club
                          Radial Fences at Leppings Lane End
                                           and Security Gates

                  The work on the radial fences and security gates
   indicated on our drawings 3563/1-3 which we sent to you on
   2 September 1981, is now substantially complete.
         Three first team home games have been played since the
   fences were erected.                                          We have not heard any formal comments
   from the Working Party about the operation of the fences and
   their access gates but we understand that representatives of the
    South Yorkshire Police have inspected the work and they are
   satisfied with the new arrangements.
                  To increase security it is proposed that pairs of gates

Dear Sir,

Safety of Sports Grounds Act, 1975
Sheffield Wednesday Football Club Ltd.                   ----

In reply to your letter dated 14th December, 1981, X understand that
the Building Authority has contacted your office direct for clarification
on a small number of points regarding the proposed installation of pairs
of gates at the bottom of the two staircases at the back of the West
Stand. Subject to the satisfactory resolution of these points and, of
course, to the gates being secured in the fully open position during the
time the public parts of the stadium are occupied when matches are
being played, the Officer Working Party has no objection to the proposals.

As regards the radial fences installed on the West Terrace and the
security gates around the North Stand, the Officer Working Party wishes
to make the following comments:-

(a)   Radial Barriers on West Terrace

The matches placed at the stadium since the installation of the barriers
confirm that they appear to be working well and satisfactorily effect the
segregation of opposing groups of fans. However, the entire section of
the Terrace has yet to be given to one group of fans.

The Police inform me that, on installation of the new radial barriers,
the existing crush barriers have been extended in some places up to and
completely through the new radial barriers at a height of 4'6” or so
from the ground. The effect is to make it very easy for fans to climb
from one pen to another.  In other places the existing crueh barrier
rails have been cut off short of the radial barriers in a manner which
leaves dangerous pieces protruding m t o some of the gangways.

(b)   Security Gates around the North Stand

You will recall that my   letter of 14th September, 1981 stated that,
provided that the gates   and/or their supports, hinges, etc., do not
impinge on the existing   critical ramp widths, the Officer Working Party
saw no objection to the   erection of the security gates.

I am informed that the maimer in which the gates have been installed
has resulted in each gate’s hinge inpinging at least 71" into the width
of the ramp. This means that there is a 15” reduction in width of the

              As the Annual winter inspection of the Hillsborough Stadium is due
              to take place anytime around now, I would suggest the opportunity be
              taken to discuss these matters at the inspection.

               Perhaps you would contact Mr. D. Vaughan of my staff (extension 422)
               so that the necessary arrangements may be made.

               An additional c o py ‘of this letter is attached for your use.

                                   I believe the small number of points needing

             in fact already provided by the sheeting frame.                                                                    There is
             also a small amount of rust staining arising from misplacement
             of reinforcement in the 100mm thick retaining wall.                                                                    There
              is no immediate danger arising from this and an appropriate
             maintenance repair will be carried out.
                                   Turning now to the radial barriers on the West
             terrace it is of course accepted that where there is a
             crush barrier passing through or close to the radial barrier
              it will make it easier for anyone who so wishes to climb
             over.                 Nevertheless we believe it is not unreasonable to
              leave the crush barriers as they are.                                                            If all barriers
             were removed back to a distance say 1.2m from the fence it
             would mean a 2.4m wide gap which is not protected by barriers.
                                                                                                                                            - "■ v "         c c

 There would be aconsequent loss of calculated spectator
 capacity which is undesirable from the Club's point of
 view.     However from the point of view of safety a strip
 of that width without a single crush barrier would be a
 major hazard.
 ----- It should be kept in mind that the introduction
 of these radial barriers has effected a very great
 improvement from the point of view of segregation of
 spectators but to achieve perfection from the point of
 view of segregation brings with it other disadvantages.
 I believe that what we have done is a reasonable compromise
 between the various interests.
           In the second paragraph on this subject you
 refer to dangerous pieces of rails protruding from the
 crush barriers.       I have not had an opportunity to check
 this since receiving your letter but I am informed that
 the word 'dangerous' is a little exaggerated and they
 do not of course protrude into a gangway as there is no
 gangway at this position.
           With regard to the security gates around tne North
 stand the point at issue is whether the encroachment into
 the gate width is at all critical.       The remaining clear
 width is 3.300mm which is equivalent to a six unit exit.
 Thus the theoretical number of people who can get out in
 eight minutes using the green book figure of 60 people
 per minute per exit width is 5,760 shared between the two
 routes.     The stand capacity is of course 10,000 and in
 practice more than half the number tend to use the lower
 exits since most spectators are reluctant to walk uphill
 to the upper set of exit stairways.       The picture is that
 fewer than 5,000 people will be trying to get out of
 exits which can accommodate 5,760 in eight minutes.
        There were very good structural reasons for placing
the gates in this way.   The theoretical exit capacity has
not been changed since it was always a six unit gateway.
There is no funnelling effect, and there is a good
'reservoir' area upstream of the gates.
        I telephoned your office yesterday but gather
you were on leave and have again telephoned this morning
with a view to agreeing a tentative date for the winter
meeting of the working party.    I will try again in the
next day or so.


                                Yours sincerely,

 For the attention of Mr D Vaughan

Dear Mr Vaughan,
            Sheffield Wednesday Football Club Ltd
            Segregation of Visiting Spectators at Leppings Lane End

             The club is anxious to segregate the visiting team's supporters
 as they enter the ground, and also to enable the police to control
 their exit at the end of a game.
     We have prepared the scheme shown on the attached print of our
 drawing 6705/2. This involves the construction of two new banks of
 turnstiles (Nos 17 - 21 and 22 - 29), and various runs of fencing
 and new gates.
     It would be appreciated if the Working Party could consider this
 proposal at an early date. Mr Chester has already given a copy of
 the drawing to the police so that they have had some advance notice.




                                                                                         Yours sincerely,




 c.c. Mr R. Chester                                                                    ______________________

    For the attention of Mr. D. Vaughan

    Dear Mr. Vaughan,
                         Safe-cy of Sports Ground Act 1975
                       Sheffield Wednesday Football Club PLC
                    Thank you for your letter of 2 May giving the comments
    of the Officer Working Party on the proposals which we sent
    to you on 9 April.
)           In the irterim period several of the points which you
    raised had already been incorporated in our latest scheme
which has yet to be considered by the Club Board.                                                 However I
would ask that further consideration should be given to the
request in paragraph (c) of your letter for a second gate to
be installed in the radial barrier and for the new radial
barrier which you have asked for to have two gates.                                                If these
gates are meant for use in emergency it would mean having                                                     a
steward in attendance on each occasion, the expense of which
would hardly be justified.                                         It is our view that in the event of
emergency,spectators can be evacuated quickly enough by the
gates on to the pitch and by the normal exit gates at the rear.
We will of course be prepared to discuss the matter with the
Fire Officer's staff should you so wish.

                                                                             Yours sincerely.

        Dear Sira,

        Safety of Sports Grounds Act, 1975
        Sheffield Wednesday Football Club PLC

        In reply to your letter of 8th May, the extra gates referred to in paragraph
        (c) of ray earlier letter of 2nd May were included primarily at the request
        of the South Yorkshire Police.

        Provided that the remainder of the points raised by the Officer Working Party
        are incopporated in the latest proposals (yet to be considered by the Club)»
        the Police are prepared to concede the request for two gates per radical fence
        in the right liand area of the Mappings Lane End Terrace (indicated as home
        supporters’ terrace on the plan).

                                                      *£       •-**
                                        .   Yours faithfully.

(g)    Plan No. 6 705/14A - so long as increased thickness is achieved
by steep slopes as indicated on the plan and not by "stepped" arrangements
to give foothold, the proposals are satisfactory but the possible need to
take measures on top of the wall to discourage persons from attempting to
clihh over will have to be borne in mind;

(h)    Plan No. 6705/16A - in view of experiences last yaar, the front
corner of the Spion Kop (by the crash Barriers numbered 5, 8 and 22) to
either have a Pitch Perimeter Fence Gate or radial barrier<s) to overcome
possible lateriilcrushing hazard whan. large crowds are present;

(i)    Plan No. 6705/17 - for both security access and emergency egress
purposes, a Pitch Perimeter Fencs Gate to be provided;

(j)    Stewarding of New Gates - aa mentioned i n my letter of 2nd May,
1985, it is essential that all the new gates are fully supervised by
Stewards, who oust be fit, able and properly trained.

For the attention of Mr. D. Vaughan


Dear Mr. Vaughan,
                                    Safety of Sportsground Act, 1975
                         Sheffield Wednesday Football Club PLC
               Thank you very much for your letter of 30 July giving the
outcome of the Working Party meeting on 29 July.                                                We note
the general comment that the calculations have to be approved
by the Building Surveyors Department.                                        We believe that all the
calculations which are likely to be required have been sent for
checking and comment.
               With regard to your detailed observations our response
is as follows                                                                                                  T'"
(a)            We are                  sure of the location on the West terrace of
the proposed, effifra security gate*:                                    There is already a gate in
the 2m wide g a ^ f o r m e d by the new radial fence for use by the
police.           This same gate will still be available for the spectators
in emergency as" there are gates into the 2m gap from the terrace
which will be under the control of the police.                                                This point may
perhaps be clarified during the Working Partyrs visit on 7 August.

(b)            The foundations~for this fence are in fact already aligned in
                                An Unlimited Company, Registered in England -    No. 1833144     >
                                                                                                              *v        *• •        s.
                                                                      SHEET



  jASTWOOD St PARTNERS




      the way you suggest.

      (c > and (d)
               We are a little surprised by the suggestion that a
      single block thickness is not sufficient for the cubicle
      walls.    The inside of a toilet cubicle is not a very
      vulnerable area and the walls are braced by the door frame.
      Stadding is not at all suitable in terms of strength or
      durability, and would probably invite vandalism.

      (e>      The refreshment area is under the most westerly
      staircase up to the north west corner terrace.     There will
      be? an opportunity to inspect on 7 August.

               The handrail is to be at a height of 1250mm (4'1")
      abetve the horizontal step, measured at the face of the vertical


               The stepping of the face of the wall is achieved by 45°
      chamfers which will not form good footholds.

      f'lxjt   Mr. Chester says that the club will certainly not
      object to the provision of another gate at this point, and
      th© precise location can be discussed on 7 August.

               As with point (a), we are not sure what is intended,
      aneir the matter can be discussed on 7 August.

       til     Your comment regarding stewarding will no doubt, be
      fcaJken care of by Mr. Chester.


               It will be much easier for your Working Party to
      appreciate what is intended when they see the works under
      constructicni^te: There will also be an opportunity to see
; r   the metal decking of the South stand.     :


                                  Yours sincerely,




      cr.cr.   Mr. R.H. Chester

      Note of a meeting held at the Hillsborough Stadium, Sheffield on
                            7th August, 1985

PRESENT:    Representing the Sheffield Wednesday Football Club pic

            Dr. W. Eastwood (Messrs. Eastwood & Partners)
            P. Hough (Deputy Secretary)

            Representing the Officer Working Party (Sheffield District)

1.    Purpose of Meeting.

The purpose of the meeting was to carry our the "summer” inspection of the
Stadium with particular reference to the Leppings Cane end improvements and
the metal sheeting of the upper seated area of" the South Stand.

2.    Ground Inspection..                          .- -

A.    Leppings Lane En d ' ...                                         ■

The progress of. the works to segregate visiting, supporters Behind and on the
West Terrace and Stand were inspected with particular reference to the
points raised at the Officer Wovking Party’s meetings held on 29th July,
(forwarded to Messrs. Eastwood and Partners by the Chief Executive's letter
of 30th July) and Messrs. Eastwood 4 Partners reply of 1st August.
           . .....                                 -•              .


Messrs. Eastwo^JjL Partners had confirmed that all the calculations which
were likely to be* required had now been sent to the &sildin&. Authority for
checking and cooaent*

On the inspection^ the Building Authority pointed out what they considered
to be the poor^ standard.of workmanship i n .the construction of the new
dividing wall^vbfch was_ being built behind the Stand. The position of the
Police Personnel access gate and the stepping of the face of the wall by .
45 chamfers         not to form footholds were acceptable.

The foundations^of t h e n e w handrail by Turnstile 23 had actually been"5
aligned so a^^gfeataintain the exit width between the outer (river) wall
and the Turnst    (unlike the indication on the plan subnitted).
                                                                           •H' ■ j -*   .-
As regards the single block thickness t>f the internal walls of the cubicles
in the new male and female toilet facilities at the rear of the stand,
Messrs. Eastwood and Partners considered that the inside of a toilet cubicle
was not a very vulnerable area, and pointed out tliat the walls were braced
by both the outer walls and the door frames. The Building Authority noted
the assurances given by Dr. Eastwood, but expressed concern that the
     dividing walls in the new toilet facilities evidently did not have any
     foundations, apparently having been built straight onto the existing
     concrete-slabs. It was noted that there were some 9 inch thick brick walls
     in the Male Toilets, it being considered that any hooliganism or vandalism
     would be more likely to occur there than in the Female Toilets.

     The Club pointed out that the new toilet facilities would not be completely
     finished by the first match of the season (on 17th August) but that
     temporary facilities would be available and that no building material would
     be left on site.

     The position of the new refreshment area under the most westerly staircase
     up to the North-West corner terrace was noted. This again had been built
     straight onto the existing concrete slabs.

      On the Terrace itself, it was noted that there was an existing gate in the
      new 2 m. wide gap formed by the new radial fence for use by thePolice.
      This gate would still be available for the use ofspectators in an
      emergency as the gates at the top of the Terrace under the control of the
      Police would enable spectators to be directed down the 2 m. wide gap.
     However, it was agreed that steps or a longer gate would be required. It
     I M S also agreed that a new gate would be required from the new South
     Jimtiral Terrace Pen.

     As regards the upper seated stand area, Messrs. Eastwood and Partners had
     sent by letter dated 2nd August plans of the new fences and barriers in
     both the Stand and at the Access level.
                       ..               .   ...              . -    .      -   -   --     ■   • ■ ; fT '   ■
     IT WAS AGREED

     (a)   that the condition of the internal walls in the new male and female
     toilet facilities at the rear of the Stand should be monitored;

     (b)   that the.existing gate in the pitch perimeter fence should either be
     extended or have steps to provide easier access from the new 2 m. wide gap
     formed by the new1
                      'radial fence;                       ■          ■ y ^ . -.

     (c)   that a new gate in the pitch perimeter fence should be provided from
     the new South Central Terrace Pen;                       ^      ;

     (d)   that the advertising hoardings at the front of the upper seated stand
     area should be securely fixed to the concrete wall;            t- r      v;

     (e)   that the spalling of the concrete of the wall at the front of the
     upper seated stand area should receive attention as a matter of maintenance;

     (f)   that the”corrosion o f thettsteel columns at the rear of the Stand*
     should receive attention on'a maintenance basis.

     Messrs. Eastwood 1 PartnerV reported that" the’conditibn' o^T the^ upper"
     concrete outer^ f^p:ion o F the exterior wall of the Stand had been 3     ^ 3
     investigated and was considered to be satisfactory.

     It was noted thif£r"the metal sheeting of the wooden upper portion of the
     Stand had been largely completed, and the spraying of the non-slip
     surface was to commence very shortly (and certainly be completed by the
     start of the season).
IT WAS AGREED that the metal sheeting of the wooden upper portion of the
Stand should largely overcome the f lammability problems inherent in such
timber structures, and the. Club stated that they would ensure that the
wooden intermediate steps were securely replaced upon completion of the
laying of the metal sheeting.                             ■



Messrs. Eastwood & Partners recalled that outline details oC'jjihe CluV* s
proposal to cover the Spion Kop had been sent for the information of the
Officer Working Party by letter dated 22nd July. As part of %Tiat scheme,
the bridge portion of the Kop would be removed. Its present condition
remained acceptable with continuing maintenance.

In view of experiences last season, the Clubwererequestedto.provide an
additional gate in the pitch perimeter fence in the frontcornernearest
to the South Stand to overcome the lateral crushing hazard which wm i a
occur when large crowds were present.            - -     >
                                                         ■      ■

IT WAS AGREED that the Club would provide a new gate in the pitch perimeter
fence in the front corner nearest to the South Stand with a
arrangement to assist access and egress.             ‘ 7 -




D.   North Stand

The temporary storage facilities created by the erection of a timber wall
(in front of the Ladies' Changing Facilities in the Sports Hall) were
inspected.   :.v < ;    ■               -                  v*;-.    '' /.•;

IT WAS AGREED that so long as light combustibles (such as paint) were not
stored in this area, its use continued to be acceptable on a temporary
basis.          :_\ _

E.   Closed Circuit Television Facilities

The advantages for general crowd control and security (both in axvl.'outside
the Stadium) which would be given by the recently installed Closed %ixxs£i3:
Television System were explained to the Officer Working Party*

IT WAS AGREED

(a)   that a 2| kg. C02 Fire Extinguisher should be installed in "both the
Police Control Box and 'the Disc Jockey Box;

(b)   that loose external wires on the outside of the Boxes should "he made
secure.

Dear Sirs,

Safety of Sports Grounds Act, 1975                                                -V;:
S h e f f i e l d Wednesday F o o t b a l l C lu b p i c

The Officer Working Party (Sheffield District) met yesterday afternoon to
consider the proposals contained in your letter dated 25th October, .1985
and accompanying plans.

1.       D is a b le d F a c i l i t i e s

The Officer Working Party expressed reservations on both of yotir suggestions
for the disabled. If the disabled continue to be accommodated in front of
the North Stand, they will still be in the "firing line" of mistimed shots
and any clear sheeting over the top of the area they occupy could constitute
an unacceptable hazard to persons who might vacate the North Stand in an
emergency situation by climbing over the front wall of the stand onto the
pitch perimeter. It is accepted that the means of escape does sot provide
for this to be done, but it has to he recognised that in practice this is a
real possibility. The structural strength of such a structure could also be
something of a problem. The other suggestion of accommodating the disabled
in front of the perimeter fence along fhe front of the Spion Kop (nearest to
the North Stand) is also unacceptable for the reasons stated by you.

The suggestion of the Police representatives was that the front area of the
lower Spion Kop (nearest to the North Stand) should have the temcing,
levelled to provide, say, a twoltier level landing on which to.accommodate
the disabled, with a substantial fence at the rear. The existing pitch
perimeter fence in front of tfcss area could be removed, and the disabled
could continue to gain access from the ramp between the Spion Kbp and the
North Stand as at present. This would also enable free access by the
disabled to the proposed disabled toilets under the rebuilt terracing of
the Spion Kop.                                                    .


                                                                                /Contd . . .




Messrs. Eastwood & Partners,
Consulting Engineers,
St. Xndrews House,
23 K i n g f i e l d   Road,
S h e ffie ld .
                                  - 2 -                                  14 November 1985


The current legislation relating to the disabled was also discussed.
In the circumstances, the Officer Working Party consider that the
proposals for the disabled suggested by the Police should b« supported
subject, of course, to there being no obstruction of exit routes and
flows.

2.     Enlarged Spion Kop

The Officer Working Party agreed with your calculations and proposals to
increase the tunnel exit on the north side of the Spion Kop to 8 clear
units and to provide a complete new 6 unit staircase on the South side.

Accordingly, the Officer Working Party agree that, subject to the following
points, the proposals for hhe enlarged Spion Kop are generally acceptable:-*

(a)     adequate headroom being provided between the new roof and the upper
      1 rear and the new south side exit routes;
(b)    to barriers being provided adjacent to the refurbished gents'
        toilets and the new ladies’ toilets in the new six unit staircase
        on the south side;
(c)    to landings being constructed in front of the existing emergency
        gates in the pitch perimeter fence (as at Bramall Lane);
(d)     to confirmation of the number of new turnstiles to be provided on
        the south side and on the Penistone Road side;
(e)     until acceptable alternatives are available, the new exit gates to
        be fitted with a turn-bar arrangement under the control of stewards.

3.     Roofing of Spion Kop

It was accepted that only an outline of the roofing proposals has been supplied
to date, but the Building Authority point out that it appears that the gables
are not to be lined and thus it would be comparatively easy for them to be
climbed.

Also the Police asked me to stress that should any of the proposed works on
enlarging or roofing the Spion Kop take place other than in the ci&se season,
it will be a requirement that the areas concerned will have to be secured to
prevent unauthorised access.

4.      Crowd Flow at the Leppings Lane end of the Stadium

The Police reported on the continuing problems, caused by the merging of spectators
from all parts of the Stadium at the Leppings iane end.

It was agreed that it was difficult to see how this could be overcome, as the
physical restraints to ac&ceve this could conceivably be more of a danger than
allowing the present position to continue, but I was requested to register the
point.

                                          -Yours faithfully,

              Dr. Eastwood reported that the sheeting of tfceeriiarged Spion Kop at
              the rear and sides would result in the structure'being virtually
              sealed. In reply to queries from the County FireJService, he confirmed

         (opened on Monday) for the enlarged, roofed Spion "Xop. "He still considered
         that any such proposals would involve the loss of-up toil,000 of the extra
         5,000 spectator places which would be provided by tlie enlar^ed Spion Kop,
        Other areas of the Stadium had also been considered and investigated, but '
        none could provide as large a flat, easily accessible area as that in front of
        the North Stand, which had been successfully used for so long without any major
        problems. Up to 80 disabled persons, plus attendants, used the area. The only
        major drawback he saw was that when there was a strong southerly wind, rain
        could be blown onto the disabled, despite the cantilever xowf o f the North
        Stand extending virtually to the pitch. For this reason, the d u b were willing
        to roof an area from approximately the letter ”0” on the results "board to the
     , -end of the Stand (nearest to the Spion Kop) with a substantial Toof, including
        armoured glass where there might be a visibility problem, provided that this
        was supported by the Officer Working Party.                                       ^

      Whilst accepting much of what Dr. Eastwood said, the Officer Working Party
      (and the Police representatives in particular) still expressed some concern as
      to whether making semi-permanent facilities for the disabled in front of the
      North Stand was the appropriate and correct thing to do.

      The Building Authority confirmed that, after further investigations, it was
      considered that the disabled facilities requirements of the Building
      Regulations 1985 did not appear to strictly apply to the roofing of the
      enlarged Spion Kop.

 As previously mentioned by Dr. Eastwood, the possibility of providing an
 increased widthaccess to the pitch area (between the: North Stand and the
 Spion Kop) foT possible use by emergency vehicles, as well as for maintenance
 by the Cliib was discussed. The facility could be incorporated into the
 enlarged Spion~^p jaroposals relatively easily.

 It WAS AGREED that, Whilst the County Fire Service felt that such a facility
 was not essential £or their purposes, it could be useful for use by emergency
 vehicles in certain situations and generally should be supported.

 Dr. Eastwood indicated the extent of the work to construct the enlarged,
 roofed, S p i o n ' K o p a n d confirmed that steps would be taken to prevent
 unauthorised access to areas where work might be in progress during the

               Items of maintenance which it is suggested should be carried
 out in the reasonably near future.


 1.            Some of the fencing posts at the top of the Kop need painting
               near the base.


 2.            The fencing at the rear side of the gangway over the lower
               exit from the Kop is becoming very corroded.


  3.           The concrete posts forming part of the retaining wall at the
               foot of the bank at the rear of the Kop (behind Penistone
               Road turnstiles)                           are showing signs of spalling due to
               corrosion of the reinforcement.                                          The cracks should be repaired
               with either liquid epoxy or by epoxy mortar.


  4.           The Denso tape wrapping on some of the starter bars at the
               back of the North West c o m e r is coming loose.


  5.           Cracks running from the top to near the bottom of the concrete
               terrace at the North West c o m e r have grown more pronounced
               in the past year with salts leached out of the concrete
               being deposited on the underside.                                           These cracks should be

                                                        Registered in England -   No. 1134531
         sealed to prevent the reinforcement corroding.


    6.   There is a very small area of rust spalling on the
         ballustrade at the front of the West stand.


    7.   The boundary wall at the South West c o m e r needs
)        pointing in places.


    8.   Certain timbers in the roof of the South stand may    be
         suffering from damp penetration.      These can be checked
         when part of the roof is examined at the end of 19 80.

                        Certain other items of maintenance work which it is
                suggested should be carried out in the near future have been
                recommended to the Club.    A list is attached.

                        New toilets and turnstiles have recently been constructed
                behind Spion Kop.     During these operations the ramp down the
       :        back of Spion Kop was disturbed by movement of the embankment.
                In particular the hand rail and concrete wall guarding the
                edge of the gangway moved sideways.     The hand rail and wall
                have now been tested in accordance with the requirements of
                the Code of Practice and in all but one case, where there was
                excessive deflection of a hand rail post, successfully
                resisted the test load.

                        Following these inspections and tests, I certify that in
                my opinion the various structures on the ground are in a
                 satisfactory condition and are appropriate for the stadium to
                be used to the full capacity laid down in the Certificate of
                Ground Safety.

  Dear Mr . VaughdJi,
                                      Sheffield Wednesday Football Club Ltd.
                                                Testing of Crush Barriers
                    The barriers at the North West corner of the ground
  are due to be tested this year, which will complete the fi:rst
  fiveyear cycle.                     As the ground is being used by a congress of
  Jehovah's Witnesses during early July, we shall be carrying
  out the tests during June.
                    Mr. Sheriff will be informed of the arrangements so
  that he can carry out his usual inspections.


                                                                                         Yours sincerely,

                       As requested in your letter to the Club date d 8
       January,                we reply to your letter dated 4 December.                                                     We will
       r e p l y to your earlier letter,                                          dated 22 April,                in the nex t
       c o u p l e of d a y s .

                       G o i n g through the list of items accompanying your
       l e t t e r of 4 December the f o l l o w i n g are being done or have
(_)    a l r e a d y bee n done b y the gr o u n d staff - ±.l,                                                 1.3,     1.5,        1.6,
       1.8,            2.1,     2.2,      3.1,         3.2 and 4.1.

                       T he concrete post m e n t i o n e d in item 1.2 has bee n
       t a k e n down and a n e w b a r r i e r rail fitted to an existing
       s t e e l post.

                       I have not had the o p p o r t u n i t y of speaking to Dr.
       E a s t w o o d about the rail in item 1.4.                                            He left for
       A u s t r a l i a the day after I r e t u r n e d from six weeks leave
       However,                enclosed is an e x t r a c t from the terrace layout.
       Is      it the rail which is s hown in red that was agreed to?

                       I t e m 1.7 is not understood.                                You will recall that
       j u s t before opening the S pion Kop,                                          handrails were erected

For the attention of Mr. G. Mackrell


Dear Mr. Mackrell,
                                             Safety at Sports Grounds Act 1975
                                                              Barrier Testing 1988

              Over the four days 14,15,18 and 19 July 1983, the fourth
part of our five yearly cycle of barrier testing was carried out.
The barriers tested were numbers 121 to 124, 124A, 125 to 128,
128A, 129 to 136, 136A, 137 to 153 and 187 all of which are on
the lower area of terrace at the Leppings Lane end of the ground.
The location of the barriers tested is shown on our drawing
1610/64E, a print of which is enclosed.
              The load testing was carried out in accordance with the
procedure set out in Appendix C of the 'Guide to Safety at Sports
Grounds 1.
              In all but one case the barriers tested, successfully
withstood the applied load.                                                 A clip over the rail of barrier 124
broke before reaching the full test load.
              Visual inspection of all the barriers on the ground revealed
that some of the ends of the rails are corroded although those
tested on the Spion Kop last year and also those tested                                                                                  o ij   the
Leppings Lane terrace this year all safely supported the test
load.

       The rail on barrier 133 is badly corroded and should be
 replaced now.       There was also a lot of movement of the rail on
 barrier 144, when tested,and we also recommend that that rail
 is also replaced.
       As agreed we have arranged for the clip on barrier 124 to
 be replaced together with rails on barriers 133 and 144, before
 the start of the coming season.
       Enclosed are single copies of our record sheets showing the
 results of the barrier tests.

For the attention of Mr. D. Sheriff


Dear Mr. Sheriff,
                                      Sheffield Wednesday Football Club
                                        Safety of Sports Grounds Act 1975
                                                   Barrier Testing 1988
              Following your telephone call I am very pleased to enclose
a copy of my report to the Club concerning the barrier testing
at the West end of the ground in July, 1988.                                                                 You will see from
the carbon on page 2 that a copy of the letter part of our report
was certainly sent to Mr. Butler in your department and to
Mr. Bownes in the Legal department.                                                          I know it is our normal
practice to send you all the record sheets but if we did not do
so, a full set is now enclosed.
              I also enclose a copy of the test certificate from Sheffield
Testing Works who checked the calibration of the testing equipment
the previous week.


                                                                                 ^fours sincerely,

Por the attention of Mr. G. Mackrell

Dear Mr. Mackrell,
                     Safety at Sports Grounds Act 1975
                           Barrier Testing 1988
      Over the four days 14,15,18 and 19 July 1988, the fourth
part of our five yearly cycle of barrier testing was carried out.
The barriers tested were numbers 121 to 124, 124A, 125 to 128,
128A, 129 to 136, 136A, 137 to 153 and 187 all of which are on
the lower area of terrace at the Leppings Lane end of the ground.
The location of the barriers tested is shown on our drawing
1610/64E, a print of which is enclosed.
      The load testing was carried out in accordance with the
procedure set out in Appendix C of the 'Guide to Safety at Sports
Grounds*•
      In all but one case the barriers tested, successfully
withstood the applied load. A clip over the rail of barrier 124
broke before reaching the full test load.
      Visual inspection of all the barriers on the ground revealed
that some of the ends of the rails are corroded although those
tested on the Spion Kop last year and also those t rsted on the
Leppings Lane terrace this year all safely supported the test
load.
                                                                         2



         The rail on barrier 133 is    badly corroded and should be
    replaced now. There was also a     lot of movement of the rail on
    barrier 144, when tested, and we   also reconmend that that rail
    is also replaced.
         As agreed we have arranged    for the clip on barrier 124 to
    be replaced together with rails    on barriers 133 and 144, before
    the start of the coming season.
         Enclosed are single copies    of our record sheets showing the
    results of the barrier tests.



,                                 Yours sincerely,
                                        i-----------------------------

          DESCRIPTION:                         One hydraulic pump complete with two hydraulic cylinders.
                                               The force on the cylinders, under an applied force is
                                               measured by a pressure gauge mounted on the pump.


          IDENTIFICATION:                       Pump: D948005
                                                Gauge: BGF 168 SR
                                                Cylinder 1: 04773                  Model RC 53AF9N
                                                Clyinder 2: 04772                  Model RC 530J8N


          METHOD

          The calibration was carried out in a Grade 0.5 lever arm testing machine                                                in
          terms of the Technical unit of force the ton force (tonf). The uncertainty                                              of
          the forces applied during the calibration is +0.55&*

          Three tests were made on each cylinder.

          Tests were made to determine the reading indicated on the gauge at fixed loads.

 For the attention of Mr. D. Vaughan


 Dear M r . Vaughan,                                                                 ;

                                  Sheffield Wednesday Football Club pic
              Thank you for your letter of 14 November setting                                                out the
 comments of the officer working party or. the proposals for the
 new roof over the Kop.                                         Our response is as follows


 1.           Disabled Facilities
              First it should be emphasised that the disabled will have
 to be accommodated at ground level.                                                 No other arrangement is
 possible at reasonable expense.                                                  The choice is between putting
 them in front of the North stand or in front of the Kop.
              Considering first the Kop, you will know that the terracing
 drops down below the level of the perimeter track.                                                         It would
 therefore be necessary to place the disabled slabbing^ and-seating
 behind the line of the present perimeter fence.                                                       Each disabled
 chair including manoeuvring space and also a runway in front
 of the chairs occupies the same space as about 20 standing
 spectators.                It would therefore be necessary to sacrifice the

                                      An Unlim ited Company, Registered in England -        No. 1833144
E A S T W O O D £s P A n T u E . l C




 equivalent of about 1000 standing spectator places to accommodate
  50 disabled people and their attendants.                     This would be
 extremely costly.                     The Club has decided to increase the
 capacity of the Kop by 5000 people and the additional cost
 compared with merely roofing over the present Kop is 'in
 excess of £500,000.                      Thus, if 1000 standing places were
  sacrificed the cost to the Club would be £100,000 at least.
 Ancillary expenses would include moving the boundary fence
  and reconstructing it to safety barrier standards plus the
  cost of the concrete hardstanding.                     We also have to keep in
 mind that not only would the spectators be in the firing
  line if anywhere near the goal but that in addition the new
  Kop roof only extends to the front of the terracing so that
  the disabled would be virtually unprotected from rain.
           The alternative proposal of leaving the disabled in front
  of the North stand has the advantage that the cantilevered
  roof extends some way in front of the seating so that there
  is some protection from rain except when the wind is blowing
  from the South.                       The Club would like to give complete
  protection from rain and is prepared to consider tho cost of
  th6 glazed roofing which we have suggested as a possible way
  of increasing the comfort of the disabled.                     The glazing
  would of           course be of toughened glass.
           If the working party has strong reservations about the
  glazing then obviously it will                    not be carried out.     However
  I should stress that there is no possibility of the disabled
  being placed in front of the Kop because of the exorbitant
  cost.          The Club will continue to use the present location and
  the only question to be decided is whether it should be under
  cover or not.                           v
           I            should add that new toilet facilities for the disabled
  are an integral part of the scheme for the Kop and will be
  conveniently placed under the North                     end of the Kop.

2 •    Bn-Larged Spion Kop
       faf   All exit routes will have 2.4m clear head room
       (approximately 8ft.).


       ib}:, JWe will need to discuss the proposed barrier
       adjacent to the new ladies toilet.        The exit route
       widens^out very considerably from 4.1m wide at the
       location where the six unit width has been calculated
       and is approximately 6m wide alongside the toilet block.
       We therefore believe that there is no bottleneck effect
  ,    and that a barrier might merely provide an unseen
       obstruction which could create difficulty.       We will
       forward, a larger scale drawing of the area so that
       our comments can be considered in more detail.


                                  provide the landings in front
       .#£ the existing emergency gates in the pitch perimeter
      :-.feiwje-, jpu. will. 'kjfcpw that there have been changes of
       view on this particular matter in the past and we would
       not wish the Club to be put to the expense of taking
       them orct again when members of the present officer working
       party are, replaced with the passage of time.


       (d)   There will be, four new turnstiles on Penistone
       Road a M six new turnstiles at the South end of the Kop.


       (e)   Gates with a t u m - b a r arrangement will be provided
       at the exits and the Club will of course provide stewards
       to control them-


 3.    Roofing, of Spion Kop
       The gables will be sheeted on the outside face only and
will    not be lined.     This is normal in Kop buildings and we
 think it extremely., unlikely that there will be any difficulty
with hooligans climbing.         The horizontal rails are at such
wide spacings that it would be difficult for even the most
■-agile to climb up.      .. .
3ASTW 0GC C- PAS7WSn£




       We are very mindful of the need to complete the areas
  open to spectators before the start of the new season.        It
  is conceivable that the contractors will have difficulty
  in completing the new terrace steps at the rear of the K op
  before the first game.   In that event secure fencing will
  have to be provided as a temporary measure. However we
  are reasonably confident that the whole of the terrace
  area of the K op will be complete by the due date.     We
  also intend to have all the new exit arrangements completed
  but it is possible that work will still be going on in toilet
  areas, particularly the new toilet for the disabled.


  4.   Crowd Flow at the, Leppings Lane End of the Stadium
       The Club is aware of the difficulties which the Police
  have to contend with at the Leppings Lane end arid; has of
  course been very pleased to help the problem by the maipr
 works which were undertaken during the last close season.
  We find it very difficulty to envisage anything more which
  could be done at reasonable expense.                   '


  5.   Fire Brigate Access to the Front of all Stands
       As part of the works on the Kop, we are completely
  remodelling the area around the existing tunnel.      The
  head room is being increased to 2.4m and the width of the
  tunnel is being increased also.    A considerable amount of
  earth shifting will have to take place and this
  presents an opportunity to widen the gangway so as to
  enable say a fire engine to pass between the North stand
  and the retaining wall of the Kop.      If the Fire Service
  think this is of value, I should be pleased to know the
  width they would like so that we can see whether it can
  be provided at reasonable cost and without sacrificing, too
  many standing spaces.

             Sease months ago we applied for Planning Approval on behalf of
 Sheffield Wednesday Football Club, for a new entrance on Penistone
 Road.         Approval was granted last September.
             €2oepurpose of the entrance is to provide access for the public
 trains tbe- Sgoacts Hall so that they will no longer have to use
 Gate fO %                     also leads to. other parts of .the ground.                                                              Another
 purpose is to jgrovide a separate access for police vehicles, ambulances
 ana vehicles for the disabled which park at the back of the gymnasium
 op     matcfe dayslll|.This effectively reduces any possible dangers which
may resultJBcp^yehlcles having to pass through queuing spectators
whilst                           gain entry through Gate 'O'.                                               .

 showing the layout and details of the proposal.
             Hie comments of the Officer Working Party would be welcomed.
 Tenders have been invited for the work and it is hoped that demolition

                       Dear Mr. Vaughan,


                                       Safety of Sports Grounds Act 1975

                            Since you spoke to me yesterday by telephone, the St. John’s
                       Superintendent rang and I have today had a very long discussion
                       with him about the requirements at the Hillsborough Football
                       Ground. I have put my observations into a separate report which
                       I attach for your perusal* Perhaps you would contact me if you
                       require any elucidation of the points and I would esteem it a
                       favour not to get involved in any long meetings with the Club
                       Officials as there are so many demands on my time that I cannot
                       afford to be away from the office for any length of time.


                                                        Yours sincerely,



                                                                           is

STRUCTOKE

The existing facilities are much below an acceptable standard and I
would suggest the Club consider providing a more permanent structure
which is not likely to require up grading for a very long time. The
internal finish particularly of the Treatment area should be of an
impervious nature so that it can be easily cleaned and rendered
fairly sterile and require no decoration. This can be achieved by
the use of tiles or formica type finish etc..#.

WATTING AREA

The Waiting Area could be arranged within corridor space to minimise
the cost, where sitting cases could wait for attention on chairs.

TREATMENT AREA

The Treatment Area should be sufficient to accommodate two or three
patients at any one time and consideration should be given to the
needs for privacy within the treatment area, bearing in mind that
the three patients may well be lying on couches.

LIGHTING

Good lighting is essential ard at the present time strip lighting
is very much in vogue and would be satisfactory. The provision of
a power point would also appear to be a basic requirement.

WATER

A supply of hot and cold water is essential^ the cold water suitable
for drinking. It would also appear reasonable to request provision
of a hand basin and a la r g e B e l f a s t type sink. The Club should
consider whether it would be cheaper in the long run to provide
stainless steel basins which are not subject to chipping.

TOI1ST REQUIREMENTS

The Club should provide at least one male and one female toilet, for
the use of the public and should consider whether they should provide
an additional toilet for the use of the staff.

STORAGE

Storage facilities are required for six stretchers, and    for two sets
of wheels for stretchers, blankets and other bed linen.    This storage
should be lockable.

EQUIPMENT

The following is a minimum list to provide a basic service.

Treatment couches with lift up ends, two or three in number depending
on space available and/or number of cubicles, if the accommodation is
cubicledo

Six Stretchers.

                                                          (Cont.«.0e)
Two sets of stretcher wheels.

20 Blankets.

Six Pillows.

One Minute-Man Resuscitator.

TEIgPHOKE FACILITIES

A telephone facility would appear to he "basic in 1979« This can be
achieved by an extension from the main switch, or sharing with police

CAR PARKTKG

The Club may also consider what facilities should be extended to the
St. John's personnel for the parking of staff cars.

AMBUIAKCES

Access for ambulances at the present time appears to be adequate but
must not be overlooked in any redesigning. It is understood that the
perimeter track is insufficient in dimension to easily run the
ambulance around the football pitch.

        out in the letter from Messrs. Eastwood & Partners to the South

        regarded as acceptable only for the duration of the existing
        battery life;

14     - the existing Police facilities are accepted cn an interim basis only
         pending the erection of purpose-built facilities in the 1980 close

Dear Sir,

Safety of Sports Grounds Act 1975 -
Annual Inspection of the Sheffield Wednesday Stadium -
6th August, 1987

I enclose for your attention s list of comments wade by Officers arising from
the above inspection.

I anticipate that durinf the course of your Clubs' nornal maintenance
arrangements nany of the i t e m H a t e d will have already been attended to.   Would
you please let ve have your comments on the points raised in due course.

If you require any clarification of the individual comments made you will see
that on the right-hand side of the sheet an abreviation of the title of the
Department/Authority concerned. At the end of the list is a Schedule shoving
the appropriate Officers to contact if necessary.

The Fire Service has recently reainded me that no reply has yet been received to
•y letter of 22nd April enclosing their letter of 18th February.  You will
recall that you were asked in that letter to connent on the points raised by the
Fire Service and I would appreciate those contents as soon as possible.  I take
the view that it is appropriate for a Certificate Holder to have the opportunity
to consent on the views of Officers before final decisions are taken on works
that are required.  If, however, you do not wish to avail yourself of this
opportunity to comment please let ae know so that appropriate requirenents can
be framed.

1 have passed a copy of this letter onto Messrs. Fast wood and Partner*.
                                                     *

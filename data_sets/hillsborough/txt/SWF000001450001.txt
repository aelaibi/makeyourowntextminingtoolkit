             STATEMENT OF; DAVID MALCOLM BOWNES

             OCCUPATION:    CHIEF LICENSING OFFICER, ADMINISTRATION & LEGAL DEPARTMENT
                            SHEFFIELD CITY COUNCIL

                                             Introduction

             Background details

     1.      My name is David Malcolm Bownes.     I am   employed by Sheffield City Council

             in the Administration and Legal Department as Chief Licensing Officer.


     2.      I have been employed by Sheffield CityCouncil since September, 1971 and

             have held my current post since 11th July, 1977.


     3.      I obtained a Higher National Certificate in Public      Administration from

             Sheffield City Polytechnic in June, 1976.


    4.       The responsibilities of my job are:-

             (a)   to manage the Licensing Section;


             (b)   to provide reports on licensing matters for departmental management

                   and committees and to institute, maintain and operate proper

                   procedures to ensure that all relevant matters are brought to the

                   attention of any committee or officer of the Council required to make

                   a decision on any licensing matter;


             (c)   to liaise with Council members, other departments of the Council and

                   outside bodies on all matters affecting the Licensing Section;


             (d)   to maintain a service to the general public on licensing matters,

                   including dealing with enquiries and correspondence;


             (e)   so far as possible to ensure that the requirements imposed upon

                   licensees by law and by licence conditions are complied with, and in

                   this connection to co-ordinate the activities of the Council's

                   officers and the Police, Fire and other relevant authorities;


HB5AAA/JJJ                                                                                    301
                                                    -2-


             (f)   to be responjible for *11 monies received by the Licensing Section

                   and to maintain proper records to the satisfaction of the City

                   Treasurer;


             (g)   to take statements and prepare reports on any matters where legal

                   proceedings may be contemplated and to appear in any court

                   proceedings which involve the Council's licensing function;


             (h)   responsibility for implementation of the Safety of Sports Grounds

                   licensing system;


             (i)   to assimilate and implement the increasing items of new legislation

                   relevant to the Council's licensing functions.


     5.      The Licensing Section deals with 33 licensing systems, for example,

             those involving taxis and private hire vehicles, operators and drivers,

             cinemas, theatres and places of public entertainment.


             Legislation and the Green Guide

     6.      On 1st August, 1975 Royal Assent was given to the Safety of Sports Grounds

             Act 1975 (Docoaent 1, pages 1-16) which established a "Certification"

             system for sports grounds capable of holding more than 10,000 spectators.

             When a sports ground is designated by the Secretary of State an

             application needs to be made to the Certificating Authority for a General

             Safety Certificate under the 1975 Act.


     7.      At the time the Safety Certificate was granted in respect of Sheffield

             Wednesday Football Club the South Yorkshire County Council (the

             Certificating Authority) was obliged to attach to the Safety Certificate

             such terms and conditions as they considered necessary or expedient to

             secure reasonable safety at the sports ground when it is in use for

             specified activities.     The terms and conditions at this time had to

             include
                                                                                          I




HB5AAA/JJJ
                                                      -3-


             (a)   The maximum number of spectators to be admitted to the stadium and;

             (b)   Terms and conditions as to the number, size and situation of

                   entrances to and exits from the stadium or any part of it and the

                   means of access to any such entrances or exits and requiring those

                   entrances, exits and means of access to be properly maintained and

                   kept free from obstruction and as to the number, strength and

                   situation of any crush barriers.     (Section 2(2) of the Safety of

                   Sports Grounds Act 1975).


             Section 2(2) of the 1975 Act was repealed by the Fire Safety and

             Safety of Places of Sports Act 1987.      However, Home Office Circular

             71/1987 (Document 2, pages 20-29) advised that those conditions should

             still be included.


     8.      Certificate conditions must also be framed with reference to the plan

             attached to the Certificate, where appropriate.


     9.      Section 10 of 1975 Act provided for an emergency procedure which could be

             used by the Council if it thought that there was a serious risk to

             spectators at a sports ground.    The procedure involved applying to a

             Magistrates'   Court for an Order prohibiting or restricting the admission

             of spectators to the sports ground.


    10.      Under Section 11 of the 1975 Act a person authorised by the Local

             Authority or the Chief Officer of Police, or the Building Authority, or

             the Secretary of State, could on production of his authority enter a

             sports ground to make inspections and examine records and make enquiries

             as he thought fit.   On local government reorganisation on 1st April, 1986

             (when the South Yorkshire County Council was abolished and its functions

             passed in the main to District Councils) the reference to the Building

             Authority was changed to the Fire Authority.




                                                                                          30 :
HB5AAA/JJJ
                                                         -4-


         11.   In 1976 the Home Office issued the "Guide to Safety at Sports Grounds

               (Football)" which is a guide to measures for improving spectator safety at

               Football Grounds, i.e., at rugby union and rugby league grounds as well as

               at soccer grounds.       A revised edition of the Green Guide was issued in

               1986 following the Bradford Disaster and the Popplewell Inquiry.          The

               scope of the Green Guide was amended to cover measures for improving

               spectator safety at existing sports grounds.       It is a voluntary code.      The

               Green Guide makes comments on such matters as the spacing of crush

               barriers, estimation of safe ground capacity, terraces, etc.       The

               Guide makes the point that deviations from individual guidelines are

^              possible without necessarily detracting from the overall safety      of the

               ground.       A flexible approach should be maintained to take account of the

               particular circumstances at individual grounds (paragraphs 6 to 8 of the

               Guide).


        12.    The Fire Safety and Safety of Places of Sport Act, 1987 amended      the 1975

               legislation in a number of areas.       In particular, the old Section 10 of

               the 197 5 Act (Document 1, page 8)     was replaced by a more wide ranging

               provision which gave local authorities the power to issue a Prohibition

    i          Notice in respect of either a whole sports ground or part of it.         A
1
W
  1                .     .     .
               Prohibition Notice can only be issued where the Local Authority      is of the

               opinion that there is a serious risk to spectators if they are admitted to

               the sports ground.      A Prohibition Notice may include directions as to the

               steps which will have to be taken to reduce the risk to a reasonable level

               and these may require alterations or additions to the ground or things to

               be done or omitted, which would contravene the terms or conditions of a

               Safety Certificate for the ground or for any stand at the ground.

               (Section 10(4) of the 1987 Act).      A prohibition or restriction contained

               in a Notice may take effect immediately if certain conditions are

               fulfilled, or after a specified period contained in the Notice.          An appeal

               may be lodged with the Magistrates'      Court against a Prohibition Notice but


HB5AAA/JJJ
                                                      -5-


             that appeal does not suspend its operation.        The Court may either cancel

             or affirm the Notice.


   13.       In the new Section 10B of the Act it is the duty of every Certificating

             Authority to enforce the provisions of the Act and regulations made under

             it and also to carry out an inspection of each designated sports ground

             at least once every 12 months and to act in accordance with guidance given

             to them by the Secretary of State.


    14.      The 1987 Act also made provision for Safety Certificates for various

             stands at sports grounds.      Also, in order to give effect to various

             Popplewell comments on indoor sporting activities, the definition of

             public entertainments which require licensing was extended.


    15.      The Safety of Sports Ground Regulations 1987 (Statutory Instrument

             1987/1941)   sets out the prescribed form of application for a Safe ty

             Certificate and also refers to appeal procedures, etc. (Docuaent 3, page

             30-35).

                                           Home Office Circulars

    16.      Home Office Circular 71/1987 (D o co a en t 2 , page 1 7 -2 9 ) introduced the

             provisions of Part 2 of the 1987 Act and gives advice on the effects and

             operation of them.     There is also specific reference to the new

             Prohibition Notice procedure and a draft Prohibition Notice.


    17.      Home Office Circular 72/1987 (D ocu aen t 4 , page 3 6 - 4 3 ) sets out the

             Statutory Guidance on inspections which is mandatory.

    18.      The County Council set up an     "Officer Working Party (Sheffield District)"

             which consisted of representatives of the Fire Service, the Police , the

             Building Authority (Sheffield City Council) and the South Yorkshire County

             Council Administration Department.        This Working Party was set up
                                                                                                   to

             following a report to the South Yorkshire County Fire Service Committee on

             8th January, 1976.   There were four such Vorking Parties, one covering

             Sheffield, one Rotherham, one Barnsley and one Doncaster.


             In the early part of 1976 discussions took place between the South

             Yorkshire County Council and the Sheffield Wednesday Football Club about

             the possibility of certification in view of the commencement of the Safety

             of Sports Grounds Act on 1st September, 1975.   On 30th March, 1977 the

             South Yorkshire Police became involved in the discussions and wrote

             to the Home Office indicating that they felt certification should be

             considered when the matter was next reviewed, owing to the large scale

             events that were held at Hillsborough.


    20   .   At a football match held on Saturday, 23rd April, 1977 there were

             incidents at Hillsborough involving some injuries and a number of arrests.

             This prompted further discussions about certification and the involvement

             of the Fire Service Committee of the County Council as well as the Police.

             At a meeting of the South Yorkshire County Council on 27th April, 1977

             questions relating to the problems at the football match were raised and a

             specific complaint was later made by a member of the public in connection

             with an incident that allegedly took place at the Leppings Lane end of

             the ground.


    21   .   The Chief Constable subsequently agreed to take up the designation

             question once again with the Home Office.   On 24th August, 1977 the Home

             Office wrote to the Chief Constable stating that the case for designation

             of Sheffield Wednesday was not overwhelming at that time - but they would

             reconsider the matter later.


    22   .   The County Council continued to press the case for designation with the

             Home Office on the grounds that because of the importance of the games

             played there and the consequent crowd capacities, only if the Stadium had

             been designated could the Authorities satisfy themselves as to standards     *)

HB5AAA/JJJ
of safety within the ground.     The Home Office once again declined to

designate the stadium.


In April, 1978 the County Council prepared and submitted a lengthy paper

to the Home Office on the case for designating the Hillsborough Stadium

under the 1975 Act.


In August of 1978, the Home Office wrote to the County Council

indicating that they would recommend to the Home Secretary that an order

be made designating Hillsborough in due course.       The County Council then

began the Safety Certificate drafting exercise.       The exercise was carried

out in consultation with the Police, the Fire Service, the Building

Surveyor and the Club.


The Safety of Sports Grounds (Designation) Order 1978 (Statutory

Instrument 1978 No. 1091) designated the Sheffield Wednesday Football

Stadium as requiring a Safety Certificate with effect from 1st January,

1979 (Document 5, page 44).


The Club applied for a Safety Certificate on 8th September, 1978

(Docuaent 6, page 45-48).


Progress of the Safety Certificate Application with particular
reference to the Leppings Lane End of the Stadium

In support of the Club's application, a report was submitted to the County

Council by Messrs. Eastwoods & Partners, Consulting Engineers, in January,

1979 (Docuaent 7, page 49-58) which dealt with the question of ground

capacity at the stadium.    The report ".   .   .   deals in broad terms with

the necessary strengthening and supplementation of the crush barriers on

the terraces, and calculations are made of theoretical exit times .       .     ."

All the stands and terraces were dealt with in the report.       Pages 4 and 5

(Docoaent 7, pages 53 and 54) of the report indicates that the west

terrace (which is at the Leppings Lane end) has a total area of some 1,480

square metres, but there are no gangways.       It is suggested that the full
                                                     -8-


             area would justify about 8,000 spectators, but after asking a 10Z

             allowance as Che equivalent of gangways, a capacity of 7 ,200 would be

             appropriate.     The report says that the barriers should be designed to

             match this figure approximately and that those barriers which could not

             withstand test load should be appropriately strengthened and extra ones

             provided where necessary.     Proposed extra barriers were shown on drawing

             1610/2X.     The three exits from the west terrace have a total width of

             about 11.5 metres which would permit some 1,250 persons per minute to

             leave the terrace.     The terrace could, therefore, be emptied in about 6

             minutes.     The report goes on that the Guide suggests that everyone on the

             terrace should be within 12 metres of a gangway or exit.     As there are no

             gangways some spectators would be 25 metres from an exit.     The report goes

             on to say that this is felt to be of no consequence as movement

             horizontally along the terrace will be easy and quick.


    28.      The north west corner reinforced concrete terrace is also referred to in

             the report which is noted as covering a net area of approximately 535

             square metres.     The recommended number of spectators was 2,900, bringing

             the total standing at the Leppings Lane end to 10,100.     It was also noted

             that the exits serving the north west terrace were adequate in width and

• <          emptying should take place within 8 minutes.     The significance of the 8

             minute time relates to the recommended maximum time for departure of

             spectators from a terraced area of a football ground.     This recommendation

             is contained in the original "Green Guide" at Paragraph 15.5 and the new

             Guide at paragraph 56.     The last page of the report, recommends a ground

             capacity of 50,100 spectators (consisting of approximately 24,000 seated

             spectators, 16,000 standing on the spion kop and 10,100 at the Leppings

             Lane end).


    29.      Following the submission of Eastwoods' report to the County Ccwncil there

             was a meeting of the Officer Working Party (Sheffield District) on 12th

             February, 1979 (Document 8, page 62) at which the west terrace and north

HB5AAA/JJJ
                                                                                             308
west corner reinforced concrete terrace were discussed.      As far as the

west terrace was concerned it was agreed that ".     .   .   In view of the

lack of depth of this terrace, the Club's offer to reduce the spectator

limit to 7,200, and the discharge time of 6.6 minutes, the Working Party

agreed that it would be unreasonable to insist that gangways or additional

exits must be provided." The Working Party also noted that special

attention would be required to the    crush barriers in addition to the

ordinary testing in view of the apparent     sharp edges, corrosion, etc.     The

Working Party agreed that there were no real problems with the north west

terrace but reference is made to the corrugated sheeting which would be

required to pass the appropriate tests, along with the crush barriers.


On 30th March, 1979 (Document 9 , page 66)   the Officer Working Party

considered further the question of the west terrace and the north west

terrace.   As to the west terrace it was noted that the terracing in small

areas near to the stand was in poor condition and that the cross-fall on

the steps on the north west corner exit would also require attention as it

tended to throw people forward.     The height of the crush barriers was also

mentioned as being below the Guide    recommendations.   The Working Party

agreed that these points should be    drawn to the attention of the Club.      As

far as the north west terrace is concerned, the Building Authority now

took the view that the corrugated sheeting would require alteration in

order to meet the requirements of the Green Guide.


On 2nd April, 1979 (Document 1 0 , page 71) the Officer Working Party

visited Sheffield Wednesday and a joint meeting was held with the Club

representatives.   The Working Party agreed that the Club's proposals

(including a capacity limit of 7,200 spectators) was acceptable, without

the need for additional gangways.    It was also agreed that the question of

the cross-fall on the steps on the north west corner exit, the height of

some of the existing crush barriers as well as their corrosion and sharp

edges in places, should be the subject of detailed discussion between Dr.
Eastwood and the Building Surveyor.     The Club's proposals in respect to

the north west terrace were also accepted, with a capacity limit of 2,900

and the improvement of existing barriers and addition of some new

barriers.   It was also agreed that the improvement or replacement of the

existing corrugated sheeting should be subject to discussion between the

Building Surveyor and Dr.   Eastwood.


On 18th April, 1979, (D oeuaent 11, page 75) a joint meeting of the Officer

Vorking Party was held at Sheffield Vednesday.     The meeting was held to

discuss further the proposals in relation to the Hillsborough Stadium.

The comments made on the west terrace were that the Club accepted that in

view of the cross-fall on the north west corner exit, the steps should be

rebuilt and that the other matters previously raised would be reconsidered

after it was seen which of the crush barriers failed on testing.      Whilst

accepting the need for improvement or replacement of the existing

corrugated sheeting on the north west corner terrace, the Club wished to

consider whether to carry   out more extensive works so as to bring an

existing unused area into   use for the accommodation of further

spectators.


On 1st May, 1979 (Docuaent 12, pages 78-80) the Sheffield City Council's

Building Surveyor wrote to the County Council indicating that as far as

the west terrace was concerned, the downward slope of the exit steps

needed to be corrected and that the limitation in capacity should remain.

It was noted that, on the north west terrace, the replacement of the

corrugated sheeting at the rear was required, as was the removal of

understrength barriers and their replacement by new ones constructed to

Guide recommendations.


On 16th May, 1979 (Docuaent 13, page 82) the Chief Fire Officer wrote to

the County Council with a   work schedule in respect of Sheffield Wednesday.

It is noted that the west   and north west terrace exit routes were   regarded
                                                       -li­


             as satisfactory.     It was noted that the capacity of the west terrace was

             7,200 persons and that of the north west terrace 2,900 persons.


    35.      As a result of these consultations between the Working Party and the Club

             on 8th June, 1979 (Document 1 4 , page 85 and Docuaent 1 5 , p a g e s 8 6 - 9 2 ) a

             list of "Matters requiring attention at the Sheffield Wednesday Football

             Ground, Hillsborough, Sheffield" was sent to the Club for its attention.


    36.      On 15th August, 1979 (Document 16, page 93)        the Officer Working Party met

             again to consider matters relating to Sheffield United, and also to review

             the progress of work at Sheffield Wednesday since the last meeting on 12th

^            July.   It was noted, amongst other things, that no strengthening of the

             corrugated sheeting on the north west terrace had been carried out.


    37.      On 19th September, 1979 (D ocuaent 17, pages 96 and 97) Eastwood & Partners

             wrote to the County Council about the emergency lighting installation in

             the stadium.    Eastwoods proposed in the letter that new emergency circuits

             and fittings be installed in areas of the stadium including the north west

             terrace, the south west terrace and the Leppings Lane exit.


    38.      Between 31st October, 1979 and 12th November of the same year, there was

             correspondence between Eastwoods and the County Council about the

             corrugated sheeting at the rear of the north west terrace.              It was finally

             agreed that a continuous horizontal timber member should be fixed to the

             front of the corrugated sheeting at a Working Party visit to the ground

             to assess the progress of works.        (D ocuaent 1 8 , page 9 9 ) .

             Grant of the Certificate

    39.      The County Fire Services Committee of the South Yorkshire County Council

             at its meeting on 29th November, 1979 approved the issue of a General

             Safety Certificate and the terms and conditions of that Certificate to

             Sheffield Wednesday Football Club.         This decision was ratified by the full

             County Council meeting on 19th December, 1979.            Prior to the grant of a

             certificate the Working Party visited the ground on 18th December, 1979

HB5AAA/JJJ
                                                       -12-


             (Docuaent 97, pages 299-301).     The grant of a Certificate was made subject

             to remedial works to the south stand steel columns and the emergency

             lighting system being carried out.        The Safety Certificate document itself

             was issued on 21st December, 1979 under the signature of Mr.         F.   A.

             Mallett, the Chief Executive of the County Council.


     40.     The Certificate is attached to this Statement:- (D ocuaent 19, p ages

             103-112)

             The Inspection System operated by South Yorkshire County Council

     41 .    The Officer Working Party (Sheffield District) carried out regular

             inspections of Sheffield Wednesday Football Club in accordance with the

             South Yorkshire County Council policy of twice yearly visits to football

             league grounds in South Yorkshire.        A list of the dates of inspections

             carried out under South Yorkshire County Council are set out below:-

             Example of Inspection

    42.      At the Working Party inspection on 11th August, 1983 (D ocuaent 20, p ages

             113-116) there were two representatives from the Sheffield Wednesday

             Football Club (Dr.     Eastwood and Mr.    E.    England), two from the South

             Yorkshire Police (J.    Barker and C.     Calvert), one from the South

             Yorkshire County Fire Service (J.       Miles), two from the Sheffield City

             Council (Building Authority) (A.     Roberts and D.      Sheriff) and one from


HB5AAA/JJJ
                                                                                                312
the South Yorkshire County Council Administration Department (D.

Vaughan).        For illustrative purposes, I would refer to the last two

paragraphs on the first page of the notes of the Working Party visit.            In

the first of the two paragraphs it is clear that a problem in relation to

the brickwork at the x^ear corner of the stand nearest the north west

terrace had been raised at the previous meeting of the Working Party and

this was further explored at the meeting on 11th August.         In the second

paragraph, Dr.         Eastwood (the Club's Consulting Engineer) gave details of

testing of the crush barriers on the terrace and indicating that

appropriate remedial action had been taken, where necessary and that the

first cycle of the barrier testing had thus been completed.


Issues arising other than on inspections

The County Council was made aware of various problems in connection with

the use of the stadium.         An example as to how these matters were dealt

with can be seen by reference to a letter from the South Yorkshire County

Fire Service (Docuaent 21, p a g e s 117-118) to the Sheffield Wednesday

Football Club regarding a test which the Fire Service did of the emergency

procedures at a match on 4th October, 1983.         There was particular concern

that stewards could not hear the emergency procedure announcement on the

public address system, which resulted in stewards failing to carry out

their emergency procedure duties.        Consultations then took place between

the Club and the Fire Officer (with reference to the County Council) which

resulted in the system being checked and found satisfactory by the County

Fire Service on 29th October, 1983, (D ocuaent 2 2 , page 1 1 9 , and D ocuaent

2 3 , page 1 2 0 ) .


                  Sheffield City Council as Certificating Authority
                          (with effect from 1st April, 1986)

Initial Administrative System

At the meeting of the General Purposes Panel on 3rd March, 1986 (which is

a Sub-Committee of the Municipal Enterprise and General Services Programme
                                                     14


             Committee of the City Council) a report was considered fran the Bead of

             Administration and Legal Department on Safety of Sports Grounds

             (Docuaent 24, page 122). The Panel adopted the recommendations contained

             in the report which were:-


             (a)   All the powers and duties of the Council under the Safety of Sports

                   Grounds Act 1975 be delegated to the General Purposes Panel.


             (b)   The emergency procedure powers under Section 10 of the 1975 Act be

                   delegated to the Head of Administration and Legal Department in

                   consultation with the Chairman or Deputy Chairman of the Panel or of

                   the Municipal Enterprise and General Services Programme Committee as

                   appropriate.


             (c)   The power to authorise Officers under Section 11 of the Act be

                   delegated to the Head of Administration and Legal Department.


             The Panel's decision was subsequently confirmed by a full meeting of the

             City Council which took place on 9th April, 1986.


    45.      The General Purposes Panel considered a more detailed report on the Act at

             its meeting on 6th May, 1986 (D ocnaent 25, p a g e s 123-127).


             Review of the Administrative System

     46.     At its meeting on 7th September, 1987 the General Purposes Panel

             considered a report (D ocuaent 26, p ages 128-130) on the future

             administration of the Council's Certificating function.


             As the report accepts that the Council, as the Certificating Authority,

             will act on the basis of advice from experts (such as the Fire Service),

             the question arose as to how that advice may best be formulated.      In this

             respect it was recommended that a "Safety of Sports Grounds Advisory

             Group" should be established which would consist of representatives from

             the Police, the Fire Service, the Building Surveyor's Division and the

             Departaent of Health and Consumer Services.    Both the Building Surveyor's

             Division and the Department of Health and Consumer Services are part of

             existing Council structure.   It was envisaged that the Advisory Group

             would function as a forum for discussion between Officers and its most

             regular use would probably be the discussion of advice to the Council

             before recommendations were finally formulated by the appropriate

             Authority.


   48.       It was also anticipated that meetings of the Group would be held at the

             request of one or more Authorities and on receipt of a request the

             Administration and Legal Department would arrange a meeting and despatch a

             list of items to be discussed.   At the conclusion of the meeting a further

             list of items would be prepared and the details of action agreed to be

             taken by each Authority would be noted.     It was then envisaged that

             detailed written advice would be provided by each discipline and acted

             upon as appropriate.


   49.       The report went on to suggest various areas of responsibility for each

             Authority:-


             Authority                          Area of Responsibility

             The Building Surveyor,             All matters relating to the structure
             (Sheffield City Council)           of stadia, including crush barriers,
                                                walls, etc.

             South Yorkshire County             Fire precautions, fire alarms, means
             Fire Service                       of escape, emergency lighting, stadium
                                                capaci ty.

             South Yorkshire Police             Stadium policing, evacuation procedures,
                                                access of emergency vehicles and
                                                emergency planning.


             It should be noted that there is, of course, an independent duty in

             relation to safety at the sports ground which falls on the club as

             certificate holder and the management of the business carried on at the

             ground as occupier.                    \
                                                                                           315
HB5AAA/JJJ
It was also anticipated that the Health and Consumer Services Department

would have an input into the Advisory Group on:- aspects of general

safety, the general safety management of stadia, and various special items

such as first aid requirements.    These lists were of course not

exhaustive and several of the functions overlapped.


The report considered the question of inspections and it was suggested

that one large scale inspection per stadium should be carried

out each year.   It was also envisaged that some additional inspections

would take place during events.    It was noted that the proposal was in

line with the Popplewell Report and with licensing practicein other

areas.


The Panel approved the revised administrative system which therefore came

into effect immediately and delegated all routine matters in connection

with that system to the Head of Administration and Legal Department.       The

system remains in effect.


The report was seen in draft by all the interested officers    and its

proposals modified in the light of     comments made. Prior to the

preparation of the report the administrative system was discussed at

length at both a meeting and in correspondence with proposed members of

the Advisory Group.


Comments on the New Administrative System

Basically, the Council's responsibility divides into three parts, i.e. (a)

inspections of sports grounds;    (b) dealing with proposed alterations to

sports grounds and (c) dealing with serious risks to spectators.     The

inspection system is dealt with at paragraphs 61 to 78.


Sports ground management sometimes wish to alter or improve their facility

and usually these proposals involve the Council as Certificating

Authority.   Recent examples of such developments include the extension and
                                                    -17-


             roofing over of the Kop and also the installation of facilities for people

             with disabilities in the North Stand at Hillsborough.      The administrative

             system for dealing with those alterations is that copies of the proposals

             are circulated to all the members of the Advisory Group for comment.

             Where comments are received, they are collated and passed on to the Club -

             if necessary following discussions between officers either informally or

             via the Group itself.    This system works reasonably veil where proposals

             are straightforward and there is      no disagreement between the officers and

             the Club about individual items.An example of a relatively

             straightforward alteration to the Hillsborough Ground is the "Gate 'O'

             Development" (Document 86, p a g es   269-270) which involved the creation of a

             new entrance to the Ground on Penistone Road.


    56.      Unfortunately,   some developments are not quite so straightforward and an

             example of the sorts of problems that can arise are contained in the large

             volume of correspondence in relation to the proposed facilities for people

             with disabilities in the North Stand at Hillsborough.       In that

             particular instance, a considerable amount of time was expended on what

             was essentially a fairly straightforward development.       The amount of

             officer time spent on dealing with alterations to sports grounds obviously

             has to be included in the total amount of time applied to the Safety of

             Sports Grounds system.


    57.      If the Council   were of the opinion that admission of spectators to the

             Sports Ground involved a serious risk then immediate steps would be taken

             to secure rectification of the problem.       If rectification was not

             possible prior to spectator admission then if appropriate steps would be

             taken to issue a Prohibition Notice.


    58.      The administrative system has not yet been in operation for a long enough

             time to enable a true assessment of it to take place and it will, as with

             any similar system, no doubt be capable of modification in order to
                                                                                               317

             imp rove its efficiency.    It is and has been my practice to review

             administrative systems after they have been in operation for a reasonable

             time (for example in this case perhaps a period of two years would be an

             appropriate time to review it).


             Role of the Administration and Legal Department
             in the Certification System

    59.      The basic role of the Department is to co-ordinate the administration of

             the Certification System and also to keep the records of it.


    60.      An example (Docuaent 2 7 , page 1 3 1 -1 3 2 ) of an Agenda and notes of a meeting

             are attached, dated 28th April, 1988, which shows the sort of items

             discussed at the Advisory Group.


             The Inspection System operated by Sheffield City Council

    61.      Every year inspections of stadia are fixed by the Head of Administration

             and Legal Department in consultation with the clubs and the interested

             authorities.    Inspections have taken place on the following dates:-

             7th August, 1986; 6th August, 1987; 19th May, 1988.


             The Inspection System

     2.      The inspection system basically consists of six stages:-

             Stage                        Action

             1                            Arrange the inspection

             2                            Carry out the inspection

             3                            Receive comments from Advisory Group members
                                           in writing

             4                            Co-ordinate the comments if necessary via an
                                           Advisory Group meeting

             5                            Send the co-ordinated list to the sports
                                           ground management

             6                            The Advisory Group Officers check that work is
                                           done either on the next inspection or at some
                                           earlier stage if appropriate.



                                                                                                  318
HB5AAA/JJJ
                                                              -19-


    63.      This procedure is of course much simplified in Che Cable above and many

             variations of it can occur.            The system itself should in most

             circumstances work well but in practice some difficulties do occasionally

             arise.


    64.      Inspections are attended by persons representing:- the County Fire

             Service, the Police, the Council's Director of Health and Consumer

             Services and the Council's Building Surveyor.                   Often, the Club is

             represented at the inspection by a consultant engineer, together with

             another representative, usually the Club Secretary or similar Officer.

             The inspection is carried out by the various officers who meet at the

             ground and then disperse to various areas in which their particular

             interest lies.


    65.      The Officers can draw points to each other's attention during the

             inspection and Club representatives are sometimes asked for

             information.


    66.      If Officers discover a serious safety defect then the Head of

             Administration and Legal Department is informed and immediate steps are

             taken to secure its rectification.               If rectification is not possible prior

             to spectators being admitted into the stadium, then steps would be taken

             to issue a Prohibition Notice, if appropriate.


    67.      Officers at the conclusion of the inspection write to the Head of

             Administration and Legal Department setting out their comments on matters

             which ought to be raised with the Club.                 These are then collated and

             discussed with the officers (when necessary at an Advisory Group) and

             finally formulated into a list which is sent to the Club for action.
                                                     %



    68.      As an example, a copy of Officers' comments following the 1987 inspection

             are attached to this Statement (D o c a a e n t 2 8 , p a g e s 1 3 3 - 1 3 4 ) .

                                                                                                       319
                                                     -20-


    69.      The actual time spent on each ground inspection alone usually exceeds two

             man days per year.     This does not include the subsequent administrative

             work or the consideration of proposals submitted by sports ground owners.

             Home Office Circular 72/1987 (D ocuaent 4 , p a g e s 3 6 - 4 3 ) states that

             inspections are not expected to take more than about two man days per

             ground on average.


             Details of the Inspections at Hillsborough in 1986, 1987 and 1988

             7th August, 1986

    70.      There is no written record of the inspection on 7th August, 1986.There          are

             two reasons for this.      The first is that no significant problems were

             discovered on the inspection and the only point of significance raised was

             that in relation to barrier 144 which is referred to in paragraphs 174-175

             of my statement.     The second reason is that at the same time as the

             inspection was being carried out, the lengthy and complex debate in

             relation to the Spion Kop was fully underway and by far the majority of my

             own efforts and those of the other participants in that debate were

             concentrated in that area.       I do, however, recall that the inspection

             followed the County Council system and it helped firm my views in that

             area.

•<           6th August, 1987

    71 .     The Building Surveyor and the Director of Health and Consumer Services

             made a number of comments on the annual inspection.           These comments

             were considered and discussed between officers and a consolidated

             list was drawn up and sent to Sheffield Wednesday on 4th December, 1987

             (Docuaent 28, pages 133-134).       No comments were received from the Fire

             Service or the Police.      The list was circulated to the Fire Service, the

             Health and Consumer Services Department, the Building Surveyor, the Police

             and Messrs.    Eastwood & Partners.




HB5AAA/JJJ
                                                                                                   32
Messrs. Eastwood & Partners wrote back to the Council (Doctuaent 82, p ages

242-245) on 15th January, 1988, indicating that the majority of the points

raised from the list of comments had been completed but raising one or two

questions on some of the items.    Copies of Eastwoods letter were passed on

to the Health and Consumer Services Department and the Building Surveyor

but owing to the impending May inspection no further action was taken at

that stage.   I should explain that it had been decided to move the annual

inspection from August to May, in order that any work that needed to be

done could be identified and carried out during the close season.


As already noted, the Fire Service did not make any comments in relation

to the inspection.   The Fire Service sent a letter to the Council on 18th

February, 1987 (Docraent 91, pages 279-284) containing a large number of

comments on Sheffield Wednesday Football Ground.    After discussions with

the Fire Service, the City Council sent a copy of the Fire Service letter

(along with various comments) on 22nd April, 1987 (Docoaent 92, pages

285-286) to Sheffield Wednesday.    After being reminded, the Club via

Eastwood & Partners responded to the County Fire Service letter on 3rd

February, 1988 (Docoaent 93, pages 287-293).    The letter was very detailed

and was passed on to the Police, the Health and Consumer Services

Department and the Building Surveyor on 8th February.    The letter was sent

to the Fire Service on 8th February, 1988, with a covering letter

(Docaaent 94, page 294).    In view of the comments in this letter, the Fire

Service were invited to respond directly to Eastwood & Partners.    The

letter also requested comments on the remainder of the points raised in

Eastwoods letter.    A Senior Fire Officer rang me in February, 1988,

indicating that the Fire Service did not wish -to reply to the letter at

that time.




                                                                              321
                                                     -22-


             19th May, 1988

    74.      The inspection was attended by representatives of the Police, the Fire

             Service, the Building Surveyor and Health and Consumer Services

             Department.


    75.      The Fire   Service and the Health and Consumer Services Department both

             commented on the inspection by letter dated 25th May, 1988 (Document 95,

             p a g es 295-296) and memorandum of 3rd June, 1988 (D o ca a en t 96, p ages

             297-298) respectively.


    76.      The Fire   Service had not yet replied to Eastwoods letter (D ocnaent 93,

             p a g es 287-293) referred to above.    I was therefore reluctant to send their

             further letter (Doctnaent 95, p ages 295-296) to the Club before the

             previous issue had been resolved.       I had thought to write back to the Fire

             Service in this way but unfortunately time simply did not permit owing to

             other commitments within the Licensing Section.         I should say that at no

             time has the Fire Service indicated that any of the points mentioned in

             their letter required immediate attention or presented any serious hazard

             to the public.


    77.      The Director of Health and Consumer Services made a number of points

             similar to ones raised previously.


    78.      Ideally,   what should have happened in June or July 1988 was that the

             outstanding Fire Service issues should have been resolved and that a

             co-ordinated set of comments submitted to the Club.         This did not

             however happen owing, as I have mentioned previously, to pressure of work

             within the Licensing Section.      As I have already said, none of the points

             raised by either the Fire Service or the tea 1th and Consumer Services

             Department had been highlighted as being of a serious nature.




                                                                                               322

             tfhy were the Administrative and Inspection Systems changed when
             Sheffield City Council became the Certificating Authority?_____

    79.      In April, 1986, I recall visiting the South Yorkshire County Council

             Offices in Barnsley and collecting the large number of files in relation

             to both designated sports grounds in Sheffield.      In addition to applying

             some time to reading the files, I talked to officers who had

             been involved with the system for some time.


    80.      It seemed to me that the key test of the South Yorkshire County Council

             administrative system was whether or not it achieved a reasonable degree

             of public safety within the sports grounds which were subject to the

)            certificating system.   Bearing this principle in mind, I formed a number

             of tentative views about the County Council's administrative system.      The

             first and most obvious point was that the issues at sports grounds were

             complex and required the allocation of a considerable amount of time in

             order to deal with them.   Also, although it appeared on the face of it

             that the system itself worked well, it struck me that there were a number

             of points which required clarification.      For example, it was not clear who

             made what decisions.    There were plenty of "agreements" on the file and a

             lot of letters to the Clubs but there was no evidence to indicate who had

^            the authority to make requirements, etc.     It was also difficult to pick up

             from the files exactly where the technical responsibilities lay and often

             "agreements" were noted as having been arrived at without an indication as

             to who contributed to them.   There was also no clear indication in a lot

             of cases as to the basis on which agreement was reached.      The constitution

             of the Working Party was also rather confused as evidently Club

             representatives were present and made comments at various meetings at

             which agreements were reached.


    81.      I also looked at the question of inspections of the sports grounds and

             wondered about their thoroughness.    The inspection records did not

             clearly show which areas of the sports grounds had been looked at and it

             seemed Co me ChaC in view of Che size of spores grounds quiCe a number of

             poinCs would be raised on an inspecCion - although Chese points would

             obviously vary in imporCance.     The quesCion of Che cime Caken on

             should be reviewed.     Obviously, Chis review process would Cake a

    83.      IC is, in my opinion, viCally important ChaC a licensing auChoriCy should,

                  by Che Council on 3rd March, 1986 (Docnaent 24, page 122) when all powers

    HB5AAA/JJJ
either attempted or intended to control the areas of the sports ground

which the officers visited.


However, during the 1987 and 1988 inspections of the sports grounds, I

attempted to encourage Officers to feel free to visit all parts of the

sports grounds and gradually this did indeed happen.     I recall that

initially the Clubs were perhaps somewhat concerned about this move as

were some of the officers, but its value has been demonstrated several

times.   For example, during the 1987 inspection of one of the sports

grounds in Sheffield it was discovered that there was an accumulation of

combustible material beneath a wooden stand.    This situation was dealt

with most promptly by the Club concerned in consultation with the relevant

officers.


One of my suggestions was to involve officers of the Council's Health and

Consumer Services Department in the Safety of Sports Grounds System.        This

stemmed from recommendation 9 in the Popplewell Report which related to

the Health and Safety experts.     I recognised that unlike other similar

licensing systems (for example, public entertainments, theatres and

cinemas), there was no input in the old County Council system from

appropriately qualified Health and Safety experts.     There were some

resistance to the idea of their inclusion, but I believe that their

contributions have been and will continue to be most valuable.


Obviously, any system can be improved in the light of experience but I

believe that any serious safety problem would be discovered and dealt with

under the current system.     In the light of the tragic events at

Hillsborough and with the benefit of the Inquiry report these issues will

be reconsidered.


                        The role of the Home Office

The Home Office is the Central Government Department which is responsible

for safety of sports grounds.     Its functions can be described in brief as
follows:

(a)   To advise Parliament on legislation;

(b)   To issue circulars informing interested persons about legislation
      and to offer guidance;

(c)   To issue Statutory guidance (for example, in relation to
      inspections); and

(d)     To issue the "Green Guide" which is an advisory document                  toassist
      the improvement of safety standards at sports grounds.



       The Certificating Authority's response to the Bradford Disaster
                         and the Popplewell Report

The South Yorkshire County Council issued a press release on 10th May,

1985 (Document 29, page 135) outlining the certification system in

operation throughout the County.           The press release went on to say that

the forthcoming "Summer" inspections will take into account the lessons of

the    recent tragic event at Bradford and any revised advice and

requirements which may be issued by the Home Office.               On 13th May,   1985

the South Yorkshire County Council sent a letter to the Secretary of

Sheffield Wednesday (D o c m e n t 3 0 , page 136) enclosing a copy of the press

release and stressing that it is vital necessity for safety stewards to be

fully aware of and trained in their duties on the manning and opening of

doors and gates on egress routes and in the use of fire fighting

equipment.


The South Yorkshire County Council wrote again to Sheffield Wednesday on

9th August, 1985 (D ocvaen t 3 1 , p ages 1 3 7 -1 3 8 )   indicating that the Interim

Report of the Popplewell Inquiry had been produced and advice had been

received from the Home Office.          The letter drew attention to a review of

the evacuation procedures in consultation with the Police and the Fire

Service and also to the duties of safety stewards.              It also indicated that

the Police and the Fire Service were willing to assist clubs in these

matters.    Detailed comments were also made about the first aid facilities

at the stadium and the requirements of the Certificate in respect of them.
 There was also a comment about stands which are constructed of combustible

 materials and that they should have "no smoking" signs prominently

 displayed.   The Club responded (Docuaent 32, page 139) to the County

 Council's letter of 14th August 1985 and comments were made about steward

 training procedures.


 The Sheffield City Council wrote to Sheffield Wednesday on 15th October,

 1987    (Docuaent 33, page 140) referring to the revised Green Guide which

 had been published by H.    M.   Government following the Popplewell Report

d r a w i n g attention to the new Guide and particularly to Chapter Z",~whicir”is

 entitled "Management Responsibility".      The letter asks Sheffield Wednesday

 to confirm in writing that the Club intends to retain a copy of the

 revised Green Guide on the premises and that they should take immediate

 steps to appoint a safety officer as defined in Chapter 2.        The Club

 responded to that letter on 23rd October, 1987 (Docuaent 34, page 141) and

 Mr.    Mackrell stated "I confirm that I do have a copy of the Guide to

 Safety at Sports Grounds - 1986 edition and have had such for many months.

 With regard to the appointment of a Safety Officer, my duties encompass

 those of the Safety Officer and I would be grateful if you could amend

 your records to note that I am responsible for all matters of safety

 within the ground".


                              The Semi-Final in 1981

 On 7th April, 1981 the Officer Working Party (Docuaent 35, pages 142-143)

 inspected the Sheffield Wednesday Stadium, bearing in mind that an F.A.

 Cup Semi-Final was to take place on 11th April, 1981.


 Sheffield Wednesday Football Club wrote to the County Council on 15th

 April, 1981 (Document 36, pages 144-145) outlining an incident which took

 place at the Leppings Lane end of the ground at the Semi-Final Match on

 11th April, that year.     It is noted that there were injuries to spectators

 because of crushing.     The Club goes on to say that from its enquiries it
appears that the crushing was caused by Tottenham supporters arriving late

due to travelling problems and rushing to their places after the game had

commenced, thereby causing problems to spectators at the front of the

terracing who had been in the ground for a considerable length of time.

The turnstile readings indicated 335 persons in excess of the

capacity for Leppings Lane end which was the result of Tottenham fans

having purchased tickets from Wolverhampton and on arrival at turnstile

'N' (in Penistone Road) which was the Wolverhampton standing area, were

directed by the Police to the other end of the ground where Tottenham fans

were standing.   Apparently, 30 spectators were treated by St. John

Ambulance for minor ailments and 8 spectators were treated at the Royal

Hallamshire and Northern General Hospitals.     According to the Police,

three people had broken limbs, one had head grazing and another had

unspecified injuries.    The Club finally commented that the crowd behaviour

both inside and outside the stadium was very good.


On 22nd April, 1981 the Chief Executive of the County Council wrote

(Docuaent 37, page 146) to the Police asking for a copy of their report on

the Semi-Final incident.


Mr. Brownlow, the then Chief Constable of South Yorkshire, wrote to the

Secretary of the Football Association on 3rd June, 1981 (Docuaent 38,

pages 147-148) commenting in detail on the incident at the match on 11th

April.   The Chief Constable starts by noting the basic facts relating to

the stadium and indicating that there had been many similar Semi-Final

matches at Hillsborough without previous incident.     The Police apparently

envisaged difficulties prior to the match because both sets of supporters

would need to use the Ml motorway.    There were a number of problems which

slowed down the arrival of spectators, namely a major road accident, a

coach breaking down and extensive road works.     These resulted in Tottenham

Hotspur fans being held up on the motorway for some 90 minutes.     This all

resulted in " . . .     a sudden influx of large numbers of football
                                                    -30-


             supporters to the area of the ground at around the time for the start of

             the match .    .   .11


      98.    Mr. Brovnlov went on to indicate that Tottenham Hotspur supporters managed

             to obtain tickets from Wolverhampton.     He noted that this completely

             defeated the spectator policy which places the largest groups of standing

              supporters at opposite ends of the football ground.    Apparently, neither

             participating football club told the South Yorkshire Police, Sheffield

             Wednesday, or the Football Association about this situation and the mixing

             of supporters was not properly catered for.     Some 400 Tottenham fans had

              to be removed from the kop and accommodated in the Leppings Lane end.


      99.    According to Mr. Brownlow the Tottenham Hotspur fans who had arrived early

              took up advantageous viewing points and refused to move to the centre of

              the Leppings Lane enclosure ". . . thereby creating a jamming effect at

              the extremeties of it       "   The late arrivals then caused a problem

             because they rushed forward immediately upon entering after Tottenham

             Hotspur had scored an early goal.     The resulting injuries included broken

             arms, legs and crushed ribs.     It is noted that some 38 people received

              treatment.   The pitch perimeter gates at the front of the Leppings Lane
  r
             enclosure were opened and spectators were allowed to go on to the

             perimeter track to relieve pressure.     Police Officers also refused access

              to the Leppings Lane enclosure to spectators waiting to get in, in view of

              the crushing problem.   In Mr. Brownlow1s view, no other course of action

              could have been adopted in the interests of public safety.


      100.   Mr. Brownlow does note that the circumstances he outlines in the letter

             had been discussed at length and would be borne in mind in planning other

              similar events.

                        The installation of, and alterations to, the radial fences
                                       on the Lepping8 Lane terrace


             The 1981 Proposals

   101.      Messrs. Eastwood & Partners wrote                 to the County Council on 2nd September,

             1981 (Docifftnt 3 9 , p a g e s 1 4 9 -1 5 0 )    indicating that ".   .     . we have been

             instructed by the Club to organise the installation of two radial fences

             on the terrace at the Leppings Lane end of the ground .                     .   .".     It was

             noted that the intention of these fences was to divide the terrace into

             approximately three equal areas, each served by its own entrance.                         The

             object of dividing the terrace was to exercise more control over

             supporters and for example, a visiting team with only a few followers

             would be allocated one section with the other two sections retained for

             home supporters.         A 1.15 metre wide gate was proposed at the rear of each

             fence, to give access for maintenance and also policing during                        the game.

             The gates could be left open, but fastened back to connect                      the areas

             during the game if appropriate.                  In order to preserve spectators' views

             Eastwoods recommended that the top of the fence should be approximately

             1680 mm above the terrace.             It was noted that a fence of this height would

             not prevent individual spectators from climbing the fence, but it should

             eliminate a mass "invasion" from one area to another.                      Apparently, fences

             of this height worked successfully at St.                 James' Park (the Newcastle

             United ground).         The plans referred to in the letter are 3563/1 and 3563/2

             and 3.


   102   .   On 9th September, 1981 (D orim ent 4 0 , page 51) Eastwoods wrote to the

             County Council indicating that radial barrier work is likely to begin in

             early October, subject to their being no objections from the Council.

             Eastwoods indicated that major changes to the proposed scheme should be

             received by 23rd September.


   103.      The Officer Working Party at its meeting on 11th September 1981 (Docoaent

             41, page 152) considered the question of the proposed new radial barriers

HB5AAC/JJJ
                                                       -32-


             on the west terrace.     It was noted that there were drawbacks to the

             division of the terrace into approximately three equal areas, but the

             Working Party felt that increased control on the terrace should result.              A

             "for instance" was quoted in that there could well be problems with

             opposing fans mixing at the rear of the west stand and/or the final exit

             gates, but the Police considered that they could cope with these

             problems.


   104.      The adequacy and positioning of the gates at the rear of the radial

             barriers was discussed as well as the use of the existing gates in the

             pitch perimeter fence.     It was noted that the plans did not indicate the

             headroom which would be available at the rear of the terrace should the

             radial barriers and gates be installed.          Hie Working Party agreed that

             there was no objection to the proposals subject to further calculations as

             required by the Building Authority being satisfactory, confirmation of

             adequate headroom at the rear of the terrace and those gates being under

             Police control.   The County Council wrote to Eastwoods confirming the

             Working Party views on 14th September (Document 42, pages 154-155).            In a

             letter of 14th December, Eastwoods indicated that the works were now

             substantially complete (Docuaent 43, page 156).


   105 .     The South Yorkshire Police wrote (Docuaent 44, pages 157-158) to the

             County Council on 18th January, 1982 about, amongst other things, the new

             radial fencing at Leppings Lane.     It is confirmed in the letter that the

             fences are working well.     It is commented that since there have been no

             games resulting in the whole of the terracing being occupied by one group

             of fans, the Police are unable to comment in that respect, but they

             foresee no problems.     The Chief Constable goes on to say that as existing

             barrier rails have been extended up to and completely through the new

             radial fencing, fans could climb over from one pen to another.            Also, it

             was noted that there were some 11.    .    .     dangerous pieces .   .   ."

             protruding from the cut off ends of some barrier rails.         The County

             Council wrote (Docuaant 45, M S * 159)     to Eastwood and Partners indicating

             that the radial fences appear to be working satisfactory and also

             outlining the Police views on them.      Messrs.   Eastwood and Partners wrote

             back to the County Council on 26th January, 1982 (Docuaent 46, pages

             161-163) accepting the possibility that fans could climb over the radial

             fence, but stating that it would be unacceptable to leave a gap along side

             each radial fence completely free of crush barriers as that would present

             a major hazard.   The Police comment on the dangerous pieces of rails is

             noted.


    ^6.      At an Officer Working Party meeting on 4th February, 1982 (Docuaent 47,

             page 164) the Police views on the barriers was again discussed.       It was

             however, agreed that the existing arrangement was, on balance, preferable

             from a safety point of view to prevent crowd surge.       It was agreed to

             review the issue at the end of the current season.


             The 1985 Proposals

   107.      Messrs. Eastwood & Partners wrote to the County Council on 9th April, 1985

             (Docuaent 48, page 167) indicating that the Club was anxious to segregate

             visiting teams' supporters as they entered the ground and also to enable

             the Police to control their exit at the end of the game.       A scheme showing

             a possible modification to the Leppings Lane end was prepared and shown on

             drawing 6705/2 which involved the construction the two new banks of

             turnstiles and various runs of fencing and new gates.


   108.      The Officer Working Party considered these plans on 18th April

             1985 (Docnaent 49, pages 168-169). They were agreed, subject to a number

             of conditions.


   109.      Particular reference was made by the Working Party to the inclusion of two

             gates in the new central radial fence and a second gate in the radial

             fence dividing the neutral area and home supporters.

                                                                                               333
HB5AAC/JJJ
   110   .    On 30th April, 1985 (Docoacnt 50, page 170) the Fire Service wrote to the

              County Council indicating that from a means of escape point of view, the

              scheme was satisfactory, providing the gates had minimum widths as

              indicated on the plan enclosed with the letter.     The Fire Service also

              stated that it was understood that these gates will be supervised either

              by the Police or Club officials.     The County Council on 2nd May

              transmitted its views to Messrs.    Eastwood & Partners by letter.

              (Docuent 51, pages 171-172).


   Ill.       Eastwoods responded to the County Council's letter on 8th May

              1985 (Docuent 52, page 173) and indicated that several of the points made

              had already been incorporated into the latest scheme.       Eastwoods say in

              the letter:- ".   .   .   However I would ask that further consideration

              should be given to the request in paragraph (c) of your letter for a

              second gate to be installed in the radial barrier and for the new radial

              barrier which you have asked for to     have two gates.   If these gates are

              meant for use in emergency it would    mean having a steward    in attendance on

              each occasion, the expense of which would hardly be justified.       It is our

              view that in the event of emergency, spectators can be evacuated quickly

              enough by the gates on to the pitch and by the normal exit gates at the

              rear.   We will of course be prepared to discuss the matter with the Fire

              Officer's staff should you so wish .     .


   112   .    The County Council sent a letter to Eastwoods on 10th May, 1985 (Doenent

              53, page 174) indicating that the Police were prepared to concede the

              request for two gates per radial fence in the right hand area of the

              Leppings Lane End Terrace, provided     that the remainder of the points

              raised by the Officer Working Party    were incorporated.


   113.       Subsequently, Eastwood & Partners submitted a further detailed proposal

              for a revised layout of the Leppings Lane end and related works on 25th

              July 1985 (Document 54, pages 175-176). Fourteen plans were included in

             the submission and it was considered by a aeeting of the Officer Working

             Party on 29th July 1985 (D ocn aen t 55, p a g e s 1 7 7 - 1 7 8 ) . The Working Party

             accepted the proposals in principle, but made a number of comments which

             were transmitted to the Consulting Engineers by a letter of 30th July

             (Document 56, p a g e s 1 7 9 - 1 8 0 ) . The comments were made by reference to the

             plans submitted:-

             "(a)   Plan No. 6705/6 - for both security access and emergency egress
                    purposes, a pitch perimeter fence gate to be provided";

             "(b)   Plan No. 6705/8A - the new handrail by turnstile 23 to be either
                    shortened or realigned so as to maintain the exit width between the
                    outer (river) wall and turnstile 23, and the exit width between
                    turnstile 16 and the new handrail not to be less than the width of
                    the roller shutter gate between turnstiles 16 and 17";

             "(f)   Plan No. 6705/12 - . . . no objection in principle, but no barrier
                    height indicated . . .";

             "(i)   Plan No. 6705/17 - for both security access and emergency             egress
                    purposes, a pitch perimeter fence gate to be provided";

             "(j)   Stewarding of new gates - as mentioned in my letter of 2nd May,
                    1985, it is essential that all the new gates are fully supervised by
                    stewards, who must be fit, able and properly trained".


   114.      Eastwoods responded to the County Council's letter on 1st August (Docoaent

             57, pages 181-182) and indicated that it might be easier for discussions

             to take place when the works are under construction.             Eastwoods' letter

             made the following comment on (a) above "We are not sure of the location
• I
             onthe West terrace of the proposed extra security            gate.    There is already

             a gate in the 2m wide gap formed by the new radial fence for use by the

             police.    This same gate will still be available for the spectators in

             emergency as there are gates into the 2m gap from the terrace which will

             be under the control of the police.          This point may perhaps be clarified

             during the Working Party's visit on 7th August".             It is also noted in the

             letter that the stewarding would "...          no doubt be taken care of by Mr.

             Chester ..." (the Sheffield Wednesday Club Secretary at that time).                 A

             copy of the letter was sent to Mr.          Chester by Eastwoods.

  115.       The Officer Working Party visited Hillsborough on 7th August 1985

             (Docoent 58, pages 183-184) and noted the progress of works to segregate

             supporters at the Leppings Lane end of the ground and on the terrace.      The

             note states "On the Terrace itself, it vas noted that there vas an

             existing gate in the new 2m vide gap formed by the new radial fence for

             use by the Police.    This gate would still be available for the use of

             spectators in an emergency as the gates at the top of the Terrace under

             the control of the Police would enable spectators to be directed down the

             2m wide gap.    However, it was agreed that steps or a longer gate would be

             required.     It was also agreed that a new gate would be required from the

             new South Central Terrace Pen."     The Working Party agreed "(b) that the

             existing gate in the pitch perimeter fence should either be extended or

             have steps to provide easier access from the new two metre wide gap formed

             by the new radial fence; (c) that a new gate in the pitch perimeter fence

             should be provided from the south central terrace pen".     There are several

             other comments about general matters in the west terrace.


   116.      At a meeting at the Police Sports and Social Club at Niagra, Sheffield,

             the Officer Working Party on 13th November 1985 (Docoent 59, page 187)

             considered the Club's proposals in relation to various projects at the

             stadium.    It was also noted that the Police reported on the continuing

             problems caused by the merging of spectators at the Leppings Lane end of

             the ground.     The Working Party noted that it was difficult to see how this

             could be overcome as the physical restraints to achieve this could

             conceivably be more of a danger than allowing the present situation to

             continue.


   117.      When Eastwoods were notified of these problems by the County Council in a

             letter of 14th November 1985 (Document 60, page 190)     in a response dated

             29th November, 1985 (Docoaent 85, page 268) it was stated that they found

             it very difficult to envisage anything more which could be done at




HB5AAC/JJJ
reasonable expense, as major vork had been undertaken during the last

close season.


The Officer Working Party at its inspection of Sheffield Wednesday on 22nd

January, 1986 (D ocu aen t 61, page 193) next considered the segregation

arrangements at the Leppings Lane end.     The Police confirmed that the nev

arrangements worked veil on by far the majority of occasions.     Other minor

matters vere referred to in relation to advertising hoardings, spalling

concrete and the north vest terrace.


Other references to the Leppings Lane end of the Stadium 1980 to 1988

1980


On 11th September, 1980 a report from Dr. Eastwood as to an inspection of

the Hillsborough Football Stadium indicates that in the north vest corner

of the concrete terrace there are a number of cracks vhich have grown more

pronounced in the past year. The recommendation is that the cracks should

be sealed to prevent the reinforcement corroding.     (Document 62, pages

194-195).


1981

On 10th February, 1981 the Officer Working Party met (Document 63, pages

196-198) to inspect the Sheffield Wednesday Stadium.     It vas noted that

the Club had received quotations for making good the cracking of the

concrete at the north vest terrace, vhich vould be considered shortly.

The Working Party also heard the Club outline the consideration it vas

giving to the siting of caravans outside the Penistone Road and Leppings

Lane ends of the ground to sell tickets.    It vas hoped that if this took

place, increased entry flow of spectators to the ground would result by

reducing delays at the turnstiles.


On 7th April, 1981 (Document 35, page 143) the Working Party noted that

the cracking of the concreting at the north west terrace had been attended
             to by injecting material from the top.         The results had been satisfactory,

             except in tvo small areas where water seepage had taken place and

             they were to receive further attention.


    122.     The next entry on the file relates to a visit of the Officer Working Party

             to Hillsborough on 8th June, 1981 (D ocu aen t 6 4 , page 200) at which some

             water seepage was again noted at the north west terrace.             There was also a

             note that the tie bars through the upper level concrete area to the rear

             had been protectively wrapped.


             1982                                                             -       ..........

   123.      The Officer Working Party at its meeting on 24th August, 1982 (Docuaent 65

             p a g e s 201-203) and a letter from Messrs.     Eastwood & Partners of 27th

             August, 1982 (Docuaent 66, page 204) deal with some minor problems which

             did not apparently involve visitor spectators in the concrete at the north

             west terrace.   Similar problems were alluded to on 21st February, 1983 at

             a Working Party meeting.     (D ocu aen t 67, page 206) On 8th September, 1982,

             Eastwoods submitted a certificate relating to their annual inspection of

             the Hillsborough Stadium (D ocuaent 68, p ages 208-209) and it was noted

             that the two radial fences had been installed on the Leppings Lane

             terrace.


             1983

   124.      The fact that the crush barriers on the Leppings Lane terrace had been

             tested was noted by the Officer Working Party on 11th August, 1983

             (D ocuaent 69, p a g e s 210-213) which testing had completed the first cycle

             of crush barrier testing at the stadium.         There was also mention of water

             seepage again at the north west terrace.         On 29th August, 1983 (D ocu aen t

             70, p ages 214-215).   Dr.   Eastwood copied a letter to the County Council

             confirming the testing of crush barriers at the Leppings Lane End of the

             ground and amongst other things, certified that in his opinion "...             the

             various structures on the ground are in a satisfactory condition and are


HB5AAC/JJJ
                                                      -39-


               appropriate for the stadium to be us«d to the full capacity laid down in

               the Certificate of Ground Safety..."


               1984

      125.     The former A.R.P.    building adjacent to the boundary vail (near to Gate

               'C') of the Leppings Lane entrances to the stadium vas in the process of

               being demolished vhen the Officer Working Party visited the stadium on

               29th February, 1984 (Docvaent 71, p a g e s 216-217). Once again, vater

               seepage vas noted on that day at the north vest terrace.     In June, 1984

               the crush barriers at the north vest corner vere tested by the Club's

               Consulting Engineers (Eastvood & Partners) (Docuaent 72, page 218 and

               Docaaent 73, p a g es 219-228).


       126.    It vas noted that there was some cracked brickwork at the rear of the west

               stand and that there were damaged angled support brackets to the pitchside

               security fence at the front of the Leppings Lane terrace, at an Officer

               Working Party inspection of the stadium on 9th August, 1984 (Docnaent 74,

               page 229).   It was also noted that the wire mesh barriers on the north

               west terrace had been successfully test loaded.

               1985

# *     127.   There was some discussion at an Officer Working Party meeting on 23rd

               January, 1985 (Docoaent 75, pages 232-233) about the segregation of home

               and visiting supporters at the rear of the west stand at certain matches

               by erecting temporary barriers.     It was noted that it was the policy of

               the Police to aim for the exclusive use by visiting supporters of the west

               stand and terrace.     The Working Party agreed that the Club would consider

               a scheme for permanent barriers at the rear of the stand subject to the

               necessary approvals.     It was also noted that the cracked brickwork

               previously mentioned should continue to be monitored and that the apparent

               rusting of steel columns at the rear of the stand should receive

               appropriate treatment.
                                                                                              333

              1986-1988

      128.    There are no other file references in respect of the Leppings Lane End of

              the sports ground other than those dealt vith elsewhere in the statement.

              It should also be noted that inspections vere taking place on a

              regular basis throughout this period.


                               Further Comments on the Certificating System

              Further comments

      129.    At the time the current Safety Certificate vas issued, the terms and

              conditions contained therein vere those thought by the South Yorkshire

              County Council on the advice of the various interested parties to be

              necessary or expedient to secure reasonable safety of spectators at the

              sports ground.     There is no evidence from the files that the Certificate

              Holder or any other interested party has appealed to the Secretary of

              State (up to 1st January, 1988) or to a Magistrates' Court (thereafter) in

              respect of the Certificate Conditions.


      130 .   Section 2(4) of the 197 5 Act (as amended) states that the Safety

              Certificate must have attached to it a plan and the terms and conditions

              shall be framed by reference to it, where appropriate.      Paragraph 5 of the

              General Safety Certificate refers to plans.      Under Schedule 1 of the
•I
              Certificate, the definition of plans is "document or documents attached to

              and forming part of the General Safety Certificate and signed by the

              person signing the Certificate ...".     When the files vere handed over to

              the Sheffield City Council in April, 1986 a copy of the General Safety

              Certificate for Hillsborough vas in an envelope, together vith a number of

              plans, none of vhich vere signed by Mr.      Mallett (the original signatory

              of the Certificate).     The original Safety Certificate and plans are lodged

              vith Sheffield Wednesday Football Club Limited (the Holder).


     131.     Under Section 3(3) of the 1975 Act applications for Certificates had to be

              copied to the Police and the Building Authority.      Sheffield Wednesday
                                                                                               340

             applied for a Safety Certificate on 8th September, 1978 ( D o c m n t 6 , p a g e s

             4 5 -4 8 ).   Copies of the application vere sent to the Building Authority,

             the Police and the Fire Service on 13th September, 1978 (D ocuaent 7 6 , page

             2 3 5 , D ocuaent 7 7 , page 2 3 6 , D ocaaent 7 8 , page 2 3 7 ) .   There vas no formal

             notice issued by the County Council requiring the Holder to supply further

             information to enable it (the Council) to determine the terms and

             conditions of the Certificate.            The matter vas dealt vith in lengthy

             correspondence and by consultation.


    ’32.     The amendment and replacement" of Certificates is governed by Section 4 of

             the 1975 Act (as amended) and the Safety of Sports Grounds Regulations

             1976, vhich were superceded on 1st January, 1988 by the Safety of Sports

             Grounds Regulations 1987 (Docuaent 3 , pages 3 0 - 3 5 ) .


    133.     The 1975 Act (as amended) provides that a local authority may, if it feels

             it appropriate to do so, amend a Safety Certificate by notice in writing

             to its holder or replace it.           A Safety Certificate may be amended or

             replaced either vith or vithout the application of the Holder of the

             Certificate.       Section 4(4) of the 1975 Act (as amended) indicates that a

             notice under Section 4(l)(a) amending a General Safety Certificate shall

             specify the date on vhich the amendment to vhich it relates is to come

             into operation, and the date so specified may be a date later than the

             date of issue of the notice.           The Regulations make further provision vith

             regard to the amendment of the Certificates.                 Regulation 5 provides that

             vhere a local authority issues or amends a Certificate it shall as soon as

             practicable give notice in vriting of the issue or amendment . . .                     to

             every interested party.          In addition, the local authority in giving

             notices must inform the persons to vhom notice is given that a copy of the

             Safety Certificate and the application may be inspected and where and at

             what time such inspection may be made.                In addition, the local authority

             must publish a notice in a nevspaper as soon as maybe after the

             decision including certain information.                                                 34

    134.     On 3rd September, 1981 the South Yorkshire County Fire Service Committee

             resolved to amend the Sheffield Wednesday Football Club General Safety

             Certificate by replacing Conditions 10 and 26 of the Safety Certificate.

             The amended Condition 10 contains slight wording differences to the

             original.   Condition 26 varied the time limits in relation to

             electrical certificates.   There is no evidence from the file that these

             revised conditions were in fact properly brought into effect.


    135.     At a meeting on 21st August, 1986 (Docuaent 79, pages 238-239) the City

             Council's General Purposes Panel resolved to amend the capacity of the

             Spion Kop at Sheffield Wednesday to 21,000 spectators.    The Panel agreed

             to amend the Certificate subject to a number of conditions, one of

             which related to temporary additional stewarding to be provided until

             certain works on crush barriers on the new Spion Kop were completed.      This

             condition related to two matches.   The amendment to the Certificate only

             affected the capacity at the Spion Kop end of the ground.    The Inquiry has

             prompted a review of this amendment and it transpires that no notice was

             inserted in a newspaper in connection with this amendment.    The Panel's

             deliberations attracted considerable publicity and copy of a report in the

              Star1 newspaper of Friday, 22nd August, 1986, is attached to this

             Statement (Docuaent 80, page 240). Additionally, the General Safety

             Certificate is regarded as a public document and therefore the spirit of

             the legislation has been met.


    136.     On 1st December, 1986 the General Purposes Panel resolved (Docuaent 81,

             page 241) to amend Schedule 1 of the Certificate so as to extend the

             definition of specified activity to include Royal visits.    Again, the

             notice provisions of the legislation were not observed.


    137.     Under Section 5 of the 1975 Act (as amended) interested parties may appeal

             against or about the terms and conditions in a Certificate and the

                                                                                              342

             Council's refusal to amend or replace it.   According to the files, there

             have been no appeals.


    138.     Under Section 8 of the 1975 Act (as amended), the Certificate Holder must

             give notice to the Council if he intends to alter or extend the sports

             ground or any of its installations (if that alteration or extension is

             likely to affect the safety of persons at the ground).     To the best of my

             knowledge, this Section has been complied vith by Sheffield Wednesday

             Football Club; the developments vhich have taken place have been the

             subject of lengthy correspondence in each case.


    139.     The Council as Certificating Authority may issue a Prohibition Notice

             under Section 10 of the Act if it feels there is a serious risk to

             spectator safety.   No Prohibition Notices have been issued in respect of

             Sheffield Wednesday.


    140.     It is the duty of the Council under Section 10B(1) of the Act to arrange

             for the inspection of stadia at least once every 12 months.     At its

             meeting on 7th September, 1987 (D ocunent 26, pages 128-130) the General

             Purposes Panel noted the details contained in a report by the Head of

             Administration and Legal Department about the operation of the Council's

             certification function for the safety of sports grounds.     One of the

             details mentioned in the report relates to inspections and the proposal

             that one large scale inspection per stadium should be carried out.        In

             fact the report itself does not make clear my intention that these

             inspections should be annual.   My intention at the time, and the Council's

             practice since has been to arrange annual inspections of sports grounds.

             The report goes on to indicate that these inspections vould be backed up

             by a series of "during event" inspections vhich proposal vas in line vith

             both the Popplewell Report and vith licensing practice in other areas.         I

             am aware that the Fire Service visit the sports ground during events and

             of course the Police are present during most specified activities.
                                                                                                343

             The Safety Certificate

     141 .   Under Condition 1(1) of the Safety Certificate, the Holder's nominee must

             be approved in writing by the Council.


     142.    Currently, the nominee is the Club Secretary.      On the 15th October, 1987,

             the City Council wrote (D o ca a en t 33, p age 140) to Sheffield Wednesday

             pointing out various provisions of the new Green Guide and making

             particular reference to the appointment of a Safety Officer as defined in

             Chapter 2 of'the Guide.    Sheffield Wednesday Football Club Pic responded

             to this letter on 23rd October (D ocnaent 34, page 141) and confirmed that

             Mr.   Mackrell's duties encompassed those of the Safety Officer and

             requesting that the Council's records be amended to note that he is

             responsible for all matters     of safetywithin the ground.


     143.    Under Condition 8(1) of the Certificate the Holder is required to provide

             and maintain at the sports ground, to the satisfaction of the Council, a

             suitably equipped first aid room.     The first aid room was installed and

             noted by the Officer Working Party to be in use on 21st February, 1983

             (Docuaent 67, page 207).    The question of first aid facilities was raised

             and discussed during 1987 and 1988 (Docuaent 28, page 134 and Docuaent 82,


•>           pages 243-244).

             Sheffield Wednesday - The Up to Date Position

     144.    On Wednesday, 10th May, 1989 the pre-planned annual inspection of the

             ground commenced involving Police Officers, Fire Officers and Council

             Officers from the Health and Consumer Services Department, the Building

             Surveyor's Division and theAdministration and Legal Department.        Detailed

             enquiries are being made of     SheffieldWednesday pursuant to the

             inspection.




                                                                                               344

                                          FURTHER GENERAL COMMENTS


                 General Safety Certificate Conditions

         145.    A copy of the Safety Certificate and the Conditions vhich form part of it

                 is attached to this Statement (Document 19, page8 103-112).      There are

                 some 31 terms and conditions contained in Schedule 2 to the Certificate.

                 The Holder is required to comply vith various terms and conditions

                 to the satisfaction of the Council, the Fire Officer or the Chief

                 Constable as provided for in the particular condition.    Generally, for

                 monitoring the ground the Council relies on annual inspections, during

                 activity inspections and being notified by, for example, the Club of any

                 proposed development or the Police (as they are present during most

                 specified activities) of any matter vhich causes them concern.     In

                 addition, following the Home Office Circular 72/1987 (Docuaent 4, pages

                 36-43) the Council would (where practicable) obtain copies of relevant

                 certificates of testing, etc.   on annual inspection.    I set out below my

                 comments on certain of the conditions.


                 Condition 3

         146.    This condition relates to the number of spectators who may be admitted to

•    I           the various areas of the Stadium.   These restrictions on the numbers of

                 spectators admitted to the Stadium are also referred to as capacities.


         147.    At the 1989 inspection a sample of the turnstile records was obtained.        It

                 is understood that these records are available from the Club for past

                 events.   There is reference on the file to individuals obtaining access to

                 the ground with forged tickets (Docuaent 38, page 148) and reference to

                 numbers of people with tickets for the "opposing" end of the ground being

                 removed to "their" end of the ground (Docuaent^ 38, pages 147-148).     There

                 is no evidence on file to suggest that the Club deliberately allow more

                 people into the ground than is provided for in the certificate.

                 Paragraphs 27-29, 31, 34 and 95 of my Statement refer to capacity on the


    HB5AAC/JJJ
                                                                ' ,                                 345
                                                   -46-


             Leppings Lane Terrace and there are other references to capacities on the

             Spion Kop.     There have been no amendments to spectator capacities in

             respect of    any part of the ground since the Spion Kop development   in

             1986.


     148.    Questions have been raised about the adjustment to capacities in relation

             to the alterations to the Directors' Box in the South Stand and also in

             relation to the incorporation of facilities for people with disabilities

             in the North Stand.     There is no reference on file about any changes to

             the Directors' Box on the South Stand.       At no time during the discussions

             in relation to the new    facilities for the disabled was any mention made of

             changes in capacity for the northstand.      Had the question of capacity

             been an issue I would have expected the Advisory Group members to raise

             it.


             Condition 8

     149.    This Condition relates   to first aid facilities and associated matters.


     150.    The County    Council, in 1979, approached the Area Health Authority   for

             advice on first aid facilities at Sheffield Wednesday.       The Area Health

             Authority responded on    31st May, 1979 (Document 87, pages 271-273) with a
#>           list of requirements.     References are made in the list to two or three

             treatment couches; six stretchers, two sets of stretcher wheels, 20

             blankets, six pillows and one "minute man" resuscitator.       Other comments

             are made about water requirements, lighting, etc.       On 15th August, 1979

             (Docment 16, pages 93-95) the Officer Working Party requested the Club to

             provide a permanent first aid structure during the 1980 close season,

             subject to the Club agreeing to provide the recommended first aid

             equipment immediately.


     151.    On 21st December, 1979 (Docuaent 88, page 274) the County Council wrote to

             Sheffield Wednesday indicating that the existing first aid facilities were

             accepted on an interim basis only pending the erection of purpose built

HB5AAC/JJJ
                                                                                              346
                                                     -47-


             facilites in the 1980 close season.      On 20th April, 1982 (D ocuaent 89,

             pages 276-277) the County Council wrote to Sheffield Wednesday following

             an Officer Working Party meeting at which the Club's outline drawing for

             new Police and first aid facilities was considered.        As far as the first

             aid facilities were concerned, four comments were made in particular

                (a)   The walls of the first aid room should be lined with a suitable
                      non-combustible and easily cleaned material, which would not need to
                      be redecorated.

                (b)   Lockable storage facilities for blankets, stretchers, etc. were to be
                      provided.

                (c)   A telephone point was to be provided in the first aid room.

                (d)   The floor was to be of easily cleanable material (such as quarry
                      tiles, etc.)


     152.    The Officer Working Party at its meeting on 21st February, 1983

             (Docvaent 67, page 207) noted that the new Police and first aid facilities

             under the north stand had been welcomed by the users and were proving to

             be most useful.


     153.    Following the interim Popplewell report, the County Council wrote          to

             Sheffield Wednesday on 9th August, 1985 (D ocaaen t 31, page 138) and drew

             attention to the necessity of providing adequate first aid and first aid

 {           room facilities.   Attention was also drawn to Condition 8 of the         Safety

             Certificate.    In December, 1987 (D o ca a en t 90, page 278 and D ocuaent 28,

             page 134) the City Council wrote to Sheffield Wednesday in response to the

             annual inspection which took place on 6th August, 1987.        It was noted on a

             schedule attached to the notification letter to Sheffield Wednesday that

             "The main first aid room requires to be supplied with adequate first aid

             equipment for the treatment of spectators .       .   ." It was also mentioned

             that the provision of qualified first aiders was being reviewed and the

             views of the Club on this subject were sought.


     154.    In a letter dated 15th January, 1988 (D ocaaen t 82, p a g e s 243-244)   Messrs.

             Eastwood & Partners responded to the Council's comments and noted the
                                                                                                 347
HB5AAC/JJJ
                                                  -48-


             views expressed on first aid equipment.     They went on to say that the Club

             regularly liaise with St.   John Ambulance about manning levels and a

             sufficient number of first aiders is provided for each game in line with

             the recommendations given by the football league.


   155.      The Green Guide deals with the question of first aid in paragraph 29

             (Management Responsibility).   Paragraph (x) is "to provide first aid

             facilities and first aid staff".


             Paragraphs 50 and 143 of my Statement also refer to first aid facilities.


             Condition 8(2) requires that during every specified activity a doctor

             shall be available to attend at the first aid room if required.


             Condition 8(3) relates to the number of first aid assistants required to

             be in attendance at specified activities and the condition states that

             there must be one first aid assistant for every 2,000 spectators.     Neither

             the County Council nor the City Council have varied that ratio.


             Condition 9

   156.      This condition relates to stewarding and makes particular reference to

             fitness and capability to carry out their duties, training and

             instruction, identifiable dress and written instructions as to their

             general duties.


             A schedule specifying the duties and responsibilities of safety stewards

             was handed to Club representatives on 10th April, 1980 at a meeting of the

             Officer Working Party (Document 98, page 302).


             At a meeting of the Officer Working Party on 13th November, 1985 (Document

             59, page 187) it was agreed that a draft booklet which had been prepared

             by the Police outlining the duties of safety stewards was acceptable and

             that it should be distributed to designated grounds for the information

             and guidance of stewards employed there.     Factors peculiar to particular
                                                                                             348
HB5AAC/JJJ
grounds could of course be added if considered appropriate.

Unfortunately, there is no copy of the booklet (which is identifiable as

such) on the file.     The Police and the Fire Service are involved in annual

briefing exercises for stewards and in addition there are tests of the

emergency procedures which include the stewards duties.      I also understand

that there are pre-match briefings of stewards.     There are two emergency

evacuation procedure drills particularly referred to on the files; the

first being mentioned at Paragraph 43 of my Statement.      This relates to a

test on 4th October, 1983 by the Fire Service.     The Fire Service stated

that    . . the stewards they questioned would have known what to do if

this message had been heard . . . "   (D ocuaent 21, page 118).


On 14th November, 1987 (D ocaaen t 99, pages 305-306) the Police instigated

a trial of the emergency evacuation procedure during a match and found

there to be some deficiencies in the Public Address System which were

subsequently reported to the Club.     Again, there is no comment that the

stewards' responses were in any way inadequate.


Paragraphs 43, 91, 92, 111, 113, 114, 171 and 191 of my Statement refer to

stewarding.    There has been no concern recently expressed about stewarding

at the Leppings Lane end of the sports ground, but the Building Surveyor

did comment on the Spion Kop stewarding in a memorandum dated 2nd

February, 1988 which was considered by the Safety of Sports Grounds

Advisory Group on 23rd March, 1988.     It was indicated by the Police

Representative at that meeting that the point had been taken up with

Sheffield Wednesday.     Some records of steward training were produced at

the 1989 inspection of the ground and further details are being obtained.


Condition 10

Condition 10 refers to the immediate and easy opening of final exit

doors/gates, the manning of those doors/ gates by stewards and the opening

of them at appropriate times.     The Police determine which doors/gates are
                                                      -50-


                opened/closed on match days and no complaints have been received from the

                Police or the Fire Service about this procedure.       Neither have there been

                complaints about the manning of doors/gates by stewards.       The final exit

                gates are subject to at least annual inspection by the Fire Service and

                occasionally by the Building Surveyor.       Other references in my Statement

                to the type of items covered by Condition 10 can be found at paragraphs

                43, 92, 103, 110 and 134.



                Condition 11(4)

      160.      This Condition refers to the maintenance of all means of ingress to and

                egress from the sports ground in good condition and free from obstruction.

                Generally these routes are checked both on annual inspection and during

                specified activities by the appropriate Advisory Group members.


                Condition 15(1)

      161   .   This Condition relates to the structural parts of the sports ground which

                are required to be maintained in sound order and to the appropriate and

                relevant standards in the Guide, and in all cases to the satisfaction of

                the Council.


                Presumably when the County Council issued the Safety Certificate to
• I
                Sheffield Wednesday Football Club Ltd in December, 1979 it was satisfied

                (subject to compliance with certain conditions) that this ground was

                reasonably safe (Docnaent 14, page 85).


                Various structural parts of the sports ground are also checked on

                inspection.    It should be borne in mind that full structural surveys of

                buildings at the sports ground is rarely practicable in view of their

                considerable size.    Separate consideration is, of course, given to

                structural alterations at each sports ground as and when they are

                proposed.
                                                                                                 ZJ'i




 HB5AAC/JJJ
                                                    -51-


   162.      My Statement refers at some considerable length to structural matters.


   163.      As far as the Leppings Lane Terrace is concerned, it was subject to a

             visual inspection by the Building Surveyor on the 1988 inspection.            The

             tunnel (connecting the Leppings Lane Terrace and the open area at the

             back of the West Stand) and the turnstile wall were inspected at that

             time.


             Condition 16

   164.      This Condition covers the maintenance of emergency equipment and the

             maintenance, repair or renewal of any items within the Stadium as may from

             time to time be necessary.    There is also a requirement to maintain the

             operational parts of the Stadium in good and efficient working order.               The

             matters covered by this Condition are generally dealt with on annual

             inspections and by during event visits where appropriate.


             Condition 18(2)

   165.      Emergency vehicle access routes are covered by this Condition.           The Fire

             Service has commented on 16th May, 1979 (D oconent 1 3 , page 8 4 )    that

             adequate roads should be provided to ensure that speedy and direct access

             can be obtained by emergency vehicles to all exterior parts of the

             stadium.   They also mentioned that it was necessary to ensure that parked

             vehicles would not obstruct this access.      I understand from this

             letter that the Fire Service only require vehicular access to the exterior

             of each building in the football ground.      The emergency access routes are

             shown on plan 1610/llA.    The Officer Working Party at a meeting on 12th

             November, 1979 ( D ocaaen t 18, page 101) agreed that whilst no real problems

             had occurred in the past the Club would in consultation with the Fire

             Service and the Police mark out a lane from the main gates to the south

             stand in which parking would not be allowed.      It was also agreed that the

             hydrant outside the south stand would have to be kept clear.          The Police

             noted on 26th March, 1980 (D ocuaent 8 4 , page 264)   that they did not have
                                                                                                       3 b1
HB5AAC/JJJ
                                                   -52-


             any current probleas in respect of the access for emergency vehicles.

             Access for ambulances is referred to at D ocuaent 87, page 273 and D ocaaent

             86, page 269.   The reference in Document 86 is set out in greater detail

             be low.


     166.    During the planning stage for the redevelopment of the kop, the Club

             offered (letter from Eastwoods 29th November, 1985 - Document 85, page

             268) to widen the gangway between the North Stand and the retaining wall

             of the kop to enable fire engines to get to the front of all stands.           The

             Fire Service responded to this at an Officer Working Party meeting (22nd

             January, 1986 - Docuaent 61, page 193)       by saying that whilst they felt

             that such a facility was not essential       for their purposes it could be

             useful for use by emergency vehicles in certain situations and generally

             should be supported.     In a letter from Eastwoods dated 18th December, 1986

             (Docuaent 86, pages 269-270) proposals were submitted for creating a new

             entrance to the Sports Hall off Penistone Road so that the public would no

             longer have to use gate 'O', (Plan numbers 7593/1 and 2).       Another purpose

             of the development was to provide separate access for Police vehicles,

             ambulances, etc.   on match days; the proposal effectively reduced dangers

             which could result from vehicles having to pass queueing spectators to

•I           gate
             'O'.  This development did take place.


     167.    It is the responsibility of the Club to maintain       these access routes, free

             of obstruction, and the emergency services have never indicated that there

             have been problems with them.     I would expect the Police (who are present

             during the majority of specified activities) to make appropriate comments

             should the need arise.


             I understand that meetings have taken place between the Police, the Fire

             Service and the Ambulance Service on the emergency evacuation procedures

             at Sheffield Wednesday.     I assume those discussions dealt with the




HB5AAC/JJJ
emergency access of vehicles to the sports ground.         The City Council has

had no direct contact with the Ambulance Service on this matter.


Condition 24

This Condition relates to the engineers' annual inspection of the sports

ground.     There is no record of any copies of Certificates being submitted

in 1984-1987, but a copy of the 1988 Certificate (dated 2nd August 1988 -

Docuaent 100, p*ge 307) was submitted on 10th May, 1989.         Previous

Certificates were submitted for 1980 to 1983 - see D ocaaent 68, pages

208-209 and Docaaent 70, p a g e s 214-215 for examples.


Condition 28

This Condition prescribes the various records which need to be kept by the

Holder and produced to authorised officers on request.         The records kept

under Condition 28(1),(2) and (3) were checked on 10th May, 1989 and

subsequent enquiries about them are being made.      The checking of records

under Condition 28(4) is not practicable,     due to the wide ranging scope

of the condition.     However, all major work is inspected through specific

applications or inspections.

THE LAYOUT OF THE LEPPINGS LANE TERRACE
WITH PARTICULAR REFERENCE TO PENS 3 AND 4

In the earlier part of my statement (see paragraphs 101-118) I refer to

the full history of discussions and decisions between the interested

parties (the Police, Fire Service, the Building Authority and the Club,

and its Consulting Engineers) leading up to and following the installation

of the radial fences on the Leppings Lane terrace.         It will be recalled

that the installation of fences took place in two distinct stages in 1981

and 1985.     In relation to the 1981 proposals it is clear from the

correspondence on file, which is particularly referred to in my statement,

that the fences were erected only after careful and thorough consideration

by the appropriately qualified experts.
                                                    -54-


   171.      In early 1985 the Club, via their Consulting Engineers, Messrs.

             Eastwoods & Partners, submitted proposals to alter the Leppings Lane end

             of the ground and to construct two new radial fences on the Leppings Lane

             terrace.   The reasons for the additional fences on the Leppings Lane

             terrace involved the better control of supporters.      Once again, full and

             careful consideration was given to the proposals by the County Council

             involving the Police, the Fire Service, the Building Authority, the Club

             and its Consulting Engineers.     Full details of the discussions dealing

             with the positioning, width and proposed stewarding of the gates in the

             radial fences are related in the earlier part of my statement.


   172.      As far as the Green Guide is concerned, paragraphs 101 to 103 (in

             Chapter 8) refer to the division of spectator accommodation.      These

             paragraphs of the Guide are drafted in general terms.      There is no

             evidence on the file to suggest that the penning arrangements at Leppings

             Lane conflict with the general statements contained in the Guide.

             Obviously, the pens were constructed over a number of years, and were

             installed and approved in that situation by all the interested parties I

             have already listed.


             Crush Barriers on the Leppings Lane Terrace
             Layout

   173.      The layout of the barriers was approved when the Certificate was issued on

             21st December, 1979.   The barrier layout must have been reviewed when the

             radial fences were installed in 1981 and 1985.


   174.      On 7th August, 1986, the Sheffield Wednesday Football Club was subject

             to an annual inspection.     During the course of this annual inspection I

             recall that the Police representative requested that crush barrier number

             144 be reduced so that the persons entering the terrace from the tunnel

             would not be obstructed by it.    Apparently,   there had been some

             difficulties in this area.     The barrier itself penetrated the central


                                                                                            354
HB5AAC/JJJ
                                                    -55-


             radial fence immediately in front of the tunnel.       The barrier was indeed

             reduced with the result that barrier 144 now contains only one section,

             that is in the north central pen (see plan 1610/64E).       This issue was

             considered at the time of the inspection in the presence of

             representatives from the Fire Authority, the Police, the Building

             Authority and Messrs.    Eastwood & Partners, the Club's Consulting

             Engineers.    No problems with this revised barrier arrangement have been

             brought to my attention.


   175.      I should, however, point out that no written record of the decision to

             reduce the barrier is noted on the file.      I can, however, say that X

             remember the discussion and that none of the persons present objected to

             the reduction of the barrier.


             Strength

   176.      As far as the strength of the barriers is concerned, they were tested

             by Messrs.    Eastwood & Partners on 14th, 15th, 18th and 19th July, 1988

             and the report (Docuaent 83, pages 246-249) is attached to this statement.

             There were one or two defects discovered on the test which are noted in

             Eastwoods' letter which were remedied during 1988.       The barriers had also

             been tested in 1979 and 1983.


             Height

   177.      Prior to certification, it was brought to the attention of the Working

             Party (Doeuaent 9, page 66) that many of the barriers were below the

             height recommended in the Guide.     Ihis was brought to the attention of the

             Club at a meeting on 2nd April, 1979 (D o c a a e n t 10, page 71), and was the

             subject of detailed discussion between Dr. Eastwood and the Building

             Surveyor.    As the ground was subsequently certificated by the County

             Council without requiring all the crush barriers to be replaced, I

             conclude that the Guide was applied flexibly as advised by the Home Office

             and that the Council were satisfied that the ground was reasonably safe.


                                                                                               35
                                                                                                    Of




HB5AAC/JJJ
                                                    -56-


             The Access Tunnel to the Leppings Lane Terrace

   178.      This tunnelwhich runs beneath the west terrace     is   not of a constant

             gradient and at   the end increases to a gradient of    1:6 on the approach to

             the terrace itself.


   179.      The files in my possession indicate that there have been no

             discussions about the tunnel itself.     No complaints have been received

             about the tunnel.     As far as I am aware there have been no problems with

             the tunnel and as it has been used for many years by many thousands of

             spectators without apparent difficulty or incident.


             The Wall at   the Leppings Lane Turnstiles

   180.      The wall at   the turnstiles is approximately 14' high from ground level to

             the coping stones and should prevent persons climbing into the ground in

             the majority of circumstances.


             Prohibition Notices in respect of Sheffield Wednesday

   181 .     No Prohibition Notices have been issued in respect of Sheffield

             Wednesday as there was no indication that there was a serious risk to

             spectators warranting such action.     The Inquiry will be aware that since

             the tragic events at Hillsborough the Leppings Lane end of the ground has

             been largely closed and certainly no spectators have been admitted to the

             terrace or to the west stand.


   182.      On 25th April, 1989 a meeting was held between the Club and the various

             officers and it was agreed that the next two football matches would be

             postponed as the Leppings Lane end of the ground was closed which

             prevented the efficient segregation of spectators and emergency

             evacuation.   It was agreed that reserve matches could go ahead as they

             have a limited number of spectators.


   183.      On 2nd May, 1989 there was a meeting held to discuss future games and

             on 4th May, various officers visited the sports ground to look at the


HB5AAC/JJJ                                                                                    356
                                                   -57-


             proposed plans for segregation, admission and evacuation of spectators

             for football matches.    It was agreed that matches could go ahead using

             part of the Leppings Lane end, but not the terraces or the stand.       The

             Leppings Lane end remains closed and will not be used for the time being.

             If it appears necessary to do so, the Council will consider issuing a

             Prohibition Notice to prevent the opening of the west terrace prior to the

             interim report of the Inquiry, as extra works required at the ground may

             then be determined.


             The Fire Safety and Safety of Places of Sport Act 1987

             Following the commencement of the Act, the existing delegations, etc.

             were felt to be sufficient and the matter was fully reviewed in a report

             to the General Purposes Panel in January, 1989.      The various delegations

             were then restated as far as it was necessary to do so.      On receipt of

             Home Office Circulars 71/1987 (Document 2, pages 17-29) and 72/1987

             (Document 4, pages 36-43) were circulated to all members of the Advisory

             Group.


             The Safety Certificate

   185.      The original 1979 Certificate is still in force in respect of Sheffield

             Wednesday.   Amendments to it are dealt with by letter and do not as such

             feature in the body of the Certificate.      Amendments to the Safety

             Certificate are dealt with in paragraphs 133-136 of my Statement.


             Directional Signs in relation to access to the ground

   186.      There has been criticism about the adequacy of directional signs within

             the sports ground which would direct people to pens other than the two

             central pens on the Leppings Lane terrace.      The point has been made that

             fans entering through turnstiles A to G or Gate C could only see the

             tunnel which leads to the two central pens and no other signs.      There is

             in fact one small directional sign to the right of the west stand which

             says "standing".

                                                                                            357
HB5AAC/JJJ
                                                                  -58-


    187.     It is appropriate to point out that spectator flow on match days is a

             matter on which the Council would need to take advice, from the

             Club and members of the Advisory Group.                     There is no record on any of the

             files that there was any suggestion of inadequacy in signing arrangements

             for the terrace at Leppings Lane and had it been a significant factor I

             would have expected that the matter would have been raised.                              The provision

             of signing is not usually a complex or expensive task.


             Means of egress onto the pitch from Leppings Lane Terrace

    188 .    There is no clear record on the files as to when the pitch perimeter

             fence at Hillsborough was in fact installed, but it appears to have been

             in place when the County Council first looked at the sports ground from

             the point of view of a Certificating Authority.


    189.     According to the files, the pitch perimeter gates at Leppings Lane were

             considered in 1985 when the second radial barrier development plan was

             submitted.        It was agreed by the Officer Working Party and the Club and

             its representatives that one pitch perimeter fence gate was to be provided

             per pen.       (D ocu aen t 4 9 , p ages 1 6 8 - 1 6 9 , Document 5 5 , p ages 1 77-178 and

•            There is no information on the files relating to whether or not the

             pitch perimeter gates should be signed.


    191.     The means of access laterally between the pens on the Leppings Lane

             terrace are the gates at the top of each radial fence immediately adjacent

             to the west stand wall.              The gates are designed so that when they are

             open a clear 1 . 1 5 metre opening remains.                  Manning of gates is dealt with

    192.     There are no gangways as defined by Che Guide on Che Leppings Lane

             Terrace.   Annex 'A' of the Green Guide defines gangways as being channels

             for Che passage of speccators through a terrace running across the slope

             (lateral gangway) or running with the slope (radial gangway).   Paragraph

             96 of the Guide indicates that the aim should be to ensure that every

             speccacor on the terrace is within 12 metres of a gangway or exit so that

             they can move quickly on to exit routes at the end of an event or in the

             event of an emergency.

             All the proposed major alterations to the terraces have been considered by

             the Working Party and therefore subject to full and careful consideration

             by the interested parties.

                              MR. COLLINS:   Sir, the whole purpose of my going through
                         the documentation was to avoid having to repeat it through
                         witnesses.  1 am mindful of that.  May I say for the benefit
                         of the press what I propose to do is to treat Mr. B o w n e s '
                         statement as his evidence without requiring him to go tnrough
                         it in any detail at all.

                              LORD   JUSTICE TAYLOR:   Shall I make it clear to'the press
            B            that that   means in this case the statement they have, of which
                         they have   a copy, is the evidence-in-chief, so they can quote
                         any of it   they want to.

                              MR. COLLINS:   The same of course applied to the Fire
                         witness and to Dr. Eastwood as well.

                 0. Mr. Bownes. you have heard that, and I take it you will
                    confirm the accuracy of the statement which you made? - A.
                    Yes, sir.

                 Q. You are the Chief Licensing Officer of the Sheffield City
             D      Council? - A. Yes. sir.

                 u   ,   In the A d m i n i s t r a t i o n ana Legal Department? - A. Y e s

                 0. Mr. Bownes. football grounds are not the only licensing
                    concern of the City Council.  Is that right? - A. That
                    is right, sir, yes.

                 0. You say in your statement that you have 33 different systems
                    of licensing to administer? - A. That is correct, sir.

                 0.      Which range from taxis through sex shops, through....                 - A.
                         Cinemas, theatres, places of public entertainment and                 so on.

                 Q.      How many people do you have to          assist you in this iicensing
                         c o n c e r n ? - A. Five in addition   to myself.

                 o.      So there are six of you altogether?                  Yes.

                 0 . And if there nave to be prosecutions for breaches of any of
                     the licensing requirements is that something your Department
                     also handles? - A. Yes.

                         So the six of you have to handle not only control, you also
                         have to handle prosecutions? - A. Yes.

                 0.      Have you found it possible generally to cope? - A. Yes. in
                         general t e r m s .

                 u . Does       it mean you have to adopt a system of priorities? - a .
                         Yes.   sir.

                        the Sheffield Wednesday football ground safety certificate? -
                        A . Yes.

                  0. You, of course, come into the picture as a result of local
                     government reorganisation which came into force in April 1986?
                     - a . Yes.
             B    0. And that meant you became the licensing authority in the place
                     of the South Yorkshire County Council? - A. The City Council
                     did, y e s .

                  0. I say "you".  I mean the City Council.  When you realised you

                             LORD JUSTICE TAYLOR:     Just give me that date again?

                             MR. COLLINS:       1st April 1986 is the change over day.
                        The old Councils expired on 31st March and the new ones took
                        over on 1st A p r i l :

                  0. Mr. Bownes. were there other licensing functions you took over
                     from the old South Yorkshire apart from football grounds? - A.
             J)      Nor that the licensing section took over.  There were some
                     others in relation to poisons and what have vou that went to
                     other D e p a r t m e n t s .

                  0. Eut your Department, this was the only extra matter that you
                     took over as a result of local government reorganisation? - A.
                     Yes.

                  0. You no doubt got from South Yorkshire the relevant files? - A.
                     yes.

                  0. And you familiarised yourself with those? - A. Yes.

                  0. Did you go to Sheffield Wednesday ground? - A. Not in April
                     1986, no.

                  0. When did you first go to the ground? - A. I believe that was
                     later on that year.  The inspection was in August 1986.  I
                     think there may have been a visit before that to deal with the
                     Kop.

                  Q. The other ground the City Council became concerned with was
                     Sheffield United? - A. Yes.

                  O. Were there any other grounds within the jurisdiction of the
                      city? - A. Yes. sir, Owlerton turned up in August 1936
                      designated as a new stadium.

                  0. That had not then been designated when you took over,       but it
                     was thought it was about to be? - A. Yes.

              -   q   . But the two most important ones at the time you took over     were
              H         Sheffield Wednesday and Sheffield United? - A. Yes.

We know Sheffield Wednesday had a safety certificate which had
been issued in 1979 and which had never been changed? - A.
Yes.

So far as Sheffield United wais concerned did that have a
safety certificate? - A. It did not.

Is there a safety certificate in being for Sheffield United
now? - A. No, there is not.

When was it designated?

     LORD JUSTICE TAYLOR:    Has it been? - A. It has been
designated, sir. yes.   I don't know, sir.

Is that a separate instrument?   There was one especially for
Hillsborough, I gather? - A. Yes, it was a separate one, a
much later one. I think, owing to this question of moving up
and down the Divisions.   I am not too sure when it was.  I can
find it out. though, sir.

     MR. COLLINS:    The result is Sheffield United has been
operating without a safety certificate when it should nave haa
one? _ a . That is not quite right, sir.   Any designated ground
can continue to operate as a sports ground provided an
application has been submitted.    It is my understanding an - -
application has been submitted for Sheffield United.

     LORD JUSTICE TAYLOR:   Can you let us know when that was
done? - A. That can certainly be found out.

     MR. COLLINS:   Anyway, had you ever been to Sheffield
Wednesday, even as a paying customer or not? - A. No. sir.

So the significance of whatever might have appeared in the
safety certificate of itself would have meant nothing to you?
Obviously when you read the files you could follow some of the
history, but the details themselves meant very little? - A.
The details of the safety certificate are reasonably clear,
sir.  It does not require knowledge of the ground as such.

I am sorry, I   am talking   about things like capacity and the
layout of the   ground and   so on? - A. Obviously the layout of
the ground is   a bit of a   closed book without the advantage of
seeing it and   looking at   the plan.

Did you, for example, appreciate on reading through the files
that "there had been the creation of these pens on the West
terraces? - A. No. sir, it was not immediately apparent to me.
That is a very detailed matter which would require a great
deal of research at the time.

So you were not aware of the significance when you took over
of those pens and their effect or potential effect on the
capacities? - A. No, sir, not at all, that.would be true.

We know that the system under South Yorkshire had been via a

                            history.

                         0. And had reported back to the relevant subcommittee of the
                            County Council?   It is not entirely clear _precisely what its
                            status was? - A. That is entirely right, sir.   I am not sure
                 B          what its status was, actually.

                         Q. And did you consider in any event that was something that was
                            rather unsatisfactory? - A. I regarded it as a matter that
                            perhaps needed clarifying somewhat, yes.

                         0. When you came into the picture you came in effectively with
                            the memorandum at page 313 of the core bundle attached to a
                            letter dated 5th June, with the report annexed to it. an
                            earlier report.  Have you got page 133? - A. Yes. I have.
#
                         G.   If we look at the first sentence we see that there is a
                              reference to a report submitted to the March 1966 meeting,
                              which of course was the meeting which was held prior to take
                              over.

                     D              LORD JUSTICE TAYLOR:   As I have it in front of me I
                              gather that Sheffield United was designated on 3rd July. 1964.


                         0.         MR. COLLINS:   Which means, speaking from memory, it had
                              then to put in an application for a certificate once it had
                              been designated? - A. No. sir, I believe would have to put in
                              an application immediately before it was designated.

                         0. That is right.  It was then up to the relevant licensing
                            authority to decide on what were the particular terms required
                            in any safety certificate? - A. Strictly, sir, to determine
                            whether or not the applicant was a qualified person.

                         G. It has taken effectively therefore 5 years? - A. Yes, sir.

                         G. And there is still no safety certificate? - A. That is right,
                            sir.  I should explain that the County Council on its
                            dissolution was about to issue a safety certificate for it
                            pending the completion of certain works that the Fire Service
                            required.  I understand those works were not completed by the
                            time of the dissolution of the County Council.

                         G. We are not strictly concerned with Sheffield United.   Let us
                            come back to Sheffield Wednesday.   Can I just ask you as a
                            matter of introduction, and I am sorry this is not in our core
                            bundle, but it is page 122 of your bundle, Mr. Bownes. oecause
                            this is the March 1986 report, just in order to put the whole
                            matter in context.   I say "your report", it is under Mr.
                            Pensam's name but drafted by you? - A. Yes, sir. that is the

                              knowledge of local government also understands.  Really, what
                              you are doing there is recording that the City Council will
                              have to take over as a result of the legislation, and you
                      B       refer to the Bradford disaster and the Popplewell Report, and
                              indicate that a more detailed report will be submitted as soon
                              as possible? - A. Yes. sir.

                          Q. And really you recommend the delegations, that the General
                             Purposes Panel should have the powers under the 1975 Act? -   a   .
                             Yes .

                          0. And a further delegation of the Emergency Procedures and
•                     C      authorisation of officers under the relevant section? - A.
                             Yes, s i r .

                       Q. So can we come on, please, to the report at our page 313
                          or your page 124, whichever you prefer? Now, you refer
                          to the current situation which wasinherited. You say two
                          sports grounds currently subject. First, Sheffield
                          Wednesday. Yes, if I bother to look I .... Sheffield
                          Wednesday designated in August, 1978, certificate issued
                          December, 1979, undergoing major works to Jhe Kop. And
                          then you refer to Sheffield Unitedand indicate that it
                  B       was hoped that the Council would be in a position to
                          issue a certificate before the start of the 86/87 season.
                          Then you refer to Owlerton which is expected to be des­
                          ignated. Can I ask you to look over the page, please,
                          at the paragraph safety certificate, standard conditions?
                          You indicate the desirability of standardisation for
                          obvious reasons. Then you say this, "The conditions do,
                          however, give some cause for concern as they appear to be
                          inadequate or inappropriate in some areas." Now, the only
                          conditions or the only safety certificate that e::isted
                          was of course Sheffield Wednesday’s. Is that right? - A.
                          That is correct, sir, yes.
                       Q. And therefore the inadequacy and inappropriateness of the
                          conditions in some areas must have referred, must it not,
                          to Sheffield Wednesday, on the face of it? - A. It did,
                   D      s i r , yes.
                       Q. Can you heIP us please, as to what conditions vou conside:
                          to be eith er inadequate or inappropriate?- A. Yes. T
                          should explain, sir, first of all, that that phrase is
                          what, if I may use one of Dr. Eastwood's comments, is a
                          daft phras e, to be honest. It was not carefully thought
                          out by the look of it. In fact it is my view that there
                          were no fa tal errors in the conditions themselves.
                          There were certain areas that needed tightening up.
                          For exampl e, it refers to the County Council throughout
                          whereas it should of course now refer to the City Council
                       Q. Well, yes, that is a fairly obvious one but that does not
                          make much difference, does it? I think in the legislation
                          there was a provision, was not there, an interim provision,
                          which effectively provided that in any document where
                          County Council appeared read relevant .... - A. Yes, sir.
                          The point I was making was that is the sort of order of
                          defect that there was in the certificate.
                       Q.        LORD JUSTICE TAYLOR:    Really one would not get that
                            impression from this, not talking about .... "A. Yes, I
                            agree with you entirely, sir. On looking at it again in
                            the light of this Inquiry I would entirely agree the words
                            are wrong ....
                       Q. So    there was nothing that gave cause for concern? - A.
                            The conditions gave some cause for concern in that there
                            were were drafting corrections that needed to be made.

                     Q.        MR. COLLINS:   W as there anything of substance that
                          you had identified that needed to be addressed? - A. There
                          was nothing, if you like, fatal in the conditions that I
                          could see that needed to be addressed immediately.
                     Q. If I had been asking you in May of 1986, Mr. Bownes, which
                        conditions do you regard as inadequate and/which do you
                        regard as inappropriate what would you have told me? - A.
                 B      Exactly what I have told you already, sir. As I have
                        explained, the wording is inappropriate. There is r.o
                        question about that.
                     Q.Did anyone on the committee ask, as far as you are aware,
                        which*were the inadequacies and which were the .... -A.
                          cannot honestly recall, sir.  It is an awful long tine.

                     Q.        LORD JUSTICE TAYLOR:   If it is just a question of
                          changing South Yorkshire to Sheffield City it would hardly
                          merit, it you look further down, a redraft of conditions
                          would of course be submitted to the Fire Service, the
                          Police and building surveyor for .... - A. I think in
                          anticipating the redrafting, sir, I anticipated there may
                          be changes that would be needed as well,simply to update
                          things. Changes may have occurred at the ground that
                 D        needed reflecting.
                     Q.        MR. COLLINS:   W hy? Were you aware on looking through
                          the file that there were changes that had occurred which
                          would need reconsideration of the certificate or was this
                          iust an assumption? - A. It was an assumption, sir. I
                          believe conditions that had been in operation for that long
                          could well require review and people might well have
                          changed their views as to the sort of things that needed
                          addressing.
                     0. But if South Yorkshire had been doing its job properly
                        surely you would have expected it to pass on a note, or
                        your opposite number in South Yorkshire to pass on a
                        note, saying look, this needs to be dealt with or that
                        needs to be dealt with?- A. Yes, sir. I find with
                        certificate conditions and what have you that people
                        tend to take them as read for years without constructively
                        looking at them to decide whether or not they ought to be
                        changed. That is my experience with other conditions the
                        Council has been involved in in licensing areas.
                     Q. So what you are saying is your experience told you that
                        it would*be sensible to have a fresh look at these? - A.
                        Yes, sir.
                     0. Ar.d you intended to mean no more than that when you used
                        these words inadequate or inappropriate? - A. Yes, sir.

to agree it was a daft expression to use. - A. It was, sir.
I would fully support that. That is right.
On the face of it, it goes a lot further than that, does not
it? - A. Yes, sir, without question.

Yes, I see. Did you have available a draft certificate
for Sheffield United? - A. Yes, sir, I believe there was
one copy on the Sheffield United file.
Because you also refer to the redraft where appropriate
and to submit to the panel for approval and then go on,
"The Sheffield United certificate could then be issued
with the new conditions before the start of the 55/87
season." That rather suggests that you had spotted
something other than mere drafting natters in the
Sheffield United certificate which you thought ought
to be brought up-to-date_or changed?- A. M o, I would
not accept that necessarily, sir. I must admit I have
not read the Sheffield United certificate recently
so I cannot really say what that comment referred to.
I see. M ow, over the page you refer to an attempt to
get the Health and Safety Executive in the picture. - A.
Yes .
W as that in the hope that it would take the burden off
the City Council and your shoulders?- A. Not at all, sir.
It came from a recommendation in the Popplewell P.eport.
I know it did but was your hope that if the Health and
Safety could be persuaded to involve themselves this would
mean "that your department would not have to shoulder the
responsibility? - A. I cannot see how that could happen, sir
The Council is the certificating authority ....
Well, I know. - A............and therefore carrys the can any way
I see.   So there was no hope of getting someone else to
carry out some work that otherwise you might have to do?
- a/ I do not agree with the way you phrase that, sir, to
be honest. I would have hoped the Health and Safety
Executive could have put a useful input into the Council's
advisory system, if you like, for certificating.
I follow. Now, one of the matters that I think you spotted
when you received the safety certificate from the County
Council was that the plans had not been signed, is that
right, the plans . . . . - A. No, sir.
W hen you say "No, sir" you mean they had not been signed?
- A. No, sir.   I had not spotted anything about the plans,
to be quite honest.
Can I ask you to V. ok at paragraph 130 of your proof?           Do

                                 you see you refer in that paragraph first of ail to
                                 sections of the Act and then you say under Schedule
                                 1 of the certificate the definition of plans is -we
                                 can see this at our page 107, I think - document or
                                 documents attached to and forming part of the general
                                 safety certificate and signed by the person signing
                                 the certificate. W  hen the files were hand«d over to
                                 the Sheffield City Council in April? 1936, a copy of
                       B         the general safety certificate was m an envelope
                                 together with a number of plans none of which were
                                 signed by Mr. Mallett,the original signatory of the
                                 certificate. This, do I understand from your answer
                                 you gave a moment ago, this is something you have
                                 spotted since? - A. Yes, sir, that is entirely correct.
                               Q. But you did not spot that at the time? - A. I did not.
                                  sir, no.
#                              Q. One thing that has not come out and I an looking at your
                                  paragraph. 134 in the history so far is that it would
                                  appear that there were one or two amendments to the
                                  safety certificate which had not been incorporated in
                                  the certificate itself? - A. Yes, sir, those are a
                       D          mystery to me.
                               0. Again, is that a matter which you have discovered since
                                  this tragedy and you have been investigating for the
                                  purpose of giving evidence? - A. Yes, sir. As you will
                                  appreciate, for the benefit of the Inquiry, considerable
                                  work has gone into the files to extract all relevant
                                  information as far as possible.
                               0. Maybe slightly surprising, Mr. Bownes, that that had not
                                  been done in the last three or four years, three years,
                                  rather, since the City Council was considering what ought
                                  to be in the safety certificate? - A. Yes. The impression
                                  I had on taking over the administrative system was that
                                  everything was O.K., everybody was happy with what was
                                  going off essentially.
                               Q. Well, one thing that must have become perfectly - well, no,
                                  I will come to that later. Any way, there were apparently
                                  amendments to the conditions, details of which we have not
                                  seen, but they are somewhere on the file, are they, indic­
                                  ating wording amendments to conditions 10 and 26, wording
                                  amendments to 10 and a time limit variation on 26? - A.
                                  Yes,.sir. They are not actually on this file, though
                                  they can be produced if required.
                               Q. You mean thev were not even on the right file, they were
                                  on a different file? - A. No, sir. They are not in this
                                  file here.

You refer to then there, and I imagine they are not
enormously material or are they? - A. No, I do not
think they are, sir, no.
Just indicates a slight, if one may be forgiven to use
the word, sloppiness in approach to what goes into the
safety certificate? - A. That is a natter of speculation
as to what the County Council actually did -----
     LORD JUSTICE TAYLOR:   Sorry. Would you speak up?
- A. Sorry. It is a question of speculation there as to
what the County Council actually did and what they
intended by these alterations. It is not possible to
pick that up from the file.
     MR. COLLINS:' Any way we know that there was a
meeting at the ground in August of 1986. Is that right?
- A. The inspection, sir?
Inspection, yes. ~ A. Yes, sir.
And you attended that, did you? - A. I did, sir, yes.
And I think you told us you had been to the ground before
that? - A. Yes, sir.
Was that correct? The purpose of that inspection was
what, as vou understood it?- A. It was one of the inspections
of the ground, the usual ones the County Council used to
organise, sir.
Yes. And also was it, as you understood it, to view the new
works that had been completed at the Kop? - A. No,sir.
That was wholly separate, was it? - A. That was an entirely
separate issue. If I could just mention, I had previously
been to Sheffield Wednesday on the 10th of July, 1936, to
discuss questions of the ICop.
     LORD JUSTICE TAYLOR:   20th of July? - A. No, sir.
The 10th of July.
Was that the first lvisit you ever nade? - A. To the best
of my recollection, sir, yes.

10th of July, 1986. " A. Yes.
And the inspection you are now referring to was when?

     MR. COLLINS:   7th of August.
     THE WITNESS:   Yes, sir, I believe   it was.
     HR. COLLINS:   How, can I just   see if I fully understand

the composition of the ~ what do you call it - safety
committee? - A. At that stage, sir, it was the working
party still.
Still the working party? - A. Yes, sir.

And what was your intention about its composition and how
it should work and its responsibilities? -A. I had formed
no intention at that stage, sir. Formed a number of views,
but the intention was at that stageit should operate as
the old working party did.
Mow, it would appear that the old working party had no
chairman? - A. To be quite honest, sir, I have not really
been able to establish how the old working party worked
as such.
It does not matter how the old one worked. How did yours
work when it started its operations ? - A. Well, sir, it
started its operation strictly, if I may go back in history
a while to a meeting that took place on Friday, the 4th of
July, 1936. That was a meeting to discuss a letter from
Dr.*Eastwood, the 26th of June, relating to The Kop. i
recall that that letter included a number of plans, I
believe, sir, and there were discussions about v/hat was
going to happen in relation to them. Immediately prior
to that meeting, sir, I formed the view I was going to
follow'exactly as far as I could what the old County
Council had done, as far as I       couldunderstandit, in
relation to preparing notes of meetings and so on and
so forth. However, sir, I was struck at that time,
within a few minutes of getting into the meeting, that
there were potentially serious problems with the Kop,
particularly from the point of view of the-Fire Service.
     LORD JUSTICE TAYLOR: It is very difficult to hear
you. I am sorry. Uould you bring the microphone closer
and try and speak a little louder? - A. Yes.

 J1
                         LORD JUSTICE TAYLOR: You realized there were serious
                     what? A. The fire service was saying there were serious
                     problems with the Kop from their point of view.      This came
                     as a surprise as I thought matters were proceeding well with
                     the Kop.  The proposal had originally been submitted in
                     October, 1985.  The information I had was that things were
                     going quite smoothly.   Then, on 4th July, 1986, it appears
                     that there were some difficulties, particularly in relation
                 B   to the eight minute metre for evacuation which is referred
                     to in the Green Guide.   This prompted a series of further
                     meetings, one on the 10th J u l y , 1986, which I have already
                     referred to, at Sheffield Wednesday, and the other on the 15th
                     July, 1986, at the. Police social club.     Then, of course,
                     finally to the committee meeting I believe on the 21st August
                     which dealt with the question of the Kop.      You will appreciate
                     Sir, with that time scale that things were moving ahead
                     at that stage and I did not really have time to prepare
                     the sort of notes of the meetings that I would have liked
                     to have done .

                         MR. COLLINS: Did you prepared any notes of meetings at
                     all? A. I did prepare some rough notes for myself, Sir,
                     yes
                 D   But nothing was put on the file? A . It certainly was and
                     you have copies of them.

                     Let us come back, if I may, to the inspection by the Working
                     Party on the 7th August, 1986.  This as I understand it
                     was to be treated, was it, as an inspection because I think
                     that you had not then decided whether it should be annually
                     or bi-annually, but an inspection for the purpose of the
                     1976? A. Inspections I do not think are referred to.

                     They are not but for the purpose of seeing that all was
                     going well in respect of the Safety Certificate and there
                     was nothing obvious that needed to be done? A. Sir, an
                     inspection.

                     Who was taking the lead in the Working Party as you under­
                     stood it? A. That is a good question, Sir.  Leads were
                     coming from several different directions really.

                         LORD JUSTICE TAYLOR: Who chaired it, if anyone? A. Nobody
                     as such, Sir,  It was an inspection rather than a meeting
                     as I understood it.

                         MR. COLLINS: Who decided what should be inspected?
                     A. Effectively the group itself, Sir, it seemed to me.
                     There was also some input from the club representative as
                     to, if you like, an element of direction as to what should
                     be looked a t .

                               presumably,   or did they only meet on inspections?
                               A. No, Sir,   I have referred to three previous meetings.

                          Q.   Who took the Chair when it met? A. I suppose it could be
                                said that I did, to some extent.

                          Q.       MR. COLLINS: There is no point in having inspections
                               unless you form conclusions as a result of that inspection,
                               is there? A. That is correct.
                      B
                          Q.   There must presumably have been some meeting following the
                                inspection at which you all sat down together and decided
                                what, if anything, should be done. A. There was not, to my
                                recollection, no.

                          Q.   How did you decide what should be done, if anything needed
                               to be done? A. There were discussions on the site, particularly
                               in relation to barrier 144, which took place at the time.

                          Q.   Nothing more than that and no record anywhere of any
                               decisions that were made? A. No, Sir.  I think that I referred
                               to this in my statement and if I may refer to the paragraph.

                          0.   By all means.   It is 174 is the paragraph where you deal
                               with this specifically in relation to barrier 144.     I am
                      D        not sure if that is the paragraph you wanted referred to
                               or whether it was more general. A. Yes, it is that paragraph,
                               174, page 54.   I can recall on the inspection making written
                               notes of what was happening and I recall that clearly
                               because inrespect of barrier 144 I remember having to draw
                               a little plan for myself so I knew where it was and what
                               we were talking about.   Unfortuantely it transpires froni
                               the file that that has disappeared and I do not k n o w where,
                               it should certainly have been typed up and put on the file
                               but it was not.

                          Q.   Perhaps we can deal with this: the removal of barrier
                               144 was a very important matter. A. it was, Sir, yes.

                          Q.   Because it.affected, amongst other things,     the capacity
                               in that pen. A. It certainly affected that     pen, Sir, yes.

                          Q.   It might have affecteed the safety of the people in that
                               pen. A. It might have done, yes.

                          Q.   It was therefore a matter, of course, which had to
                               be notified to the City Council, and was notified to the
                               City Council as an alteration because it might affect
                               safety. A. It was an alteration that might affect safety,
                               yes, Sir.

                          Q.   We have heard from Dr. Eastwood that he had reservations
                               but he was persuaded by Inspector Calvert. A. Sir, I think
                               that is not quite right.  I think that Mr. Strange was actuall
                               present at the inspection and Mr. Strange heard Mr. Calvert's
                               submissions.

                               He had reservations, Mr. Strange had reservations as well
                               but was persuaded by Mr. Calvert, according to Dr. Eastwood's
                               evidence, as I understood it, that the removal of that
                               barrier was a better course. A. Yes.  I have to say,
                               Sir, that I have no detailed recollection of the discussion
                               itself.  My notes would have helped significantly in that,
                               there is no question about that.          .

                  B            You were, of course, no doubt, aware too of the provisions
                               of the Safety Certificate which effectively required the
                               ground lay-out to remain as it was at the time of the
                               Certificate. A. Which condition are you referring to?

                               I am referring  to 29 which required prior notice in
                               writing to be given to the County Council in accordance
                               with paragraph 5(2) of the schedule.   There certainly was
                               a record of an oral   request in relation tothis barrier
                               but I have not seen   any notice in writing. Is there any?
                               A. There is not to my knowledge.   I should explain that
                               condition may not be entirely applicable in the circumstances
                               as I believe it foresees an application being made by the
                               club to alter a barrier or whatever, whereas in this instance
                               there was an agreement on site prompted in the first instance
                               by the police.
                  D
                               That may be but you   see what might concern some is that an
                               important matter like this appears to have gone through
                               without any written record in the City Council's anywhere.
                               A. I accept that there was a written record, I can remember
                               writing it.  The problem is that it has now disappeared.

                                   LORD JUSTICE TAYLOR: That was your personal note?
                               A. That was my personal note, yes.

                          Q.       MR. COLLINS: No official notice.   A. There was no
                               notice served in paragraph 29.

                          Q    Do you remember the matter being discussed in the sense that
                               there were conflicting views about whether or not it was
                               the right thing to do? A. At this late stage I cannot
                               remember the details of the discussion.

                               Can you remember any discussion? A. All I can remember is
                               Inspector Calvert saying that the police would like it
                               removed.

                          Q    And that is all? A. Taht is all I can recall at this
                               stage, yes.

                          Q    Was there any discussion, apart from that, or is it simply
                               that you cannot remember whether or not there was? A. I am
                               reasonably sure there was discussion with all the officers
                               present, the building surveyors representative, the fire
                               service, the police, and, of course, the club representative
                               about the matter.

                             was Chairman.  What body are you talking about?   The Officer
                             Working Party? A. Effectively it was the Officer Working
                             Party .

                             There seem to be a number of things here of the Officer
                             Working Party.  Were you always present? A. At what dates,
                     B       Sir?

                             I have come across a couple.  There was one on the 29th.
                             You would not be in the July, 1985, one or before 1988?
                             A. Quite right, Sir.

                                 MR. COLLINS: Sir, I do not think we have any notes
                             of any meetings because I think that it is right that
                             you did not take any minutes of any of the inspection
                             meetings? A. Yes, Sir, I did take notes of them.

                             I said did not take any minutes.  There are not any
                             formal --- A. There are not any notes in the same form
                             as the County did them, Sir.

                     D       We do not have a record, do we, correct me if I am wrong,
                             of the dramatis personae attending at such inspections
                             after the City Council took over. A. I do not understand
                             the Latin , I am sorry.

                             I am sorry, the people who were there. A. Certainly not at
                             the 1986 Sheffield Wednesday inspection, however there are
                             records of the 1986 inspection at United.

                             I am concerned with Sheffield     Wednesday. -Are there any
                             records of who was present at    the 1987 inspection? A. That
                             was done under the new system,    effectively, whereby people
                             submitted comment subsequently    to it.

                         Q   But there was an inspection,   was there not? A. Yes,   that
                             is how the comments arose.

                         Q   All I am asking is are there any records, as far as you
                             can recall, of who was present at any of the inspections
                             in 1987 or 1988? A. That would be actually in the comments
                             that were submitted personally by officers from the
                             appropriate authorities.

                         Q   One can glean from seeing who wrote into you and wrote
                             the comments who was there? A. Yes.

                         Q   I am sorry to take a little time on this but what powers
                             did the Officer Working Party have? A. The Officer Working
                             Party operated from 1st April, 1986, effectively, as a

                              sort of advisory group.  It did not have any powers itself.
                              It derived powers if anywhere from the delegation to the
                              head of administration, legal department.

                              It appears that authorisation was given at the ground, in
                              the course of that inspection, to remove barrier 144.  Is
                              that right? A. In the 1986 inspection yes, that is quite
                              correct.
                     B
                              Who gave the authorisation to remove that barrier? A . T h e
                              matter was discussed with all the representatives of the
                              appropriate bodies and effectively I think the authorisation
                              would have come from me in those circumstances.

                              What power did you have, with respect, Mr. Bownes, to
                              authorise that barrier to be removed? A. I was acting on
                              behalf of the head of administration, legal department.

                              Had you had any specific delegation to you? A. That is not
                              the way I understand local govenment to work.  I think
                              delegation would go normally to the Chief Officer but in
                              practical terms it is exercised by the officer who is
                              involved with the particular dealing.
                     D        So you believed, did you, that you had power to act on
                              behalf of the City Council to authorise any change that was
                              requested to the ground? A. I believed, Sir, that I had the
                              authority, within the limits of the delegation given to the
                              head of administration, legal department.

                                  LORD JUSTICE TAYLOR: To make any alteration to the ground?
                              A. If that was within the delegation, Sir.

                         Q.   Was it? A. Yes,   Sir,   it was.

                         Q.   It is to make any alteration to the ground.  I thought that
                               the General Purposes Panel had delegated to them the
                               responsibility. A. Yes. Perhaps if we can refer to the report.

                         Q.   What I am wondering is if something of consequence was going
                               to be done to the ground did it not have to be referred to
                               that panel? A. Yes, in fact in relation to the Spion Kop
                               development where application was made ------

                         Q.   Just taking out   an odd barrier was all right? A. So far
                              as changing the   Certificate itself isconcerned in relation
                              to the capacity   at the Spion Kop then that would have to
                              to to the panel   as I understand it.

                         Q.   You wanted to refer me to something? A. Yes, Sir.

                         Q.       MR. COLLINS: Are you referring to the original delegation
                              which we saw at page 122 of your bundle, in March, 1986?
                              I know that is a recommendation but I assume, because we
                              have not got the resolution, that those recommendations

                                 MR. COLLINS:    122, sir, of the City Council bundle.
                                THE WITNESS:     I think we are perhaps looking at
                           different reports.
                      Q.         MR. COLLINS:    I am sorry, which one are you after?
                           A.    I am looking, at the May, 1986 report, sir, Recommendation
                           Ain   the Conclusion.
                      Q.       LORD JUSTICE TAYLOR:     You are looking at page 127,
                           are you?   A.   I am, sir, yes.
                      Q.        MR. COLLINS:    That is the administrative system
                           organised by the County Council and continue it in being.
                 D         A . Yes, sir.
                      Q. But that does not deal, does it, with the powers of the
                         Working Party to authorise any changes?   A.   I would
                         take the view there that it did, sir.
                      Q.    Since   you did not know what the Working Party's powers were
                           under    the old system and you could not find out what they
                           were,    that seems hardly satisfactory, does it?   A.   It
                           isn't    entirely satisfactory, no, sir, I agree with that.
                      Q.   It does look, with respect, Mr. Bownes, does it not, as
                           if you may have acted ultra vires?   A.That I would have
                           to take advice on, sir, I don't know.
                      Q. I am not blaming you specifically because the matter was
                         far from clear but it does look as if no-one had thought
                         through the need to decide who was to give instructions and
                         who was to authorise.   A.   It is a complex area, certainly,
                         sir.
                      Q. Was it appreciated how important the removal of this barrier
                         might be?   A.    Sir, I was relying there on the experts
                         who were present.
                      Q. I know you were but trying to think back to that meeting,
                         did this seem to be something which was really rather routine
                         or was it your impression, can you help, that there was a
                         possibly important safety impact behind it?   A.   That is
                         a difficult question, sir, going back that long, but a
                         discussion certainly did take place.   Had anybody expressed
                         reservations or requested me to do something, then I would
                  H      have done, sir.
                                                                                         37 :

You see, one thing that it affected and considerably
affected was the capacity of the pens.     A.I have heard
that suggested, sir, yes.
Well, it has not only been suggested; it is a fact if one
looks at the Green Guide. A.    Yes.   I think that is also
a difficult question, sir.
Had you read the Green Guide before you took over your
responsibilities?   A.   I had looked at the Green Guide
that was available at the time, sir, but the new one didn't
come out until November, 1986, which was after this time.
The 1976 Guide is not really materially any different in
relation to this aspect, the calculation of capacity.
A.   No, sir, I believe it isn't.
And you had obviously familiarised yourself with the
provisions of the Green Guide.   A.   In broad terms, sir,
yes, as far as I could understand them.   Obviously there
were technical aspects there.
You saj^it help, no doubt, from those who did understand them
if you had any doubts.     A.   Yes.
One thing that must have struck you when you went tc the
ground for the first time a n d l o o k e d at Leppings Lane end
for the first time was the existence of these- pens.
A.   I must admit, sir, not having been to a football ground
before or realising how the operation actually worked,
it didn't, sir, to be honest.
Did it not occur to you that it might not be a bad idea to
get yourself briefed on the significance of these pens?
A.   Sir, you might as well say that I should have got
myself briefed on all aspects of emergency planning, fire
safety and so on, if you get my drift, sir.
Well, Mr. Bownes, you were the person who was the delegate
of the City Council who were responsible for issuing the
Certificate and ultimately responsible for ensuring that
the spectators of Sheffield Wednesday Football Ground were
safe.   A.   Yes, sir, that is correct.
And that was a grave responsibility, was it not? A.       And
it still is, sir, yes.
We know and when you read the Certificate you would have seen
that the capacity on the terraces was global in the sense
that it did not take account of the pens.   A.   That is quite
right, sir, yes.
You apparently did not appreciate the significance of
that at the time.   A.   I did not, sir, no.
Did anyone at any time as far as you can recall before this
tragedy occurred indicate to you that there was any significanc
in the pens in relation to capacity?   A.    I believe it
                                       D. BQWNES

would be true to say no, sir.
Did anyone at any time indicate to you that it was important
that there should be some form of control to ensure that fans
spread evenly over the terrace rather than packing into the
central pens?   A.   No-one indicated that to me at any
stage, sir.
So you were wholly unaware of the need for any system of
monitoring to ensure that there was even distribution on
those terraces?   A.   Yes, sir, that is true.
Were you aware at all of the importance of ensuring that
there were suficient turnstiles to enable people to get
through in a reasonable time?    A.   Sir, I think I ought
to say at this stage that the Council cannot act independently
in exercising its role here.   It acts on the basis of advice
from specials - from Fire Service, Police, Building Surveyor.
It cannot subrogate the Club.   it cannot stand in its
shoes, effectively.
What it boils down to, or seems to boil down to, is this,
that the Council went on effectively in complete ignorance
as to the significance of any of the lay-out of the ground
at the Leppings Lane end.   A.   Sir, in so far as the
South Yorkshire County Council had recently ceased being
a certificating authority, it seemed reasonable to me to
take the view that the ground was reasonably safe at that stage
Did you ask your opposite number, your predecessor at South
Yorkshire whether there were any matters which you ought
to know about?   A.   I believe I did, sir, yes.
And he told you nothing?   A.   He didn't highlight any
points that needed looking at, sir.
When we get to the meeting of 7th August,    can I ask you to
look at page 341 of our bundle.    This is   the only note
that exists as far as we are aware of the    meeting of 7th
August, 1986.    I expect you have seen it   before, have you
not?   A.    I have had a brief look at it   before, sir, yes.
And this is the note that deals with the removal of the
barrier.   As I expect you would agree, unless you know
that it is dealing with that, it is not entirely clear
from the face of it that it is.   A.   No, sir.   It
looks.like some handwritten note that was done at the
time, sir.
It was made by Mr. Strange, I think, and there is also a
note of the various matters that require to be dealt with,
that needed to be repaired, as we can see from Nos. (3)
onwards.   Do you see that?   A.   Yes, sir.
Obviously matters which the Working Party had spotted that
needed to be done.   A*   It looks like that, sir, yes.
                                     D. BOWNES

Unless you have some written record or write some letter
to the Club, how on earth can you know or be sure that they
are going to do what they are supposed to do in relation
to repairs?   A.   Sir, I think I have already explained
that I did make a note at the time.   I fully intended to
deal with it but unfortunately it disappeared from the file.
One would have thought that you would write the sort of
letter that we see later on, namely referring to the meeting
and saying, "This, that and the other in the way of repairs
must be done".   A.   Yes, sir, that should have been done.
There is no argument about that as far as I am concerned.
Of course, that could stand effectively as the minutes,
could it not, in the sense that if you write a letter
immediately following to indicate what was agreed, that
will take the place to some extent of the minutes.
A.   Y e s , sir .
But you have got to have one or the other.       A.   Yes, sir.
I quite agree with you.
And sadly here you have got neither.    A.    Yes, very sadly,
sir. Yes.
Then we come on to the Kop because, of course, at this time
too, as you have indicated, the Kop had been roofed and
extended to some extent.   A.   Yes, sir.
Can 1 ask you to look at page 370 of our bundle, please,
mr. Bownes.   You here confirm the Panel agreed to increase
the capacity of the Kop to 21,000, subject to three
conditions; right?    A.    Yes, sir.
For some reason the Safety Certificate was never amended
and never has been amended.    A.  No, sir, there was a
defect in the procedure in relation to that in that no
public advertisement was made.
Exactly.   A.    I think I refer to that in full in the
statement.
You do and you seek to excuse it by saying it got a lot of
publicity anyway, have a look at the preceding page of our
bundle, page 369.   A.   Sir, I think the statement is
entirely clear; there is no attempt at excuse her.
I follow that.   A.    Sir,   you just said it was being   used
as an excuse.
Well, it is being used as an excuse, with respect, Mr. Bownes,
is it not?   You are saying that although the regulations
were not followed, in fact everyone knew because it was well
publicised.   A.   Sir, I have not used the word "excuse",
it was not put as an excuse. There is a clear admission
that there was a mistake made, an oversight in not putting
a press notice in.   The point of referring, I think, to
the various bits of publicity which accompanied the
                                       D. BOWNES

development of the Kop was to demonstrate really that had
any interested persons wished to object or to make any
comments at all, they would have been clearly put on
notice by all this publicity.
The Safety Certificate itself is a public document, is
it?   A.   I am not sure what a public document is, as
such.
What I mean is, if anyone had come to the City Council
and said, "Can I have a look at the Sheffield Wednesday
Safety Certificate?" you would have shown it to him?
A.   Yes, sir, there is no difficulty with that.
And anyone looking at it, if interested, would have seen
that the capacity of the Kop was whatever it was - 18,000-odd?
A.   Yes, sir, that is correct.
And he would not necessarily have appreciated that it had
been increased.   A.   Sir, I think an amendment to the
Certificate can be dealt with by means of a letter or other
document attached to it, as indeed Liverpool have done
in the latest certificate.
If it forms part of the Certificate, because any offence,
of course, if you have to prosecute, is for breach of a .
condition of the Certificate, is it not?   A.   Yes, sir.     •
     LORD JUSTICE TAYLOR:   You said just now you did not
know whether it was a public document but in your proof you
say this, do you not, at page 42: "The General Safety
Certificate is regarded as a public document and therefore
the spirit of the legislation has been met."    A. Yes,
sir, I failed to recall that.    As far as I am concerned,
it is a public document and anyone may have access to
it if they wish to see it.    Sir, as far as I am aware,
an amendment need not actually be written on the Certificate
as such, as long as it is properly recorded then I would
have thought proceedings for an offence could take place,
obviously you are better qualified to judge that than I
am, sir.
     MR. COLLINS:   Did you consider this at the time?
A.   Consider what, sir, exactly?
That there was no need to amend the Safety Certificate
because what you had done was satisfactory - was this a
matteT that you considered at the time or is this hindsight
j u s t ification? A. I believe I took the view that it
was unnecessary to recover the original Certificate document
and physically amend it in order to record the amendment
in that way.
     LORD JUSTICE   TAYLOR:   Was there an amendment in
effect annexed to   it and a letter saying, "Do the same
for yours"?   A.     Yes, effectively, sir, this letter
that we have just   referred to to Mr. Chester at page 370
of the bundle was   that amendment.                          QQ1

                           Q.        MR. COLLINS:   Although that was simply a private
                                letter to the Club.    A.   the Certificate Holder, sir,
                                yes, indeed.
                           Q. Certainly, and did not form part of the Certificate itself.
                              A.   The letter did not form part of the Certificate
                              itself, sir.   I take the view, and obviously there are
                   B          others better qualified than me to comment on it, that
                              the existence of that would effectively amend the Certificate

                        Q. Now, after the meeting in August, 1986. and the approval of
                            the extension of the Kop. what was the next matter that the
                           City Council did in relation to the safety certificate, the
                            review of the safety certificate?  Can you help us about that.
                            Mr. Bownes? - A. I am not sure to what you are referring.

                        0. You had indicate*in that minute we looked at in May 1966 you
                            w e r e intending to redraft the safety certificate, and you were
                u          going to seek comments from the interested parties, that is
                B          the Fire Service, the Police and the Building Surveyor? - A.
                            Yes, sir.

                        0. And you started that process, did you? - A. If I can refer to
                           some notes I have made, sir?

                        0. Yes, of course.   I just wanted to find out when that process
                            started.  It would seem to have been in the late autumn of
                            1986. but I will be corrected if I am wrong. - A. Perhaps it
                            might be useful for me to go through a chronology of this?

                        0. If you have got a chronology that would be very helpful.

                        0.        LORD JUSTICE TAYLOR:   We have not got it in this bundle,
                             have we? - A. I think it can be made available, sir.
                    D   Q.   We have not got it in the bundle? - a. It is not in this
                             bundle at the moment.

                        0.   Is there a copy?

                                  MR. MAXWELL:    There is. sir.      There is a copy I have
                             made available to Mr. Collins.

                                  MR. COLLINS:     This is the chronology we are talking
                             about?

                                  MR. MAXWELL:   Y e s . sir. and I think it is the schedule
                             of safety conditions at the end. its chronology set out with
                             letters.  I have not got 20 copies but I can get them.

                                  THE WITNESS:   I believe it is the last two pages of the
                             document you have, sir.

                        G.        MR. COLLINS:   Yes.  You had asked other Councils for
                             copies of their safety certificates and their conditions, and
                             you had done that in April and May 1986? - A. That is correct.

                        0. And in June 1986 you sent a memorandum....

                                  LORD JUSTICE TAYLOR:   If this is tabulated in some form
                             I would very much like to have it rather than have to write it
                             all down again.

                                   MR. MAXWELL: Y e s . I am sending someone off now to do
                             it.

                             safety certificate conditions.

                                    MR. MAXWELL:   I hesitate to interrupt, but in the mean
                               time could I offer you mine,, marked somewhat as it is. but it
                               may assist y o u .

                                    LORD JUSTICE TAYLOR:      I will be patient.

                          0.        mr. COLLINS:   6th May 1986, meeting.of General Purposes
                               Panel, the resolution we have seen.  That is in our bundle.
                               313.  29th May your Chief Executive writes to his opposite
                               numbers in Birmingham. Manchester and Leeds asking for their
                               safety certificates? - A. Yes, sir.

                          0. 5th June memo to building surveyor, and letters containing the
                             same comments to the Chief Constable and Chief Fire Officer,
                  D          informing them that the certificate conditions were snortly to
                             be redrafted when they would be asked for comments.  Tnat was
                             putting them on notice they were going to be asked for
                             comments but not actually asking them? - A. That is right.

                          0. You get a reply from Birmingham on 10th June.  You      write to
                             your opposite numbers in Barnsley and Doncaster on      <+th July
                             inviting consultation, because they had taken over      some of the
                             old South Yorkshire grounds in their jurisdiction?      - A. Yes,
                             and Rotherham Council as well.

                          G. And Rotherham.  29th August you get some response from the
                             Home Office? - A. Yes, sir.  I d o n ’t think that should be in
                             there.  It is not really relevant.

                          G. We will forget about that.       - A. The next entry is 2*tn
                             September.

                          0. You get a copy from Manchester.  I can see you were doing
                             that, but you did not start the process of asking for the
                             specific comments of the Fire Service, the Building Department
                             and the Police, it would seem until November 1986 or
                             thereabouts, because if you look at our page 374.... - A. I
                             think 1 can speed this up a bit.  The drafting of the safety
                             certificate conditions actually took place during the 6 months
                             January-June 1987.

                          G.   Yes, I follow that.  All I am asking you about at the moment
                               is when you requested the input to help you with the drafting
                               from the Fire, Police and Building Department? - A. That was
                               on 7th July, 1987.
                      H   0. 7th July?       No, you told them you were going to ask them on 7th

                           July? - A.   I think you have mistaken 1986 and 1987.

                      0. You say you did not ask them until July 1987? - A. Yes.

                      G.        LORD JUSTICE TAYLOR:      About a year later? - a . Yes.

                      Q.         MR. COLLINS;  I think you are doing yourseif an
                           injustice there, Mr. Bownes, because unless I have misread the
                  B        purpose of the letter at page 374 you had asked in November
                           1986,

                                MR. MAXWELL:   I hesitate to say the purpose has been
                           misunderstood, but I think it has, because it is a response to
                           another letter asking whether the Fire Service has any
                           comments about the ground rather than in the context of safety
                           certificate conditions.

                                MR. COLLINS:    I follow. I got myself into the same mess
                           before as I remember, in relation to the Fire documents:

                      0.   It was not until July 1987 that you asked for the input that
                           had been referred to in the meeting of May 1986.  Is that
                           right? - A. Yes. sir.

                  D   G.   It seems to have taken, with respect, an awful Ion? time to
                           get round to asking for their comments? - A. Yes, sir.   The
                           problem essentially was that the exercise which I originally
                           anticipated would be relatively straightforward was not.   By
                           looking at the other Council certificates I noticed very much
                           in the way that Mr. Justice Popplewell noticed that matters
                           differed considerably between authorities.  It took me a great
                           deal of time to wrestle with that and to try and get it down
                           and take the best bits of each certificate and put them
                           together.

                      Q. That was the problem,     was it? - A.   It was a very great
                         problem, yes, sir.

                      Q. Having requested that you, I think, had a draft report for a
                         meeting in September 1987 which appears on our page 417?   Is
                         that correct, or your page 128, whichever you prefer. - A.
                         Yes, a report to the General Purposes Panel in September 1987.

                      G.   What you      say there, I think so far as relevant is that you
                           refer back under the heading, "Current situation" to the
                           p a n e l ’s meeting in May 1986, and identified several main areas
                           for further investigation? - A. Yes. sir.

                      0. Then you deal with the review of the administrative system and
                         say it is going to be changed.  In the meantime presumably
                         there had been an inspection meeting in August 1987. or the
                         summer of 1987, or not? - A. yes, there had been one in 198/.

                      0.   That was   under the old system again, was it? - A. No, sir,
                           that was under the new system slightly anticipating this
                           report, where individual officers were asked to submit
                  H        comments in writing, which indeed happened.

                         0. That we can see,    for example,   at - no we can't.   - A. It is in
                            my bundle.

                         0.   I am not particularly concerned with that because no doubt it
                              was sensible to anticipate what was clearly a sensible
                              reorganisation.- I d o n ’t doubt that at all.  Can I get
                              absolutely clear what was the new system as you understood it
                     B        that was going to operate? - A.     The inspection system or the
                              administrative system, sir?

                         0. First of all the inspection system? - A. Yes, sir.  My
                            impression was that the best way of operating an inspection
                            system like this was to persuade officers to submit the
                            comment subsequently in writing and then those comments would
                            be submitted to the club, which would make it reasonably clear
                            what exactly was being raised and who was raising it in order
                            that the matter could be dealt with more efficiently than I
                            thought had been done in the past.  So it occurred to me that
                            some of the working party minutes did not make it clear who
                            was saying what in relation to matters.

                         0.   I follow that,   but you would have an annual inspection? - A.
                              Yes .
                     D
                         G. That would take how long, was it anticipated?  One day, two
                            days? - A. In terms of officer time or in terms of time on the
                            ground?

                         Q.   In terms of time actually on the ground? - A. That would take
                              perhaps a full day, I would have thought.

                         G. Who would decide which parts were to be inspected? - A. That
                            would be for the individual officers to form their own views.
                            They would go to the areas they were most concerned with.

                         0. Was there a chairman of that group? - A. No. sir, it can't
                            work like that effectively.  This is a very similar system to
                            that used for public entertainment inspections in those sort
                            of premises, where officers simply go to the areas they are
                            particularly interested in in order to obtain their comments
                            or make c o m m e n t s .

                         G.   Did you attend? - A. Yes,     I did.

                         G.   What parts did you look at? - A. I c a n ’t recall offhand,   sir.

                              What, did you consider to be the area with which you were
                              concerned when you went on these inspections? - A. Any area
                              which somebody pointed out to me was a matter tor concern, fo:
                              example, sir.

                         0.   Such as? - A. I c a n ’t actually recall what happened on the
                              inspection, sir.

                         0.   Did you have any knowledge of what you were going to look for
                     H        - A. No, sir.  As far as I am concerned I am not an expert.
                                                                                            386

I follow that.  - A. I rely on the advice of experts, and they
have frequently given advice on various matters relating to
safety.  My job as I saw it was to ensure that the inspectors
could go where they wanted to, were not obstructea in any way
- there was no suggestion they were ever obstructed - ana to
ensure they had all the information they needed to carry out
their job.

Did you have an advance meeting before you went on this
inspection to discuss among yourselves what you should look
for an so on? - A. Not as I recall in those terms.  All the
services involved are very familiar with doing inspections in
this way.                                 -

Did you have a meeting afterwards to decide what eacn of you
required to be done or was it simply left to the individual to
write a letter to you? - A. Individuals wrote a letter, sir.

To you? - A. To me.

And you would send on to the club?  You would write to the
club incorporating such of the points as you thought the club
ought to know about? - A. No, sir.  what happened on this
occasion is that the newly set up advisory group, which is
referred to in this report in September 1987, considered the
various comments made by the Building Surveyor and the
Environmental Healtn Department, and from their input I was
able to extract a list of comments to send to the club.

The advisory group was going to consist of who? - A. The Fire
Service, the Police, the Building Surveyor, the Health &
Consumer Services and ourselves, sir.

    LORD JUSTICE TAYLOR:   You have got a working party which
consists of these.  They conduct an inspection? - A. Yes.

With you there.  They then write to you with their comments on
the inspection for consideration by an advisory group? - a .
Yes.

Which is the same outfit? - A.     Yes, sir, effectively.

Then I d o n ’t understand. It is probably my fault, but I d o n ’t
understand the difference between the working party and the
advisory group at the moment. -   A. There is none effectively.
It is simply a change of name.

Why do you call it something different?      - A. Because that   more
accurately reflected what it did, sir.

    MR. COLLINS:   Are there two different bodies? One goes
and does the inspection and then reports back to another
group? - A. No, sir.

It is the same group? - A. It is the same     individuals. The
individuals do not inspect as a group.

                         0.   They inspect individually? - A. Yes.

                         0.       LORD JUSTICE TAYLOR:   What we have got then is a change
                              of nomenclature.  What was the officer working party is now
                              going to be the advisory group? - A. Yes, sir.

                         0.   And the officer working party can    be buried.    Is that it? - A.
                 B            Yes.

                         0. As a name? - A. Yes, sir.

                         G.       MR. COLLINS:   I am sorry, but this meeting you attend at
                              the ground, is that all the advisory group going along on the
                              same day? - A. It is not a meeting as such.  It is an
                              inspection.

                         G.   I am sorry.  This inspection of the ground, is this ail tne
                              advisory group going along on the same day? - A. Yes. it is
                              representatives from all the authorities going there and
                              inspecting.

                         0.   And then you have a meeting after that to decide what should
                              be done? - A. When the comments are in, if it is appropriate
                 D            to do so.

                         G. Each after that-inspection writes you a letter indicating what
                            he has seen that he considers ought to be put to the club? -
                            A. Yes, sir.

                         G.   You receive all those letters?   - A. Yes.

                         G . You then put them together and decide what should go to the
                             club.   Is that right? - A. No, as I have just explained....

                         0. You have another meeting of the advisory group? - A. No, a
                            meeting, not another meeting.

                         G.       LORD JUSTICE TAYLOR:    You have an inspection.  Now you
                              are having a meeting.  The same personnel? - A. Sometimes the
                              same personnel, sir.   It depends who is available at the time.

                         G. That meeting is not on site.       That is round a table somewhere?
                            - A. yes, sir.

                         G. And if something like removal of a barrier is proposed at a
                            meeting of that kind you consider it is down to you to decide
                            whether it happens or it does not? - A. No, sir, that is not
                            right at all.

                         G. Well, I have misunderstood what you said before about
                            delegation. - A. When the comments are collated and brought
                            together then-they are submitted to the club acting under the
                            appropriate delegated power, sir, after they have been
                            discussed if necessary.
                     H        They are submitted to the club,    you say? - A.   Yes. sir.

                                                                                             388

                        Q. And then? - A. And then the club takes action and the
                           individual members check the work has been done.

                        Q. Forgive me, but can I just get this clear in my mind.  At what
                           point is the city's approval given and by whom? - A. At the
                           point the letter goes out to the club with the consolidated
                           comments, s ir.
                    B
                        0. But between the meeting of the advisory group and your sending
                           that letter out, has anyone other than you from the city
                           considered it? - A. No. sir. effectively not.

                        G. So it is your decision as far as the citv is concerned as to
                           whether it goes to the club with approval? - A. Yes. sir.
                           effectively, after- all the comments have been fully discussed
                           by the people who are making them.

                               LORD JUSTICE TAi'LOR:        I think we will break off at that
                           point.  2 o ’clock.

                                      TUESDAY, 27th JUNE. 1989

                          MR. -MAXWELL:  Sir, I hope you have received now
                     thememoranda from Hr. Bownes in the form of, I think
                B    it is, five sheets.
                          LORD JUSTICETAYLOR:        I think it is coning upnow.
                          MR. MAXW ELL:     Sir, can I just explain what it is that
                     you are receiving?
                          LORD JUSTICE TAYLOR:         Yes.Thank you.

                          M R. MAXWELL:   Three of the sheets areheaded by a page
                     marked delay and the other two are headed safety certificate
                     conditions schedule.
                          MR. COLLINS:   Those behind me have only received
                     three sheets.  I do not know whether that is general or
                     whether we are being discriminated against.

                          R.. MAXI-JELL.    The.re should.be a total, of five..
                          MR. COLLINS:    Being discrininated against. I have
                     sot five but I just wondered whether anyone else had
                     three sheets only. I an told the five nay have been
                     divided into three and 2 but I an not sure.
                          MR. MAXW ELL:  Sound engineering principle.         Sir,
                     do you have the five sheets?
                          LORD JUSTICE TAYLOR:    I have got three and two
                     which takes one bad: a very long time.
                               M R. M   AXWELL:   Sir, yes. What they consist of,
                     on the sheet marked delay, is a commentary on the
                     matter of delay and that is attached to a chronology
                     of what are called and explained in the body of the
                     first sheet exceptional events arising in Mr. Bownes1
                     workload and running parallel with that chronology
                     is a chronology set out under the heading safety
                     certificate condition schedule and the chronology
                     is divided up into si:: month blocks each and it is
                     hoped one can look across from the blocks in the
                     c h r o n o l o g y of exceptional events to the corresponding
                     b l o c k i r . t h e safety certificate conditions schedule.

                                                   Examined   dv   HR. COLLINS (Coat'd)

                                  Q    Y e s , Mr. Bownes, perhaps the convenient thing to do wcul:
                                       be to incorporate this into your statement, would it, as
                                       r e a l l y part and parcel of it? - A. Yes, si'r.
                         B        Q. Mr. Bownes, we were dealing iust before lunch with the
                                     change of the working party to the advisory group,
                                     advisory - I have forgotten the name now. - A. Group, s

                                  Q.   Group.    I 'was rigr.t, y e s . And you e:-::>lained about that
                                       Nov;, you were tnen going on to explain about the future
                                       adminis tration    That, I think, appears, does it not.
                                       at page 413 of our bundle and 129 of yours or does that
                                       deal with both, both the change of status of the advisory
                                       grout) and the future administration? - A. Yes, sir, it
                                       deals with both.
                                  Q.We have dealt with the advisory group. Can we go on to
                                     the future administration and can you tell us of the
                                     salient details of your understanding of the system
                          D          after this was agreed? - A. Yes, sir. Basically it was
                                     similar to the old system in that there were some
                                     guidelines issued to the various officers.indicating
                                     the areas in which- they would have a particular
                                     responsibility, if you like. I think that is dealt
                                     wit'n in full detail in the report.
                                       The areas of responsibilities are those set out at
                                       the bottom of the first page or, rather, the .... • A.
                                       That is correct, sir, and over the page on 3.

                                  Q.   Vt es what- I still want to know is the question of the
                                       decision making and that you set out on page 419. You
                                       say there is also, under delegations, also a further
                                       question to be dealt with at this stage and that relates
                                       to the day to day decisiso.n making required for the
                                       running of the certification system? - A. Yes, sir.

                                  Q.   "At the moment decision caking powers rest with the panel
                                       but this is a highly impractical arrangement which needs
                                       to be reviewed urgently." Can I iust pause there?
                                       That sentence suggests that you did not in fact have
                                       a n v decision making powers before this proposal was
                                       put into effect? - A. I do not think thatis right, sir
                                       The previous report that I mentioned earlier on deal■i *■
                                         ith the continuation really of the working party sys tem
                                       ass it was effectively and I believe that gave del egated
                                       powers to deal with it.
                                  Q.        LORD JUSTICE TAYLOR:   Which report was that? -
                                       It was the Hay, 1936 report, sir.

                                 0. Is that correct,'Mr. Bown.es? - A. That is correct, yes.
                         B       0. You went into that but ail I am noting is that sentence
                                    on page 41$-which reads, "At the .moment decision asking
                                    powers rest with the panel but this is a highly im­
                                    practical arrangement which needs to be reviewed urgently,
                                    "if that sentence is taken at face value and if the
                                    reader believed what he was reading it would indicate
                                    that vou had no powers to make decisions at that stage
                                    because the powers had only been delegated to the panel?
                                    - A. No. sir, I think that is really referring to the new
                                    administrative system in that sense.

                                 0.        LORD JUSTICE TAYLOR:    Would you look at page 122
                                      in vour bundle? - A. I have it, sir.

                                      before the Council actually became the certificating
                                      authority.

                       A        quite clearly at the moment, i.e., as of now before these
                                provisions are put into effect, decision making powers
                                rest with the panel but that is highly impractical? - A.
                                Yes, sir, I think-that uas a reference to the, if you
                                like, decisions that involve the change of capacity.

                       B   Q.    It does not say that and, indeed, it is wholly consistent
                                ■with the history, as Lord Justice Taylor has pointed out to
                                 you, that you should have believed that at that time, i.e..
                                 September, 19S7, decision making powers in general rested
                                 with the panel? -A. I do not share that interpretation.

                                well, with respect then, you do not write wha_ vou mean
                                dc you? - A. 1 think it is important to appreciate tha
                                I kr.ew perhaps what I was talking about at the time but
                                perhaps did not translate it entirely accurately into
                                words.

                                a g a i n out . do not see how a rather bland and vague
                                expression in (a) on your page 127 can be said to change
                       D        what can be read at page 122. How does it change it? - A
                                VJell. sir. it authorises the continuation for the time

                                '•'el 1, what was the County Council's system, that an
                                officer in your position should have the decision
                                making power? Where do you get that from? - A. Effectively
                                 the working party operate in the way it did.
                                     HR. COLLINSr You told us earlier you did not know
                                how it worked. That was half the trouble? - A. Yes, it
                                was half the trouble, sir, yes.

                           Q.   If you did not know-how it worked how could you know
                                that it worked to give you delegated powers? - A. I
                                took the view that the County Council in writing to clubs
                                or whatever making comments had the power then, if you
                                like, to make the decisions. Effectively the working
                                party could be said to have made recommendations which
                                were then firmed up in the form of letters to the clubs
                                or whatever.

           A         savs meeting held at Division Street conference rooms.

                Q. Where is that? Is that the Fire Service? - A. It would
                   have been at the time, sir, I think, yes.

                0. And it records your presence and various other of the
                   Citv Council and a number of Fire Service.- Right? - A.
                    :es s l r .
            B
                Q. \ou remember this meeting, do you, Mr. Bownes? - A. Yes.
                   sir,         so.

                     About half-way down, discussion on areas of responsibility
                     and ground inspections, which presumably is relevant to
                     ',;hat developed into the memorandum that we have beer.
                      Icckina at in September? - A. Yes, sir. W   hat followed
                     after this meeting vas in fact an exchange of corres­
                     pondence about this situation.

                Q.   It says, ."On areas of responsibilities M   r. Bownes did net
                     want to be tied down to individual references and even
                     indicated that his department could not act independently
                     but must refer all matters to the Council Committee
                     responsible for the Safety at Sports Grounds Act."
            D        'To*.;', it looks as if you were then saying that you yourself
                     could net make decisions,■ you had to refer everything
                     back, does not it? - A. Sir, I think the discussion
                     real!” was there about the future administration of
                      the svsiem rather than the present one and it was an
                     attempt to discuss what role the General Purposes Panel
                     should have and what role officers should have.

                Q    Well, for the future you did not want to have to refer
                     everything back. W  hat that appears to be relating to
                     is the present, i.e., you cannot now act independently,
                     you have got to refer everything back? - A. 1 would say
                     not, sir.  I think that is referring to broad discussion
                     about the future.
                Q. I see. It goes on, "Whilst all others present would
                   orefer definitive areas of responsibility, allowing
                   there must be some overlap, Mr. Bownes preferred to
                   refer, back to the future meeting following further
                   consideration of the matter." That is to say that you
                   were not then accepting definitive areas of responsibility.
                   You thought further discussion was needed? - A. Certainly
                   further thought, sir. That, indeed, did take place.
                0. You then refer or it is recorded you referred to the recent
                   Lords decision on ground inspections. Did that refer to
                   the Bill that was then presumably going through which
                   became the 27 Act? - A. To be perfectly honest, sir.^I
                   dc not know. I dc not know v/hat that refers to at all.

                     You cannot help on that? - A. ?!o

    Q.   This would mean a much more thorough examination than
         the present system of bi-annual inspections. Did you
         •believe that, that your future system would be more
          thorough, annual inspections? - A. I must admit the
         wording is a little difficult.   I do not really know
         what it is getting at there.
    Q. Well’, the difficulty is you did not apparently take a
B
       r e c o r d of this meeting? - A. Sir, what happened following
       this was that detailed letters were sent to individual
       authorities dealing with the future administrative syste:

    c    But. vou see, tms is tr.e oniy recorc we r.ave ana sir.ce i:
         rersrs : vour thoughts I t n o u g n t in fairness to you I ou:
         tc ask you to deal „     the matters ir. case any false
c        impression nav have been given?-         Yes. I think the
         matters were deait witr. rullv in correspondence sub-
         secuentlv.

         . see    Did vou think it v/ould mean a more tr.orougn
         examination than the present system because that was
         r.ot said ir. terms, I think, in the correspondence? ~
         I do not know, sir. to be quite honest. I think in
D        principle an annual inspection is preferable to a bi-
         annual msoecticn m that it    if can hp -
                                              be *n

         not ds as ce'
                       fail to follow that, Mr. Bcwnes. It depends
         how detailed you. choose to make the inspection, whether
         it be bi-annual or annual, does not it? - A. Yes, sir.
         I think an annual inspection tends to focus minds a
         little better than a bi-annual one does and an annual
         inspection is a common occurrence in ail other licensing
         a r e a s rather than bi-annual.

Mr. Bownes. may I asK you this generally.            This was. cf
course, thrust: upon you as a resuit of the abolition cf tr.e
Me t r o p o l i t a n Council? - A. The function was transferred to tr.e
Council, yes. sir.

Y o u , the Council,    and I am not referring to you personally at
the m o m e n t ....

     MR. TOULSON:     I have the page your Lorasnip wanted.    !
think you have in mind the letter at page 6 6 .   169 in tr.e core
tunaie and "the. sentence at the top of page i/0.

      LORD JUSTICE TAYLOR:              Thank vcu.       That is what 1 was
looKir.g for.

        MR. COLLINS:          M r . B o w n e s . you the city,   naa nc expertise

w a s tnrust upon vou?- A. That is wrong, in fact. Tr.e
Building Surveyor of the Council had been involved in tr.e
safety of sports grounds since its inception in iv79 as far                         as
Sheffield Wednesday went.

what did that extend to. the Building Su rve yor ’s
responsibility? - A. I think you have seen,tne schedule cf
responsibilities that was put forward in the ouncle scmewr.ere.

Let ~e put it tnis way.  Your Department r.ac r.ad r.z overai-
concern for safety? - A. It nao none at all. sir.

And effectively you and your Department hac tc learn ail aocut
it ? - a . Y e s . s i r .                     .

You were already considerably stretched.   You had a great ceai
to do in licensing other matters? - A. It is certainly a ousy
Department, sir, but there was,- at least I perceived at tne
time, room to accommodate this function.

Without the need for any extra staff or any extra assistance?
- a . That was my feeling, yes.

And vcu depended really upon the advice of others, namely, tne
Fire, the Police and your own Building Department, together
with some input from the Consumer Heaith side? - a . Yes. sir.
A licensing authority generally speaking does not have
expertise itself within its own organisation to deal wit.-, ail
matters.  For example, public entertainments licensing, it
relies on advice from others, the professionals, tne Fire
Service.

Did it occur to you at any stage tnat it might oe iesirac_e ::
instruct someone ii>;e Dr. Eastwood, that is to sav an
incependent engineer, to nave a iooK and advise tr.e ;.:un:i.
specifically on tne safety of sports grounds? - a . Z tnir..-; it
is risnt to say tne council has its own e ngineers.

All  right.  Did you put your own engineers on to tr.e problem?

                            o r anyone    to go and take an independent appraisal of tne
                            sports grounds which you were then being put in charge e:? -
                            a. It c o u l d not really be an independent appraisal if it'was
                            acne by in-house surveyors, sir. who had probably been
                            involved before.
                   B
                       0. All right.     Did it occur to      you to put a n y o n e . ...

                       0..LORD JUSTICE TAYLOR:           It would be independent c f 'the
                           clue, whose financial interest was to manage it? - a . Yes. cut
                           tne same engineers who had been doing it were independent' of
                           the club, the Council's _own e n g i n e e r s , and tnev haa been cci.ig

                       0.         MR. COLLINS:             So     you took  the view that  if there was
                            anything which neeaea to be dealt with it should have been
                            spotted by t h e ' C o u n c i l ’s engineers in any event'who haa been
                            dealing -with it since 1979? - a . If it was a matter within
                            their particular sKill, yes, sir.

                       0.   But did it not occur to you that it might be desirable to nave
                   D        someone take an inaependent look, and by independent. I mean
                            independent., of t-hos.e.who had been dealing wiTriv it hithert-c? •-
                            a . No. sir. it aid hot.

                                  die not occur tc you that that might be aesiraoier - A.
                            thought'had not occurred to me, sir. to be perfectly hones-
                            w i t h vou.

                            May I finally go to the point I hope I anticipate may have
                            been in my Lera's mind when referring to the letter of Dr.
                            Eastwood at page. 169-170 of our bundle.  The reason I have noi
                            ■referred to it is it was before you time, but nonetheless it
                            would have been on tne files and you would have read it.   You'
                            would have been able to read it had you wished? - a . fes.
                            I think that- is a fair comment.

                            How much did you actually read these old files? - a . I was
                            hanaed some S files altogether, relating to Sheffield Unit ed
                            and Sheffield Wednesday.  I think we have to remember it i
                            not only Sheffield Wednesday we are dealing witn nere.   wn at
                            aid was try to get a flavour from those in as much detail e£
                            reasonably could in the time allowed.

                            I think one could make the point if you had read the se :ii
                            and come across, for example, this letter, you wouid have

                            taking over the licensing function I think the City Council

        have picked up on reading that what it actually meant, to be

             LORD JUSTICE TAYLOR:         I am not blaming you for not
        knowing about sports g r o u n d s , but it does seem a very
        unsatisfactory situation, does not it. that- responsibility for
        licensing a sports ground is given to a local authority whose
        officer in charge of it really knows nothing about the suoject
        at ail? - a. No. sir.    If you like in respect of other
        licensing matters I d o n ’t know in detail wnat the professional
        aspects of them are.   My job is to administer and co-orcinats
        really, essentially, and to enable the appropriate,
        professionals to have their input at the appropriate stage.

        Somebccy has to make the decision? - A. Yes.    based on advice.

            thought vou were delegated that power? - a . Yes. the
        decision is made based on the advice of the appropriate
        specialist, sir.

q   .        m r . COLLINS: If you don't know what to ask them to iook
        for you are not necessarily going to get the right advice, are
        you? - a. With this ietter I imagine it would have been
        circulated to all the interested parties, and i am sure if
        they felt it necessary they would have- maae-.a comment., .

        to m i n k all was weii. and tnerefore there was not anv need
        for anyone to worry, so far as the city was concerned? - A.
        No. sir. that is not right.    In relation to - I think what vou
        are saying effectively is that the Council did not take any
        action at all when it got the safety certificate function.

C.      It left it to the.working party and to the advisory group, die
        not it? - A. To some extent it should leave matters whicn deal'
        with professional judgment to the professionals and to octain
        advice on it.  The Council .did not, however - there are
        examples on the file in relation to another sports ground in
        the city, where things were not all right and which were dealt
        with very promptly, sir.

C. Because you were told that by the relevant advisory group or
   working party professionals? - A. The appropriate
   professionals at the time, sir, yes.

Q.      There was no independent appraisal by the Council as such.   It
        simply assumed, rightly or wrongly, the working party had got
        it right hitherto, and there was no cause for concern? - A.
        That tne County Council had got it right, yes.  I .tninx it had
        to assume t h a t .

0. A lt h o u g h it was apparent or obviously abie to be mace apparent
   from a'cursory examination of the file that certain things nac
   not been properly done in updating the safety certificate in
   r e r t - fn respects? - a. I d o n ’t think that would have come
                                                                   409

from a cursory examination cf the file. sir.

And you knew you did not do it right in relation to the
increase in the Kop? - A. I-certainly know now. sir.

You cid not appreciate then? - A. I did not appreciate that,
sir.

Very well.   Mr.    Bownes.   that is all I would wish to ask.

                   Cross-Examined by MR. H YT NER :

1 wouid like to see now far you regarded the Council's duties
in tnese matters. Mr. Bownes.  If in January 1939. at a tine
wnen Sheffield United did not have a safety certificate you
had known they had been invited by the Football Association to
consider having a Semi-Final piayea at their ground, would vcu
r.ave taKsn any action? Would it have concerned you? - a. 1
would imagine what would have happened in tnose circumstances
is that the Police, who are closely involved in these matters,
would have raised tne issue then and appropriate action would
no doubt have followed.

Would tne Police have known that Sheffield United did not have
a certificate? - A. Yes. they know perfectly well. sir. 1
“nx n   .

Say for example, not being we understand a great devotee of
football-, you had not watched the fixture list and you had
teen on ieave in April, you would have depended on the Police
to have stopped a Semi-Final being played at Bramali i_ane in
April? - A. Sir. I cannot conceive of a Semi-Final being
played at Bramall Lane without there being a great deal of
publicity and involvement of the advisory group, sir.

Would it surprise you in fact that the FA haa asked Sheffield
United to consider having a Semi-Final at Bramall Lane in
April 1969? - A. I have no views on it, sir.

None at all? - a . None at        all, sir.

Can I now go back to your take over.   We are all, I hope,
suitably conscious of the fact that this is originally the
responsibility of another authority, and the matter had
been in their hands for very many years until you took
over, but you did, of course, appreciate that you were
taking on a responsibility? - A. Yes, sir.

You understood, did not you. that whereas there was an
advisory guide from the Government, there was no compulsion on
a club to follow the advice given in the Green Guide? - a . Or
on tr.e authority, sir. that is quite right..

Or on the authority.          This was advice only.    Is that rignt? -
a . Yes, sir.

But you knew that once there was a condition in a certificate
                                  95


                                                         D. BOWNES


     there were very considerable sanctions against a club flouting
     the condition? - A. Yes, sir, if a club had breached a
     condition then there were criminal penalties.

S. When ycu read the Greer. Guide did not it become obvious that
   some cf the recommendations were somewhat more strict tnan
   others?   In other words, some were no open -to interpretation
   throug h common,sense and professional judgment.   They were
   plain, strong advice, whilst others might have been open to
   "interpretation? - A. Perhaps you can give me an e x a m p l e s i r .

0. Yes. I will come to the one I am going to give you.
   Stewaraing:  have you got a copy of the Green-Guide?               Chapter
   13 paragraph 195. just aoove that on page 56:

           "Effective stewarding should prevent overcrowding ire­
           sections of the ground, reduce the likelihooo and
           incidence of disorder, help to disperse spectators in
           such a wav as to reduce crowd pressure and provide tne ■
           means to investigate, report and ta«e early action ir. an
           emergency".

     Now, there can't oe any question of professional judgment cr
     common sense overriding the need to prevent overcrowding in
     any section of the crowd?         Would you agree? - a . Yes.    The
     '.-judgment; comes iiv irr how many stewards you provide/     ”•

q   . Certair.lv.   That is interpretation,     application,   common sense.
      - a . :es . sir.

           LORD JUSTICE TAYLOR:        And what you cail overcrcwcing.

           M R . HYTNER:   Yes:

0.     5ut the need to take some action is clearly imperative,           is net
      it? - a . In what sense?  I am afraid I have lost you.

c. The Green Guide makes it clear that there must be some action
   taken by stewards to do those things? - a . Yes. sir. inoeea.

0.     When you read the Green Guide and then you read the conditions
      in the 1979 certificate, did not you find it rather odd that
      the duties of the stewards did not appear to include these
      things at all? - a. as I recall from the certificate they
      include control and direction of spectators.

G.    In and out of the ground.        Would you like to look?       It is in
      your Dundle at page 122.

                                      Did you think that that was clearly laying a duty on the club
                         B            to direct stewards to assist in preventing overcrowding in the
                                      sections? - A. I would have said the word "using" implied
                                            sir.

                                      I d o n ’t suppose you can say what was clear to the club, it
                                      was your view, was it. reading that certificate,, that it would
                                      nave oeen a breach of the conditions of the certificate for
                                      tne club not to nave stewards directing the dispersal cf
                                      crowds in the particular sections to prevent overcrowding? -
                                      a . I think that is a question of cases, if I might say so.
                                      You would have to look at a particular example to decide that.

                                      wonder whether it is helpful to get this witness's view of the

                                      that by 1989 you were not aware of the importance of tne

                                  Q. You now know that the layout of the turnstiles meant that
                                     the areas   of 7,200 and 2,900 were just lumped together?

                                     would be a matter for you? - A. Yes, sir.

                          D       o    What action did you take? - A. None, sir.
                                  n.   Why not? - A. If there had been a breach cf- -the safety
                                       certificate I would have expected to have been advised
                                       aboutit.
                                        Do you mean the club would ring up and say by the way.
                                       .we intend to breach the safety certificate. W   hat are
                                        you going to do about it? - A. Not at all, sir.
                                  n    What do you mean? - A. I would have expected advice either
                                       from the Police or, indeed, from the club to say that -we
                                       have this problem, can we deal with it, please, which is
                                       the view the club has taken in the past.

                                  0. You are saying you are surprised to find the club did not
                                     ring up to say we are going to breach the requirements
                                     of our safety certificate on two . . .. - A. i!o, sir. I
                                     think what you have done there is twisted my words, if I
                                     may say so.
                                  Q. Forgive me. I apologise. Are you really saying you
                                     e::pect the club to ring? - A. The club may have felt
                                     it an appropriate thing to do, sir, if they thought
                                     there was a difficulty, with the safety certificate.

                                  O.Did ycu check whether or not they were complying with the
                                     safety certificate? - A. In respect of this capacity, sir?

                                  0. This Inquiry is about overcrowding. - A. Yes, sir.

                                  0. The ability     to check pens.   I am eliminating all the things

you did not know about. I am merely restricting myself
to things you did know about, 7,200 and 2,900. W  hat did
you do about the attempts of the club to circumvent the
restriction upon them? - A. I did not check that, sir.

     LORD- JUSTICE TAYLOR:  Hr. Jackson, I do not quite
know what you mean by attempts of the club to circumvent
     M R. JACKSON:  It would appear, sir, from my under­
standing of the position once the turnstiles A to G
were to_be used for the entire West terrace and 1'lorth
West terrace the requirements of the existing safety
certificate could not be complied with.
     LORD JUSTICE TAYLOR:      Because you could not limit
2.900?                                              "

          1-R. JACKSON:   I have forgotten all about the e::tra
pens and whether cr not they can be considered separate.-
I am merelv suggesting when the plan to use A to G for
the W      est terrace and the North West terrace the existing
s a f e t v certificate could not be complied with and must
have also not been complied with in 1988.

    .LORD JUSTICE TAYLOR:      Yes..
      MR. JACKSON:   Did you in fact check at any time
the attendance figures submitted by Sheffield Wednesday
ir. rssoect of the 1933 . . .. - A. I have not, sir, no.
     LORD JUSTICE TAYLOR:   Well, it cay have been compl
with but if it was it was by chance is what you are savi
     •IR. TAYLOR:  You recall I asked the question of
Mr. Evans, it could not be complied with because we
know the turnstiles A to G were again used.
     THE W ITNESS:  Sir, might I make the point that in
fact if the Council was wanting - well, if the Council
decided positively to establish how many people were
in a particular area, perhaps with the intention of
proceeding against a club, it would have a very
difficult task in doing so. I have been involved in
prosecutions of places of public entertainment involving
capacity and the only way of accurately establishing
capacity is in fact to count people in and out. It is
virtually impossible, I would have said, tc do that in
respect of football stadia especially where you are
talking about these sort of figures.
     :;R. JACKSOI'I: I do not want to in any way seem to__'
rude to vou, but do you really understand the layout of
the turnstiles at the Leppings Lane end? - A. I believe
understand the layout, sir.

                                                 Cross-examined bv MR. MULLER :

                    B
                                  Mr. Bownes, whatever your personal position may be or
                                  what you regarded it to be in relation to the safety
                                  certificate and the advisory group this much is
                                  absolutely clear, is not it, that the licensing
                                  authority was of course the local authority, Sheffield
                                  Metropolitan District Council. Right? - A. Yes, sir.
                             Q.    And precisely how they carried out that function was a
                                  matter for them? - A. Yes sir.
                             Q. And as far as the various members of the advisory group
                                were concerned, namely, the building surveyors, the
                                South Yorkshire County Fire Service and the South
                                Yorkshire Police, their position is also absolutely
                                 :lear, is not it? They were there to advise? - A.
                                  vYes,   sir.
                     D
                             0    And you took the view that they were there purely as
                                  advisers, not tc make decisions? - A. Yes, srir, that
                                  is right.
                             Q. And the position is therefore this, is not it, that
                                w h a t e v e r ' advice they m ay or may not have given ultimate'
                                it was your function to make sure that a decision was
                                made and whatever decision was made was made known to
                                the club?- A. W           hat sort of decisions are we talking
                                about, sir?
                             0. About anything that the advisory group were concerned
                                with. - A. Yes, sir, if it was appropriate to do so.
                             r\
                             *w   If advice is given there is no point in advice being
                                  given
                                  O     to you unless you do something about it? - A. Yes
                                  sir
                             n And it was therefore your job, and surely you understood
                               it to be so, to make sure that when you got the advice
                               if it was unanimous advice no doubt you could recommend
                               to whoever was going to make the ultimate decision to do
                               precisely what had- been advised. Right? -_A. Yes, sir.
                               I think it is useful to bring in the building surveyor's
                               memoranda at this point of 2nd February where the matter
                               was put to the a d v i s o r y group and the Police representative
                               dealt with it there and then.
                             Q. The position ultimately at the end of the day is that
                                it is your job, nobody else’s job, to make sure that
                         H
                                                                                                     416

     the decision of the local authority is passed on? - A.
     If it is appropriate to do so, sir, yes.
0. And it is your job also to make sure there is a decision
   if necessary? - A. If it is necessary, yes, sir.

0. I an obliged. And it was your job to co-ordinate the
   work cf the advisory group?- A. Insofar as it needed
   co-ordinating, yes, sir.                                        „
0.   If a rr.eeting was wanted you were the one who had to
     organise it? - A. Yes, sir.
Q. If people wanted to knowfor their records or you wanted
   to know for your records what had happened at a particular
   meeting it was for "you to make minutes? - A. Yes, sir.

0.   But as weknow, and I do not want to dwell on it, there
     were many occasions when you did not make any ninutes for
     publication, you did not circulate any minutes on many
     occasions? -A. All the advisory group ninutes have been
     written up and circulated, sir.

Q. I think there were many occasions when you -either       you
   had private r.inutes which you did not circulate.      I think
   ■:cu have a:re.ad.y told Lord Justice■Taylor? - A. Ye s , I"
   have said, sir, that I have made various notes of various
   meetings that took place, for example, in July of 1936.
0. And obviously it was desirable if you were going to have
   minutes or to have any record of what,.happened at the
   meeting to make that record as quickly as possible
   so that action could be taken to save people getting
   into difficulties? - A. That is right, sir. I can
   bring forward three meetings that took place in July.
   1936, which took place in a period of something under
   14 days which did not permit, if you like, proper
   writing up of those minutes in accordance with the
   previous system ....
Q. Can I just ask you again, please, would you look at the core
   bundle'at page 410? It starts at page 417. That was a
   document you put before the Local Authority. Is that
   right? - A. It was a report to the General Purposes Panel,
   sir, yes.
0. And you were making various - your concluded recommendations,
   is that right? - A. Well, sir, it was setting out a number
   of items ....
0. .If you look or. page 418 where you set out the areas cf
    responsibility. - A. Yes, sir.
C. How, before that document actually went off there had beer.


                                                                       417

   some discussions with the advisory group, had there not?
   You told us about one on the 10th of March, 1937, which
   appears in the core bundle at 381 and there was another
   one on the 15th of July, 1987, of which we have also seen
   some minutes made by the Fire Service.. Right? - A. In
   relation to this report, sir?
0. In relation to the question of areas of responsibility.
   There was discussion about that, was not there? - A.. " -
   Yes, sir, and I have explained subsequent correspondence
   dealt fully with the matters raised.
0. Let's not deal with subsequent correspondence. Let's
   just deal with correspondence and the meetings prior to
   that. - A. Yes.
Q. !-;hat you put dowr. there was the building surveyor was'
   to be responsible for all matters relating to the structure
   of the stadium, including crush barriers, walls, etc? - A.
   Yes, sir.-

Q. Of course the building surveyors were part of the Local
   Authority? - A. Yes, sir.

Q. So you realised they were the competent authority to
   advise on that matter? - A. Yes, sir.
Q. Do you recall that when these matters were being discussed
   Mr. Grimshaw of the South Yorkshire County Fire Service
   told you that what you had written under the responsibiliti
   for the Fire Service, namely, fire precautions, fire alarms
   means of escape, emergency lighting and stadium capacity,
   placed the Fire Service in difficulties? - A. Sir, I think
   I can perhaps answer this question fairly briefly. On the
   17th of August, 1937, there was a letter to the Fire
   Service asking for their comments on this draft report, I
   believe. I have got a note cn my copy of that, sir, that
   at 2 p.m. - I-think I may have got the date of the letter
   wrong, sir - I think it was 2 p.m. on the 17th of August
   that Hr. Grimshaw rang up and said that O.K., they are
   happy with the report ,but if there were problems in the
   operation of the new system then they would come back and
   tell me, sir.
Q.Does not deal with the situation because there was a
   meeting on the 16th of July, 1987. Do you happen to
   have -any minutes of your own of that meeting? - A. I
   do have some handwritten notes on the file, sir, yes.
Q. Are they available? - A. They are, sir, I think, yes.

0. 1: ‘t possible to see them? - A. I think it is, sir, ye3.
0. While that is being sought can I perhaps put the situation
   to you? Did you appreciate that the Fire Service could not

                          deal with the question of capacities in their entirety?
                          Did you appreciate that? - A. They saw the report, the
                          draft report, and they approved it, sir. I cean I cannot
                          be any clearer, I do not think.
                       Q. I an putting to you, you see, that what you have got set
                          down there on page 41S . . .. - A. .... is what the Fire
                   B      Service approved, sir.
                       Q. Yes. But they approved it subject to pointing out to
                          you that the Fire Service could not deal with holding
                          capacity because holding capacity was a natter for the
                          structural people who would consider, as you have quite
                          rightly indicated, for er.anple, the crush barrier? - A.
                          Sir, l"have already said the-Fire Service approved that
                          report and I have a note on the letter saying exactly
                          tha t , s i r .
                               MR. MULLER:   At an earlier stage when the Fire
                          Service was giving evidence about this natter reference
                          was made by Hr. Seaman to notes that he made on the
                          original document which was sent by the local Council,
                   D      indeed, by Mr. Bownes. I have now recovered that from
                          the west Midlands Police and the annotations in relation
                          to the very matter I am talking about will clearly be
                          seen on that document. Sir, perhaps I could put that ....
                               LORD JUSTICE TAYLOR:    Which document is it that ....
                               MR. MULLER:  It is Erchibit 11 in the Fire Service
                          bundle. It reoroduces effectively what appears at oage
                          418.
                               LORD JUSTICE TAYLOR:   Right. Well, you had better
                          put it to the witness as to whether that was what was said,
                               MR. MULLER:   Sir, that is what I was proposing to

     that equipment was.
Q. Is it something which you have followed up with that
   Department to see that thet has been done?  A.   That
   the equipment has been provided, sir?
Q.   Yes.   A.    I believe it has been provided, sir.
Q.   But you do not know what it is?         A.    I don't know what
     it is, sir, no.
Q. I do not think you r& y help us any more on that point but
   could you return, please, to the Safety Certificate,
   page 111.   A.    I have it, sir.
Q.    Paragraph 8.2:   "The Holder shall ensure that during
     every Specified Activity a physician employed or retained
     by the Holder is available to attend at the First Aid
     Room if required and that his whereabouts are known to
     those in the Police Central Control Room at the Stadium."
     Have you ever taken any steps to ensure that that provision
     is complied with?     A.   I personally have not, sir.
Q. Has anybody at the City Council to your knowledge?
   A.   T° my knowledge, no, sir.
                      Cross-examined by MR. G L A S G O W :
Q. Mr. Bownes, while you have got the Certificate in front
   of you, if you need to refresh your memory go to page
   117, were you aware of the fact that the Certificate
   required specific areas of the ground to be covered by
   stewards?     Had you noticed that? A.   Yes, sir, it is
   set out i n --
Q. I know it is set out.   I wondered whether you had noticed
   it before?   A.   Yes, sir.
Q ., You had?    A.     Yes, sir.
Q. When you re-drafted - and perhaps I should, completely
   to deal with it - did you notice the fact that in the
   sections of the stadium to be covered there were no
   stewards required as a matter of the Certificate on the
   terraces?    A.  I have to admit, sir, that I did not
   notice that.
Q. You did not notice that.           A.    I didn't notice that.
Q. To be fair to you, when you came eventually to redraft
   the certificate, you did think that some provision ought
   to be made for control of the numbers entering sections
   of the ground?   A. Could you refer me to the document,
   sir?
Q. Yes.   When you redrafted the Certificate, your redraft I
   think is most conveniently found at -- it starts with the
   letter at 387.   The only bit I was going to refer you to

                            was on 390.   This, of course, was in the summer of 1987.
                            You provided under Paragraph 10, as we see on 390, that
                            the written instructions given to the stewards should
                            include, as the first one, "the preventing of overcrowding
                            by ensuring crowd limits in various parts of the ground were
                            complied with."   A.   Yes, sir, that is what it says.
                 B       Q. And was that a matter of conscious in-put from you or
                            something which perfectly sensibly you had culled from
                            a different certificate?   A.   I believe, sir, that
                            that actually is in the Green Guide, if I am not mistaken.
                         Q. At any event, was it something which you had given active
                            thought to as being a possible problem at this ground
                            or just a matter of good sense generally, wherever it had
                 C          come from?   A.   I must have given it active consideration
                            to put it in the conditions, sir.   These conditions were
                            not ground specific at this time.

                              No.  Mr. Bownes. what you may be able to help on is when that

                              to be done.  Do you remember that? - a . Y e s . I think it is
                              fairlv well stated in their letter.

                              It is noted in 390 as we can see, and if you want it more
                              legibly you find it on *09.  On 409 they were replying on I3tn
                 8            August to that letter of 7th July, and they say in respect of
                              section 1 0 (a):

                                   "Whilst specified in the Green Gui de ” (which is ri rnt
                                   "it is difficult to imagine how this task can be
                                   controlled by stewards.  This matter snoula be considered
                                   further".

                              - a . Yes.    sir.

                         Q. Does that refresh your memory?.- A. Yes,       that is what was
                              SeiG .

                         O. Was it considered further? - A. In the revised draft, which
                            perhaps we could have a look at ....
                 D       Q. By all means.  You have to go well forward for the revised
                            draft. - A. It is 500 or so.

                         G . *99 is the relevant page.  We find it on *99 that ycur
                             suggested solution to the problem there raised is simply
                             alter the wording to read:

                                       "Under the direction of the safety officer cr cnief
                                       steward or authorised officer, prevent overcrowding".

                              - A. That was my understanding, sir, but I think the Fire
                              Service have made additional comments on that, but I c a n ’t
                              recall what they are     at the moment.

                         G. Can you remember any discussion about itafter i t      had oee”
                            raised by the Fire Department? - A. No, sir.

                         G. Specifically as to how this was physically to be achieved at
                            this ground? - A. No, sir, I c a n ’t recall any discussion.

                         G. Again, I wonder if it helps, when you went to this wonderful
                            seminar with everybody, including the West Yorkshire Police,
                            did you notice the fact that it was a matter specifically
                            raised by the Police at that seminar that the control cf these
                            pens was part of the policing procedure at the ground?  Do you
                            recall that or did that pass you by? - A. I am afraia that
                            must have passed me oy. sir.  I can't recall that.

                         G.   If we look at page *, and this is I appreciate a digest cf
                              what was said and not a report, you see the role of the Police
                              is discussed in much the same way as the role of the Fire ,
                     H        Brigade has been discussed which Mr. Muller was helping us
                              with? - A. Yes. sir.

                               Q.   Do you remember the man from West Yorkshire telling everybody
                                    about the way the Police ought to do it? - a . Vaguely, sir.  I
                                    think my notes were the bits that I took real note o f .

                               0.   A summary may help us.    We get it on page 4. Perhaps it is
                                    the quickest way. of doing it to save everybody time.- The role
                                    is defined under the three general headings. <b) being to
                           B        maintain safe and orderly crowd upon arrival at the stadia and
                                    to preserve that condition throughout the game. - a . Yes, sir.

                               G. Then the point I wondered might have concerned you is under
                                    the Safety of Sports Ground Act underneath.  If you go over
                                    the page you see on page 5, "Normal policing methods".  - a.
                                    Yes. sir.

                               G.   I take it no further if your recollection does not go this
                                    far. Mr. Bownes. but do you remember that as part oz normal
                                    policing methods the West Yorkshire senior Officers were
                                    talking about the use of pens?  It is the second matter after
                                    "Segregation” :

                                         "The use of pens:  as part of the normal policing we have
                                         the use of pens. i.e. smail segregated enclosures for
                           D             supporters on the terraces greatly improves crowd
                                         control, e t c ” .

                                    I won't waste time by reading it through.  We can reaa it for
                                    ourselves. - A. Yes, I accept what is written there.

                               0. My question is t h i s . You had raised the problem in the summer
                                  of this year.   The Fire Service had very sensiDlv come back
                                  and said to you, "Yes, but how on earth are we going to do
                                  it?” . You then go off to a seminar in all modesty to be
                                  better informed about these problems, and lo and behold the
                                  Police Officer from the next County gets up and talks about
                                  this specific problem.     I wondered if at least at that stage
                                  did it ring a bell to you to say, "My goodness me, this is the
                                  very problem we are talking about at Sheffield"? - A. Forgive
                                  me, sir, I thought you were talking about stewards to start
                                  with.   I have misinterpreted what you say.

                               G.   I am not trying to score points on that all, Mr. Bownes.   It
                                    does not matter whose responsibility it was.  It so happens it
                                    was discussed as part of normal policing.  That is not the
                                    point.  What I wanted you to remember was whether or not this
                                    rang a bell with you as to whether or not we had got a problem
                                    of precisely this kind at Sheffield? - A. No, the question of
                                    pens I must say passed me by.

                               G. Finally, Mr. B o w n e s , in fairness to you is it right to say
                                  when you did circulate your draft to the members of the
                                  working party you were told by all of them - taking them in
                                  turn -'by the Police Force first, both in January and in
                                  October, that they were very satisfied with the co-operation
                           H      of the club and the way in which it was dealing with its
                                  problems? - A. Yes, sir, the Police have certainly said that.

                               Sir.

                          G. And that your own lead authority, the Environmental Health
                             Officer, had said precisely the same thing at 413. actually
                             saying he was impressed by the management?  Would you like to
                             remind yourself of that?  I think it is *13 of the big bundle.
                             The last line that is relevant:  "I was noticeably impressed
                      B      with the level of ground management being maintained"? - k .
                             Yes, sir•

                          0. The question simply for you, Mr. Bownes, having had your ideas
                             circulated and received the input from the members of the
                             working party, did you think that there was anybody on that
                             working party who was at all unhappy at the way in which the
                             club had been behaving in relation to its safety functions? -
                             A. No. sir.        -

                          O.   I am sorry, one very' last matter, the question of alterations
                               being made.  I think you have'said you regarded alterations
                               which would have required a variation to the certificate to be
                               put before the fully authorised committee, the panel? - A.
                               Yes, sir.

                      D   O. Matters of rearrangement         which did not go to the root of the
                             certificate you regarded         as being fit for the working party? -
                             A. Yes. sir.

                          O. Would it be fair to say from your own attendance at those
                             working party meetings you would not have been surprised if
                             the d u o ' s officers nad acted on the request of working party
                             officers to carry out minor works around the ground? - A. It
                             is a question of what you mean by minor, sir.

                          0. Of course. - A. Painting, that sort of thing. I would not nave
                             thought there was any difficulty.  Have you got a particular
                             point in mind, sir?

                          0. I wondered whether the rearrangement of the barrier was one
                             that concerned you as being something that ought to have been
                             taken further or whether your reaction as the time was that if
                             that is raised by the working party it is not surprising it is
                             acted upon? - A. This is 144, sir?

                          0.   Yes. - A. Yes.   in respect of that barrier at that time.      Yes.

                               That it was a matter that I would expect the club to act on.

should think there were quite a few of a routine maintenance
nature, sir. yes.

I won't press it further.

     LORD JUSTICE TAYLOR:   When the question of removing that
barrier was discussed was there specific mention of the fact
it would necessarily reduce the number that could be
accommodated in that pen? - a .  I would honestly say I can't
recall if any mention was made of that.

I think Dr. Eastwood has told us it did.

     MR. TOULSON:   He was saying it on the strength of the
report he got from Strange, of   course. Sir, I will touch on
that if I may in a moment.

              Cross-Examined by MR.   TOULSON:

Mr. Bownes. I am sorry to come back to the working party, but
would you' turn in your statement to page 5 paragraph 16. where
you set out the background under the South Yorksnire regime:

     "The County Council set up an 'Officer Working Party
     (Sheffield D i s t r i c t ) ' which consisted of
     representatives of the Fire Service, the Police, the
     Euilding Authority (Sheffield City Council) and the
     South Yorkshire County Council Administration
     Department".

Rightly, you den't include there the club or its engineers as
members of the working party because they were not. were they?
- a . No, sir.

They would be present by invitation at the twice yearly
inspection of the ground by members of the Officer Working
Party when obviously matters would be discussed? - A. Any
comment on matters really before 1986 would be speculation on
my p a r t ....

So be it. - A ....... but it is my understanding that club
representatives were present on inspections.

That is right, but not at other meetings of the officer
working party? - A. No, sir, some meetings were conducted
without club representatives being present.

Coming on to the change under your regime, your statement,
page 14, paragraph 46, records or leads on to the description
of now in the next paragraph the' advisory group came to be set
up.  I d o n ’t want to go over what has been gone over tefore.
Effectively that was going to be the same group but under
another name? - A. Yes. with some slight chan ge s.

You were going to have on i t . p a r a g r a p h 49 page IS. the
Building Survey.  He had been on already? Correct? - A. Yes,
sir .

                       U.       County Fire Service.    They had been on already.    -A.     Yes. sir.

                       Q.       Police.-   they had been on already? - A. Yes.

                       C;.      The County Council could not be on any longer because they haa
                                ceased to exist, and you were in their plade? - a . Yes.
               B                But before that change of name - it was no more than that -
                                took place, which we see from your statement was September
                                196/. you had been in the saddle for 18 months? - a . Yes. sir.

                                And it was during that 1 8 -months period that the inspection
                                had taken place in August when the removal of        was
                                'authorised?.- A. August, 1986, sir.

                                Exactly.   Do I understand it right that during that 18
                                months period you had been continuing with the old
                                system', the officer working party, but with yourself in
                                place of the now defunct County Council? - A.
                                Effectively, yes, sir.

                       G        You told the Inquiry that you had your own engineer - when I
               D                say "you", the City Council? - A. Yes. sir.

                       u    .   As indeed had the. County Council beforehand? - a. N'c- , sir.
                                The County Council used the City C o u n c i l ’s Building.Survevor.

                       u    .   I am so sorry.   At any rate, the hat may have changes but wnat
                                was beneath' the hat remained the same? - A. Yes. sir.

                       u.       He was in fact. Mr. Don Sheriff of the Building Department? -
                                A. I think Mr. Sheriff attended meetings, sir, yes.

                       (J   .   Ana he is a qualified chartered engineer? - A. I d o n ’t know
                                his qualifications, sir. but I am quite confident he is.

                                If he was not there there was somebody else standing in his
                                shoes? - A. Yes, I imagine so.

                                Under the old system, would you look in the core bundle page
                                27.   I expect you have seen it before.  To avoid people not
                                knowing what their respective responsibilities were there was
                                an allocation of responsibilities, and if we look at
                                "Terraces" on the left-hand side, "Structural” was a matter
                                primarily for the building authority but with the Fire and
                                Folic_e to be consulted. - A. Is that the third one down, sir?
                                It is a poor copy.

                       u . It depends       how you count, but do you see the word "Terraces” ?
                                - a . "Egress from the ground", and it is below that?

                                Yes.  Over the page:  "Spacing of crush barriers:  strengtn cf
                                crush barriers", both building authority? - A. Yes. sir.

                            was the decision to introduce the radial barriers after
                            discussion, and we see under (2):

                     Q. And I am not going t0 duplicate the exercise for 19S5.
                        Let's come on, if we may_, to the 1986 meeting, inspection
                        meeting, which was the first annual inspection you
                        attended although you had been to the ground previously?
                        - A. Yes, sir.
                     Q. Turn. please, to page 341 in the bundle. -• A. Yes, I have

                     Q. And, indeed, it was more than an authorisation, it was a
                        request, because it was not something the club were
                        asking to do, was it? -A. The Police raised the issue
                        and it was a matter of agreement really at the end of
                        the day.
                     0. Now, this document we have is a job list, is it not,
                        prepared by Mr. Strange from Eastwoods noting the various
                        things which the club was going to have to do after the
                        raised insoection? - A. It looks like that, sir, yes.
                 D   Q. Perhaps we can just glance down. Do we get an indication
                        of the detail with t’hich the group had gone round ths
                        gro i by, for example, item 4, seat 3, row       in tne
                        ;’est Stand needs repairing? - A. Yes, sir.
                     0. This was no mere perfunctory glance, This was a detailed
                        inspection? - A. Well,, sir, there are a number of Doir.ts
                        raised.
                     0. And so far as the radial removal - there were two radial -
                        two fences, I am sorry, barriers, to be altered. Ue are
                        not directly concerned with Ho. 1. That was in the
                        corner of the ground. It was a question, you agreed, one
                        piece of barrier should be taken out and replaced by
                        another? - A. Yes, sir.
                     0. We are concerned directly with No. 2. You have told the
                        Inquiry that there was discussion - but you, do I under­
                        stand, do not recall any of the details of the reasons
                        why the Police wanted it out? - A. Regrettably, no, sir.
                     0. Do you recall this, that ic was being put forward as a
                        matter of some urgency because it was now the 7th of
                        August and the season was going to start with a home
                        game against Everton who were, I thinl:, champions, and
                         that was going to coincide with the opening of Spion Xop?
                         Does any of that ring a chord withyou? - A. That would ~o

                              read every document-with great care but obviously there
                              would have been certain documents you would have*wanted
                              to look at, would not there? - A. Yes, sir, I tried to
                              get a flavour of the files

                         Q. Had you, for example, read Dr. Eastwood's original reoort
                            back in 1979, survey report, page 36 in the bundle?
                            Would you-care to look at it? - A. I have it. sir.

                            distance ....
                 D
                         0. If you were trying to see your way into the matter that
                            might have been one of-the basic documents you looked at.
                            You have no recollection? - A. Quite possibly, sir, but
                            I do not recall reading that particular document.
                         0. You would no doubt have read the 1976 Gilide and how
                            capacity was calculated? - A. I certainly read the 1976
                            Guide, sir, yes.

                         Q. And how capacity was calculated because that was something
                            which you were going to be responsible for? - A. Yes. I
                            noted how the capacity was calculated but it is not - it
                            is a technical matter which I would have to take advice on.
                         Q. And no doubt did take advice from the engineers? - A. Where
                            it was appropriate to do so, sir, yes.

                         Q. It was appropriate to know how capacity wascalculated,  was
                            not it? - A. If a question had been raised on capacity,

                         Q.        LORD JUSTICE TAYLOR:   I suppose one short cut
                              to all this would be when you took over from the
                              County to have a meeting of everybody that was involved,
                              including the club and its engineer, and say, " L o o k , v;e
                              have taken this over. W e are responsible for the

                              be done?"- A. Yes. Well, in fact, there was a meeting
                              involving the working party, if you like, in the middle

of March where those points were in fact raised.
And the club? -A. Not including the club, sir, no.
Almost inevitable, is not it, Dr. Eastwood would have
said we'll, there have been considerable changes and
it has altered capacity? - A. Yes, I think.in hindsight
it would have been useful to have that discussion.
     HR. TOULSOI!:  Just look, if you would, please,
two pages here, page 56? -A. I have it, sir.
Keep your finger in there if you would, please, and
also go to page 117. I an just wondering about your
comparison --between the figure Dr. Eastwood originally
suggested for standing on Spion Kop and the figure that
had been certified'. Dr. Eastwood had suggested that
once the works had been done which were in fact then
done they could certify for 16,000. In fact the
Licensing Authority was more generous from the point
of view of the club's revenues by certifying for 15,350?
- A. That is evidently true from the file, sir, yes.
So clearly that authority had exercised its independent
mind when looking at the question of capacity? - A. Yes,
sir.
At any rate, when you - you have said. I think, in your
statement that on the occasion when the removal of 146
was authorised the building authority were there and
represented and able to advise you? - A. Yes, sir.
And they were the people who you understood you were
going to be looking to for advice on calculations on
capacity? - A. Yes, sir, as*far as the old revision of
responsibilities was concerned, yes.
So either the question ofcapacity was discussed and the
view concluded there was no need to alter the figure
or the building authority did not raise it at all but
you do not remember? - A. I am afraid I do not remember,
sir.
Mow, finally, you produced today a bundle of correspondence
starting with a letter of the 23rd October, 1986. I am not
quite sure why the first letter was being introduced but
it refers to previous correspondence and in case it has
any materiality the position was this, was not it, you
are there acknowledging a letter from Eastwoods of the
15th of October in reply to a letter of the 9th October.
I have copies of the letters there but unfortunately we
have iust produced them. The position was this, was not
it, on the 9th October you had written to the club saying
that you did not seem to have any plans for the Spion Kop

  end although the building work was well underway and
  Eastwoods had replied saying that the plans had"in fact
  been deposited with the Council ten months earlier and
  also copies had been supplied 'to-, the-Fire Brigade and
  the building authority? - A. Yes, sir.      As I recall,
  what happened was    the advisor - I forget which -had
  said they had nothad copies of these plans and would
  I raise it with Eastwoods.
0. And in fact had the?, all along? - A. Yes. W hat had
   happened is that the normal system for subr.itting plans
   had not been follor/ed. Sir. I wonder if I may make -
   I am sorry - a comment about the Spion Kop?
        LORD JUSTICE TAYLOR:     Yes, by all means.
        THE WITM ESS:     Dr. Eastwood actually applied for a
   capacity of 22,000 or so, I think, nearly 23,000 I think
   it*was, and the General Purposes Panel when it considered
   the application for the increase in capacity on the advice
   of the*Council' s various advisors reduced that to 21.000.
        MR. TOULSOS:   Yes.

0. Mr. Bownes, when you took over you made a point. I think
   you said, of looking at the Green Guide, the 1975 Green
   Guide? - A. Yes, s i r .
C. And looking at the safety certificate? - A. Yes, sir.
0. Because you wanted to know what you were responsible for,
   what you would have to enforce and had to have a firm view
   about the meanings? - A. I certainly needed to familiarise
   myself with it.
Q. You could not do your job unless you knew what'you meant
   or what you were taking - to be responsible for? - A. Yes,
   sir.
0. Did there come a time when you looked at the 1985 Green
   Guide? - A. Yes, sir.
Q. Did you notice the significant difference between the two
   concerning the emphasis and importance attached to the
   holder’s responsibility and stewarding? - A. Yes, sir, I
   think the accompanying circular drew attention to part­
   icularly the section m relation to management respons­
   ibility, s i r .
Q. Yes. If one compares the two, and we do not need to do
   it now, but it can be said, can it not, that there is
   barely any reference to stewarding and the organisation


                                                                441

                      A        of people at the ground but in the Green Guide of 19S6
                               that is almost the primary emphasis? - A. Yes, sir.
                          Q. Yes. The 1976 one effectively concentrates on physical
                             methods, barriers and that sort of means of controlling
                             people's positions? - A. I believe so, sir, ves.

                          Q. Yes. Wel-l, when you read Che 1986 Guide did you give your
                      B      mind at all to whether or not the safety certificate was
                             appropriate and sufficient in the light of the new
                             guidance? - A. It did occur to me that amendments may be
                             required and it was an ongoing process, if you like, of
                             redrafting the safety certificate conditions/
                          0. Of course you will have looked at the safety certificate
                             and you will have _seen what was said, perhaps with some
                      C      prescience, under paragraph 9, under condition 9, con­
                             cerning the responsibility of stewards.

                                    THE W ITNESS:    I have it, sir.   Sorry.   What was
                               the question?
                      D   q.        MR. W OODWARD: You will have perhaps noted when you
                               looked at the position of stewards to see there that in
                               1979 the drafters of the certificate had had some thought
                               about it? - A. Yes, sir. I noticed that the condition was
                               there , sir, ves.
                          0. And the only reference in the certificate to the ensuring
                      E      of safety by control and direction of the fans rests
                             insofar as it is dealt with in the certificate upon the
                             club and upon the stewards? There is the lacuna that
                             Mr. Glasgow pointed out in relation to the terrace.
                                    LORD JUSTICE TAYLOR:   Mr. Woodward, we have been
                               over this umpteen times and I have reminded you three
                               times of what your Senior Officers have said and I can
                      F        read what the certificate says and the Green Guide.

                                            (MORNING SESSION)


                                           DAVID BOWNES Recalled       *
                 B               Cross-examined by MR. MAXWELL (Cont'd) :

                     Q. Hr. Bownes, I was dealing with barrier 144 and perhaps
                        at this stage you could formally produce - it has a l r e a d y
                        gone before Lord Justice Taylor - the photographs showing
                        Leppings Lane terraces in 1965 and by reference to those
                        as they were refurbished, I think, in 1966 you can see
                        barrier 144 across the tunnel entrance. So far as that
                        barrier is concerned and the events of summer of 1986.
                        August, if it had been said at any time that the removal
                        of 144 would affect capacity on the terraces is that a
                        matter which would have been of concern to you?- A. Yes,
                        sir, it would.
                     Q. And is there any action that you would have taken about
                 D      it had that been the position? - A. Yes, sir. I would
                        have asked the appropriate experts for their advice on
                        capacity.
                     Q. In that context who are the appropriate experts? - A.
                        The Fire Service, the building surveyor and the Police
                        have some involvement, sir.
                     Q. If such a suggestion had been made is it a matter that
                        you think you would have remembered? - A. Yes, sir.
                     Q. Are there any documents on your files or any of the
                        other files of the various parties that suggest that
                        this was stated? - A. Not so far as I am aware, sir.

                     Q. At the meeting in August, 1986, who else was there apart
                        from Mr. Calvert for the Police? - A. There was, I believe,
                        Mr. Strange from Eastwood &Partners, Mr. Butler from the
                        Council's building surveyors -----
                     Q. He is the Council building surveyor? - A. Yes, sir.

                     Q. Did he express any view about the removal of 144? - A.
                        Other than agreeing to it, sir, I cannot recall.
                     0. You recall that he agreed to it? - A. Yes, sir.
                     Q. Subsequently was any report ever made to you by way of a
                        complaint or comment about the absence of 144 after it
                        had been removed?- A. No.

                 H   Q. Did anyone ever suggest to you the removal of 144 reduced

                                the power of control of the crowd on the terrace? - A. No.
                           Q. I mean in respect of crowd movement or crowd distribution.
                              Was anything ever said? - A. No, sir.
                           Q. In that context, looking at the matter generally, did
                              anyone ever suggest to you that there was any problem
                              at all of crowd control on the terrace? - A. No, sir.
                  B
                           Q. If a report had been made to you about overcrowding on
                              the terrace is there any action that you would taken? - A.
                              Yes, sir. I would have immediately consulted once again
                              the appropriate experts in that area.

                           Q. And, similarly, if it had been suggested to you that there
                              was a need to monitor the numbers in some way, counting
                              the fans in or counting them when they were on the
                              terrace, if that had been suggested to you is that
                              something you would have taken action about? - A. Yes, sir.
                           Q.        LORD JUSTICE TAYLOR:   Did you know that there was
                                a means of counting the numbers through the turnstiles
                                as a whole? - A. Yes, sir. I was aware that the turnstiles
                   D            do record numbers of people going through them if that
                                was the question.
                           Q. And what did you think the object of that w*-? - A. To
                              control the numbers of people on the areas for which
                              you had access by the turnstiles.
                           Q/ But nobody ever raised at all in discussion at any of
                              these meetings you attended the problem of subdividing
                              the area? - A. Not as far as I recall, sir, no.
                           Q.        M R. M  AXWELL: In that context Lord Justice Taylor
                                has seen a plan prepared by Dr. Eastwood's firm of
                                April, 1987, showing pens 3 and 4 with two figures on,
                                1,000 and l.,200 respectively. The plan is 8945/1. - A.
                                Yes, s i r .
                           Q. Did such a plan ever come to your notice before this
                              tragedy? - A. No.
                           Q. Were you aware before this tragedy of such subdivided
                              capacities? - A. No, sir.
                           Q.        LORD JUSTICE TAYLOR:   You mean you were aware of
                                the subdivisions but not of the subdivided capacities?
                                -A. Yes, sir,   that   is correct.

                           Q.        MR. MAXWELL:   If it had been necessary for any
                                person, including the Local Authority, to calculate the
                                capacity for a subdivided area is that something that

you would have expected to find mentioned expressly in
the Green Guide? - A. I believe I would, sir, yes.
Do you find it mentioned expressly in the Green Guide?
- A. I have not been able to find a reference, sir, no.
And, similarly} is it a matter that you would have expected
to be mentioned by the Home Office in the advice that they
have sent out to local authorities? - A. Yes, sir.
And is it something that has been mentioned by the Home
Office? - A. Not as far as I am aware, sir, no.
Or dealt with byvirtue of any safety regulations? - A.
There have definitely been no safety regulations in this
area, s i r .
It seems that in the past doubts have been expressed, I
think by the Police in documents Lord Justice Taylor has
seen and also by the club in other such documents, doubts
expressed about the holding capacity on the Leppings Lane
terraces. Were you ever made aware of any such doubts?
- A. N o , s i r .

So far as the crush barriers are concerned, quite apart
from'any■ inspection . that Dr. Eastwood 1s-firm* makes: oc : .
them, are they al.su inspected by the Local Authority?
- A. Yes,    sir.

And is that pursuant to the statutory guidance? - A. It
is, sir.
And is the position this, that at least 10 per cent of
the crush barriers are inspected for overt signs of
damage? - A. That is correct, sir.
So far as first aid is concerned you told Lord Justice
Taylor that there is not any national index or the kind
of equipment that should be available by way of first aid
equipment. Have you in fact made efforts to see whether
such a national index is available?- A . Yes, sir. In
connection with the pop concert at Sheffield United, for
example, I obtained a copy of the Greater London Council
guidance on the sort of matter a local authority ought
to consider.

      LORD JUSTICE TAYLOR:  The sort of what?- A. Matters
the local authority ought to consider and there is in there
a vague reference to first aid. It is not in any detail
at a l l , s i r .
     MR. MAXWELL:   There is no detailed list of equipment
that you should,provide? - A. No, sir, definitely not.

I wonder if I could ask you quite briefly to return to the


                                                              450

memorandum that you have prepared that deals with delay
and which is now added to your statement only to do this,
if you -ould, please. I think you have actually considered
the length of time that these different items of exceptiona
workload, as you have described them, have taken for each
of the six month blocks that are referred to. - A. Yes, sir
Could you please look at that memorandum and taking the
blocks of time from January, 1987, could you tell Lord
Justice Taylor what the exceptional workload amounted to
first of all for that period, January to June, 1987, the
total time taken up on these other matters was what? - A.
Approximately ten working weeks, sir.
And July, 1987, to December, 1987, again the total period?
- A. Approximately twelve working weeks, sir.

January to June, 1988?- A. Approximately ten working weeks,
sir.
And finally July to December, 1988? - A. That was approx­
imately 15 working weeks, sir.
And I think you can give a breakdown if necessary of those
total periods?- A. Yes, sir.
I would invite you now, Mr. Bownes, to look to the .-’’lure.
Are you aware at least through this Inquiry and probably
aware in any event of the assistance that the ambulance
service can give you in respect of your certificating
function? - A. Yes, sir. I believe the ambulance service
can have a useful input and I am sure they will be
shortly invited to make comments to the Council.
You will extend the invitation to them to be of assistance
to you?- A. I will do, sir, yes.
Both with regard to medical and paramedical matters and
all those other issues on which they can quite clearly
offer assistance to you?- A. Yes, sir.
     LORD JUSTICE TAYLOR:   What, as part of your advisory
group or simply on an adhoc basis?- A. That would be a
matter for discussion, sir.
     MR. MAXW ELL:  Similarly, the Health and Safety
Executive, would you intend to approach them again to
see whether they could offer assistance? - A. I think
I would approach them again, sir, to see if they have
changed their view at all.

     his mind to the matter could not   but have realized that
     their capacities were important.   A. It may be that the
     Home Office took that view, Sir.

         LORD JUSTICE TAYLOR: Just on that, have you got the
     Green Guide there?  A. No, Sir, I have not. (Same handed)

Q . If you look at page 64 when you said a f e w ‘minutes ago
     that there was nothing in the Green Guide to suggest that
     you needed to calculate capacities of sub-divisions had
     you in mind the reference throughout that chapter seems
     to be to terraces?  A. Yes, Sir.

Q.   But if you look back at page 33, paragraph 101, does not
     that raise the point, with a reference to chapter 16?
     "Ground should be divided into sections to prevent
     potentially hazardous migrations by spectators.   Each
     section of the ground has its own limit of safe capacity.
     See chapter 16".  A. Yes.   Perhaps I have misread that
     to read the terrace as a whole.

Q.   I follow that it could be made clearer   in chapter 16 but
      apart from the common sense point that Mr. Collins just
      made there is reference at 101, is there not?   A. Yes,
      Sir .

Q.       MR. -MAXWELL: I would invite you, Sir,    to look at 102.-.

         LORD JUSTICE TAYLOR: Yes.  It all depends what you mean
     by each section, each major section.  It could be clearer,
     Iagree.

Q.       MR. COLLINS: At the very least, Mr. Bownes, it is
     something in respect of which you might have asked your
     experts?   A. Possibly, Sir, yes,

Q.   Although one sympathizes with your work load, Mr. Bownes,
     I think you will agree with me that it cannot possibly be
     an excuse for not doing what ought to have been done in
     relation to a particular function of the licensing authority?
     A. Yes, I would agree with that.

Q.       LORD JUSTICE TAYLOR: If necessary the head of admin­
     istration should have been told: "We need someone else” ,
     is that right?   A. Possibly, Sir, yes.

Q.       MR. COLLINS: And then no doubt the usual financial
     constraints would have come into play.  A. I think that
     the Council has a record when dealing with safety matters
     of giving them an appropriate priority, Sir.

Q.   Finally, it was put to you and you have said that there was
     no guidance anywhere in relation to firstly what sort of
     first aid equipment should be available.  If you had
     looked at the file you would, of course, have seen that
     South Yorkshire had indeed asked for someone to provide

                             a list, a miminum list, of first aid equipment.  You
                             were aware of that, were you?  A. Yes, Sir.  I believe
                             I was referring to national guidance.

                             I f o l l o w that but so far as this club is coneened if you
                             had looked at what is now page 88 or our bundle you would
                             have seen Dr. B a i l e y ’s recommendations. A. I am aware
                             of those recommendations, Sir, yes.
                    B
                        Q    That at least would have been a starting point?          A. It
                             would , S i r , yes .

                        Q.   Thank you.

                                           Inspector CLIVE CALVERT. Called
                                              Examined by MR. GOLDSACK


                        Q.   Are you Inspector Clive Calvert?     A. I am, Sir.

                        Q.   Now I think with Complaints and Discipline Department
                             but for many years stationed at F.l sub-division?
                             A.Yes,Sir.

                    D   Q.   Whilst there were you the liason officer with Sheffield
                             Wednesday?  A. I was, Sir.

                        Q.   Did that cover   the period 1979 until when?     A. Until late
                             1987, Sir.

                        Q.   So it includes the 1987 semi-final?  A. it includes the 1987
                             semi-final and I worked closely with Mr. Sewell, who took
                             over until the 1988 semi-final.

                        Q.   You I think were the first person who had been designated
                             as liason officer?  A. That is correct.

                        Q.   What did you see your role as being?  A. It was a develop­
                             ing role from virtually nothing to liason with the football
                             club, planning in conjunction with the senior officers,
                             football matches, and dealing with most of the matters
                             on their behalf and with their consultation.

                             What sort of regularity of contact did you have with club
                             officials?   A. I saw the club officials on every match
                             day.   If we had a problem I would deal with them on the
                             match days.   I would see them at the inspections, and if
                             we had any reason to contact them on a day to day basis
                             it would usually be me who did it.

                             Do we take it that barring exceptional circumstances you
                             were always present at football matches during your years
                             as liason officer?  A. If I missed one match a season
                             during that time that would probably be the most.

                             Did you have available to you from. 1979 onwards access to
                    H   Q
                             the Green Guide?  A. Yes.

                        Q    You were aware of its provisions,    were you?    A. Yes         454

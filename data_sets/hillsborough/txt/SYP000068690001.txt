pitch       invasion by the             supporters.                  As      I reached      the     perimeter           fenci

to the Leppings Lane                   end         of the        ground,       I noti c e d      the      fans w i t h i n        t

to   revive         him.      Whilst       attempting          these a c t s , I sensed              that     there was

a great        deal    of a c t i v i t y aro u n d me,            but      I d i d n ’t notice a n y t h i n g         in

particular.            I b e l i e v e d at        that     point     that      the youth         I was a t t e m p t i n g

to   revive was            the    only     sudden death w i t h i n             the ground.             whilst       knelt

over     the deceased             body,     using mouth            to mouth,         I suddenly

felt     a pain at the             base     of my b a c k , and             I was    pushed onto           the     body

itself        fay what      I believe        was a kick.              As     I fell     over      the     body,      I heart

someone        scream,        "You ESastard."               I d i d n ’t react         to the kick          in the

normal        manner,       for    some     reason,         I just       continued         to attempt         to     revive

the y ou t h        lying     on the       floor.         After a short             time    it was        obvious       that

life was        extinct and with                  the a s s i s t a n c e    of either       officers        or fans,          '

cannot        remember        which,       the y outh was            taken to the           rear     of    the N orth

Stand        near    to the       g y m n a s i u m area.

After        covering       the    body w ith rny coat,               I then        returned       onto     the      pitch

area     in order          to as s i s t    other       officers.

Upo n    returning          to the       pitch area,           it was        then and       only then that              I

realised        that       ather     bodies        had been feaken from the L e p pings                      Lane

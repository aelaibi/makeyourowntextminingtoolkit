                       PARLIAMENTARY QUESTION FOR PRIORITY WRITTEN ANSWER ON
                       24 APRIL 1989




                       Mr Max Madden (Bradford West): To ask the Secretary of
                                 State for the Home Department, what reports
                                 he has received about assaults on police
                                 officers and emergency service personnel on
                                 duty at Hillsborough on Saturday 15th April.




                       DRAFT REPLY



                       I am informed by the Chief Constable that information
                       about any assaults on police officers has not yet been
                       collated.     The Chief Fire Officer informs me that so
                       far none of his staff have reported any assault.     The
                       Chief Ambulance Officer reports that, so far, three
                       staff have reported an assault but that the debriefing
                       of his staff is not yet complete.
BACKGROUND NOTE



We have collected information from DHSS (who received information
from the Chief Ambulance Officer), from F8 Division (who received
information from the Chief Constable), and direct from the Chief
Fire Officer.


The police are as yet unable to provide the statistical
information sought.   The 3 reported assaults on ambulance staff
is probably the total but debriefing of staff continues.

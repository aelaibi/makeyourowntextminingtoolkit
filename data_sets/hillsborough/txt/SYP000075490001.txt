    On the Saturday        15th April      1989 (150489),      I made my way to

    Northampton and caught the club coach together with friends
                                                                                          P5

    hold tip^, ar r i v i ng at /Sheffield about        1.45pm    (1345)-2.Q0pm   (1400). The

    coach driv        ome of us off the coach before getting tc^^the ground

    approx quarter mile before this included m y s e l f ,

                                                  s\jrfTly" the second or so
    and two young kids, who I didn't know. This wasXjrfuy

    match and they tagged onto us to show them their way.



    $e   began walking to the ground and as we did we passed a number of
/
    Liverpool supporters sitting on walls and hanging around near to the

    ground. They were drinking alcohol from cans.



    We arrived at the Leppings Lri turnstiles at approx 2.15pm                    (1415) and

    I was surprised that there was hardly any supporters queueing to get

    into/the turnstiles.             In fact within a few minutes of getting to the

    tLyrnstiles we were through and into the ground.                 I can remember that

     utside the turnstiles there was approx three foot patrol Police

    Officer to every two turnstiles and they were searching two out of

    three supporters.        I can't remember        if there were any stewards except

    for the/ones    in the turnstiles box's and the one's selling programmes.

     ust /nside the ground there were more Officers and they too were

    slear chi ng supporters again,          in fact I would say there was approx         10— 15

    ilns/ide the turnstile between the turnstiles and the back of the W

    Stand.

  nee inside the ground I know where I was going because of previous

visits, and I made my way straight to the tun ne 1 to get behind the

goals. Having said that          I knew that the tunnel took you to the back of

the goals and then I thought that you could get to all of the terrace

behind the goal.         I didn't know there were pens with fences separating

you?



      e ntered the tunnel without seeing any Police or stewards a t this

entrance and once inside the tunnel           I noticed that it was quite small

and very dark and about 30 yards long. As soon as I entered the tunnel

 I could see the Spion Hop on the opposite side of the ground through

 the exit of the tunnel.          I walked down the tunnel still with

As we got to the end of the tunnel we decided we wanted to get to the

 best part of the terrace where people were singing and we decided this

was     in Pen 3. There were quite a lot of people already in the terrace

and we had to push our way into the terrace,               having said that I mean

we weaved in and out of other supporters.



We 4 ot      to the front of the terrace almost over to the

       had a metal     barrier   in front of us.   In fact the,       barrier

^ater saw was the one which broke. The time now was abou
0
(1430). The atmosphere at this time now was really great, we were

singing,      dancing and jumping about.      It was   really good. There was also

swaying from side to side and surging from the back               of theterrace.    I

expected all of this because this is the normal way               of supporters    at

big matches. You push forward and push back. However as time went on

 I noticed that it was getting          really packed and things were getting
                                                                                          PAGE     4
                                                                                          SI 975

                 more and more tight and with it being a hot day,        things were beginning

                 to get really uncomfortable.



                       stood this until about 2.55pm (1455), when it was now really bad

                 with the tight packing and we were being pushed against the barrier

                 that we were standing by. We started looking round and noticed that

                 the pen No 2 which was on our right was very loose with none of the

                 tightness and pushing that was going on in our pen, also at this

                 time I was becoming very concerned for my own safety and that of the

                 two kids that were still with us. We then decided to make our way to

                 the fence which separated the pens 2 and 3 . When we finally got

                 there we began^climbing over,      it was now just before 3pm (15QQ),

                   cause    I saw that the players were on the pitch.



                 We all managed to get over the fence and I saw that other supporters

                 were doing thjl same. Once     in the other pen we found we had that much

                 room I couldf have had a break dance without      torching anyone,

                 back and indicating to the supporters U K g e t   back.   I then noticed

     v-                       ----------- -------
                 appear ed to be being crushed into the fence at the fro nt. I d o n ’t know

                 what was    really causing   it, except they were all   packed in like

                 sardines.    There was shouting,   screaming and it looked awful,    horrible

                 so much that    its hard to describe.



                 P e o p l e ’s faces werg/being squashed into the fence a nd there were hands

                 raised up in the air. People were gasping for breath.

             I c oul dn’t really believe what    I was looking at and it took some time

             for   it to sink    in that people were being crushed.           said,   "L e t ’s

             do something,      le t ’s help." We started to try and lift people up from

             the bottom of the fence up and over into Pen 2, but it was hard

             because of the spikes on top.



             We t ^ ied to help others that had got onto the top of the fence. A few

               inutes after Police     came into Pen 2 near the centre fence and told us

              to get gack away from the fence. We pushed him aside and carried on

             what we were d o i n g , which was thelping people.
\
             We helped a old lad and a young one over and into Pen 2 and then onto

              the pitch. These two were unconscious.      I d o n ’t know what happened

              to them.   I d o n ’t know what they were wearing.



    /f'yfS    We then saw other supporters     ripping down advert boards and helping

              people by carrying them. We decided to help do this.

              We carried 3-4 away like this from near to Pen 3 over to the gym,

              Th^re were Police Officers there who were giving mouth to m o u t h
              /
             /resuscitation to some of the bodies.

(2 j
             After a while things began to calm down once everybody realised what

             had happened and things became more organised.



             Once there was nothing else for us to do we just walked round trying

              not to believe what we had seen.



             When I saw the people being      crushed in the front right hand corner of

             Pen 3 I remember      climbing up the fence myself at the front of Pen 2

             and I could see quite clearly the wire mesh fence at the front of Pen
                                                                               PAGE     h

        3 bowing with the pressure of people against        it.   When there was

                ing more for me to do I left the ground of my own accord.     I

         c a n ’t remember any loud speaker announcements other than Kenny

         DALGLISH.     I w a s n ’t injured at the match.



         In A y   view the trouble was    caused by lack of communication between

           lice Officers outside and inside, when they knew the middle        pen was

         full     they should have   closed the tunnel and made people go to the

         outside routes to the other       pens.

            On Saturday 15th April            1989 (150489)    together with an organised party

            of Liverpool Supporters            I went to the Semi-Final    between Liverpool and

            Nottingham Forest held at Hillsborough Football Ground,               Sheffield.



            We arrived in Sheffield around 2.00 pm (1400) and the coach driver let

            some of us get off the coach about a quarter of a mile away from the

            g roun d.



            We arrived at the ground at around 2.15 pm (1413) and went to the

            Leppings Lane entrance and through the turnstiles.                I was searched by

            the Police and allowed through with no problems.



            We went through the tunnel           under the West Stand and went to the right
                                                                       PAGE
                                                                       S197SA

at the end into what I now know to be Pen 3.



We went towards the front of the terraces just in front of the barrier

that later broke.     At first it was great with the crowd surging back

and forwards and from side to side.



However,   as time went on I noticed    that it was getting really packed

and it was getting really uncomfortable.      We stood there until about

the time the players    came out and then decided for our own safety to

make our way towards the Pen to the right.       It took us some time to

get there because of the crush but      eventually got there and then

climbed over the fence    into Pen 2,   where there was much more room    to

move about.    The game had now started and I could see Police Officers

standing on the other side of the perimeter fence      in front of Pen 3,

shouting and indicating to the supporters to move back.       Some fans

tried to climb over the perimeter fence and the Police      pushed them

back.   I thought at the time it was a pitch invasion like the Police

but quickly realised people were getting hurt and getting squashed

against the front perimeter fence.



It seemed a long time before the Police began to       act and start

pulling people out.



When they did they came into Pen 2 and started to pull the fans over

and we also helped them.



My frustration was the delay in the Police taking proper action and

their total   lack of communication.



I make no specific    complaint against any individual officer but was

         concerned with the overall   policing,

 TRAINED PEOPLE THERE TO DEAL WITH THE CASUALTIES.

 GOT WORSE, & I JUST KEPT MOVING TOWARD THE RIGHT.

 <345 •
 DID YOU WITNESS ANY CROWD SURGE,   IF SO, DO YOU KNOW WHAT CAUSED

 IT? (BRIEFLY)

 IT WAS NOT WHAT I WOULD DESCRIBE AS A SURGE,   IT WAS MORE JUST A GRADUAL

 BUILD UP OF PEOPLE & IT WAS GETTING TIGHTER & TIGHTER.


Q16

 G46

 WERE YOU INJURED,   IF SO, DID YOU ATTEND HOSPITAL IN SHEFFIELD?

 NO.

»
 DID YOU WITNESS ANY DEATHS?

 NO.

 Q48

 DID YOU ASSIST ANYONE WHO WAS DEAD OR INJURED,   IF SO, BRIEFLY EXPLAIN.

 NO.


Q17

 G49

 DID YOU WITNESS ANYTHING THAT YOU CONSIDER WAS A FACTOR IN THE

J J t HS, OR THE INJURIES TO ANY PERSON?

YES,   I FEEL THAT THE SECTIONAL FENCES CAUSED A LOT OF THE PROBLEM ON

THE DAY.    IF THEY WEREN'T THERE PEOPLE WOULD HAVE BEEN ABLE TO SPREAD

OUT OVER THE TERRACING.

G50

WHAT TIME DID YOU LEAVE THE FOOTBALL GROUND?

APPROXIMATELY 3.45PM (1545).

<351

DID YOU LEAVE ON THE DIRECTION OF EITHER A POLICE OFFICER, A STEWARD,

A LOUD SPEAKER ANNOUNCEMENT OR OF YOUR OWN ACCORD?
                                                                              PAGE    a

 I LEFT AFTER AN ANNOUNCEMENT OVER THE TANNOY,


Q 18

 052

 DID YOU WITNESS ANYTHING THAT YOU CONSIDER TO BE A CRIMINAL OFFENCE?

 NO.

 G53

 DO YOU HAVE ANY VIEWS OR OBSERVATIONS ON THE WAY THE INCIDENT WAS

 HANDLED, AFTER THE MATCH WAS STOPPED?

 I WAS STANDING IN THE AREA TO THE RIGHT OF THE GOAL AS YOU LOOK AT THE

 PITCH & ALL THE PEOPLE IN THERE WERE ARGUING OBVIOUSLY WANTING THE GAME

9      RESTART & OTHERS WERE SAYING THE GAME SHOULD BE ABANDONED.   I COULD

 SEE PEOPLE AT THIS TIME LYING ON THE PITCH SOME WHO WERE OBVIOUSLY DEAD.

 THERE WERE A LOT OF POLICEMEN WHO HAD DISCARDED THEIR HELMETS & WERE ALL

 EITHER ON THE FENCE OR BY THE FENCE DOING THE BEST THEY COULD TO HELP.

 I DID SEE THE POLICEMEN ACROSS THE MIDDLE OF THE PITCH BUT I REALISED THEY

 WERE THERE FOR A REASON.

 G54

 IS THERE ANYTHING THAT YOU WISH TO ADD WHICH YOU FEEL IS VITAL TO THIS

 JUDICIAL INQUIRY?

 i ^ M A I N CONCERN IS THE SECTIONAL FENCING, IF THIS HAD NOT BEEN THERE THEN

 THE FANS WOULD HAVE HAD PLENTY OF ROOM TO SPREAD OUT.

 I ALSO FEEL THAT SOMEBODY SHOULD HAVE BEEN AT THE ENTRANCE TO THE TUNNEL

 TO STOP FANS COMING IN AS IT WAS WELL OVER CAPACITY BY 2.40PM (1440).

 WHEN I ARRIVED AT THE GROUND I SAT ON THE WALL IN LEPPINGS LANE WITH MY

 FRIEND I                   I, WE WERE SITTING THERE FOR ABOUT 1 1/2 (ONE AND

 A HALF) HOURS & ALL THAT TIME THERE WERE FANS COKING PAST US ASKING FOR

 TICKETS, IT WAS QUITE EVIDENT THAT THERE WERE/GUITE A FEW HUNDRED WITHOUT

 TICKETS.    I SAW A TOUT 'IN LEPPINGS LANE ACROSS THE ROAD ON THE OTHER SIDE

OF THE ENTRANCE TO WHERE I WAS SITTING A. HE APPEARED TO HAVE A HANDFUL OF

TICKETS & THERE WAS A RUSH OF FANS TOWARDS HIM, THE POLICE STARTED TO MOVE
                                                                          PAGE    9

 TOWARD HIM & HE RAN OFF & THE FANS RAN AFTER HIM.

 WHEN *I ENTERED THE GROUND THROUGH THE TURNSTILE IT WAS THE ONE ON THE FAR

 RIGHT, THERE WERE 3 OR A- LADS IN FRONT OF ME AND I AM PRETTY CERTAIN THAT

 THEY DIDN’T HAVE TICKETS & PAID CASH TO ENTER THE GROUND.   I ACTUALLY

 OVERHEARD THEM ASK A POLICEMAN IF WE COULD GO AND GET IN, & HE TOLD THEM TO

 SEE THE MAN ON THE GATE.

1) WHEN THE FANS WERE TRYING^ TO GET OUT THE POLICE KEPT CLOSING THE GATES

AT THE FRONT OF THE PENS.     THEN A FIRE OFFICER CAME OVER TO THE POLICEMAN

AT THE GATE TO PEN 3 AND TOLD THE POLICEMAN TO OPEN IT.                  THE POLICEMAN THEN

OPENED IT BUT TRIED TO CLOSE IX AGAIN.       THE FIREMAN THEN TOLD THE POLICEMAN

TO GO AWAY AND OPENED THE GAl           CAT'      1&UC*£.               A T                ^   0    £

THESE PEOPLE OUT.     ALOT OF FANS WERE CLIMBING OUT OF PEN AND OVER THE SIDE

FENCE, BUT PEN 3 SEEMED EVEN M<|>RE PAfcKED AND PEOPLE HAD PROBLEMS CLIMBING

2) WH£N I WAS BY THE GOAL AREA THERE WERE ALOT OF DOCTORS AND MEDICAL PEOPLE

TRYING TO HELP.     BUT THEY HAD NO EQUIPMENT.     THE $AS BOTTLES WERE EMPTY AND

THEY HAD NO OXYGEN.

Q54

IS THERE ANYTHING THAT YOU WISH TO ADD WHICH YOU FEEL IS VITAL TO THIS

j(®ECAL INQUIRY?

•1) THERE SHOULD BE MORE ENTRANCES TO FOOTBALL GROUNDS IN GENERAL. IF THERE

WERE MORE ENTRANCES THEN PEOPLE WOULD BE SPREAD OUT MORE AND THERE WOULDN’T

BE SUCH A CROWD IN ONE PLACE.

2) FOOTBALL GROUNDS IN GENERAL ARE TOO OLD AND CRAMPED.                  THERE IS A NEED FOR

NEWER LARGER STADIUMS.

NORMAL, THERE APPEARED TO BE TOO MANY PEOPLE IN THE PEN AND WERE APPARENTLY

CRUSHED AGAINST EACH OTHER, THEY WERE AS ONE MASS OF PEOPLE TIGHTLY PACKED

TOGETHER.

 I ASSISTED IN PULLING A NUMBER OF PEOPLE UPWARDS FROM THE STAND BELOW.


G17

Q49

DID YOU WITNESS ANYTHING THAT YOU CONSIDER WAS A FACTOR IN THE DEATHS, OR THE

 INJURIES TO ANY PERSON?

T ® PEOPLE AT THE FRONT OF THE PENS WERE UNABLE TO GET OUT BECAUSE OF THE

CLOSED GATES.     EVEN THOUGH PEOPLE WERE PULLED OUT OF THE TERRACE, IT SEEMED TO

TAKE A LONG WHILE BEFORE THE SITUATION BELOW STARTED TO EASE.

WHAT TIME DID YOU LEAVE THE FOOTBALL GROUND?

4.45 PM (1645).

Q51

DID YOU LEAVE ON THE DIRECTION OF EITHER A POLICE OFFICER, A STEWARD, A

LOUDSPEAKER ANNOUNCEMENT OR OF YOUR OWN ACCORD?

THERE WAS A LOUDSPEAKER ANNOUNCEMENT FOR FANS TO REMAIN IN THE GROUNDS TO
                                                                           PAGE    8

ASSIST IF POSSIBLE WITH THOSE INJURED.     THERE WAS NOT ANOTHER ANNOUNCEMENT,

BUT I WAS LATER TOLD, I BELIEVE     IT MAY HAVE BEEN A POLICE OFFICER, THAT THERE

WAS NOTHING ELSE I COULD DO AND     USHERED OUT OF THE GROUND.


G18

G52
 DID YOU WITNESS ANYTHING THAT YOU CONSIDER TO BE A CRIMINAL OFFENCE?

 NO.

 G53
DO YOU HAVE ANY VIEWS OR OBSERVATIONS ON THE WAY THE INCIDENT WAS HANDLED,

 AFTER THE MATCH WAS STOPPED?

 -fll POLICE AND STEWARDS ON THE MATCH PERIMETER DID NOT APPEAR TO RECOGNISE

 THE PROBLEM QUICKLY ENOUGH.    IT WAS NOT UNTIL THE MATCH WAS STOPPED DID THE

 OFFICIALS BECOME AWARE AND MADE    ATTEMPTS TO HELP THOSE IN THE PENS.

 Q54
 IS THERE ANYTHING THAT YOU WISH TO ADD WHICH YOU FEEL IS VITAL TO THIS

 JUDICIAL INQUIRY?
 I WOULD LIKE TO POINT OUT THAT FROM MY VIEWING POINT ABOVE THE TERRACES, I HAD

 A CLEAR VIEW TO THE SIDES, AWAY FROM THE PENS BELOW.     THERE WAS PLENTY OF

 ROOM IN THOSE AREAS THAT COULD HAVE BEEN USED IF SOME FANS HAD BEEN DIRECTED

 Ui^pl ENTERING THROUGH THE TURNSTILES.

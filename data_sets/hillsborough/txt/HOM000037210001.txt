HILLSBOROUGH

Here is a first draft of an oral statement for you to work on. On present plans I would
like to get a draft to the Home secretary for next weekend. I am out of the office
Monday - Wednesday, but Peter Edmundson should be able to field any comments
in my absence.

DRAFT:              13 JUNE 1997



DRAFT ORAL STATEMENT FOR THE HOME SECRETARY



With permission, Madam Speaker, I would like to make a statement about the
Hillsborough Stadium disaster.


2.        It is now more than eight years since the disaster on 15 April 1989. But no
one who saw the news reports on that dreadful Saturday will have forgotten those
terrible events. For those who lost loved members of their family, the memories are
even more painful. We all felt then that we must do all in our power to prevent
anything like the events of that appalling day happening again.


3.        A Public Inquiry by Lord Taylor was immediately established. The terms of
reference of the Inquiry were not only to enquire into the events but to make
recommendations about crowd control and safety at sports events. The Inquiry took
oral evidence from over 170 witnesses at public hearings during May and June 1989
and considered many hours of video evidence from different sources. In his interim
report in August 1989 he found that there were a number of causes for the disaster.
He did not attribute all the blame to a single cause or person, but in paragraph 278
he made clear that:


            “The main reason for the disaster was the failure of police control”


4.        Lord Taylor made 43 immediate recommendations. His final report in January
1990 made a further 76 recommendations. The developments which have taken
place since then in safety at football grounds and in the policing of football matches
have been based largely on those recommendations. Football in this country has
been transformed since the Taylor Report. To a large extent that is due to his wide-
reaching and soundly based conclusions.

5.        The deaths which occurred on 15 April 1989 were the subject of inquests
conducted by the Coroner of the western district of South Yorkshire.


6.        An inquest is a fact-finding inquiry to establish answers to four important
questions. They are:


           The identity of the deceased


           The place of death


           The time and the date of death and


           How the deceased came by his or her death


7.        The Coroner’s rules require proceedings and evidence to be directed solely at
finding answers to those questions.


8.        The jury examining the evidence found that the cause of death for those who
died at Hillsborough was accidental death.


9.        There was a further investigation conducted by the West Midlands Police,
supervised by the Police Complaints Authority, to establish whether there were any
grounds for criminal proceedings. That investigation also considered whether any
police officer should be subject to disciplinary proceedings.


10.       That investigation involved the taking of over 5000 statements and the
scrutiny of all the material which had previously been examined by the Taylor
Inquiry.         After that investigation the evidence was sent to the Director of Public
Prosecutions, who concluded that no person should be subject to criminal
proceedings. The Police Complaints Authority decided that the senior officers in
charge on the day should face disciplinary charges for neglect of duties.          In the



f:\oppu\hou\drafts\pp0232pd.doc
event, Chief Superintendent Duckenfield retired due to ill health in advance of a
ruling by a disciplinary tribunal. The Police Complaints Authority later decided that
disciplinary proceedings against Mr Duckenfield’s deputy should be withdrawn
because the retirement of Mr Duckenfield meant that what, in effect, was a joint
allegation of neglect of duty could not be fairly heard in the absence of the more
senior officer.


11.        It is well known that some of the families of those who died were unhappy
with the verdict of the inquest. They later applied for judicial review of the coroner’s
proceedings. During the judicial review proceedings the conduct of the inquest was
subjected to close and detailed examination.          The court ruled that none of the
matters raised in the judicial review proceedings justified intervention by the court in
the verdict of the inquest.


12.        The events surrounding the disaster have therefore been subject to
exceptionally thorough investigation on several occasions.          But concerns have
remained about whether the full facts have yet emerged. I have met relatives of the
Hillsborough victims. I know that they believe passionately that there are unresolved
issues which should be investigated further.


13.         Representations have been made to me and my predecessor, to the Attorney
General and to the Director of Public Prosecutions.              A Granada television
programme in December dramatised the disaster and raised a number of issues
which, in the view of the programme makers, presented new evidence about the
disaster.          Since that time further material has been submitted on behalf of the
Hillsborough Family Support Group.              Those representations have related in
particular to video evidence of the disaster and medical evidence about the time of
death of the victims.


14.         My department, the office of the Attorney General and the Crown Prosecution
Service have considered very carefully all the evidence which has been put forward




f:\oppu\hou\drafts\pp0232pd.doc
in recent months. We have been unable to find anything which we consider would
have materially affected the outcome of any of the investigations into the disaster.


15.        Much of the evidence which has been put forward concerns matters which
were fully addressed by the previous investigations. For example, the Granada
television programme suggested that there were ten unresolved questions about the
disaster.         I am satisfied that all those ten questions were fully considered by the
Taylor Inquiry, and in relation to eight of them specific recommendations were made.


16.        I have not so far received any evidence which would lead me to conclude that
a new public inquiry should be established.              Similarly, the Director of Public
Prosecutions considers that none of the material which has been made available
would justify fresh criminal investigations.        The Attorney General takes a similar
view in relation to the possibility of applying to the High Court for a new inquest.


17.        However, I want to ensure that no matter of significance is overlooked and
that we do not come to a conclusion without a full and independent examination of
the evidence.


18.        The Attorney General, the Director of Public Prosecutions and I have
therefore agreed that the representations which have been put forward should be
subject to independent scrutiny. We are therefore appointing Lord Justice Stuart -
Smith, a senior Lord Justice of the Court of Appeal, to consider all the available
evidence and to report to us.           His terms of reference are: [to be inserted after
agreement between Ministers.]


19.        We have asked Lord Justice Stuart-Smith to examine all the written and other
evidence which has been submitted.             He will also consider any further material
which interested parties wish to submit. There will be an opportunity for interested
parties to make representations to him if he considers that necessary to enable him
to form a view. His task will be to provide advice on the basis of his independent




f:\oppu\hou\drafts\pp0232pAdoc
consideration of the evidence.        This will not be a Public Inquiry.    However, I
undertake to make public the advice which he gives under this terms of reference.


20.        I hope that this examination will enable us to establish conclusively that no
material evidence has been overlooked in establishing the causes of the disaster.

           THE HILLSBOROUGH STADIUM DISASTER

           Thank you for copying me your letter of 5 June to the Attorney General setting out
           your proposals for an independent examination into the alleged new evidence
           concerning the Hillsborough disaster.

           Such an examination would seem to be a sensible way of addressing continuing
           public concern. I have no objections either to your proposed terms of reference or
           to your preference for a judge to lead the examination.

           Copies of this letter go to the Prime Minister, the Deputy Prime Minister, the Lord
           Chancellor, the President of the Council, the Minister W ithout Portfolio, the
           Attorney General, the Director of Public Prosecutions and Sir Robin Butler.




                                                                               THE RT HON CHRIS SMITH MP

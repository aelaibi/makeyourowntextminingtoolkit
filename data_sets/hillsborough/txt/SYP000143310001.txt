G35.   IF YOU ATTENDED LAST YEARS SIMILAR MATCH WAS THERE ANYTHING

       SIGNIFICANTLY DIFFERENT WHICH YOU THINK    IS A CONTRIBUTORY FACTOR

       TO THIS DISASTER?    (BRIEFLY EXPLAIN)



       No the arrangements appeared the same even to the point that the

       Leppings Lane end that the Liverpool Supporters used appeared the

       same.   Last year was not so light with people but even last few

       people were pulled up into the seats above.



Q36.   HAVE YOU ANY COMMENTS TO     MAKE ON THE DISTRRIBUTION OF FANS   IN

       THE STANDING AREA TO   THE FRONT OF THE WEST STAND?



       I ^el^ive that the   incoming fans needed to be sheppafded more

       carefully to the end   areas of the terraces.    I did not see the

       build up but I think   the   opening of the gates must have   produced

       the deaths because even the build up outside would not have

       been in such a small area.



G37.   DO YOU HAVE ANY VIEWS ON THE WAY THIS DISASTER WAS CONTROLLED

       FOLLOWING THE RECOGNITION OF THE INCIDENT HAPPENING?



       No
                                                                                  PAGE       8

G38.   IS THERE ANYTHING THAT YOU WISH TO ADD WHICH YOU FEEL IS VITAL

       TO THIS JUDICIAL INQUIRY?



       1 and other directors had to walk around the pitch to our

       supporters to explain what was going on,                there was no public

       address message explaining the disaster and I feel our supporters

       thought      it was a pitch invasion.         Our Supporters    response was

       magrti f i c a n t .   Only one lad from the forest and had to be put

       onto the pitch because he was shocked and suffered from a hole

       in the heart.           I did ask a Policeman why no message was put

       over.      This officer had 2 or 3 pip I'm not sure but I think

       his view was that he didn't want lots of people leaving

       early.       I did not go into deep conversation with him.              I also

       spoke with Liverpool Supporters who were               complaining about     not

       being                                                     /

       allocated the Kop and some showed me a full/ticket that                  indicated

       they had got in without going through the yuurnstile.                  Four others

       a^lso said they had come in the match without tickets and had got

       in.

       In relation on ticket allocation at the same match last year                     it

       seems to work well and the problem to me appears to the pure

       volume of fans arriving without tickets.

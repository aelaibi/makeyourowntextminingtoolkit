  LORD DORMAND'S BILL ON SPORTING EVENTS (CONTROL OF ALCOHOL ETC)



  Thank you for copying to me your letter of the 6 March 1992 to
  John MacGregor about the proposed handling of Lord Dormand's
  Bill.   I am content with the proposed handling although there
  can be no prospect of further progress.



  I am copying this letter to members of LG Committee, the
  Secretary of State for Education and Science, the Minister for
  Sport, First Parliamentary Counsel and to Sir Robin Butler.

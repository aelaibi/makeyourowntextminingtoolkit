 Whilst        I wa s      outside          I did           not    see      any      of    the       big         gates       open       or

 anyone        getting          into      the       ground         by      climbing            over         the       walls.




 Once       inside        the    ground,            I do         not    remember           seeing               any    signs       showing           me

 where        to    go.        I waited         for         my    brother         to      get     into           the    ground          and     then

 we w e n t        and    found where               we w e r e         supposed           to    sit.




 As    we     got       into    the      stand w e saw                 thaj^fne           front         2       rows    of    people          were

 stood        up.        The    g am e    was        1 ry p r q # r e ss .        We      walked            down       to w h e r e      we     were

 supposed           to    sit,     w h i c h was            in    row B,       the        second            row back.              When       I got

 t he r e ,    I could          see      people         climbing            over       the      front            fence,         1 did         not

 know why           until                                    ;ai d t h a t        the      people               in the       pen w e r e        being

people        in t h e r e         must    have        b e e n all     crushed.              It    l o o k e d as         if     everyone

wa s    being       pushed          forward        s l ow l y.




As     I was       looking          into       pen 3     I saw a barrie r                just       buckle           over        a nd    I saw

l oads       of    people          go    forward and            fall    down.           There       were       arms        and        legs

everywhere              and    other       people        on     top    of    the       people       t ha t     ha d       f al l e n .

While        this       was    happening,              I wa s    helping          to    pull       people       up        from        the

pens     below.           As we          pulled        them     up we w e r e          sending          them    to        the     back        to

recover.            Most       of       them were        just       dazed.         One       or    two w e r e        a     bit w o r s e

for w e a r        especially             a young        woman        in her       e a r l y 2 0 5s.           She        wa s

unconscious              when       she    wa s    pulled        up.        We    tried       to    bring       her         round.            She

was     breathing             a l r i g h t but        did    not     open       her    eyes.           One    of     the        committee

members                                   carried        her     to    the       back    of       the     st an d .        When         he

came     ba c k     he    said          I have     given        her    to a St J o h n s            Ambulance              man.          1

then     carried          on       helping        other       people        up    into       the    stands.           The         pen

be 1ow s t a r t e d          to    c 1 ear     a n d we      stopped        pul 1 i ng       peopie          up.     I could                see

on     the    pitch       t ha t        there     were       people     being          given mouth             to     mouth.                 Other

people        were       being          carried        off    on a d v e r t i s i n g       hoardings.




Being        up    in the          s t a n d we    could        not    do m u c h       so we       stayed           there        and

eventually              left       the    g r o u n d at a b o u t      1 6 . 1 0 hrs         (1610)          and w al ke d

towards           the    c i ty     centre.




I think           that    a factor             in the        deaj/ns a n d        injuries          caused was                 that      too

many     people          were       allowed        into/the           pens a nd         initially             the     people            trying

to     climb       out    of       the    pen at        jme     front       were       pushed       b a ck     in.



I think           that    after          the    ma tc h was         stoppers the             p o li c e    were       too        slow

opening           the    emergency             gates.         The     majority          of    the       p o 1 i ce    didn't            do

anything,           they appea r e d              to    be    tot-^Aly       bewildered.                  There       was        no     senior

              of m e d i c a l          and    e m e r g ency     equipment              Eventually          it    turned         up    but m u c h

              too      late.




              A    line       of     police         officers       were        deplayed across             the     p i t c h.      I think

              that      the m a j o r i t y          of    them would , h a v e          been     better       employed           helping       in

              other       places.




              I also          think       t ha t     there was        a    lack       of a n n o u n c e m e n t s i n f o r m i n g     people

              what      was         going      on.        There    were        only S anno un ce me nt s.                One      telling

              people          to     c lear        the    pitch.      The       second       s om e   time     l a ter     by     the

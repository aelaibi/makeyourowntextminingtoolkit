Noel Joseph Wade states


1.   I am employed as the Assistant Chief Ambulance Officer

     (Training) for SYMAS.


2.   My date of birth is 9th December 1956.


3.   My home address is                             IRotherham.



4.   In 1978 I joined SYMAS as an ambulance man at Maltby.        I

     became a qualified ambulance man in 1979 and in 1980 1 moved
     to Rotherham Ambulance Station.      In 1985 I obtained the

     National Health Service Training Authority's Ambulance Aid

     Instructors Certificate and I also did extended training.

     Also in 1985 I did a paramedics course in SYMAS.    At that

     time there was not a national course for paramedics and when

     the national scheme was started in, I think, the following

     year, those people who had done the SYMAS paramedic course
     simply had to pass an exam rather than attend the national

     course.   I was the one exception to that and attended the

     first national paramedic course effectively as a guinea pig.

     From   1987 onwards     I spent roughly half of my time in

     training and was appointed the training officer in 1987.     In

     1988 I was appointed to my present post.


5.   Saturday 15th April was officially a day off but I was

     involved in a training exercise with a group of cadets on
Burbadge Moor.     That exercise finished at about 5.00 p.m.   I

could tell from the messages which 1 could hear over the

radio that there was some form of incident at Hillsborough

and I radioed into control to ask if they needed any help.
I was told to report to the headquarters in Rotherham.



1 arrived at headquarters at about 5.30 p.m. where Mr Smith

briefed me.      He told me that the scene was clear of live

casualties at this stage,      1 saw Mr Page in the ambulance

room and he said that he and 1 would be going to the ground.

We left for the ground at about 5.40 p.m.


We arrived at the ground at 1755 where we saw Mr Hopkins, Mr

Eason, Mr Dale and Mr Jones.    Mr Hopkins briefed Mr Page and

1 and we spoke to the senior policeman in the gym whose name

is Mr Addis.      Mr Addis explained what was to happen about

the bodies.     The bodies were being bagged at this time for

later removal.


We went back to headquarters at 1830.        There was a small

press conference in Mr Page's office at 7.00 p.m. and 1 went

off duty at 7.30 p.m.



Approximately every 2 years a major exercise is planned with

the other emergency services.        The last one was in the

autumn of 1988 and involved the mock up of a train crash at

Doncaster.     Thirty to forty ambulance men from SYMAS were
      involved and there were three or four crews from other

      districts involved as well.   None of the crews knows it is

      an exercise until they arrive at the scene.


10.   We review the SYMAS major incident plan after each mock

      incident plan after each mock incident.       This review is

      carried out by a panel of senior officers.     A copy of the
      major incident plan is kept at each ambulance station.



11.   All recruits are given an overview of the major incident

      plan as part of their inductive training, concentrating upon
      their part in that plan.



12.   When ambulance men go onto full time day duties we hold a

      week's course which 1 run and at that time they all see a

      copy of the complete major incident plan and we discuss

      recent incidents and the way they have been handled by the
      ambulance service.



13.   We had been planning to hold a major incident seminar

      shortly, but, in view of the Hillsborough tragedy this has
      been shelved for the time being.

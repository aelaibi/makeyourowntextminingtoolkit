     Dear Mr Moynihan,
          I am in my         year at                                              and
one of my chosen subjects is Design and communication. For my final
project I am designing a sports/football stadium. I would be very
grateful if you could send me any information on any thing concerning
the design of sports facilities.       I would especially like to know
about safety     and other regulations which would have to be kept to.
  I would be grateful if you would reply promptly as the completed
project is required to be in on 9th March!
                   Thank you for your time,
                              Yours Hopefully,




                                                                 (Miss)

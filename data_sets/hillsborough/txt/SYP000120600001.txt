                             turnstiles          gave     access        to      the    West, S t a n d     seated          area.        Our

                             specific          duties     were       search          fans    and    ch e c k    tickets          for

                             appropriate           colour        coding         for    ground       section          (RED--WEST

                             STAND    SEATS).

            12.30pm          Th e   first       coaches       began       to     arrive       at    this       end    of    the

                             ground.           However      departing            supports          made    their       way,       away
from    th e      ground          towards       Catchbar             Lane       and    Penistone             R o a d,

A steady          increase          in a c t i v i t y      on       the    turnstiles,                mainly

father        and      son    fans,       family          groups.           These       people          were

obviously             here    to    enjoy       what       should          have       been an af t e r n o o n

of    festivity;             jokes       were       shared       between          myself          and       t h e se

fans    and       they       had    no    objections             to       drinking          their       small

bottles          of    pop    before       entering             the       ground.

Any    small          queues       which       built       up at          this    t i me     were       orderly,

with    people          wai t i ng       patiently          for       admittance             to    the       ground,

they    were          in no       hurry    they       had a r ri ve d            in    plenty          of    t im e     to

get    a good          view       from    the       front       of    the       stands.

An    increase           in f a ns       arriving          at    the       Leppings          Lane,          yet

still       no    significant             numbers.              I was       beginning             to    think

that    I was          policing          the    wrong       game,          since       there       seemed          to

foe v e r y      few    fans       around       at    all.           1 remembered             the       days       when

my    dad     would       t a ke    me    to    cup m a t c h e s          at E l l a n d     Ro ad and

Bramall          Lane     a n d we       would       arrive          at    least       an    hour       before

the    game       was     scheduled            to    kick       off;       e v e n at       this       time       th e r e

would       be    large       queues       waiting          to       go    in.

Out    of     nowhere         they       came.        An    ocean          of    red.        Thousands             of

"fans"        arrive         at    our    turnstiles.                 Pressure          was       beginning             to

build.           Impossible          now       it w a s     to       search       fans.           Large

quantities             of a l c o h o l    were       confiscated                not    by s e a r c h i n g ,

since       this       was    not    necessary.                 Boisterous             youths          were       waving

t h e m about,,           Now      there       was    no    organised             queuing.              Th e      only

colleague             I could       see    was       PC    513 FRANCIS                on the       adjacent

turnstile             and a WPC          on my       other       side.

At    this       point       I began       to       fear    for       the       safety       of    people

myself        and      colleagues          included.                 On    six    occasions             I was

completely             lifted       off    of       the    floo r,         and    pinned          against          the

              turnstile           walls.             I tried          to    communicate                  and    restore           some

              order     with       the       public,            but    my    c r ie s       were         drowned        out       by    the

              uncivilised              contingent               before       me.          Youths          of    18 - 2 5     y e ar s

              pushing        and       jostling.                Now    not       o nly      were         the    tickets           waved

              by     them,       red;       t he y     were      brown       a nd      blue         as    well.

              Queues        by    the       minute         are    thickening.                   A    bottle        neck       was

              being     created             as    still         more       fans       arrived            pushing        and

              chant i n g .

              One     could       not       now      communicate             with         these          people        as    they

              continued           to    pus h,         all      the    time       hurling            abuse        and

              critisising              the       'set      up'    an d      crowd         control.              What        was    now

              occurring           could          only      be    described             as    absolute             chaos.

              Between        myself          and       the      WPC    on    turnstile               10 was        a flimsy

              grey     barrier.              Minute          by m i n u t e       increased               pressure           was

              evident        on    this.             People       were       jumping            over       a nd    helping

              people        over       in    order         to    try       and    j um p     q ue ues .           Eventually

              it     just    collapsed               under       the       strain         and       people        fell       to the

              floor.         No    one       attempted            to       help       them      up,       I was        10 yds          away

              an d    could       not       assist.             These       so    called            fans       would        not    even

              help     their       own.           The      reason          not    being         inhumanity              the       reason

              being     t hat      t he y        were      so    d run k ,       t he y     weren't            aware        of what

              was     going       on    around            them.

    2.5 5pm   Mounted        Police          presence            could       not       make         their       wa y    through

              the     swa rm.          Under         normal       circumstances                     order       could        have

              been     restored,             since         policing          was       more         than       adequate.

              However        on    this          occasion         it       was    hopeless;               the     hooligan

              element        amongst             the      supporters             would       not         co-operate.

I made        my way          to    the    front          of    the      terrace        and    it w as          only

then     did       I realise             the    severity            of    the    incident.                Bodies

were     piled       up       in the       gutter          area         beneath       the     bottom        step

of     the    terrace.              Myself       and       another         officer          had      to

physically           throw          people       ou t      of      the w a y     to     get    to     them.

The     first       o n e we        got    to w a s        a woman         in h er       mid      twenties.

She     was    blue       and       had    barely          any      clothes        on.        She     had

obviously           unfastened             clothing             in t he        crush     before

collapsing.               She       was    dead .          We      carried       her     to    the        rear    of

the     West       Stand       where       a St       John's            attendant        took        c ha rge .

We     rushed       back       to    the       front       of      the    stand       and     brought           out

another        casualty,             this       time       a    slightly         older        woman        than       the

first.         We    carried             her    to    the       rear      of    the     West      St and where

another        St    John's          attendant             t o ok       over.      We    returned           to

carry        out    another          three       or       f ou r    people       not     knowing           whether

they     were       dead       or    alive.           No t      much      attention           wa s    paid       to

the     removal          of    these       people,             I did      not    have       time      to    observe,

I just        had    to       get    ba ck      to    relieve            more     people       from        the

horrific           macabre          scenes       on       the      terraces.

It     seemed       strange          that       the       pitch was            o n l y a f e w yard?, a w a y v'

and     that       why    could          they    not       be      carried       to     there.            The

reason        being       that       it w a s        difficult            to    get     people        up a n d        over

the     fences,           In the          meantime             police      officers           and     other

emergency           services             began       to    try and         rip     down       sections           of

t he    fence,       in a n a t t e m p t            to    release         the     trapped           fans.

Once     there       was       a way       through             o nt o    the    pit ch,       X climbed           out

onto     the       cinder          perimeter, t r a c k             and    continued           to     pull       people

free     from       the       nightmare          they          were      experiencing.

For     some       it was          far    too    late.             Everything           paled        into

                         i              out.

                                         I can      remember         very       little       detail        of     the      remainder              of    the

                                         afternoon,                I carried          injured        and    deceased              on a d v e r t i s i n g

                                         boards,        ripped       down       by    'concerned*           fans        across          the

                                         returned        to    the      s c e n e ; never         once     staying          with        a    particular

                                         when      it w a s    apparent          that       the    ground         had      been      emptied,            due

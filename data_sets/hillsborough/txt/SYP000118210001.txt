game.       I saw several         small    groups        of supporters           from both side?              who

were w a ndering        in the H i l l s b o r o u g h    park area.

As the morning          p r ogressed the        crowd built            up,    and    I saw groups            of

Liverpool        fans who were        the worse          for    drink,       with    cans       of beer etc,

who were        u r inating along       the    side      of terraced houses               in Parkside

Road,     adjacent      to the H i l l s b o r o u g h    park.

By around        12 noon time        it was a l r e a d y quite           crowded with groups                 of

supporters        who were       the Worse      for      drink    but     it was hard to e s t ablish

w hich    side    they sup p o r t e d due to both teams                  having      the       same    coloured

At 2 ,00     pm that      date    I made my way to the ground,                       to take my meal,,

w a l k e d along Penis tone'Road,             to an entrance             near      the N orth Stand,,

The    crowd at      side    of the ground, was            quite       noisy but        over all         well,

behaved,.        It was     obvious     that    due      to the general             smell       in the

t u rnstiles area,          that most      of the        fans    had been drinking,,

I had my        lunch   in the GYM at Hills b o r o u g h ,             and made my way                back to

H i l l s b o r o u g h Park area via the L a p p i n g s Lane               end of the ground,,

At 2.30      pm I w a l k e d    passed,      the L e p p i n g s Lane        turnstiles          where there

was    quite a large         crowd within         the     penned area on the                outside       of the

t u r nstile s .    The     c rowd was     push i ng and ve ry no i sy at                 t hat    t irne and

several     youths      were     climbing      over      the    high perimeter            wall     above      the

turnstiles.         I saw quite a number                 of uniform officers                and mounted

officers who were            trying     to keep the            crowd from        pushing         but   the    crow

paid     little    notice       to their      instructions            or directions.              I continued

As    I walked along         I was    constantly asked                if I had spare             ticket      for

the game.         The   fans who asked a p p e a r e d           to be from the Liverpool                     area

I turned off Leppings. Lane                into P a r k s i d e       Road.      I saw quite a number

of fans     climbing        trees and onto walls                etc    in a n . a t t e m p t    to gain a

I ret u r n e d to the H i1 1s b o r oug h P a r k / pa rk         s i d e y are a a s my no rm a 1 d u t y «

i became aware              of the     problems at the        ground      by the number        of

a mb u l a n c e    vehicles      speeding       to the ground.           I received a radio

message        to at t e n d     the GYM at the ground and                it became      obvious     that

a major        incident        had took      place.

I ran to the ground and                   into the gym via an entrance                  on Penistone

Rd,      On arrival         at    the GYM the       first    three    or four bodies           had been

1 a i d out.         Over      the    p eri o d o f w ha t-m u s t have   b e e n the    n e t hou r or s o

their      seemed to           be an endless flow of dead avid injured bodies                       being

b rou g h t i n by fans and Police o f f i c e r s / a m b u Ia n c e m e n .

At    first        it was      impossible        to know how man y dead there was               therefore

tables and           chairs were m oved to make              space and attempts were made                      to

a s s emble        the bodies        in some     order and     identify them.

1 looked around and saw Police officers trying to resusitate fans

etc.       every one seemed              to be stunned and shocked and several                      fellow

The    instruction was               given that as an officer              brought      i n a body or

took     charge       of a body        brought     in by fans that          officer w ould then be

W h e n all        bodies were        * in order      * I was    instructed       to attend

I was at           that   location for most           of the evening with a constant                   stream

of    reports        to be taken.          The    room was a quite          large,      recently

modernised        room and well             set out for         the   task    it was     picked to be

used    for,    a l t h o u g h at    first       there were      not enough telephones                but

T e l e c o m engineers        set up further lines..

T h r o u g h out the        evening        I also a t t e n d e d at the Boys         Club adjacent          to

H a m m e r t o n Rd,   e s c o r t i n g various       families      to the welfare          officers

etc.      The Boys          club was quite             busy but taking        into account         the    number

of    people     involved          I think the         social    services and helpers             did a

sterling       job with the help given to the                         families.

I briefly a t t e n d e d at the Forbes Rd Chapel,                        with a uniform           I nsp Ho gars

I was     finally stood down by C I Agar who                           I believe was        i nstructed          by

I ended my duty              at    1 .3 0 am Sun d a y       16 April     at fe.ccIesfie1d             Police

Station.

1‘ returned home             that morning          to my wife and tried to explain the

events      of the day but            I found that words               could not express what                had

happened.



                                        I                                        found myself           increasingly

media     coverage          of the events and found                it hard to believe            that     the

S u n d a y m o r n i n g pa p ers    s h o wed    p i c t u r e s of obvi.au s 1y d e a d / d y i n g f a n s ,

whe n at that time             few of the dead were                identified.          I just     think      of

parents who did not                 know    if their        loved ones were dead or not,                  being

c csn f r o n t e d by a f u 1 1 col o u r p i c t u r e i n t h e press.

The    body that           I was    deputed       to    in the Gym at H i l l s b o r o u g h was

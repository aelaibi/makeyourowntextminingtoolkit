                  At    9.00       a.m.       on    Saturday,         15th          April,       1989,       I    commenced          duty       at

                  Hammerton             Road       Police      Station,             Sheffield,          in       connection          with       the     Semi-

                  Final        Cup      match       Liverpool         v Nottingham               Forest           to    be    played       at    the

                  Sheffield             Wednesday            Football          Ground.

                  Together             with       other      C.I.D.       officers,             I attended             the    ground       where        at

                  9.45        a.m.      we    assembled            ready       for    a    briefing          at    10.00          a.m.    by    senior

      'iw         the        ground       about        11.30       a.m.        Also       deployed       in       the    team       were       Detective

A zr'L-           back        pocket         of    his      trousers.

                  Initially,              I was        on    foot    in    plain          clothes       in       the    vicinity          of    the

                  area        at    the      rear      of    the    South       Stand       respectively.                    At    this    time        the

area       was       very       quiet        with       a       number       of       supporters             gathering                about       the

outermost             entrance              gates       and       the       wall       of    the       bridge       adjacent                and

parallel             to    the       river-         Restricting                   access          to    the       car       park,          was    a

series          of    free-standing                    barriers             manned          by    uniformed             Police,

In    the       locality             there        was       plenty          of    uniformed             Police          presence                both       at

the       turnstiles              and       in    Lappings             Lane       itself,          where          the       reception             of

supporters                arriving           by    coaches             and       on    buses       was       being          supervised                by

I.n s p e ^ t c n ^ J 3 y k e s      of     ’F 2 ’ .

Even       at    this          early        stage,          a    number          of    Liverpool             supporters                approached

the       ground          drinking           beer       and       soft       drinks          from       cans       which          in       the    main

were       discarded              on      the     floor          or    as    they          approached             the       turnstiles                to

gain       entry          to    the       ground,           in    containers                which       I noticed                had       been

positioned                by    Police           Officers             directly             outside          the    turnstile                area.

Certainly,                anything           containing                alcohol             was    either          disposed             of,       drunk

or    otherwise,                by     fans       before          they       entered             the    ground,             no    doubt

anticipating                   that       they     would          be    searched.

Probably             around          1.30        p.m.       the       numbers          of    supporters             in       the       Lappings

Lyane a r e a         had       increased              significantly.                       Many       people       were          stood          about

the       footpaths             throughout              the       length          of       Leppings          Lane       and       a    large

number          of    them        were       continuing                asking          others          if    they       had       any       football

tickets          for       sale        to    enable             them    to       see       the    match.           Clearly,                there

were       literally              several          hundreds             of       people          who    had       arrived             in

Sheffield             without             tickets           for       the    game          and    there       was       a    ready          market

for       those       who       I saw        selling             spare       tickets             which       were       quickly             snapped

up,

A    steady          stream          of     fans       were       walking             towards          the    ground             both       from       the

Middlewood                Road       and     Wads'iey B r i d g e                directions             and       the       area       at       the

Leppings             Lane       end       was     becoming             fairly          congested.                 Looking             towards          the

turnstiles,                I    could        only       see       the       top       of    one    Police          helmet             and       the    top

of    a    flat       Police           cap,       but       faces       were          obscured          by    the       height             of    the

     crowd.           On    a       high       wall       adjacent             to       and     partitioning                various

     turnstiles,                youths          had       ciimfaed            to    the       top    and      were         making       their          way

     perilously             towards             a    further             wall       above          the    actual           turnstiles            where

     uniformed             Inspector                Bennett             *F1 * , w a s         assisting           them          and    no    doubt

     alleviating                a    dangerous                situation             that       they       were        putting          themselves              in

     By    about       2.40          p.m.       the       crowd          situation             was       hectic        to       say    the     least,

     there       were       hundreds,                tmjursarids              of    supporters               walking            along       Leppings

     Lane    towards                the    entrances                where          there        seemed        nowhere            for    them       to

     go.     Around             eight          mounted             Police          Officers          were        attempting             to     form        a

     barrier          with          their       horses             through          the       solid       hords        of       people       cramming

      owards          the       turnstiles                and       Police          Constable             SuKton           from       Hammerton

s/   Road,       who       drove          up    outside             the       Leppings             Lane      entrances            in a       F5o l i c e

     Land    Rover,             was       appealing                through          the       v e h i c l e ’s    loud          hailer       system

     for    the       crowd          to    stop          surging             forwards          as    people           were       being       crushed

     at    the    turnstiles.                       In    spite          of    innumerable                requests,              the    crowd

     continued             to       move       unrelentingly                   in       the    direction              of    the       entrances.

     Such    was       the          volume          of    people             that       any     pick-pocket                observations                were

     now    useless             and       at    Detective                Sergeant             S m i t h ’s    instruction,                  together

     with    Detective                Constable                Lindsay             and       others       engaged           on    the       same

     duties,          I made          rny w a y          to    the       junction             of    Vere     Road          and    Leppings

     Lane.        We       continued                to    walk          down       Vere       Road       towards           Penistone          Road         and

     several          residents                were       clearly             annoyed          and       remonstrating                 with     youths

     who    had       obviously                been       urinating                in    a    passageway.                  In    fact,       without

     exception,             every          passageway                   on    the       ground       side        of    Vere; R o a d         had       been

     used    a    number             of    times          by       unknown          persons          relieving              themselves.

     Staining          of       urine          was       all       over       the       walls       and      floors         of    the       passageways

     With    Detective                Sergeant                Smith          and    Detective             Constable              Lindsay,          I

     continued             to       the    ground             at    a    time       when       several           dog       handlers          with       dogs

     began       to    assemble                at    the       top       of    the       access          path     to       the    pitch        between

     the    Spion          Hop       and       the       North          Stand.           They,       shortly           after,          moved
      towards      the    pitch.

      About    3.00      p.m.    or    thereabouts,            within     five       minutes       of   entering     th e

      gymnasium         sited    inside      the    ground,.        I was      instructed          with    other    Police

      Officers         present    to    clear      an    area      to   make    way    for    the       reception    of     a

      number      of   fatalities        from      the    Leppings        Lane       end.     An    area    was    cleared

      Police      Officers,       I was      engaged          in   helping      to    process       the    property       of

  REPORT
Statement of Stephen LIT.LEY DC 491

I am a Detective Constable in the South Yorkshire Police at present stationed
at Hammerton Road Police Station, Sheffield.

At 9.0.am., on Saturday, 15th April, 1989* X commenced duty at Hammerton Road
Police Station, Sheffield, in connection with the Semi-Final Cup match Liverpool
v. Nottingham Forest to be played at the Sheffield Wednesday Football Ground.

Together with other CUD police officers, I attended the ground where at 9*^5*am.
we assembled ready for a briefing at 10.0am. by senior officers. Following this,
in accordance with an Operations Order governing the proposed game, in company
with Detective Sergeant Smith and Detective Constable Lindsay - both F.2. CID -
and being part of a pick-pocket team, I made my way to the Leppings Lane end
of the ground about 11.30.ara. Also deployed in the team were Detective Sergeant
McSloy, Detective Constables Locking, Lawrence and Hallam, all F.1. CID., with
the latter officer having a wallet alarm in his back pocket of his trousers.

Initially, I was on foot in plain clothes in the vicinity of the turnstyles and
driveway leading to the terracing and main car parking area at the rear of the
South stand, respectively. At this time the area was very quiet with a number
of supporters gathering about the outer most entrance gates and the wall of
the bridge adjacent and parralel to the river.   Restricting access to the car
park, was a series of free-standing barriers manned by uniformed police.

In the locality, there were plenty of uniformed Police presence both at the
turnstyles and in Leppings Lane itself where the reception of supporters
arriving by coaches and on buses was being supervised by Inspector Sykes of
F.2.

Even at this early stage, a number of Liverpool supporters approached the
ground drinking beer and soft drinks from cans which in the main were disgard-
ed on the floor or as they approached the turnstyles to gain entry to the
ground, in containers which I noticed had been positioned by police officers
directly outside the turnstyle area.   Certainly, anything containing alcohol
was either disposed of - drunk or otherwise - by fans before they entered the
ground no doubt anticipating that they would be searched.

Probably around 1.30.pn., the numbers of supporters in the Leppings Lane area
had increased significantly. Many people were stood about the footpaths
throughout the length of Leppings Lane and a large number of them were
continuing asking others if they had any football tickets for sale to enable
them to see the match. Clearly, there were literally several hundreds of
people who had arrived in Sheffield without tickets for the game and there
was a ready market for those who I saw selling spare tickets which were
quickly snapped up.

        A steady stream of fans were walking towards the ground both from the Middlewood
        Road and Wadsley Bridge directions and the area at the Leppings Lane end was
        becoming fairly congested. Looking towards the turnstyles, I could only see the
        top of one police helmet and the top of a flat police cap but faces were
        obscured by the height of the crowd.      On a high wall adjacent to and
        partitioning various turnstyles, youths had climbed to the top and were making
        their way perilously towards a farther wall above the actual turnstyles where
        uniformed Inspector Bennett (F.1.) was assisting them and no doubt aleviating
        a dangerous situation that they were putting themselves.

        By about 2.40.pm., the crowd situation was hectic to say the least.        There were
        hundreds, thousands of supporters walking along Leppings Lane towards the
        entrances where there seemed nowhere for them to go. Around eight mounted
        Police officers were attempting to form a barrier with their horses through
        the solid hords of people cramming towards the turnstyles and Police Constable
        Buxton from Hammerton Road, who drove up to outside the Leppings Lane entrances
        in a Police Landrover, was appealing through the vehicles loud-hailer system for
        the crowd to stop surging forwards as people were being crushed at the turnstyles.
        In spite of innumerable requests, the crowd continued to move unrelentingly in
        the direction of the entrances.   Such was the volume of people that any pick­
        pocket observations were now useless and at Detective Sergeant Smith’s
        instructions, together with him and Detective Constable Lindsay and others
        engaged on the same duties, I made my way to the junction of Vere Road and
        Leppings Lane.   We continued to walk down Vere Road towards Penistone Road and
        several residents were clearly annoyed and remonstrating with youths who had
        obviously been urinating in a passageway.      In fact, without exceptjon, every
        passageway on the ground side of Vere Road had been used a number of times by
        unknown persons relieving themselves.     Staining of urine was all over the walls
        and floors of the passageways.

        With Detective Sergeant Smith and Detective Constable Lindsay, I continued to the
        ground at a time when several dog handlers with dogs began to assemble at the top
        of the access path to the pitch between the Spion Kop and the North Stand.       They,
        shortly after, moved towards the pitch.

        About 3«0»pm.* or thereabouts, within     5 minutes of entering the gymnasium sited
        inside the ground, I was instructed with other police officers present to clear
        an area to make way for the reception of a numbed of fatalities from the
        Leppings Lane end. An area was cleared and almost immediately bodies started to
        arrive, and throughout that evening into the early hours of Sunday, 16th April,
        1989, with other police officers, I was engaged in helping to process the property
        of and the victims of the tragedy.

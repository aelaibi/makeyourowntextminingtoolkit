HILLSBOROUGH INVESTIGATION - COSTS


In his minute to you, dated 7/9/89, Dr McQuaid requested information on
the costs involved in the Hillsborough Investigation. Only SEL parts
of RLSD were involved and costs to date are as follows:

       Section                Time (1/2 days)              Cost @ ^26/day

Mechanical Engineering              364                           59332

Metallurgy & Materials              200                           32600

SSS - MDU                            57                            9291
      Graphics                       37                            6031
      Photographic Stills            47 + processing (£ 9 6 6 )    8627
      Workshops                       7                            1141
      Film Unit                       4                             652

SITS                                  3                            489

Protective Equipment                 16                            2608

                                    735                       120,771

The total, including SSS, is ?120,771 + vat. If it is assumed that SSS
costs are included in the overhead figure then the total reduces to
£§5,029 + vat.

These totals do not include Dr Nicholson's time which is estimated to
be 40 days. Hence it could be argued that an additional maximum cost
of £13040 + vat was incurred. Thus the maximum grand total is ^-33,811
+ vat.

For your further information the total extramural cost of work requested
by SEL to date is j?16,440. This is being paid by the Home Office.

The estimate of the total time spent by TD staff on this investigation
is 64 days. I do not know the TD daily rate so I cannot cost this
effort.

A copy of the Pen 3 maximum safe capacity diagram and a note on how it
was constructed is attached. I understand Dr McQuaid made a verbal
request for this.

Hillsborough investigation. The total time recorded by
nenbers of this Section is 200 half-day units,
consisting of:

On site and laboratory exanination of barriers
                               — 104 half-days

Counting entries through turnstiles A-G
                               —   42 half-days

Meetings, attendance at Inquiry and report writing
                               —   54 half-days

At the current cost level o f 4^26 + vat/day, the total
cost for this Section cones to ^32,600 + vat

Please let me know if you require further detail.

             Dr MnQiwid has requested a statement of SEL's
             costs to date of assisting with the Hillsborough
             Inquiry.

             Will you, therefore, please let me know the total
             time recorded far your SectiayUhit for this
             incident. An KLSD total estimate can then be

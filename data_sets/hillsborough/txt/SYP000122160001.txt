disorderly               and    joked          that          we    wouldn't                 get    much       overtime             from       this

match        as     it    would       be       a    repeat           of       last          years    semi          -    final.




We    met     up       with     PC 1594            A1              and        his       partner          in     the      canteen             and       I

believe           at     that     time         we           were     a l l in g o o d             spirits,             laughing and                joking

again        about        the     overtime                  and    how        PC A l l o t t        and       his       partner          had       been

patrolling               Town     Centre,               attending              several             skirmishes                at    Pubs       and          how

we    had     been        down       at       the       Station,              doing          nothing          much.




We    were        s t i 1 1 / rpo n i t o r i n g           the    radio           on       Channel       29       when       we       heard       control

ask     PS    Hill/to           send          all       his       jdog    handlers                from    the          Town       Centre          to       the

ground        a sVassistance                   was          needed        urgently.                 We    heard          PS       Hill       tell          them

to    ring        the     canteen             to    inform           us       as       we    had    gone        in      for       early       meal          but

we    managed            to    get    through                and     tell          them       that       we     were         already          on       our

way.




We    went        downstairs              and       as       we    were        passing             through             the    Station

Sergeants              Office        towards                the    Garage              where       the    vans          were       parked          I

remember           a     PC    shouting             to       me    "Denise,                 you    used       to       work       in    Ops       Room,

W h a t ’s    Operation              Support                mean?".




I    h a d n ’t     heard       this          come          over     the       radio          and    asked             him    what       he       meant

and     he    said        that       it       had       come       over        the          radio    that          Operation             Support             was

required           at     the     ground.               I   informed                   him    then       that          it    m e a n t all

available              Personnel              was           r e q u i r e d at the            ground          toa s s i s t / w i t h         a

serious           incident.               I    then          went        to    my       van       with    rny      partner             and    looked             at

my    watch,           seeing        that          it       was    only        3.05          pm    (1505        h r s )/and            saying          to

myself,           " T h e y ’ve      only          been       playing              5    minutes.              I wonder             w h a t ’s

A    number       of       Police          vehicles          were          already          there       and    officers                were       stood

No    one      seemed           to    know       what       was       happening             and    what       was    required                from

us.       Then        a    call       came       from       one       of    the       other       Handlers          that          we    were       to

take      the     dogs          into       the    ground.              I    took       my    dog    and       went       into          the    ground

through          gate          'O’ and       stood          with       the       other       handlers          near          to    the       Police

room      at     the       top       of    the    ramp       which          leads       down       onto       the    pitch.              People

were      running              around,       some       coming             up    the    ramp       with       stretchers                and

people         laid        on    them       with       coats          or    jumpers          over       their       heads.              It    then

hit     me     that        people          had    in    fact          died       in    whatever          had       gone       off       inside

the     ground            and    I    remember          thinking,                perhaps          selfishly,             I    d o n ’t       know,

"I    hope       the       Bobbies          that       are       in    there          are    alright".              We       were       then

instructed                to    take       our    dogs       back          to    the    vans       and    remain             with       them

until        instructed               further.              Once       back       at    the       vans    we       stood          talking

amongst          ourselves,                trying       to       work       out       what    had       happened             to    result          in

p e o p l e ’s    deaths.




I    c o u l d n ’t       make       anything          much       over          the    radio,       all       the    transmissions                      on

it    seemed          to       blurr       into    one.           Several             Notts.       Forest          fans       came       out       of

the     ground            and    said       it    was       the       Liverpool             fans    that       had       invaded             the

pitch.




I    remember             watching          in    awe       as    ambulance             after       ambulance                passed          by    me

and     went      into          the       ground       to    be       followed          shortly          afterwards                by    the       Fire

Brigade.              An       off    duty       Doctor          in    his       own    car       pulled       up    and          stated

he    had      heard           the    radio       message             on    local       radio       and       had    corne         to    help.

In    the      rear        seats          were    his       two       young       children          and       he    asked          if    someone

could       look          after                them.           As    I was          the    only          Policewoman                around          I       stated

that       I would             look             out       for       them.           The    children             were          both       about          5    yrs

old    and       were          strapped                   in       child       safety          seats       so       I    left       them       there             as    I

thought          it       would                be    safer          than       trying          to    keep       them          with       me    outside                in

the    steady             streams                   of    fans       that       were       now       beginning                to    leave          the

ground.              I    then             saw       all       the       other       Dog       Handlers             getting             their       dogs          from

the    vehicles                and             going          into       the    ground.              I    had       to    remain             with       the

children             as       there             were          no    other       Officers             either             male       or    female             around.

At    one       point,             I       seemed             to    be    the       focus       of       the    fans          because          they          kept

coming          to       me    in          a    very          agg/essive             and       angry       manner,             spitt/^ng            and

occasionally                   punching                   me/saying             it       was    all       my    fault,             fio m e     of       them

tickets          in       for          a       tenner          a    time       and       one    very       ir rate            Liverpool             fan          who

refused          to       give             me       his       name,       said       he    had       seen       a       gate       man       let    in       ten       at

The    fans          were          very             aggressive                and    angry          continually                converging                   on    me

saying          what          they             had       to    say       before          making          their       way       off       towards             City

Centre.              A    number                were          banging          on    the       car       which          contained             the       2    young

children             and       I       began             shaking          with       fear       thinking                that       they       might          turn

the    car       over          so          I moved             away       from       the       car       shouting             at    them       to       take

it    out       on       me    and             not       the       children          in    the       car.           They       came          towards             me

and    I    thought                "This             is       it,    I ’m      going       to       get    it       now”.           but       apart          from

being       pushed             around                and       spat       on    yet       again          and    a       couple          of    punches             to

my    body       they          went             away.              I went       back       to       the    car          and    comforted                the

children             who       were             beginning                to    cry       and    got       them          laughing             again          talking

of    all       things             about             'Thomas             the    Tank       Engine’.




I again          stood             away             from       the       vehicle          so    that       the          children             would          remain

safe       if    anymore                   irrate             fans       came       to    me.        I    could          hear       coming          from

inside          the    ground             cheers,          screaming                and       booing          and        began          to      wonder

what       could       possibly                be    happening                to    my    Colleagues                   inside           the      ground,

because          it    I was             being       subjected                to    this       abuse          outside                the     ground,

what       was       happening             to       them       in    there.




The    Doctor          then          returned             to    his       vehicle             stating             that          there        wasn't         much

more       he    could          do.




I asked          him       what          had    happened             and       he       told       me       that       people           had      been

crushed          and       he    had       seen          about       30       people          dead,           I     saw         that       he    was       very

white       and       shaken.              I asked             him       for       his    name          but       he     said         he     had/given

his    details             to    someone             inside          the       ground.                 He    then        drove         a w a / and          I
                                                                                                                  tO io(b(b(p\ ]

and    asked          me    if       I    had       seen       PC    Dowdall,             another             of       the       handlers             because

he    couldn't             find          him,        I    said       I    h a d n ’t      all          the    time          I    had       been       sifood

outside          the       ground,             so    he    asked          me       to    take          him    round             to    the       i-aja^ings

As    we    arrived             at       the    Leppings             Ln       end       all    I       could        see         was    a     mass      of       red

and    white,          Liverpool                fans       were          everywhere,                   most       of     them         surrounding

what       Police          Officers             I    could          see,       arguing             with       them          and       pushing          them

around.              Inspector             Phenix          got       out       of       the    van          and     told         me     get      back           to

other       dog       handlers,                 Liverpool                fans       began          to       corne      towards             the    van

the     gym.           Everything                just       seemed             to    be     chaotic.                I    looked           over       towards

the     Leppings                Ln    end       and    I    could          see       fans        in    the       stand         above        the

    placed       back       onto       their          respective                   trains.

We     were       then          told       to    stand       down          and       return           to    Niagara, which                      we       did.

As     I walked             up       the    steps          into       the          club,     I    remember               seeing       a     male

officer           sat       crying          and       I was          told          that    he     had       been         at    the        front       and

had     carried             some       of       the    injured             and       dead        from       the         crush.        Other

             Officers           were       just          sat       around          quietly        with       looks        of    sadness             and

             disbelief           on    their             faces          and    it    w a s n ’t    until           speaking          to    other

             Officers           that       I       realised             just       how    lucky,        if    that's           the    word          to    use,

             how    lucky        I was             to    have          been    stood       outside           the        ground       with       the

             children.               Then          after       a       de-briefinq          from        Inspector              Phenix          we    u^re

             stood        down       from          duty       at       the    ground       and     together              with    PC       AVEott

             returned           to    El       where          we       went    off       duty     at   8     pin    <2000       hrs).




             All    I     can    say       in       closing             is    that       I was     very       frightened              and       upset       by

             the    actions           of       the       majority             of    Liverpool           fans        towards          myself          and    the

             other        people       who          were       trying          to    help       the     injured           inside          the       ground.

             Especially              when          on    my    own       outside          the     ground,           the    group          of    supporters

             advanced           on    me       because             I    honestly          feared        that        I would          be    caused

             serious        injury             and       that          even    though       I wanted               to    call    for       assistance             I

             d i d n ’t    because             I    knew       people          inside       the        ground           needed       help       more       than

             myself        so    I would                suffer          the    consequences                and      not    add       to    the       already

             1arge        burden       inside.




             Submitted           for       your          information.

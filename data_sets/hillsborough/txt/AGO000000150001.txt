SOLICITOR GENERAL
                                                     <*t
We discussed the handling of the decision relating to the
application under section 13 of the Coroners Act 1988 for
authority to seek an order from the High Court directing a fresh
inquest in relation to the Hillsborough disaster.     You and I
will both be away when the Attorney General returns.   I propose
to leave him a short submission covering my note of 31 July to
you and your note of the 4 August.       I shall invite him to
endorse a decision to refuse the application.

Thereafter, the following steps will be necessary:

1.   A formal (official) letter to Messrs Malcolm J. Gregg &
      Company informing them of the decision.  A draft of the
     official letter is at flag A.

2.   Letters to the five Members of Parliament with Merseyside
      constituencies who attended the meeting with yourself and
      the Attorney General at the House of Commons on the 15
      June.   They were Jane Kennedy (Liverpool, Broad Green),
      Eddie Loydon (Liverpool, Garston), Robert Parry (Liverpool,
      Riverside), Peter Kilfoyle (Liverpool, Walton) and Robert
      Waring (Liverpool, West Derby).      A draft of a standard
      letter to each of those MPs is beneath this note at flag B.

3.   There are three Members of Parliament who did not      attend
      that meeting but who have written separately         to the
      Attorney General.  They are George Howarth MP, Sir   Malcolm
      Thornton MP and David Alton MP.   Draft letters to   be sent
      to each of those are at flags C, D and E.

In a white folder attached to this file are letters from two
members of families.   They are Mrs Teresa Glover who is one of
the applicants under section 13.    The other is Mrs J. McBrien
whose son, John McBrien (18 years) also died at Hillsborough.
She was not one of the applicants.     Although she has not made
a formal application under section 13 I think we should treat her
letter as such.   The gist of the reply should be to explain the
position generally and say that there are no special
circumstances in relation to the case of her son such as would
justify any different decision. Draft letters to Mrs Glover and
Mrs McBrien are in the white folder.

I should be grateful if you would consider and approve these
letters so that I may leave the Attorney General with a composite
package.

       Dear Sirs,

       PAUL CARLILE, IAN GLOVER, RICHARD JONES. MICHAEL KELLY, PETER
       TOOLE and KEVIN WILLIAMS (APPLICATION UNDER SECTION 13 OF THE
       CORONERS ACT 1988)

       Further to my letter of 21 April 1992, the Law Officers have now
       given very careful consideration to the application made by your
       clients for authority under section 13 of the Coroners Act 1988
       to apply to the High Court for an order directing a fresh inquest
       in relation to the above named persons who died in the Hills­
       borough disaster on the 15 April 1989.     The material submitted
       under cover of your letter of 3 June 1992 has also been taken
       into account together with representations received on behalf of
       some of your clients from Members of Parliament with Merseyside
       constituencies and a letter received direct from Mrs Teresa
       Glover.

       X&e criterion adopted by the Law Officers in respec^-jof--,Such
       applications is to consider whether the cijyawrrStances and
       evidence are such as to create a realistigu^tSgsibility that the
       High Court would, having regard to tker'considerations specifi­
       cally identified in section 13 of^Iie 1988 Act, conclude that it
       is necessary or desirableJdsr'the interests of justice that a
       fresh inquest should bg^ftt^ld.   The applications have been con­
       sidered against th^te^riterion both collectively in view of the
       matters conrnon^fecfeach of them and individually to take account
       of those pajjarCs and evidence specific to particular cases.  The
       Law Off>tf£rs have concluded that there are no grounds for
       authorising or making application to the High Court under section
       13**€f the Coroners Act 1988.

I promised when I met you together with other Members with
Merseyside constituencies on the 15 June that I would write to
you once I had reached a decision about the application made
under section 13 of the Coroners Act 1988 for authority to apply
to the High Court for an order directing a fresh inquest in
relation to the six persons who died in the Hillsborough tragedy.


I have now had an opportunity together with Derek Spencer to
examine the application in de                                                          has take

Granada Television Documentary/Drama production on the Hillsborough Tragedy

In common with yourselves, I have recently been approached by Granada Television who have
commissioned Jimmy McGovern (the author of the books upon which the 'Cracker' television
series were based) to write a drama/documentary dealing with the aftermath of the 1989
Hillsborough tragedy.

I had a meeting with the Production Team yesterday together with a number of South
Yorkshire Police staff in an attempt to establish what exactly defines the genre
'drama/documentary', what was meant by Granada's claim to "strictly factual" drama and what
support was sought for the programme from the South Yorkshire Police.

The team intend to conduct research with a large number of those who were involved with,
and affected by, the tragedy with particular emphasis upon the view of the relations of those
who died. On the basis of the material obtained by this process McGovern will write the
piece, which will probably be screened some time in the Spring of 1997. My suspicion is that
the 15 March anniversary, or close to it, will be favoured by Granada. The Granada team
sought my support in allowing access to South Yorkshire Police officers who were involved
and to statements obtained in the aftermath of the tragedy.

The view we expressed to Granada at the meeting was that the weight of medical opinion
suggested that people who suffered from Post Traumatic Stress Disorder would all find such a
programme to be both distressing and disturbing and that, therefore, no possible good could
accrue to anyone involved with the tragedy as a result of the programme being made. The
sole benefit would be to Granada and to Mr McGovern. Moreover, one of Jimmy
McGovern's previous books was dramatised in a 'Cracker' episode which dealt with the
murderous effects of the tragedy on a Liverpudlian man, and suggests that the author is
unlikely to produce an objective account of any aspect of the tragedy.

As a result, the South Yorkshire Police have taken the unusual step for an organisation which
prefers and promotes openness and have withheld co-operation from the programme makers.
I thought that you should be aware of our decision as well as the fact that we have referred
Granada to several other independent sources of advice on the likely effects of the
programme.

                 of the proposed drama/documentary.

        2.       She has asked for the co-operation of the Service to ensure that the documentary
                 is factual.

        3.       We have asked for written questions of the areas they would wish us to focus on
                 before going any further with this.

    4.           On receipt of the questions and after careful consideration of their content, we will
                 consider our position regarding the level of co-operation required.

PROPOSED DRAMA/DOCUMENTARY ON THE HILLSBOROUGH TRAGEDY

Following our meeting of yesterday, I write to confirm that the South Yorkshire Police, with
some reluctance in view of our declared policies of openness, does not feel able to co-operate
with the making of the programme as it is currently proposed.

Our declining your offer of collaboration is based on:-

1.   Our view is that the overwhelming weight of expert medical opinion is that any dramatic
     reconstruction of an event such as Hillsborough will be likely to cause further distress
     and grief to all of those who suffered post traumatic stress disorder as a result of the
     tragedy, and that therefore no benefit would accrue to any of those affected either in
     Merseyside or in South Yorkshire by such a programme being made. I am sure that you
     will honour the commitment which you and Katy made at yesterday's meeting to consult
     with all of the medical experts whose details you obtained from                      and
     Peter Metcalf, and that, as a result, even at this stage you will re-consider making the
     programme.

2.   The previous written treatment of the Hillsborough tragedy by Jimmy McGovern which
     was screened in a "Cracker" episode, led us to a belief that it was unlikely, in our view,
     that the aftermath of Hillsborough would be treated in an objective way if Mr McGovern
     wrote the script.

Accordingly, I'm sorry to say that I am not prepared to lend your programme any esctra
credibility which would be afforded by our official endorsement of it.

As we agreed, it may be useful to maintain a dialogue in the future as you conduct your work,
and to this end I reiterate that such contact should be made to me either through my private
office or through the office of Gillian Radcliffe our Head of Press and Public Relations.

Granada Television Documentary/Drama production on the Hillsborough Tragedy

In common with yourselves, I have recently been approached by Granada Television who have
commissioned Jimmy McGovern (the author of the books upon which the 'Cracker' television
series were based) to write a drama/documentary dealing with the aftermath of the 19»y
Hillsborough tragedy.

I had a meeting with the Production Team yesterday together with a number of South
Yorkshire Police staff in an attempt to establish what exactly defines the genre
'drama/documentary', what was meant by Granada's claim to "strictly factual" drama and what
support was sought for the programme from the South Yorkshire Police.

The team intend to conduct research with a large number of those who were involved with,
and affected by, the tragedy with particular emphasis upon the view of the relations of those
who died. On the basis of the material obtained by this process McGovern will write the
piece, which will probably be screened some time in the Spring of 1997. My suspicion is that
the 15 March anniversary, or close to it, will be favoured by Granada. The Granada team
sought my support in allowing access to South Yorkshire Police officers who were involved
and to statements obtained in the aftermath of the tragedy.

 The view we expressed to Granada at the meeting was that the weight of medical opinion
 suggested that people who suffered from Post Traumatic Stress Disorder would all find such a
 programme to be both distressing and disturbing and that, therefore, no possible good cou d
 accrue to anyone involved with the tragedy as a result of the programme being made. The
 sole benefit would be to Granada and to Mr McGovern. Moreover, one of Jimmy
 McGovern's previous books was dramatised in a 'Cracker' episode which dealt with the
 murderous effects of the tragedy on a Liverpudlian man, and suggests that the author is
 unlikely to produce an objective account of any aspect of the tragedy.

 As a result, the South Yorkshire Police have taken the unusual step for an organisation which
 prefers and promotes openness and have withheld co-operation from the programme makers.
I thought that you should be aware of our decision as well as the fact that w e have referred
Granada to several other independent sources of advice on the likely effects
programme.

DRAMA-DOCUMENTARY - HILLSBOROUGH

Thank you very much for your letter of 30 October to which I'm now able to turn after a week
away at Conference.

You will probably not be surprised when I start by saying that, after our episode with Jimmy
McGovern and the Hillsborough theme on "Cracker", we are not bouncing with optimism
about the "strictly factual" treatment which you envisage. As an armchair critic, I am not even
sure how drama can be strictly factual.

However, we do have substantial facts at our disposal and we have two options: keep them
from you and let you portray something hopelessly inaccurate or provide what we can and
leave choice amongst those facts to Jimmy McGovern's dramatic creativity. It seems a stark
choice.

However, we are resolved to help.

Please contact our Private Office on                 and arrange the meeting you suggest. I
will make arrangements for at least one middle-ranking commander to be present, a counsellor
from our Occupational Health Unit and a senior representative from our Complaints and
Discipline Department, who handled the post-Disaster legal proceedings.

Leslie Sharp, the Chief Constable of Strathclyde, is just into his final weeks before retiring.
You might consider it prudent to see whether he would want to speak about the investigation
as part of the "aftermath" or put you in touch with one of his senior investigators. I am
sending a copy of this to Leslie to alert him to my suggestion.

I await further contact about our meeting.

                                                                             )

Dear Mr. Wells,


Granada television is in the early stages of preparation for a drama/documentary based
on the aftermath of the Hillsborough disaster.                 7*

The two hour programme will be strictly factual and it will be written by the dramatist,
Jimmy McGovern. It is intended for screening Autumn 1996 or Spring 1997.

A great deal of research will be involved in the project and we are writing to you first
as a matter of courtesy and also to solicit your co-operation with the project.

All the bereaved families involved with Hillsborough have been contacted and notified
of our intentions. Mr. McGovern, myself and a colleague recently attended a meeting
of the Hillsborough Family Support Group who have given their support to the
project.

A similar meeting with you and/or your senior officials would be most welcome.

Your comments on the matter would be greatly appreciated.


Yours faithfully


David Price

                         I shall of course keep you appraised upon receipt of the questions.

Thank you for your letter concerning the above television programme. Having
seen several of the programmes written by Jimmy McGovern I fully support
your reasoning and agree that the involvement of the Police Service would be
both distasteful and inappropriate. We will promptly decline any offer to
become involved and I shall let you know if any of my officers are contacted.

Best wishes for 1996.

Granada Television Production
Many thanks for your letter of the 22nd December 1995.
You will remember that we spoke about this briefly at the Cutler’s Hall when you indicated
that Granada Television were putting forward that I was co-operating fully with them. This
is quite incorrect.
My initial response to Granada was that I would be unable to give them very much
personal help as I was not in post at the time of the disaster nor the subsequent inquest. I
did however say that I might in the future be prepared to comment upon any matters of a
procedural or strictly legal nature. The role of the Coroner is frequently misunderstood and
I felt it might be better to correct misconceptions rather than allow a myth to be
perpetuated. However, McGovern et al have not responded on that particular point and
whether I am willing to speak with them in such a fashion in the future will depend very
much upon circumstances prevailing at that time. I will plainly bear your recent decision
very much in mind.
The major contact we had from Granada was a request to visit the Medico-Legal Centre
and in particular to see the viewing facilities. The mortuary is of course owned and run by
the Sheffield City Council and the decision on this lay with the City Solicitor. He agreed
with me that there was no good reason to refuse, particularly bearing in mind that this
building is frequently the subject of tours by interested parties ranging from nurses and
special constables to church groups or Rotary.

I believe Gill Radcliffe will have told you that I spoke to the production team during their
visit. Whilst they were extremely courteous and friendly I gained a very distinct impression
that their programme was unlikely to contain much sympathy for the efforts made by
people in this City.
Nonetheless, the only further request made of me at that stage was also difficult to refuse.
The team have asked if they can have sight of the video tape which (for record purposes)
was made of the inquest proceedings. As this is a strictly factual record of a public event it
is difficult to see upon what grounds I could refuse although it was made plain that they
would not be allowed a copy nor is there any question of the video tape forming any part of
their programme.
The production team have not asked for — nor will they be granted — access to any
statements or formal documents relating to the inquest. However, the documents that
relatives are entitled to by law have, in the main, been requested over the last two to three
years and supplied either by your force or my office. I assume therefore that most of the
statements that the production team might like to get hold of are in fact readily available to
them anyway.
Thank you for taking the time to write to me with such a detailed account of the reasons for
your refusal to co-operate. I suspect that this will be a case of “dammed if you do and
dammed if you don’t”.

                   PROPOSED GRANADA TELEVISION PROGRAMME ON THE
                   HILLSBOROUGH DISASTER

                   The Force has been approached by Granada Television, asking for our co­
                   operation in their making of a two-hour drama documentary about the
                   aftermath of the Hillsborough Disaster.

                   The author of the drama documentary is to be Jimmy McGovern, who
                   writes the popular "Cracker" series, one episode of which featured the
                   Hillsborough Disaster.

                   After a meeting today with Granada representatives, attended by serving
                   officers of the South Yorkshire Police and representatives of our
                   Occupational Health Unit, both past and present, I have decided that the
                   Force will not co-operate with the making of the programme.

                   This is against our normal policy of openness with the media and I want to
                   explain why I have taken this decision.

                   Best medical advice tells me that the screening of dramatic incidents can
                   trigger, in the minds of those affected by the trauma - whether families,
                   friends, members of the emergency services or simply onlookers - serious
                   emotional reactions. These reactions will range from various anxiety
                   states to a virtual reliving of the events and all the implications of such an
                   experience.

                   This leads me to the belief that there can only be two beneficiaries of such
                   a programme: the television company and the author. Though it is said
                   that the bereaved families unanimously support the making of the
                   programme, the professional advice I am given suggests that they may be
                   unaware of the longer-lasting and negative effects of what they are
                   entering into.

                   A further reason for my not wishing to endorse the programme comes from
                   the previous ’’Cracker" episode from the same author, which gave rise to
                   serious doubts about Jimmy McGovern's ability to see the aftermath of
                   Hillsborough with a sense of objectivity.

                   A further, complementary objection lies in the fact that the events of the
                   day have already been exposed to a number of judicial processes, none of
                   which has produced conclusive agreement on even all the facts, let alone
                   the many theories arising from those facts.         A two-hour drama-




       £1   DEC   ’ 95   10:55                                                   PAGE. 0 0 1

            documentary, however balanced the authors try to make it, is unlikely to
            succeed where extensive judicial process has tried and failed.

            Finally, the programme makers are quite clear that the story will be written
            from the families' viewpoint, which further minimises the realistic chances
            of achieving balance.

            I am not prepared, therefore, to lend the name of the South Yorkshire
            Police to bolster the credibility of a programme which is, in my view,
            made without the best and long-term interests in mind of any of the
            suffering parties.

            i have referred Granada to other clinical authorities in the field of post
            traiiH aiic stress disorder in the hope that the programme-makers will
            reconsider their proposed project. At the moment they are firm in their
            intention but I have offered them further discussion if they substantially
            alter their view.

            There will be some publicity stimulated by my decision and I wanted you
            to be aware of our Force stance on the matter, rather than be taken by
            surprise by media coverage.

            I am taking steps to inform other people, including retired police officers,
            of the reasons for the decision.

                       Dear

                        HILLSBOROUGH DISASTER

                       Thank you very much for your letter of 4th December and enclosure.

                       Having now discussed Granada's invitation with Members, the Chief Executive has now
                       written back to the individuals in question agreeing to meet with them for preliminary
                       discussions in much the same way as you already have. For your information, I enclose
                       a copy of the Chief Executive's reply.

                       I would add for the sake of completeness that they have already been to view the Medico
                       Legal Centre to see for themselves the facilities actually present at such building. I
                       should also add that one of my staff, as a matter of courtesy, has been in contact with the
                       former Building Surveyor who was involved with this facility at the time who has now
                       retired and also with Dr Eastwood and, as you know, Graham Mackrell at the Qub has
                       already been approached direct.

Thank you very much indeed for your thoughtful letter of 28 November about the
'Hillsborough' drama/documentary by Granada.

I attach a copy of my reply to Granada's invitation.

'Help' at this stage means only meeting them for preliminary discussions on
20 December at 2.30 pm. We are still a long way off co-operation, which is dimly
viewed in our organisation as a prospect for doing anything other than fuelling the
continued grief of the bereaved families and enhancing Granada's ratings. Leslie Sharp
is not minded to help and Ken Threlfall of SYMAPS has adopted the same line as
ourselves.

We will, likewise, keep you informed.

Dear Mrs Gordon,

Granada television is in the early stages of preparation for a drama/documentary based
on the aftermath of the Hillsborough disaster.

The two hour programme will be strictly factual and it will be written by the dramatist,
Jimmy McGovern. It is intended for screening Autumn 1996 or Spring 1997.

A great deal of research will be involved in the project and we are writing to you first
as a matter of courtesy and also to solicit your co-operation with the project.

Ail the bereaved families involved with Hillsborough have been_contacted and notified
of our intentions. Mr. McGovern, myself and my colleague Katy Jones recently
attended a meeting of the Hillsborough Family Support Group who have given their
support to the project.

A similar meeting with you would be most welcome.

Your comments on the matter would be greatly appreciated.


Yours faithfully



David Price

                                 %




          Many thanks for your hand written letter and for the enclosures. The personal
          words written are pleasing to receive and I am grateful for them. Whether, or
          not, we shall meet "afore I go", I know not, but the Hillsborough papers will be
          delivered to your office on 1 December 1995, by my driver, Constable___________
          My guess is that he will arrive just before lunch time.
          As for the "strictly factual" programme "written by a dramatist", Ihave no
          intention of taking part.     It seems to me that the proposed programme is
          ill-conceived, but your resolve to try to portray as much accuracy as possible, is
          understood. I shudder when I think of the clips of film which inevitably will be
          included in the programme.                                                                                                  ©
          I cannot find any valid reason for anyone wishing to expose those scenes to the
          public eye ever again, and any talk of "lest we forget" or "pour encourager les
          autres", has no appeal for me.
          If I do not see you before I go to collect my bus pass, I send sinceregoodwishes
          and best regards for the past, present, and maybe even for the future.

NOTES OF MEETING ON 20 DECEMBER 1995 WITH REPRESENTATIVES OF
GRANADA TV REGARDING A PROPOSED DRAMA DOCUMENTARY ON THE

Richard Wells welcomed Katy Jones and David Price, and said that strategically the South
Yorkshire Police was committed to be open and accountable as a police service. One of the
ways in which we strove to maintain this accountability was in taking an open approach to the
media, providing them with as much information as possible as opposed to as little as
necessary. This had been the approach taken with regard to a number of previous factual
programmes which had been made after the Hillsborough tragedy. Set against this strategic
overview was real concern regarding the precise definition of a "factual drama". He did not
understand the genre and he requested that Katy Jones and David Price give a detailed outline
of how drama and fact would intertwine within the proposed programme, especially in the
light of Jimmy McGovern's previous treatment of the Hillsborough disaster in the "Cracker"
programme. In this way the purpose of today's meeting was to try to understand Granada's
position and how a programme could be factual yet also dramatic and, most important, how
there was any way in which any people in South Yorkshire and/or Merseyside would benefit
from the making of such a programme.

David Price said that Hillsborough was a very dramatic day. His wish was to re-create it,
omitting from the programme any scenes of what went on within the pens at Hillsborough.
There was a need for his staff to talk to as many people as possible who had been involved in
the tragedy to gauge how they had reacted and how they perceived it. The methodology in
compiling a factual drama was to talk to people initially with no cameras or microphones
present on a head to head basis, and produce a database of evidence. Jimmy McGovern would
use this database to write the dramatic input from the evidence produced by the researchers.
Having written the programme, it would come back to be checked by David Price and Katy
Jones, and everything written by Jimmy McGovern would be sourced before the script was
approved. It would then take the form of a film with actors and actual scene productions. It
was anticipated that the project would be a major film production. The initial phase was a
massive fact-finding exercise and they sought the co-operation of South Yorkshire Police in
this exercise. Granada TV would like to approach serving and retired officers with the SYP's
approval and have access to statements taken at the time in respect of the disaster.

Katy Jones added that the genesis of the project was the feeling from the families who suffered
during the tragedy that they had never been given the chance to express their views. It was
intended to concentrate therefore more on the aftermath of the disaster. She added that
Granada had the full co-operation and support of all of the bereaved families. She accepted
                                               2


that police officers in the aftermath had been traumatised as well as the families from
Merseyside and she hoped to achieve a proper balance in the resultant programme. She
outlined her background as a producer for the documentary programme 'World in Action' and
said that it was her intention to make the programme as factually accurate as possible.
However, it was the perspectives of the bereaved families which would be featured
predominantly.

Richard Wells said that whilst he understood the methodology proposed, there was a practical
problem where common facts which can be validated and are known to both sides are subject
to different interpretation. He wondered how the programme-makers would deal with this
dilemma and which interpretation would be given prominence in the programme. A discussion
ensued during which Katy Jones stressed that the proposal for a drama documentary should be
seen in a completely different light to the previous Jimmy McGovern "Cracker" programme
which had dealt with aspects of the Hillsborough disaster and which were purely drama.

                     /ondered whether Granada TV realised sufficiently that a factor in post
traumatic stress disorder is that if you repeat the event again, even in the form of a drama,
people concerned will tend to believe it to be the actual event unfolding once again. This had
potential health implications both for the families at Merseyside and for officers affected in
South Yorkshire. Katy Jones said that Granada TV had considered this view and had
consulted a clinical psychologist who specialised in this field.

                   reiterated the fact that there were post traumatic stress disorder implications
in what was being proposed by Granada TV and she outlined a number of medical experts in
the field of post traumatic stress disorder and gave details of these people to Katy Jones and
David Price, inviting them to take soundings prior to developing plans for the drama
documentary. Katy Jones and David Price undertook to approach all of the people mentioned
by______________ ind also Dr                           a further consultant in the field mentioned
by Peter Metcalf.

                   vondered when the drama documentary was due to be shown. Katy Jones
said that it would probably be between Autumn of 1996 and Spring of 1997. Richard Wells
wondered whether the programme was intended to be shown on the anniversary of the
Hillsborough disaster. David Price said that that was not the intention. Katy Jones added,
however, that she and David Price did not know exactly when the programme was intended to
go out.

Richard Wells asked David Price whether Granada were committed to making the programme.
David Price confirmed that they were.

                  wondered why Jimmy McGovern had been chosen to write the script. Katy
Jones said that Jimmy McGovern had originally approached her and David Price with the
project. It was his idea, hence his involvement with it.

John Lowe wondered which families the programme-makers intended to highlight. Katy Jones
said that she did not know at this time - one, two, or possibly three families may be used
whose paths may have crossed in some way on the day of the tragedy.

    John Morgan wondered what the response had been of other agencies approached by Granada
    TV. Katy Jones said that the Ambulance Service, through Ken Threlfall, had committed
    support and co-operation with the project. The Fire Service had yet to respond.

    David Price said that West Midlands Police had agreed to co-operate with the project. He had
    spoken to Superintendent Ross at West Midlands yesterday, who had been supportive of the
    project and who, in fact, lectured upon the subject of Hillsborough himself. He added that Mr
    Sharp had been the only police officer so far who had indicated a wish not to co-operate with
    the project.

    John Morgan asked whether the programme would dwell upon the issue of scapegoats and
    blame. Were they to be explored and apportioned? Katy Jones said that they would look at
    the conclusions of the inquest but she was not sure exactly how issues of blame and
    scapegoats would be dealt with.

    David Price said that the programme-makers would be looking at the 3.15 pm cut-off point.
    All of this information was in the public domain and it was hard to say at this point if specific
    blame would be apportioned. He added, however, that the way that these issues were dealt
    with would be up to Jimmy McGovern, but that libel actions could flow from any reckless or
    inaccurate allegations made in the resultant programme.

    Richard Wells wondered whether in view of Jimmy McGovern's background and the
    "Cracker" programme that Granada had any hope at all that the Hillsborough issue would be
    treated objectively in their programme. David Price said the families would practically only
    talk upon the basis of their own experiences so that it would inevitably be biased in some
    respect. John Lowe agreed saying, for example, that if the Wilson family were to be used in
    the programme their views would not be impartial.

    Peter Metcalf said that the worry of South Yorkshire Police was that if criticism were levelled
    against the organisation, even if that criticism were supported on the basis of the Taylor
    Report's conclusion, the fact was that it would have an adverse affect upon the health of
    officers past and present. Therefore even a legitimate and unbiased programme which
    contained criticism of past and present officers could affect the occupational health of the
    organisation. The ultimate insult to officers concerned could be to see such a programme
    made "with the co-operation of South Yorkshire Police". This was the root of the concern of
    South Yorkshire Police with regard to co-operation with Granada TV.

    Katy Jones said that she understood this dilemma. South Yorkshire Police would be in a
    difficult position, there would be no editorial control in the programme for South Yorkshire
    Police. It was a matter for the Chief Constable to decide whether or not to co-operate.

    Richard Wells asked what practical good the Granada team saw coming out of the
    programme? David Price said that he felt it would not attract great ratings. Katy Jones added
    that it would provide an opportunity for the families to put their stories and to set the record
    straight, and to help them to deal with their post traumatic stress disorders.

                     laid that she understood this logic, but there was a counter argument. The
    families would never overcome the loss, the making of the programme would simply revive
    the distress. She would on this basis query the judgement made by Granada TV that the
making of the programme could somehow be beneficial for the families involved. She quoted
recent evidence of VE Day celebrations where wartime veterans had been referred in large
numbers to psychiatrists. This indicated how long post traumatic stress disorder symptoms
could remain in people affected. This was a serious issue and Granada TV should re-consider
their decision to make the programme.

Richard Wells asked whether Granada were concerned about re-awaking feelings of stress in
those concerned on a moral basis. Katy Jones reiterated the fact that without the support of
the bereaved families the project would not have become as advanced as it is.

              confirmed the extent to which many South Yorkshire Police officers, serving and
retired, were still deeply affected by post traumatic stress disorder arising from the tragedy.

John Morgan agreed the programme would cause hurt to officers and on this basis he was
reluctant to give his co-operation.

David Price said that the Granada team had already approached a number of retired officers
who had been supportive of the project and had given good accounts which would be used in
the programme. Richard Wells asked who was responsible for the "Cracker" programme that
dealt with Hillsborough. Katy Jones said that the persons concerned were the Head of Drama
Gub Neill and the Producer Paul Abbot. Richard Wells asked the Granada team whether they
had perceived "Cracker" to have been awful television. David Price said that he saw it as
emotive television. Katy Jones said that neither her or David Price could speak for Jimmy
McGovern.

Richard Wells said that practically a problem for South Yorkshire Police was a link between
the "Cracker" programme and the proposed programme mooted by Granada TV in the form of
Jimmy McGovern's involvement.

Gillian RadclifFe said that the dilemma for South Yorkshire Police was that whenever
Hillsborough was revisited in any form the results were always damaging to the organisation
and caused pain to those in it and those who had left as a result of the Hillsborough tragedy.

John Lowe agreed and said that practically Jimmy McGovern's involvement would ensure that
the only perspective to come out of the proposed programme would be that of the bereaved
families. For this reason he could not support any co-operation with the programme-makers.

Richard Wells said that as a result of the conversation today he was not at all sure whether,
given the genre of the proposed programme, any of the families bereaved in Hillsborough
would be assisted in coming to terms with their grief. He was not convinced that there was a
yield for anyone from South Yorkshire co-operating with the programme-makers. On this
basis he could not see at this stage a way in which the South Yorkshire Police could give
support to the programme-makers.

                  Agreed and said that she had personally worked for a long period of time in
the mortuary in the aftermath of the tragedy when she had seen the "Cracker" programme, a
programme which in general terms she had found entertaining - the effect had been to send her
into a state of shock for several days. She asked the Granada team to understand how the
proposed programme could affect people like her.

    Gillian RadclifFe said she did not doubt the integrity of the Granada team but she did not
    believe that any individual or group would benefit from any more programmes on
    Hillsborough. For these reasons she was against co-operation.

    Richard Wells agreed. He too did not doubt the integrity of Katy Jones and David Price.
    However, practically Granada could perform a "hatchet job" on South Yorkshire Police and
    simply move on. Even if criticised Granada could withstand the criticism. For these reasons
    he felt that the organisation was damned if it co-operated and damned if it didn't. However, he
    did not treat the proposals lightly but could not see any clear beneficiary from the programme
    being made other than Granada TV.

    John Morgan agreed and said that there was still a great deal of hurt within the organisation
    arising from Hillsborough and it was time to try to put it all behind us.

    Katy Jones said that she and David Price were pleased that South Yorkshire Police had agreed
    to meet them today and to discuss the request for co-operation. They would like to come
    back to SYP in the future as the project developed and as further questions arose. She
    recognised that it was a sensitive story but said that she saw benefits from talking to the police
    involved in making a balanced drama.

    Richard Wells queried the term "drama" and asked why Katy Jones had not referred to a
    drama documentary as previously spoken of. Katy Jones said that the omission of the word
    "documentary" was a mistake. She made it clear that the programme as envisaged would be a
    drama documentary.

    David Price agreed. He said that in the words of Bob Hoskins "it's good to talk". He
    appreciated the time given by South Yorkshire officers to the Granada team today and hoped
    that the programme makers would continue to have dialogue if not co-operation with South
    Yorkshire Police.

    Richard Wells asked for people around the table to sum up their views.

    Ken Greenway asked David Price and Katy Jones what the title of the programme would be.
    Katy Jones said that no title had yet been discussed.

    Peter Metcalf said that he felt that the documentary drama would create harm for all of those
    involved at Hillsborough and there was no benefit to any party by supporting the project.

    John Morgan agreed. He was opposed to the drama documentary being made.

    Gillian RadclifFe said that it was not her usual approach to oppose co-operation with the media
    but on the grounds of the discussion today she could not support co-operation with the
    Granada programme, although she would like to retain an open door as a conduit for future
    dialogue.

    ___________said that he agreed with Gillian RadclifFe. He had a duty to protect his clients
    from further trauma, and the programme if made would do them more harm than good.
                                              6


                         saying that the fear and anxiety which the programme would create
among those affected in Merseyside and in South Yorkshire needed to be constantly
monitored and revisited.

Richard Wells said that the interests of South Yorkshire Police staff were for the victims of
Hillsborough, both the families and South Yorkshire Police officers serving and retired. He
did not think there would be any benefit, except to Granada TV and Jimmy McGovern, in
making the drama documentary in the form outlined by Katy Jones and David Price. No
programme that they would be able to produce would be able to do other than resurrect
memories and cause further distress. The greater humanity would be served by not now
reawakening those stilled emotions which had resulted from the tragedy. He said that any
further contact with South Yorkshire Police and Granada TV should be made either through
his private office or through the Head of Press and Public Relations, Gillian Radcliffe. That
was the position of the South Yorkshire Police and that would not change without further
consultation in the forum as constituted today.

At this point Katy Jones and David Price left the meeting.

A brief discussion ensure and the following actions were agreed.

1.     Richard Wells to write a draft telex and General Order for internal circulation to
       inform South Yorkshire's staff of the proposed programme and the SYP response to
       the request to co-operate.

2.     Richard Wells to make contact with West Midlands Police and Ron Hadfield with
       regard to the co-operation and the role of Superintendent Ross.

3.     Richard Wells to check with South Yorkshire Metropolitan Ambulance and Paramedic
       Service and with Chris Dorries the Coroner to see if they had both indeed pledged co­
       operation, as claimed by Katy Jones and David Price.

4.     In the light of 3. above Richard Wells to write to Katy Jones and David Price setting
        out formally our refusal to co-operate with the programme, and indicating that this
        refusal would persist unless a substantial shift of approach from Granada TV took
        place.

5.    ___________ to write to those members of SYP who were not retired and to explain to
       them our approach and to alert them to the fact that the programme was being made.

6.     Gillian Radcliffe to prepare a position for the broader media, either on an "if asked" or
       "up front" basis.

7.     Richard Wells to notify the Chief Constables of Merseyside, Nottinghamshire, and
       West Yorkshire, some of whose officers had worked during the disaster to alert them
       to the activities of Granada TV.

    Dear Mr Lowe

    I am writing to ask if you would be able to assist me in ascertaining the details of St John
    members who were on duty at the FA Cup Semi-final at Hillsborough on 15 April 1989.

    Shortly after the event our duty book listing all the members present at the ground was
    handed to the police as part of the investigation into the events on this day. St John have
    now been asked by Granada Television to participate in a programme about this tragedy.
    Before I go ahead and get members involved in this, I would like to contact the people who
    were on duty and obtain their views.
         »


    Unfortunately I do not have a copy of the information that was supplied to the police and am
    writing to ask if you could possibly supply me with a list of the St John Members who were
    on duty at the football ground on that day. -

    Yours sincerely

It
          Dear Richard

          Thank you for your letter dated 22 December 1995.

          Like yourself I have severe doubts about the motives behind the Granada
          documentary/drama. In fact, in earlier correspondence, I made the initial observation
          that Mr McGovern’s opinions of Hillsborough are well documented and I would
          question any such balance.

          Out of courtesy, however, I had a meeting with Granada who have offered to write
          me a formal letter setting out the basis on how such a programme would be
          produced.

          This is still awaited but I can assure you that I will make no decision without
          discussing the matter with you and my initial reaction still stands that such a
          programme is best avoided.

          Yours sincerely

                    Police concern over plans for Hillsborough


South Yorkshire Police have been approached by Granada Television, asking for co­
operation in their making of a two-hour drama documentary about the aftermath of the
Hillsborough disaster.


The author of the drama documentary is to be Jimmy McGovern, who writes the popular
"Cracker" series, one episode of which featured the Hillsborough disaster.


After a meeting before Christmas with Granada representatives, attended by serving
officers of the South Yorkshire Police and representatives of the force's Occupational
Health Unit, both past and present, the Chief Constable decided that the force will not
co-operate with the making of the programme.


"This is against our normal policy of openness with the media and I want to explain why
I have taken this decision," said Mr Wells.


"Best medical advice tells me that the screening of dramatic incidents can trigger, in the
minds of those affected by the trauma - whether families, friends, members of the
emergency services or simply onlookers - serious emotional reactions. These reactions
will range from various anxiety states to a virtual reliving of the events and all the
implications of such an experience.


"This leads me to the belief that there can be only two beneficiaries of such a
programme: the television company and the author. Though it is said that the bereaved
families unanimously support the making of the programme, the professional advice I
am given suggests that they may be unaware of the longer-lasting and negative effects
of what they are entering into."

Another reason for the force deciding not to endorse the programme comes from a
"Cracker" episode from the same author, which gave rise to doubts about Jimmy
McGovern's ability to see the aftermath of Hillsborough with a sense of objectivity and
resulted in the force complaining to Granada at the time.


Said Mr Wells: "A further complementary objection lies in the fact that the events of the
day have already been exposed to a number of judicial processes, none of which has
produced conclusive agreement on even all the facts, let alone the many theories
arising from those facts. A two-hour drama-documentary, however balanced the authors
try to make it, is unlikely to succeed where extensive judicial process has tried and
failed.


"Finally, the programme makers are quite clear that the story will be written from the
families' viewpoint, which further minimises the realistic chances of achieving balance.


"I am not prepared, therefore, to lend the name of the South Yorkshire Police to bolster
the credibility of a programme which is, in my view, made without the best and long-term
interests in mind of any of the suffering parties."


South Yorkshire Police have referred Granada to clinical authorities in the field of post
traumatic stress disorder in the hope that the programme-makers will reconsider their
proposed project and have offered them further discussion if they substantially alter their
view.

          Thank you for your letter dated 21 December 1995 concerning the
     proposal by Granada Television to produce a drama/documentary dealing
     with the aftermath of the Hillsborough tragedy.

           I must say that I agree entirely with your view that      such a
      production could serve no useful purpose,       indeed may even prove
      detrimental to the individuals still coping with the aftermath of the
      tragedy.

           As  requested, should an approach be made by Granada Television for
      assistance, we would inform you out of courtesy.  At this  stage  should
      such an approach be made, either to me directly or individual Officers,
      no formal assistance will be provided.

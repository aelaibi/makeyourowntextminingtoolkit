I commenced              duty       at    the    Sheffield             Wednesday             Football             Ground       at

9.^5     a.m.       on       Saturday,          15th    April          1989, and             a    10.00       a.m.       briefing             toe

place     in    the       North          Stand    by    Chief          Superintendent                   Duckenfield.                 I w as

under     the       supervision             of    Police            Sergeant           Chapman,             serial       1,    covering

track     duties             throughout          the    operation.                 Briefing             was       completed          at

approximately                 10.20       a.m.    and       I       subsequently             took       up    a    position          on       the

track     under          the       North    Stand       between             the    half          way    line       and    the       Spion

Kop     end .       I    usually          work    the       same       duty       for       all    Sheffield             Wednesday

home     games          and    I    have    worked          many       semi-finals                at    the       ground       during          my
                          O
14     years     Police            Service.        I    usually             take       up    the       same       position          as

stated        for       all    matches.

I    noticed        that       a    few    fans    had          entered          the    Spion          Kop    by    11.40          a.m.       and

there     was       a    constant          trickle          of      fans        arriving          after       this       time       again       o

th e    Spion       Kop       (Notts       Forest       fans).

Meal     was     taken         at    approximately                  1.15        p.m.    on       the    direction             of    Police

Sergeant         Chapman            and    this    was          a    hot    meal       eaten       in       the    gymnasium             at    tt

rear     of     the      North       Stand.

I returned              to    my    previous       position                on    the    track          at    approximately

1.40     p.m.           I remember          that       by       this       time    the       Spion          Kop    had    filled          up

considerably                 and    by    2.15    p.m.          the    Spion       Kop       and       South       Stand       appeared

to    be    nearing               full       capacity,              these    parts        of        the    ground           being         taken          up

by    Notts            Forest         fans.         At       this     same       time     I     noticed              that      the       North

Stand        was        perhaps             only    half        full       and     this       also        being        the       case         with       tb

West       Stand         seats.

The    Leppings                  Lane       terrace          has     three       pens     for        standing              only         and    at

approximately                     2.15       p.m.       I     can    recall        the     centre              pen    being         quite          fu l l ,

the    pen        nearest             the     police           control        was       about        one        third       full         and       the

pen    towards               the      North        Stand        was        almost       empty.            This        was      certainly

unusual            for       a    semi-final                match     being        only        45    minutes           from         kick       off

time.             It    was       obvious          that        the    Liverpool              fans     had        not       arrived            at     the

ground            early          as    the    Spion           Kop    and     South       Stands           containing                the       Notts

Forest            fans       were        almost          fu l l .

By    approximately                     2.45       p.m.        the    North        Stand        appeared              to    be       quite         full

but        t he    Liverpool                fans        in    the    seats        directly           facing           me       were      very

intoxicated.                    At n o r m a l S h e f f i e l d W e d n e s d a y m a t c h e s s u c h y o u t h s                               woulc

sportsground.                         The     problem          was    that        all    the        young        white          males         aged

about         20-30 y e a r s               were        all    the     same       and     it    would           have       been         impossible

to    arrest            them          all.        It     was    quickly           evident           that        these          Liverpool             fans

were        very        hostile             and     abusive          towards           myself        as        a Police             Officer          and

Press         photographers                    who       were       taking        up    positions               on    the       track         nearby.

At     about           this       time        (2.45          p.m.)     I    can     recall          hearing           on       my    personal

radio,            Superintendent                    Marshall           at    the       Leppings            Lane       turnstiles

stating                there          was     a    serious          problem         with       the        crowd       outside            and       that

he    wanted            to       have       the     main       gate        opened.           I recall            Superintendent

Marshall               asking           for       the    gates        to    be    opened        about           3 or       4    times         during

the        following              few       minutes           and    from        his    voice,            he    was    obviously               in      sor

distress.                 I      remember           Police          Sergeant           626     Goddard           in     th e        Police

Control          saying             over        the   radio,        'IF       IT     LOOKS      AS     THOUGH           SOMEONE           MIGH'

By    2.55       p.m.          the     central          pen        for    standing             at    the L e p p i n g s          Lane        end

appeared           to      be       absolutely              packed        solid       whilst           the    pen       towards              the

Police       Control                was     about       half       full        and    the       pen     towards             the       North

Stand       was       perhaps              only       one    sixth        full.           For    normal           big       games        the

standing           fans          at       the    Leppings          Lane        terrace          have       filled           each        pen

slowly        well             before        kick       off.

At    this        time          (2.55       p.m.)        th e      Liverpool             team       came onto            the p i t c h         to

'warm       up'       and           this       brought       the     usual           'big      cheer'        from       the        Liverpoo

fans.         I    then          heard          Police       Constable              1868       Buxton        on      t he    Police

radio        asking             for       the    kick       off     to    be       delayed.            I    heard       Police

Sergeant           4l6          Goddard          in     Police       Control             say,       'WE'VE        NO    CHANCE,              ONE

OF    THE     TEAMS             IS     ALREADY          OUT'.        The       Notts        Forest          team       and        the

officials                 had       NOT    at     this      point        come       out     onto       the     pitch.                 About        tw

minutes           later             the    Notts        Forest          team       and     officials           did       come          out     ont

the     pitch             to    more       cheers.

The     game          kicked           off       at   3-00       p.m.     and        after      a     few    minutes              Liverpool

hit     the       crossbar,                again        making          the    crowd        shout          with      excitement.

Normally              I    would          by     this       time    take       up     my    seat       on     t he     track           (when

Police           Sergeant              Chapman          retreated             into       the    players           tunnel),               but       as

 I    looked          towards             the     Leppings          Lane       terrace          (now         approximately                    3-05

p.m.)        I    could             see    fans       being        allowed           onto      the     track         from         t he    pens.

At     this       time           the      drunken           Liverpool           fans        in t h e       North       Stand           directl

 in    front          of       me     were       shouting          abuse        and        threatening               an o f f i c i a l

 Press       photographer                       who   was        directing           his    camera           towards             the

 Leppings             Lane          terrace.            I realised             that        these       fans       were           so    hostile

 that    I       told           the    photographer                to    go     away        as I      believed              he    was     in

 danger          of       being        attacked.

 There       were          now        Liverpool             fans    running           down       the       track        in       front        of

the      North        Stand       obviously               having          come        onto         the    track      from        the

Leppings            Lane     terrace.               I stopped                the      first         three        youths       and         a s ke d

them where             they       were        going.               They      all      produced            North      Stand         s eat

tickets          so    I directed              them           to    go     towards            the     Spion       Kop      then       turn

l ef t    to    get        into     the       seating              a r ea.       By     now        all    I could          see       at    the

Leppings            Lane     end        was    people              spilling             out      onto      the    track       a n d Poli c e

Officers            trying         to    prevent              them       going        onto         the    pitch.           I then          saw

Superintendent                 Greenwood                 run       onto      the        pitch       towards         the      referee,

obviously             requesting              him        to    stop        the     game.            The     players          all      t hen

went      off        the    field        and        by    this           time     there          were      literally            hundreds

of     f ans        spilling        out        onto       the        track        through           the     gates       at      the

Leppings             Lane     terrace.               I recall              Inspector               Sewell        saying         on P o l i c e

radio       he h a d       five     serials              in     the       gym      which           were    then      sent        out       to

the      track        in     front        of        the             North        Stand          and      Leppings          Laneterrace. 3

then       saw       the     St.    John's           Ambulance               drive          across         the     pitch        to     the

track          in      front        of    the L e p p i n g s             Lane       terrace.

I was       at         this        time       in the                same        position            on    the     track              to p r e v e n t

drunken             Liverpool            fans       invading              the      pitch,           but    assisted          by      another

Serial          who    were        spread           out       in     front         of      the     North        Stan d .

By       3*15       p.m.     a number           of       casualties                were         being      carried         across           the

pitch       on       stretchers               and    shortly              afterwards                I noticed        casualties

 being         carried        on        advertising                 hoardings              by      other    fans.          It     was       now

 apparent            that     a large           number              of    f ans      had        been      crushed       in      the

 central            pen.      It        was    not       until           about        3-15         p.m.    t hat    the      scale          of

 the      disaster           became           apparent.                  I was       by     now      very       frightened             for my

 own      safety        as    the        crowd        in       the       North        Stand         were    more      hostile              and I

 feared         they       would         invade          the        pitch       en      mass        at    any moment.                I began

 to      feel       very     sick        as    there               appeared           to      be    total       mayhem       everywhere

 Casualties            were        being        carried              across           the       pitch      in    their       dozens             and

 many      were        obviously              dead.            By     about        3-40         p.m.      the    Fire      Brigade              and

medical         services             were       present          and        people          were       receiving                treatment

over      the    full          length          of    the       pitch.            I was       approached                by       a male

Liverpool            fan       aged       about          45    years        who    was       gasping             for       breath       but

ab l e    to    walk.           I assisted                him    towards           the       track          at    the       corner          of

the      Spion       Kop,       but       we    were          unable        to    get       up    the       track          to    the    rear

of    the      North       Stand          due       to    the    amount           of    people             and    casualties                being

carried         on    advertising                   hoardings.               The       man       stated          he    would         sit     dowr

for      a while          on    the       track          at    the     corner          of    the       Spion          Kop.        I then

noticed         a number             of    Police             Officers           trying          to    place          a male         casualtj

onto      an    advertising                hoarding             on     the       pitch       so       I went          to    assist .             I

then      helped          carry       this          casualty           up    the       track          to    the       gymnasium             at

the      rear    of       the    North          Stand.           There           was    a serial             of P o l i c e          forming

a cordon         to       the    entry          at       the    rear        of    the       North          Stand.           There       was

only      just       sufficient                room       to    ge t    the       casualty             into       the       gym where

other       oficers            pulled          the       man    in     on    the       advertising                hoarding.                 The

man      was    semi-conscious,                      white,          aged        about       25       yea r s .

The      gymnasium             was    full          of    bodies        and       casualties                still          a l ive     were

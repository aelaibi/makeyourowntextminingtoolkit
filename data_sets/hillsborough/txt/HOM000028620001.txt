7./'N          On inspecting the area I found that at Turnstile 'H* o small section of
               fencing, secured by scaffold clips, had been slackened so that a signifi­
               cant breach of the fence could be made, giving access to the circulating
               corridor.   From the enquiries I made it appeared that this liad been done
               by fans during the night, no doubt intending to apply pressure at the
               right moment to gaii. entry to the Stadkim,

8.             Information was paused to     officers under inyconmand by an unidentified
               Liverpool police officer, that lie had heard fans planning to rush the
                'H\ 'J' and 'K' tumstilea. This confirmed my own view that these were
               the most vulnerable areos and therefore the most lively to be attacked.

               as time progressed, I noticed that there were more people in that area

•               suffering the ill effects of alcohol and tension was beginning to increase.
                This culminated in a nunfcer of fights at the 'pinch point', the narrowest
                point of the concourse, outside the Stadium offices.       The fights were
                caused apparently by the sale of tickets by ’touts'. Although veil known
                touts were not evident, there seemed to be a number of people selling
                one or two tickets. Tlie fans were keen to attack such people and yet
                also to buy the tickets at inflated priccs,

L0.            By 12 *30pm, the crowd wasbuilding up generally, but especially so outside
                turnstiles *H\ ’J’ and ’K ‘. Because this area is confined, I had to
                put in a cordon of police horses and foot police between the T.V. compound
                and turnstile ’H* to prevent the danger of crushing.

IK             outside of the cordon, there were more outbreaks of disorder among fans
                who had been drinking and I personally received a blow to the head whilst
                assisting one of my officers in making an arrest.

12.            The turnstiles were late in opening because a lorry was still carrying
                out some work in the circulating corridor.    This lorry could only make
                an exit through a gate at the side of turnstile 'K*. It did this just
                before 1.15pm but caused quite severe problare with crowds waiting for
                the turnstiles to open. The gate stuck when it was only half open and
                a lot of effort was required to prevent a large number of illegal entries
        *"      to the Stadium.
                once the turnstiles opened, I expected the crowd to ease considerably,
                ^ rv i  T w in r f l t h e c o n m l a l n t s of crushing I was getting from people in
                the crowd.          That people wen? ooviousiy prestsjjiy iwww-v —                    -
                crush in these circumstances, in the vrake of Hillsborough, amazed me.
                I was more amazed, however, to find that the crush was not dimnishing
                as I expected it to at turnstile ’H 1, This w a s because of ticketless
                 fans forcing their way through the lumstiles                                       thc
                having to be reeved through exit gates, slowing down the whole of the
                 operation.

            at the cordon and allowing only those with tickets through. Many people
            were reluctant to produce tickets, fearing that they mi<£it be snatched
            from than,    They took the trouble to secrete than in shoes, socks and
            other places, which node it difficult when production was demanded. The
            nurtoer of street robberies far this event are «iuch higher than for similar
            events.

            There were no* some 30Q people on the outside of the cordon who did not
            have tickets but were still anxious to find a way into the.Stadium. Rather
            than leaving the oortjon as a fixed target, I decided to ooftnence a sweep
            of the ooncourse, pushing these fans towards the Royal Tunnel and away
            from the vulnerable area.

            When the sweep from the other side, turnstiles JA* to *E'# reached the
            Royal Tunnel, the crowd which nurbened about* 500 began throwing bottles
            and cans at police* A nurrber of arrests were made Airing the completion
            of the sweep.

   18.      Despite the sweep, small pockets of ticketless fans returned to the concourse
            during the progress of the game. At about half time, there was a determined
            etterpt by about 200 to gain entry through gates and windows at the stadiun
            Offices and turnstile ’H 1- This was successfully repelled.

   19.      Just before the end of the game, all gates to the Stadium vere opened
            in preparation for the exodus. At this stage, Liverpool were in the lead
            and fans were starting to leave. Hcwever, the equalising goal was then
            scored by Everton. This resulted in an influx of fans who had been leaving
            and also those still around the ground without tickets. All managed to
            get into bays around the Staditm to wetch extra tiro.

    20 .     The nurrber of arrests, 76 on the outside of the Stadivm, does not fully
             reflect the nagnitude of misbehaviour by drunken fans. Rather a balance
             is struck in deciding whether arrests can be made without seriously reducing
             the nunrtoer of police left to control the crowd*

    21 .   *■ on this occasion, there was a rapport between the Liverpool and Everton
              ■importer*. Hed this not been the case, I believe nuch greater disorder
              would have enanated frcm the section of fans determined to gain entrance
              to the Stadium, regardless of the oost in any terms, to others.

             Having described a lot of bad behaviour on the part of some fans, I should
             say that the irajority were well behaved and concerned for the safety of
             themselves and others.

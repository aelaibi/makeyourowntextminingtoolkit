Lord Justice Taylor,
The Hillsborough Enquiry,
c/o Sheffield Wednesday Football Club
Hillsborough,
Sheffield, S6 2SW


 Dear Sir

We are a manufacturer of high visibility and waterproof clothing for the fire,
police and ambulance services, and are regarded as being authoritative in the
application of BS6629:1985 - the British Standard for Conspicuous Clothing.

In August of 1988 we started to develop a set of garments for stewards in crowd
control situations, and at that time had correspondence with the Scottish League
and the Scottish Football Association.  Our proposals to produce garments which
would clearly identify the responsibility and training of stewards at the
football grounds were warmly received by these organisations, and during the
winter and early part of 1989 we perfected the design.

We were about to present these garments to clubs when the Hillsborough tragedy
occurred, and not wishing to be thought to be trying to profit from a disaster,
we withheld the launch of these garments until a few weeks ago. At the beginning
of August we felt that the time had come to make these garments available to
interested clubs, and we held a Press launch at Hampden Park.  I enclose a copy
of the Glasgow Evening Times' coverage of this announcement.

 The garments are made of saturn yellow waterproof material, which is the fabric
 we use for traffic police coats, but where garments to BS6629 require
 retroreflective tape around the body, we have placed colour-coded reflective
 tape over the shoulders, where it can be seen easily when stewards are standing
 in a crowd of spectators. Green and white tape indicates that the steward has
 some first aid training; red and white means that the steward has been trained
 in crowd evacuation procedures, carries a plan of the ground showing all
 emergency exits and fire extinguisher sites, and will liaise with Fire Brigade
 personnel; blue and white tape is worn by stewards who are carrying personal
 radios and are in continual contact with the central control unit, probably
 manned by police. Thus in an emergency, both crowds and emergency services can
 identify those trained to assist.

 I have written to every league club in the United Kingdom with details of these
 garments and of less expensive, simple yellow garments which can be numbered
 and/

and clearly marked "Steward". We have tried to keep the cost to an absolute
minimum to make these affordable to clubs throughout the football league.

These garments have been warmly welcomed by Mr David MacLaren, Security Advisor
to the Scottish Football Association, and it is his hope that clubs will adopt
the garments, which have also had the approval of chief police officers in Scotland.

I hope that clubs and officials will not choose to think that I am presenting
these garments purely as a money-making proposition, as this is not the case.
We are a relatively new company, rapidly gaining a reputation for quality and
service, and our income is derived from large contracts - mainly with the three
emergency services - not from small orders of a few garments per club, such
as this may generate. Nevertheless,   I feel that we should make our idea available
to clubs if they wish to take it up.

If you wish any further information on these garments, or indeed if you would
be interested to see samples, I would be happy to forward these to you.

Yours faithfully,

 Dear Sir,

 We are a manufacturer of high visibility and waterproof clothing for the fire,
 police and ambulance services, and are regarded as being authoritative in the
 application of BS6629:1985 - the British Standard for Conspicuous Clothing.

 In August of 1988 we started to develop a set of garments for stewards in crowd
 control situations, and at that time had correspondence with the Scottish League
 and the Scottish Football Association.   Our proposals to produce garments which
 would, clearly identify the responsibility and training of stewards at the
 football grounds were warmly received by these organisations, and during the
 winter and early part of 1989 we perfected the design.

 We were about to present these garments to clubs when the Hillsborough tragedy
 occurred, and not wishing to be thought to be trying to profit from a disaster,
 we withheld the launch of these garments until a few weeks ago. At the beginning
 of August we felt that the time had come to make these garments available to
 interested clubs, and we held a Press launch at Hampden Park.  I enclose a copy
 of the Glasgow Evening Times' coverage of this announcement.

 The garments are made of sattirn yellow waterproof material, which is the fabric
 we use for traffic police coats, but where garments to BS6629 require
 retroreflective tape around the body, we have placed colour-coded reflective
 tape over the shoulders, where it can be seen easily when stewards are standing
 in a crowd of spectators.  Green and white tape indicates that the steward has
 some first aid training;  red and white means that the steward has been trained
 in crowd evacuation procedures, carries a plan of the ground showing all
 emergency exits and fire extinguisher sites, and will liaise with Fire Brigade
 personnel; blue and white tape is worn by stewards who are carrying personal
 radios and are in continual contact with the central control unit, probably
 manned by police. Thus in an emergency, both crowds and emergency services can
 identify those trained to assist.

 I have written to every league club in the United Kingdom with details of these
 garments and of less expensive, simple yellow garments which can be numbered
 and /

and clearly marked "Steward". We have tried to keep the cost to an absolute
minimum to make these affordable to clubs throughout the football league.

These garments have been warmly welcomed by Mr David MacLaren, Security Advisor
to the Scottish Football Association, and it is his hope that clubs will adopt
the garments, which have also had the approval of chief police officers in Scotland.

I hope that clubs and officials will not choose to think that I am presenting
these garments purely as a money-making proposition, as this is not the case.
We are a relatively new company, rapidly gaining a reputation for quality and
service, and our income is derived from large contracts - mainly with the three
emergency services - not from small orders of a few garments per club, such
as this may generate. Nevertheless,   I feel that we should make our idea available
to clubs if they wish to take it up.

If you wish any further information on these garments, or indeed if you would
be interested to see samples, I would be happy to forward these to you.

Yours faithfully,




Patricia M. Watson (Mrs)

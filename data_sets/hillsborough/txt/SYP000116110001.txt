youths,         obviously           angry and               annoyed,        a n d was       subjected               to    v e rb al

abuse,         because         in t h e i r       view,       we w e r e      late        arriving.             I was          then

On     entering         the      tunnel,          I was       m et     with     several           people        carrying

In m y       view       their      efforts        were       doomed        to       failure,           but      I did       not

consider           it    prudent         to    try and         tell      them        tha t       at    that      time.            They

were     obviously             very      Angry,        distraught              and       upset,        and most            of     them

I therefore              assisted         one     such       party       to     convey a youth                   to       the     stand

near     to       the    entrance         to    the      gymnasiuih.                I supervised                the       placing           of

t he    stretcher            under       the    stand and made                  an       examination             of       th e    person,

but     satisfied            myself       that     life a p p e a r e d             to    be     extinct.             One        of    the

fans     w i t h me at            that    time     obviously             knew        t he      d e c e a s e d so         I advised

him     to    remain with               the    b ody.        I then        returned              via      the    pitch           to    the

Leppings           Lane       end.

from     t he      terrace         either       on to        the      pitch         or    out     of      the    ground.

I was        then       involved         for    what      seemed a             lengthy           period         in g e n e r a l l y

trying        to     placate         irate      Liverpool             supporters.

At     one    p o in t ,      I had      to    intervene           to    prevent            a newspaper               photographer

being        physically            assaulted           for     trying          to    ta k e      pictures            of    deceased

and     grieving             relatives.           In m y       view,       their          conduct          was       reprehensible

and     is    n ot      justified         by t h e m      stating          th a t        they are          ’j us t        doing        th ei r

job* .

There        was     a brief         moment       also       when       th e    Forest           f an s    taunted          the

Liverpool            fans      which      caused         the    latter          to       run t o w a r d s       the P e n i s t o n e

Road     end       of    the      ground and           in m y      view,        had       not     the      fences          been        in

place        at    that      end,       there     m a y well          have      been a serious                   law and              order

a    line     of     officers           across     the       pitch.

During        this       time,       I became          separated           from          the     rest      of S e r i a l         53 a n d

Member of Seriel 53«

Sergeant in Charge - Sgt. Bovm.



On Saturday, 15 th April, 1989 , I paraded on duty at Main Street at $«^5ain
and with other officers was then conveyed to the pre-match briefing at
•Hillsborough Stadium.

The duties of seriel 53 prior to the game were the supervision of tfce arrival
of coaches carrying Notts Forest supporters to the ground, and their allotted
parking area at the Herries Hoad bus depot. This duty was carried out without
incident, as generally Speaking, the supporters were in high spirits, but
generally well behaved. As early as from 10.30am. I received requests for
directions to public houses, mainly from Forest fans, but from a few Liverpool
supporters, who, for some reason or other had found their way to the Penistone
Road end of the ground.

Shortly before kick off, I was first made aware of a problem developing at
Leppings Lane, but, in accordance with instructions, at about 3«5pm» we were
instructed to make our way on foot to Claywheels Lane, for stand      by duties
and refreshments.

On route however, we were diverted to attend at the Leppings Lane end.

Shortly after arriving there, Seriel 53 was directed into the ground through
entrance C. The forecourt at that time had been partially cleared, but it was
obvious something serious had occurred by the conduct of supporters. I personally
was approached by several youths, obviously angry and annoyed, and was subjected
to verbal abuse, because in their view, we were late arriving. I was then
physically manhandled towards the tunnel beneath the West Stand.

On entering the tunnel, I was met with several people carrying 'bodies’ out
and my first duty was to assist two fans with one such person whom they were having
difficulty with because of his size. This person at that time was still alive
and on reaching the forecourt, I commenced resuscitation before being relieved
by, an ambulance man.

I then re-entered the tunnel and went to the terracing, referred to as Pen 3»
The first thing that struck me was the stench of stale perspiration, and alcohol.
Fans were ocreaming at me and other officers to 'get summat done*. I went to the
foot of the terrace and saw a 'pile1 of persons. It seemed to me they were at
least 5 or 6 deep. Entwined in these bodies was part of a crush barrier which
had collapsed.

I then began to remove the first 'body' I could get hold of which was partly
trapped by the crush barrier. Eventually it was released and dragged through •
the perimeter fence gate on to the pitch. I was satisfied that person was dead
and could be no further helped. I therefor went back on to the terrace and assisted
in the recovery to the pitch, of a further b persons. In my view, they were
beyond help.

By this time, advertising hoarding were being made into make shift stretchers
and fans were placing ’bodies' thereon and conveying them to the jtenistone Road
                                                                            cont...
end of the ground.

In my view their efforts were doomed to failure, but I did not consider
it prudent to try and tell them that at that time. They were obviously
very angry, distraught and upset, and most of them were influenced by
alcoholq? and would not have listened to reason at that time.

I therefore assisted one such party to convey a youth to the stand near to the
entrance to the gymnasium. I supervised the placing of the stretcher under
the stand and made an examination of the person, but satisfied myself that
life appeared to be extinct. One of the fans   with me that time obviously
knew the deceased, so I advised him to remain with thebody. I then returned
via the pitch to the Leppings Lane end.

By that time, as far as I could see, all the bodies had been removed from the terra
either on to the pitch or out of the ground.

I was then involved for what seemed a lengthy period in generally trying to placate
irate Liverpool supporters.

At one point, I had to intervene to prevent a newspaper photographer being
physically assaulted for trying to take pictures of deceased and grieving
relatives. In my view, their conduct was reprehensible and is not justified
by them stating that they are ’just doing their job*.

There was a brief moment also when the Forest fans taunted the Liverpool fans
which caused the latter to run towards the Penistone Road end of the ground
and in my view, had not the fences been in place at that end, there may well
have been a serious law and order situation break out as well. This appeared to
be later controlled by a line of officers across the pitch.

During this time, I became separated from the rest of Seriel 53 and saw no member
of it again that day.

My nex$ direct instruction was to assist in diplomatically trying to persuade
Liverpool fans to leave the ground which was eventually achieved.

Thereafter, having failed to locate any other seriel member, I made my way
back to Clayvheel^j^ane fpjr eventually stand down, and return to C1.

Further to my statement of the 2nd June 1989.


I entered the Leppings Lane terrace via the tunnel giving access to Pens
3 and 4.    At that time I was not aware of the fencing dividing pens 3 &
4.   I just entered on the right as it seemed to me that that was the
area where most assistance could be given.      I moved forward towards the
front of the terracing where I saw bodies piled several deep which
appeared to be adjacent fo the perimeter wall.      I commenced the removal
of these bodies but was initially hampered    by part of a crash barrier
which was entwined into the bodies, and was preventing the easy removal
of the same.
On referring to the map shown I    would say that thegreatest concentration
of bodies    that I was involved in were squares   P7, 8 and 9 and to a lesser
degree squares 07, 8 and 9.     This is an area between the broken barrier,
the track side perimeter fence and track side gate number 4.
My first irrpression was the   pile of bodies were 5 or 6 deep, and I
believe the first body we moved was a male well built, wearing a light
coloured shirt.    In order to move the body we had to struggle to move
the broken barrier to release his body.      Once the body had been removed
the barrier returned to the same position as if spring loaded.

When I released that body I can    say that there were legs   of    other
bodies still trapped under that barrier.
1 took the first body onto the pitch left it with other people and then
returned    to the area of the broken barrier where I assisted in removing
2 further bodies which were clearly dead.

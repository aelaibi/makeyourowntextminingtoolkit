         Subject:          Specific complaint against South Yorkshire Police Officers
                           ACTION NUMBER A5110




         I enclose written statements made by                                 and                          both
         16 years, which contain allegations that two officers on duty at Hillsborough
         on Saturday 15th April 1989 offered to admit non'ticket holders to the ground
         on cash payment.



         Neither officer is identified but descriptions and locations in the ground are
         provided.           Although not specifically identified in his statement, the blue
         concertina gate mentioned by                          is GATE ’B ’            has recorded the allegation
         in a letter to 'MATCH MAGAZINE.'                     Enquiries have not been made in this regard.


         A third witness,                                   an adult, of
         Tel No:                              is alleged to have been similarly present.           He is, however,
         engaged on Territorial Army exercises in Germany until 17th June 1989.                                It is
         proposed that he be interviewed by West Midlands Police in connection with the
         Hillsborough Inquiry on his return and, subject to any wish expressed to the
         contrary, should he make a specific complaint it will be recorded similarly
         to that of                     and


         I have discussed the matter with Detective Chief Superintendent FOSTER of my
         force and he requests that I forward documentation to you direct.

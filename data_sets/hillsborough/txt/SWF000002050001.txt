                       FRIDAY,    26TH MAY,    19 89

                            (MORNING SESSIOM)



          MR. KALLIPETIS:   Sir there ara two (farther calls on
     the transcript that I handed in yesterday.   In fairness
     to this Officer perhaps I should pat those to him as well


          LORD JUSTICE TAYLOR:        That will only take you a
     moment will it?

          MR. KALLIPETIS:      Yes.

          LORD JUSTICE TAYLOR:   Perhaps you would like to do
     that now because I am going to interrupt the flow of
     evidence by something else which I will mention in a
     moment.

                  DAVID GODFREY DUCKEMFIELD recalled

              Further cross-examined by MR. KA L L I PE T I S :

Q. Mr. Duckenfield you recall that yesterday I handed you a
   transcript of the tracks of the tapes at SYMA5 Head­
   quarters.  - A. Yes sir.

Q. And we went through the first call that came               through from
   Force Control.  -   A. Yes.

Q.   Do you still have that in. front ofyou? .         -. .A..-1, have jus
     got a copy.

Q.   You will see that on the fourth page there          is    asecond
     call at 15.08.13.   - A. Yes sir.

Q.   Also from Force Control - you will see the abbreviation
     'F / C ' . - A. Y e s .

Q. And that was asking for ambulance to Leppings Lane end,
   and then it says:

               "A big fleet of ambulances,        immediately
               as many as you've got."

     He is told there is one on its way:

               “We want more than one."
                                                                     ;r: .r-'v/,-;-.



                    "Just hold on while we get the

                    ambulance up there, we've got officers
                    in the vicinity that can assess it
B                   for ...

       and then the tape is either indecipherable or cuts out.                         -
       A. Y e s .

    Q. There is a third call over the page at 15.10.

             LORD JUSTICE TAYLOR:           What page are you on now?

            MR. KA L L IP E T I S :    It is track 11.       It is the second
       transcript sir:

    Q. You see at 15.10.25:           Force Control:

                     "Leppings Lane."

D                    "Hello love i;3 Superintendent Clark
                     there please."

                     "Hold the line."

       and if you turn over the page please you will .see that the
       call is transferred to Superintendent Clark a t '15.10.35.
       The legend is 'Control':

                     "Hello can I help you?"

       Do you see that Mr. Duckenfield? - A. I have got "Just
       to let you know .... operation.." Is that the paragraph?

    Q. Yes : '                                      .1 - V    •

                     "Just to let you know ...."

       and then it is indecipherable I am told:

                    ".. . .operation....all the manpower
                    from all over South Yorkshire ....
                    Leppings Lane.".

                     "OK.  .Right we'll respond then thank
                     you for your help."

                     "Much obliged to you."

       and   that finishes at 15.11.         -   A. Yes sir.

             LORD JUSTICE TAYLOR:   Can you help about this
H      Mr.   Kallipetis.  I noticed in a    report which I have seen



                         i
                                 3




from the Ambulance Service that there were two ambulances
there before the match began.  Is that right?

     MR. K A L L I P E T I S :       No sir, one was there.

     LORO JUSTICE TAYLOR:                 And one within a mile.

     M R . KALLIPETIS:               And one was on standby.

     LORD JUSTICE TAYLOR:    We saw on the film that the
St. John's Ambulance single ambulance comes on first and
it seems to be quits a long time before one sees any other
ambulance.  What happened to the SYMAS ambulance that was
actually at the ground?   What happened to that, do you
know, in the early stages?

     MR. KALLIPETIS:   That stayed in situ   according to
the plan to act as the base for communications.   The
Officers from that ambulance went to the Leppings Lane
end to find out what was happening because they couldn't
see from where they were.   There was then a call through
to'Headquarters at 15.13 declaring that there was a major
incident, and by that time, 15.13, already ambulances had
arrived at Lappings Lane end in response to the earlier
call from the Police.

     LORD JUSTICE TAYLOR:   Am I understanding correctly
that the ambulance that was on at the ground as the SYMAS
ambulance on duty so to speak was not an operational
ambulance, it was a communications ambulance was it?

      MR. KALLIPETIS:   It is an operational ambulance sir
but as you will see from the plan the first ambulance on
site does not rush straight into the scene.   T here has cc-
to. be an assessment of exactly what is-required. There
are several reasons for this, sir, which will become
apparent.

     LORD JUSTICE TAYLOR:    I don't want to anticipate.  I
just wanted to know why we had not seen it at an early
stage on the ground but I thi-nk you have explained it, anc
we will hear the evidence later.

     MR. KALLIPETIS:   You will hear why it is not a good
idea for the ambulances to go right on to the pitch.

     LORD JUSTICE TAYLOR:                 Very well, thank you.

     Now, Mr. Collins I understand that - of course the
video that was shown last Friday as a compilation of
about two and a bit hours out of many, many hours of
video.
      MR. COLLINS:       Sir, that is right.

     LORD JUSTICE TAYLOR:   And I understand that there
ace parts of the remainder which have been looked at and
which may be relevant, and it may be better that those
who are still going to cross-examine look at it before
they proceed.

     MR. COLLINS:    I think so sir because bits may be
relevant to the Chief Superintendent's evidence because
they show the scene after the disaster had started.

     LORD JUSTICE TAYLOR:    In that case it seems to be
sensible 'that we should do that now.  I understand"there
are three different sections, is that right?   O n e w h i c h is
photographed from the West Stand looking down towards the
pitch ....

     MR. COLLINS:   Sir may I explain?   The first is
indeed that.  It is actually the unedited BSC film from
that camera which is situated as I understand it in or
under the West Stand looking out towards the goal from
behind.  Parts of that are in the compilation but not all.
The second is a compilation made after hours’of difficult
work of a Police video camera from last year of the
Lappings Lane turnstiles showing the flows last year, and
indeed also of the state of the pens last year, and the
third, which I have noc myself yet seen, I understand to
be six and a half minutes or so showing the 200m being
used on the opening of gate A, arid the opening, I think
the first opening, of gate C.  That is my understanding.
I have not personally yet seen those two...

     LORD JUSTICE TAYLOR:     We know where the camera-is      ...
that shows' gat e C - that is the one -on--the extremes tipCo’f *
West Stand there.    Is that the same camera that1 :'can"focus
on to gate A?                            -         - '

     MR. COLLINS:        I think so.   Clearly the BBC contains
an hour's worth but I don't suggest that we look at the
whole of that p e r i o d . It is *the p e r i o d .front" three .to four .
I would suggest that about the first f i f t e e n ;to twenty
minutes is what we should see of that.              The last year
compilation is a total I think of about twenty five
minutes.  Again I don't suggest that it is necessary to
look at the whole of that, and we can look at the eariler
bit from the middle and a bit of the end perhaps to give us
a clear idea of what it is about.            The other as I say is
six and a half minutes and I think we can watch the whole
of that.

     LORD JUSTICE TAYLOR:   We will do that as soon as
that can be set up, and of course anybody who wants to see
                      5




more of it arrangements can ba made.  I think it will take
about ten minutes to set this up but I think there is no
point in proceeding at the moment.

     MR. COLLINS:  I think probably it would be desirable
to see it first because it may be thera are matters which
will oe clarified and which will obviate the need for
questioning.

     Sir, I was just wondaring what you were intending
about personnel.  It would seem desirable that anyone who
wishes to, who is here, if thera is room should come and
particularly perhaps the witness and any Police Officers
who are about to give evidence.

     LORD JUSTICE TAYLOR:   All those who are involved in
the Inquiry who are here may sea it and as many of the
public as there is room for as well.  It will be in the
Mandala Room and it is being set up as soon as possiole.

     MR. COLLINS:   Certainly I have ssaa two of them and
I Know Mr. Glasgow has saen at least two of them.  We can
probably get soma agreement as to which bits we can omit
and which bits we can show.

     LORO JUSTICE TAYLOR:      Does anybody else want to say
anything about this?

     MR. HYTNER:   Yes sir.  Just to fill the ten minutes
that we are waiting I want to make two points.  The first
is, which directly bears on this, my clients have
requested a view of the uncut videos, and obviously
relating to Leppings ....

   •-.LORD JUSTICE TAYLOR:     All sixty nine hours? '

     MR. HYTNER:   Not quite.  Only those relating to the
Leppings Lane terraces, and I think I ought to say that
the West Midlands Police and Mr. Collins have agreed in
principal that that will be done, so those, who wish,., and.
those who take medical advice as to whether they should;
will no douDt in due course see that.                     '

    Q. Was not one of the aspects of that problem that you foresaw
       the probability that those on the inside would be unable
       to control the crowd when it came in through the gates? -
       A. It was a possibility, sir.

    Q. And since that possibility was in your mind, it was also
       vital that as m uch warning as possible be given to those
B      who were to receive that crowd whether Officers or Stewards?
       - A. Yes sir.

    Q. Why did you attempt to contact Mr. Locke? - A. I personally
       did not try and contact Mr. Locke, Superintendent Murray
       took that responsibility on himself.

    Q. Am I right then in thinking that had Superintendent Murray
       not tried to do it, you would not personally have foreseen
       the need to contact anybody? - A. In my experience there,
       and it is difficult because it is with hindsight ....

    Q. Forgive me being rude, could I ask for the ansv/er first
       and then tell us what the reason for it is, if that does
       not sound rude? - A. On the day in question I did not
       think of contacting Mr. Locke but Mr. Murray did.
D
    Q. Would you now like to explain why?  Why did you not think
       of it? - A. Because I was dealing with the incident as I
       saw it.

    Q. It was simply an oversight on your part? - A. It was an
       oversight.

    Q. That is very kind.  Who is the Chief Steward? - A. Mr. Locke
       I am sorry, as I understand it it is Mr. Locke at Sheffield
       Wednesday who we liaise with.

    Q . You -thought that Douglas L o c k e , the retired Superintendent
        of "Police,- wassthe-.'Chief Steward at this ground? - A.
        understand that he is our contact and i'thought he was
        a Chief Steward.

    Q. Who was responsible for the disposition of Stewards at
       the West End of this ground, who is actually.in charge of
       them? - A. I cannot answer that question specifically.
       Do you mea n from the Club's p o i n t of view?

    Q. Unspecifically.  You always use that word and I d o n ’t know
       what_it means in the context in which you use it.    Give
       me any answer you like whether specific or general as to
       who was in charge of the Stewards at the vest find of t-.hr>
       ground or putting it bluntly ....  A. A representative
       of Sheffield Wednesday Football Club.

    Q. What was his name? - A. I don't know.

    Q. Putting it again bluntly, Chief Superintendent, you should
H      have known, shouldn't you, who was actually in charge of.

Q.   I am referring to any means.   - A. Oh.   Yes.

G.   It would have been possible, would it, to have got in touch
     with either an Inspector or with the steward in charge in the
     concourse? - A. Yes, my Lord.

Q. Well, why not do it? - A. Because it was not done, my Lord.
   It didn't cross my mind.

Q. Forgive me, Mr. Duckenfield.  I understand you have properly
   said that it was an oversight on your part not to have tried .
   to do something of that kind, but that Mr. Murray:did think
   of doing something, namely getting intouch with Mr.Locke.
   Is that right? - A. Yes, sir.

G.   In your presence? -    A. Yes, my Lord.                    -

0. But he failed to get in touch with Mr. Locke, c o u l d n ’t get
   through, but you then had been alerted to the idea of getting
   in touch with somebody by what Mr. Murray had decided to do? -
   A. Sir, because of the events I didn't appreciate at the time
   what he was doing.

Q. Ah. - A. The sequence of events is rapidly changing, ana
   people are taking courses of action, and Mr. Murray, knowing
   the situation, took it upon himself to speak-with M r . Locke.

G. But you did not realise at the time he was doing that? - A.
   N o , my L o r d .

Q.   I see.

G.         MR. GLASGOW:. . And so far as you were conc er n e d , Chief
     Superintendent, the gates were being opened, and more
     importantly, the decision or the consideration to. the opening
     of those gates was going on without you believing -that ^anybody
     on .the inside-was :being war n ed ? — A. Ncr;
     pieked --up -the- •information on the talk^throtrglr

G.   Yes.  The whole reason for the club providing you with their
     own radios was so that you in the Police control box could
     direct stewards if necessary as well as Police Officers, was
     it not?   A. Sir,; you will have to ask. Mrv'ttole for^the
     reasons . I am :aware that we had a radio.    I don^ t-know'that
     we directed stewards with that.

G. Well., Chief Superintendent, I am sorry, you are the man who
   was in charge on this day, and my questioning would be wholly
   different if you were even at this stage prepared frankly to
   concede that the Police made a muck up of this operation, but
   you .will not concede that, and therefore I-am putting to you
   as the senior Commanding Officer of this Police operation that
   your attempts to pass responsibility to the club are
   disreputable and unfair.   Do I make that plain? - A. I have
   heard what you have said, sir.

G. Yes.       It is right to say as we heard from your colleague,
                                    ^

     Chief Superintendent Mole, that the club has co-operated to
     the extent of vast expense in providing every single facility
     that the Police has asked of it, is not it? - A. Mr. Mole
     agrees with the co-operation, sir.

Q.   It is right they have provided probably the best and most
     expensive surveillance system in the country in the ground
     for the Police use? - A. It is an excellent system.

Q. Exclusively at their expense? - A. I don't know about that,
   sir.

Q.   It is right that they provide not only the radio link within
     the ground but that they provide you with the equipment so
     that you can break into that radio link and contact their own
     stewards directly?   That is right? - A. I didn't know that,
     sir, but I will accept it if it is correct.

Q.    You didn't even know that the Police control box       had the
     ability to override and break into the c l u b ’s radio system? -
     A. No, sir.

Q. You at least knew they handed over exclusive control of the
   Tannoy system, did you not? - A. Yes, sir, for emergency
   purposes.

Q. And you knew that that Tannoy system was checked every single
   g a m e to the satisfaction of the Police? - A. Yes, sir.

Q.   And despite the understandable criticisms which have been mac-
     of it in this crisis that occurred, would you agree with me
     is in fact probably one of the best Tannoy, systems -in any
     football ground in the country? - A. I can only speak of tv;;
     sir, at the moment, and it is a very good system.

■Q.. it ^isva' -veryogood .system.. .Can .you think of atvy-tfeingr,elee .\tni
     the-mlub couldr-have-done,.:whether by way -of •Bianp^we^          •
     financial expense which would have better _c©~oper.ate<i: with :r.
     Police than what.they did do? - A. No, sir.

Q.    On top of that, lest there be any misconception in a n y b o d y ’s
     minds- as to the extent to which the club simply exploited or
     took advantage of Police Officers to do their jobs, they
     actually paid something like £50-,000 to the Police to actuall
     provide the men every time they came to a match as big as
     this, did not they? - A. You are talking about payment for th
     resource?

Q. Yes, the actual paying for the Police? - A. Yes, they would
   pay for them, yes, sir.

          LORD JUSTICE TAYLOR:    That is something that has been
     established they have to do.

          MR. GLASGOW:      Oh, yes.    I w o n ’t press that further:

n    uhon von decided to override the control system of people
                                                          D.G. DUCKENFIELD


     coming into the ground you in effect not only failed to take
     advantage of all those facilities that had been made
     available to you but you deprived the club of the
     ability to co-operate in controlling the fans when'
     they came in.  Is not that fair?

          LORD JUSTICE TAYLOR:   I d i d n ’t follow the question.            My
     fault.  I lost the beginning of it.

           MR. GLASGOW:       It is probably mine, sir:

Q.   There are two parts to it, Chief Superintendent.  I will put
     them separately.  If you decide simply to open a gate and let
     the crowd in en bloc you are overriding all the control
     systems that have been set up and agreed upon? - A. Yes. sir.

Q. And if you do that without giving anybody warning:-either on
   the telephone, on the radio or by word of mouth, you are also
   overriding and ignoring all the communication, systems'-Which
   have been set up? - A. I think the point he is making, sir, is
   this.  I was attempting to save life and serious i n j u r y , and
   in my consideration of saving life and serious injury I
   decided to open those gates.  The other consequences at that
   time, whilst they were there, were not the prime
   consideration.

G.   Let me make it absolutely plain that I accept you acted in
     good faith on the spur of the moment and.that the mistake
     w h i c h you made was a bona fide and perfectly honourable-, o n e ,
     but you accept that it was a mistake, do you.not? - A .     what
     are you saying was a mistake?

G. Not to -teil- people what you were doing? - A. Attempts'were.:' ~
   made to tell, people what we were doing.        In the crisis of the
   moment the prime consideration was the saving of life a n d '
   s e r i o u s injury, and that was a prime consideration... .

G.   c h i e f - Superintendent , I- have accepted U p t t o 'that'stage: ai’l ' ” •
     your- bona: fidesr despite what^l am- respectfully puttlng Tt6"you
     was a mistake.        What I am challenging you on is your
     disreputable attempt to make the club responsible for that
     mistake.    D o n ’t you understand that? - A. ..I can understand -
     your line of questioning, sir.               :1   ; ~ : -que*-v-.-

G. Yes.  You have accepted that it was a mistake very candidly
   when my learned friend, Mr. Hytner, on my right asked you a
   question yesterday. - A. Can you just clarify that? What did
   I accept was a mistake?

Q. Opening the gate without warning anybody on the inside that
   you were going to do so? - A. I think with h i n d s i g h t ....

Q.   I see. - A. With hindsight I would say that that was a
     mistake.  The point is that at the time I had other
     considerations.                     .

Q. And other people under you were, you expected them, to be able
                              17
                                                      D.G. DUCKENFIELD


   to work through the consequences of that without you telling
   them? - A. Yes, sir.

Q. And to be fair to the men under you it is quite apparent, is
   not it, that somebody did have the forethought to work through
   the consequences before gate A was opened? - A. Yes.

Q. You know that now? - A. No,       I was aware of the consequences of
   gate A.

Q. Were you aware of the fact that somebody without orders from
   you had organised, I think-, two serials of Officers to receive
   the crowd as they came in through gate A? - A. Yes. there was
   serial 20 behind gate A, forming a funnel.

Q. Did you give any instruction to anybody as to what should
   h a p p e n and .how. those Officers should be deployed before gate A
   was opened? - A. No, sir.

Q. You now know, I think, that the two serials lined up to form a
   cordon to receive the crowd as it pushed through gate A? - A.
   Yes. sir, but that is the very point I am making.  Officers on
   Serial 20 behind gate A, anticipating the difficulty,
   organised themselves and took a course of action which would
   be in keeping with any directive of mine, and if we go back to
   the earlier situation in the enclosure. I said there were
   Officers there who understanding the situation when the gates
   were opened. I would hope would organise themselves.

Q. Were t h e re two serials of Officers inside gate C who on their
   own initiative could have formed up a cordon so as to. control
   the crowd as it entered? - A. Serials 14 and 15, sir.

Q. Putting it bluntly again, you expected the Officers in the
    concourse, of their own volition, to line up and form the
    cordon at gate G as they had done at gate A? - A. I did not
 ~. say. gate. C,-.:sir..   w o u l d say I expected, them^to. take, a course
    of action.'.which;, may>assist when gate. C was- opened.; ; ,      v

Q. Without orders? - A. Without orders, sir.           If we had the time
   to issue the instruction, but we did not.

Q. Do you know when gate A was opened? - A. Somewhere in the:
   region of after the order for the gates to be opened, it was
   after that, and I would think it must have been about 2.55.

Q. Yes.- I can tell you there is no secret about it, because this
   we shall see on the video you are going to watch and can
   be checked. That gate was in fact opened at 2.58, but that
   means some 6 minutes after gate C had been opened? - A. Y e s ,
   sir.

Q. Now, if you are right in saying that the order which you gave
   was "Open the gates", it would appear that somebody thought
   fit to delay for over 5 minutes before complying with that
   order in respect of one of those gates? - A. yes, sir.

    Q. Why do you think that was done? - A. I have no idea, sir.                                                 The
       instruction I gave was, "Open the gates".

    Q. And did you not even know whether that instruction was being
       complied with? - A. Superintendent Murray gave the instruction
       over the personal radio to open the gates.

B   Q. Did you not know whether or not your order was being complied
       with? - A. I could only see on the video gate C.

    Q. Would it surprise you to know that one of the Officers under
       your immediate command in the control box was. sufficiently
       concerned to zoom in on gate A, or did you not:know that the
       200 m was used at all? - A. I d i d n ’t know that., sir.


    Q.       But if it is right, as    we shall see that the     zoom was used
            respect of both gates, does that not show at least, somebody in
            your immediate command and physical presence in the control
            box was concerned to see precisely what was happening at -chose
            two gates? - A. Yes, sir.

    Q.       That would be the reason for zooming in on them? - A. Yes,
            sir.
D
    Q. And, Chief Superintendent, are you really saying that standing
       behind the men who were controlling those cameras and those
       screens you did not realise what they were doing, and didn't
       even see the results of what they were doing on the video
       screens displayed above you? - A. The activity in that control
       room at lO-to-3 or thereabouts on the 15th April, was              -
       considerable.   I have 7 monitors to watch, the. crowd scene and
       other situations, and I did not keep a const a n t .watch on every
       single screen.

    q   .        LORD JUSTICE TAYLOR:         Mr. Duckenf ield.,^1^ wowder-.-if I can
            clarify something.        I think you have agreect:wi.tlr. counsel that
            when gatex>A w a s ■;opened-, without any •in&£xucttxm:--f rpm^^ua&fcere•
            were two ,serxals,. had been put ;Xn- posLitixvv,-toixecei.vel,jtheitt5' w-A-i-v
            my Lord., I am aware of one, Serial 20...                      c.       ...

    Q. Yes, but I understood yesterday that you did say that when
       somebody in the control room said that gate A was going to go
       in anyway .unless it was opened < Sergeant..Higgins-.’I:-.-thinkryou
       said? - A. Yes, my Lord.

    Q. You instructed that every available Officer should attend in
       two places.  One of them was in the North Stand to control the
       landings there for these people that were coming in, and the
       other was on the perimeter? - A. Yes, my Lord.

    Q. Well, what I         was wondering is this.  Why you thought it
       necessary to         give an instruction to warn people to control the
       crowd coming         through gate A into the North Stand, but not the
       crowd coming         in through gate C? -A. It was the time factor, my
       Lord.                                       _
H   Q.      I am wondering - I would like you to deal-with it - I am

                                           D.G. DUCKENFIELD


wondering this.  In the North Stand there are individual
seats? - A. Yes, my Lord.

And I suppose if a lot of people come in there who are not the
seat holders there can be trouble? - A. Very much so.

But that was what you had in mind, was it? - A. Yes.




                      /Q. But am I to understand
                                            D. G. DUCKBMFIELD
                                                           —




Q. But am I to understand that so Ear as the gate C and tha
   terraces are concerned your view was simply as it had
   always been, that it was up to the fans to level,
   themselves out. because nobody had a particular place?
   - a . Yes my Lord.   But behind gate C there is a safety
   area.  Behind gate C there is an area of safety prior to
   the tecrace.

Q. You would not expect people wanting to go to the match to
   remain there would you?  - A. No my Lord.

q   .          MR. GLASGOW:    If I may just ask you the next
        question that I was going to ask about that single point
        with respect to what my Lord has put to you;      Was it not
        even more important to have what my learned friend
        M r . -Collins-called a 1ceception committee1; at gate C than
        at gate A?     - A. Yes sir.

Q.      Because in gate A, as we can see from the plan, those
        coming through ware already channelled in one direction in
        a relatively tight corridor.  - A. Yes.


Q. Whereas at gate C they were simply going to soill into the
   concourse and unless controlled go straight down.there.
   — A. Yes s i r .

q   . When the first - again I use the word "illicit",- che
      bursting through entry at 2.47 occurred, you have already
      told the Inquiry that you were concerned as to what the
      consequences of that might be.  - A. Yes sir.

Q.      Y o u had ..two means of checking your concern. --One-was— to
        look at: the video which was showing the entry :thcoug.hi-:that
        gate, would you agree?   - A. Yes sir.            ’        ....

Q. The second was to do the rather more old fashioned and
   less sophisticated thing of looking out of the window into
   the stand.  _   A. Yes.                     ..

Q. Did you do neither?            A. I looked at both sir:'     '

Q. And when you looked out of the window, down into the stand
   as we see in the last photograph of the bundle, did you
   not see the impact that that sm a l l, relatively small, crowd
   had on pens 3 and 4 when it came through the tunnel just
   after 2.47?  - A. No sir.   I don't recall any impact.

Q. You didn't notice any effect on the crowd of the men
   coming through the tunnel at 2.47?  - A. My specific
   recollection is that I didn't notice a distinct
   difference.

                                      D. G. DUCKENFIELD




Q. Let us look at the vidao because you say you looked at the
   vidao as wall.   If you did look at the vidao at 2.47 how
   on earth do you think you hava forgotten- the fact that its
   operator had zoomed up close on that gata to see what was
   •going on? -   A. Sir I don't recall accurately whara the
   camera was tracking at a particular moment in time.

Q.   But you did see and look at the way in which the crowd
     entarad at 2.47 and what I keep calling the 'illicit1
     entry.  -  A. Yes sir.

Q.    And did you sea that although it has been very fairly said
     that the fans walkad in in an orderly fashion at the
     sacond entry when the gates were flung wide, a large number
     of them ran through whan tha gata was opened the first
     time.   Did you notice that?  - A. You ara saying that a
     large number ran through on tha first ....

Q.    Yes, that thera ware a large number to besaen running on
     tha vidao.  That is what I am suggesting.  -   A. Yas
     there was a crowd rushing in.

Q.   Rushing you v/ould use. - A. On the first one, on the
     occasion whan the Polica horse recovered the situation.

Q. Did you actually sea that one or two oc possibly three men
   fell.to the ground whan that rush came in?     A. I don't
   recall that sir.

Q. Hava you not seen that on tha video, that there is what
   looks like a scuffle and there is at least one, and
   probably two, and possibly three men falling to the ground
   in front of that crowd?   Did you not notice? — A. No
   sir.  I will .accept that if you say that.              '

Q.   By the time that: crowd, in your word, rushed in you had
     already become concerned at the way in which the crowd
     already in pens 3 and 4 were distributing themselves were
     you not?  -  A. It was filling sir.

Q. No, you were already concerned at the way in which they
   were distributing themsalvas.  -  A. I had noticed earlier
   that the central two pens were filling more so than the
   wings.

Q. Were you concerned about the way in which the crowd in
   pens 3 and 4 were distributing themselves?  - A. I was
   aware the pens were filling sir, but had not got to the
   po x n t «...

Q.        LORD JUSTICE TAYLOR:    Mr. Duckanfield I think it is
     a very simple question, I don't know that the answer may
     ba simple but that is the question and I wonder -if you
                                         D. G. DUCKENFIggD




     would please try and answer the question.     -   A. I wasn't
     concerned.

Q. You weren't concerned?      -   A. Not at that stage.

Q.         MR. GLASGOW:   I thought that you told the Inquiry
     yesterday that you had - one of the few orders you did
     give - you personally had ordered a tannoy message broad­
     cast to those specific fans to distribute themselves more
     sansib.ly.  -  A. That was much earlier sir.

Q.   How much earlier?     A. I think on reflection, remember­
     ing from my statement, somewhere in the region of 2.30;

Q.   So some quarter-of-an-hour earlier or 20 minutes?       - A.
     Y 23 .

Q.   In fact only a quacter-of-an-hour before the first rush. -
     A. Yes sir.

Q. And when you had that announcement made had the crowd in
   fact distributed itself in the way in which you wanted
   them to?  - A. I didn't monitor exact movements but there
   had been movement across the terrace.

Q.   Had the crowd distributed itself in    the way in which you
     wanted them to?  Were you satisfied    with the situation   ‘
     which you could see in front of you    in pens ....  - A. I
     was satisfied with the situation as    I saw it.

Q. Obviously I. am only asking about what you saw Chief
   Superintendent.   You are seriously saying that the view of
   the crowd building up in pens 3 and 4 between half-past-2
   and quacter,-to-3 was satisfactory in yotit 'Vievr?^'^
   sir.                .                  ■:

Q. Knowing as you did that there wasn't a single Police
   Officer in that pen even at the gates at the rear?   -           A.
   Yes sir.

Q. You knew that, and you knew, like Chief ■ Supierintehdent
   Mole, that no Sheffield Wednesday stewards would be there.
      A. At the back of the pens?

Q. Y e s -    A. Yes s i r .

Q. And therefore, like Chief Superintendent Mole, you were
   celying upon the good sense of that crowd to distribute
   themselves evenly, or in Chief Superintendent Mole's
   words, to ease out to the outer pens.  - A. Yes sir.

Q.   And you are seriously saying to the Inquiry that from what
     you saw with your own eyes looking down on those pens they
                             24

                                       D. G. DUCKENFIELD




     were easing themselves out satisfactocily between half-
     past-2 and a quarter-to-3?  -  A. Yes sir.

Q. You realised of course that the Club's control in the
   bowels of the South Stand did not give them any video
   pictures of that stand, didn't you?  -   A. Yes sir.

Q. And so if you had been concerned, and I accept that you
   say you were not, but that if you had been concerned the
   Club control would only know of that if you either 'phoned
   them or radioed them?  -   A. Yes sir.

Q.   Did you know -that in addition to the radio there was a
     direct land-line telephone between the Police Control Box
     and the Club Box?   - A. Yes sir.

Q. And so that any difficulty in getting through on the radio
   could immediately, instantaneously, be solved by picking
   up a telephone with a direct link?  - A. Yes sir.

Q.   If anybody, any of your Officers, was seriously concerned
     to contact Mr. Locke, or the Police Liaison Officer in the
     Club Box at any time, the most obvious thing to do would
     be to pick the 'phone up wouldn't it?  - A. Yes sir.

Q. And would we be right in supposing that the only reason
   why abortive attempts were made to use the Club's radio
   was because you simply didn't -know where Mr. Locke was
   stationed on that day?  - A. I didn't know sir.

Q.   Because if you or Superintendent iMurray had known    that he
     was where he ought to have been, with respect, in     the
     Control Room, you would have used the telephone?      - A.
     Yes s i r .         '

Q.   Finally, Chief Superintendent^ may I come to the account
     which you gave of this incident after it had occurred,
     because I am concerned with the effect that that has had
     on my clients as   well as others. It is right to say isn'c
     it that when you decided to withhold the information that
     the decision to let people into the grouned had been a
     Police one, you withheld that information from everybody on
     the afternoon in question.    -  A. Yes sir.

Q.   For my part I can accept that the initial embarrassment, if
     you li:<e, to say something to Mr. Kelly may have been done
     on the spur of the moment, you persisted in that deception
     throughout the afternoon.   - A. Thera was good reason sir
     not to tell the crowd what had occurred.

Q. Was there good reason not to tell my clients, the officers
   of the Club?  -   A. I felt so sir at the time.

                                         D. G. DUCKENFIELD




Q. You actually went to the boardroom of the Club, because
   they w a nted to be told what was going on on their ground,
   didn't you?    - A. Yes sir.

Q. And when you went to the boardroom and saw the directors,
   who were extremely concerned, you would agree?  - A. Yes
   sir.

Q. You didn't think it right even to tell them within the
   confines of the boardroom, as the officers of the Club,
   that the disaster had been what you regarded as an
   unforeseeable consequence of a Police decision?  - A. No
   sir.

Q. Did you realise, or did you even consider, that the
   possibility of that deception would lead to very unfair
   stories being circulated about the Club officers as wall
   as Police Officers the following day?  - A. Sir at that
   time I acted in good faith.

Q. Yes, but did you consider the possible consequences for
   others?  Let us look at them.  Did you think about what
   people might write and say about Superintendent Marshall?
   -  A. At that time sir ....

Q. Well did. you think or not?      -   A. I didn't think of the
   consequences.

Q. Did you think about the consquences for the Club and its
   officers, that people might very reasonably ••write1stories
   about the irresponsible behaviour of the Club stewards?
   Did you think of that?      - A. No sir, but at that time -I'"
   had m a n y things on my mind, not the least of which was a :
   disaster.,- and.-it was-a- very tragic, very serious
   situation-/ and--I"was- acting in what I “thought- was- t h e r best
   interes t s .

Q. Did you tell the Assistant Chief Constable the truth?
   A. Yes sir.

Q. You told Mr. Jackson?  - A. Not until - it is difficult
   to say at what time, but I certainly spoke to him about
   it.

Q. He came to the Control Box in his civilian clothes         because
   he was obviously concerned as soon as the invasion         first
   started.  I'm sorry, that is a silly word to use.          As soon
   as the perimeter fence was first climbed over.  -          A. Yes
   sir.

Q. At that stage of course you already knew what the cause
   had been. - A. Yes sir.

                                            D. G. DUCKENFIELD




    Q. Was there any conceivable reason for withholding that
       information from the Assistant Chief Constable?     A. I
       am not sure when he first came in he knew the full
       circumstances sir.
B
    Q.   Well Mr. Duckenfisld let me help you.  He went with you to
         the boardroom to see the directors, and he stood by in
         that boardroom unaware of the fact that you were not
         telling my clients the truth, didn't he?  - A. Yes sir.

    Q.    And you, when  giving the account to them of what happened,
         realised that the deception which was being practised upon
         them was also being practised upon the Assistant Chief
         Constable in your presence by you.    - A.- I think that is
         an unfair comment, sir, about deception.    It was a
         decision I made in the best interests I thought of the
         operation.

             HR. HYTNER:    I wonder, sir, before Mr. W o o d w & p d ^ r o s s -
       examines, m a y I just put two more questions really arising
       out of matters that I had no knowledge of when I cross-examined?

              LORD JUSTICE TAYLOR:   Yes, Mr. Hytner.
               Further Cross-Examined by MR. H Y T N E R :
    q .       MR. HYTNER:   Mr. Duckenfield, now we know wha t you
B       said later to the Board and to your Assistant Chief Constable,
        you have given your explanation as to w h y you did not wish
        to  tell the truth and I am not going to pursue that.   What
        I want to ask you is why in deciding to suppress the truth
        you also decided to tell a lie about the supporters/ about
        the Liverpool fans.   Why couldn't you have.simply said'you
        did not know w hat had happened? - A. In the crisis of the
        moment, sir, with all those pressures that are so evident,
        I can't give an honest answer other than the stress of the
        situation.

    Q. You realise do you, that that lie for which you cannot give
       an explanation, has caused widespread slandering of the fans
       not only here but also in Europe? - A. My intention in ray
       action sir was not to cause any distress.

D   Q. Well in that case, this is my last question, since that was
       not your intention, would you now take the opportunity of
       publicly exonerating the fans? - A. Publicly exonerating
       the Liverpool supporters sir?

    Q.- Yes? - A. For w hat exactly?

    Q. For the overcrowding behind the goal at the Leppings Lane
       end which caused 95 deaths? - A. I am in some difficulty
       with that answer, sir.  I would apologise for any inference
       with Liverpool supporters as a whole.

    Q. Mr. Duckenfield, let me make it plain,. I am.sprry I have
       o v e r ru n my- two questions, that I am no^...?^kiligu}yo%c*tajnitS&t'i.c,

       to exonerate the fans for the overcrowding in Pens 3 and 4
       whi ch caused 95 deaths? - A. Yes, I publicly apologise sir
       for the-inference that people caused those d e a t h s ./: : : -

              MR. HYTNER:      Thank you.

             _ MR. JACKSON:  Sir, we indicated at the outset that
       m y learned friend Mr. Hytner and I would not ask the same
       questions but it is quite apparent that those questions
       asked by Mr. Hytner in fact covered the virtual entire
       remit of matters I wo ul d      have put to the Police Officers
       in this case.

             M a y I associate myself with the questions and parti­
       cularly accept the apology and observations made by the
       Chief Superintendent.

                           Cross-Examined by MR. W O O D W A R D :

    Q. Mr. Duckenfield, is this right, that insofar as you have been
       responsible for any misunderstanding or misleading, you
       unreservedly withdraw and apologise? - A. I do sir.

    Q. W hat time did you get home after these events on the 15th
B      of April 1989? - A. About half-past-1 in the morning sir.

    Q. And is it right that the time came when the investigation
       and consideration of w hat happened at Hillsborough was
       passed to the West Midlands Constabulary? - A. Yes sir.

    Q. Although Sheffield or the South Yorkshire Police have been
       relieved of the burden of that, have you been considering
       this matter and had it on your mind at all since it happened?
       - A. It has been on my mind daily and almost hourly sir.

    Q. Mr. Duckenfield, plainly many many people will have been
       grievously affected by what happened that day.   We do not
       seek to diminish our sympathy for them in that tragedy,
       but what has been the effect on you?      - a . Quite a
       traumatic effect, sir, very sad and on some occasions
D      difficulty recalling accurately times and sequence of events,
       although they are accurate from my recollection.

    Q. And insofar as you are able to join with those, do you
       extend your sympathies and heartfelt feelings to those
       who have been'involved? - A. Sir, my deepest sympathy
       goes out to them.  I cannot say enough on that matter.

    Q. You have given evidence before-the Inquiry according to
       your recollections? - A. Yes sir.

    q   . Thinking about the matters, hearing and understanding,from
          otli^'r!1^e6p;re ;•their xecollections and- their •understandings v
          6f ptlitte','      “you experienced any surprtsre :‘

          - A. Yes sir.

    Q. In w ha t and how in general has that been? - A. I have a
       clear picture in my mind of events of the day but I have
       found with video tape and information since that my
       sequence on occasions is incorrect.

    Q. Nevertheless do you still have that clear sequence in your
       mind? - A. The sequence and the events of the day will
       never leave me.

    Q. However, that recollection that you have in a number of
       respects do you understand that it is out of synchronisation
       w ith wh a t others recall? - A. Yes sir.

    Q. And is inconsistent in some respects with w hat others
       state? - A. Yes sir.
H
For example you have told the Inquiry that you recall a
message to the supporters in the W est E n d 'terrace to move
forward to allow others to come in? - A. Yes sir.

Do you remember at what time that was given? - A. No sir.

Does it surprise you that there is evidence that that
indication was given some time between 2 o'clock and 2.15?
- A. I am surprised sir.

What was your impression of when that happened.  What is your
impression of when that was given? Not what others tell
you, but what is your persisting impression of when that
happened? - A. I would have thought that might be later,
sir.
According to e v i d e n c e , another; ;exSmple, t h e r e ^ i s -indication
that a request came from Hr. Marshall to close Leppings
Lane.  Do you have a clear impression, your own impression
   when that occurred? - A. Yes sir, my perception was.that
it was about half-past-2 and the thing that sticks in my
mind is the bus that wen t past and I wondered why he wanted
it closed.  I related that to 2.30.

Ar-e you aware in fact that there is evidence that that
was given or will be evidence that that request occurred
at about 2.17? - A. Yes sir.

How does that information and the, knowledge of that, other
evidence equate with your recollection. -Whatsisqyour: ,■i :
response to that? — A. I am surprised sir.

Another example, I don't intend to go through them all
because the evidence will in d u e course b t j>uttl^fore.; :
the Inquiry.   You will recall an endeavour“by^Mr*. .Murray
Who was -in the Control Box t o . c o r a m u n i c & f c © ; - i
- A. Yes sir.                       ■     " ^                 •

 ^jviat is' your recollection of what', it was^t-hat Mr^'Murr-ay
 was tryihg to say? ^ A. I can*tr remember sir wha± *e-w as
 trying to s a y .
           an -impression may have b e e n recei.ved ,frpm :*y9U.rrv;
 Y e s t e r d a y

 that the gates were going to be opened? - A. Yes sir.

 Would you just like to think about it for a moment and
 doing the best you can please try and help us what your
 recollection is, or what it was that Mr. Murray was saying,
 if you heard it? - A. I did not hear it, sir.

 So when you gave your understanding yesterday of what it
 was  what were you drawing upon in order to answer those
 questions? - A. An impression based on five weeks ago, sir.

                                  ‘34        D.G. DUCKENFIELD


        Q. You see Mr. Murray did indeed endeavour to contact Mr. Locke
           but it was not concerning the words:  "The gates are going
           to be opened" or any warning to that effect.  Do you follow?
           - A. Yes sir.

        Q. If that is the case and that turns out to be the evidence,
           how does that accord w ith your impression of what was
    B      happening at the time? - A. It would appear that I was
           confused on the occasion, sir.

        Q. May I ask you about the Control Room in which you were? -
           A. Yes sir.

        Q. We have seen the photographs of it, at the back of West
           Midlands 2.  In that Control Room can one see a number
           of telephones? - A. Yes sir. , ;                  .....

        Q. Various other items of and for communication? - A. Yes.sir.

   especially on photograph No. 29, the first one.

   those terraces in addition to those that were already there

   job? - A. Yes, sir.

G.   Did it occur to you at that time that if others should have

Q. The control of the gates comprised of the Police Force having

   that there should be a Policeman' at those gates throughout a
   game? - A. No, sir.

Q. Or even at the beginning of a game? - A. No, sir.

Q. Or even before the game started? - A. No, sir.

         o f ‘its own? - A. I don't know the fine technical detail, sir.

    Q. Did you know also that the club had the facility to and were
       viewing the Police monitors? - A. I didn't know that, sir.

    Q. Did you know that the club had down in that room the ability
       to call for sight.of whatever was being shown on any of the
B      Police monitors? - A. I was not aware of that, sir.

    Q. Was there a Policeman down in the control room?        Did you know
       that? - A. Yes, sir.

    Q. Mr. Guest? - A. Yes. sir.

    Q. Mr. Guest had radio contact with the control room? - A. Yes.
       sir.

    Q.   Is it right that the club, through that control room, through
         its 'room, had facility to communication with the Police
         control room? - A. Yes, sir.

    G. W h e t h e r ;it be right or wrong, and the evidence will have to be
       looked at, did you have any doubt that the club would be aware
D      of what the state of the crowds were in the various parts of
       the ground? - A. No, sir.

    G.    You had     no doubt, but whether it be right orwrong is another
         matter? - A. Yes, sir.

       do you know what is meant by talk-through? - A. Yes. sir,

    Q.    Is that a- facility on the Police individual radios? - A .   Yes.
         sir.

    Q.   Is-that channel 19? - A. Yes, sir.

    Q. What does'talk-through mean? - A. It is an open channel'
       whereby any conversation-between, the parties on that link,
       that is the Constables, Sergeants, and the control room, it i
       an open airwave where all conversations can be heard.

    Q. And that is the Police radio? - A. Yes, sir. .

    Q. However, whilst all conversations can be heard does that mean
       that everybody can speak? - A. There are difficulties, sir.

    Q. What" are the difficulties as you understand them? Whether
       rightly or wrongly, what is your understanding of them? - A.
       More than one person can try and communicate at once, and if
       they do so difficulties occur with the messages. ■becoming

                   NINTH DAY *S PROCEEDINGS

                   FRIDAY   26 TH MAY,   19 89

                     (Afternoon Session)

           Cross-axamined by MR. WOODWARD (cont.)


Mr. Duckenfield before I go to the major incident I am
as!<ed to correct something that was put to you this
morning in relation to talx-through, do you follow?
A. Yes sir.

Tal<-thr.ough is .not a particular channel, it is a
particular facility that is available for different
channels.   - A. Yes sir.

And one can switch to it', and then while you are operating
on that channel it exists for all who possess radios who
are listening and using them.    The major incident I was
going to ask. you about, do you have with you volume 2 of
the South Yorkshire documents?    - A. Yes sir.

I am going to ask you simply about the procedure, the
major incident manual is ifound after tab 24, and if we
look- at section 4 there it says 'The Alert' do you have
it?      A. Yes.

           "If notification is received, zhe
           information must be passed immediately
           to the Force Operations Room who will
           alert the other emergency services that
           a major incident may have occurred and
           t h a t :the Police are implementing the           . .
     .     major incident plan."                             ...

So according to that, once the alert has been raised then
Force Operations have a-role to fulfil.  - A. Yes sir.

"And if" one goes to -section 7, page ,1 of. that ,- a'few "pages
further on, entitled "Force Operations Room", daes.it
there identify, amongst the responsibilities of the
Operations Room, at B, the function and task of alerting
the emergency services and other authorities and depart­
ments whose facilities and expertise will be needed.          - A.
Yes sir.

So once this procedure is set in train, for example by
communication from someone such as yourself, what
responsibility or role do you then have in calling for
those services?     A. I don't have any, sir, they are all
with Force Operations Room.
                                    D. G. DUCKENFTELD




A point was out to you concerning the number of Police
Officers who appeared on the pitch to form the cordon,
yesterday, and in relation to those Officers who appeared
on the pitch to form the cordon right across it after the
•incident had become apparent is it your understanding
 that those Officers will have come from within the ground,
from the Force already on site as it were?   - A. I can't
be accurate in that reply sir.

It: is unlikely isn't it that they have come from
'Operation Support'?   - A. I would think so.

Now may I ask you, not in great detail, but a little about
the events of that day.  The build-up of people outside
the turnstiles in the numbers and throng that we sea on
the tapes, was that something that you had anticipated
occurring?  - A. I had anticipated a football crowd
gathering, yes sir.

Had you anticipated the sort oc difficulties that the
Officers there experienced?  - A. No sir.

Did there come a time when you asked for assistance to come
from reserve within the stadiun?  - A. Yes sir.

Do you remember what time that was or not?            -   A. NTo sir.

That, was to get reserves to go to gate. A, Serial 20 I
think, was one of the serials that turned up....-   A. Yes
sir.

Are you aware that that serial was unable immediately to
get out of gate A?  - A. Yes sir.

Were you. aware at the time?           A. No sir .              x -r* -

Are .you aware.--that in fact the gate was• locked .and-it ,was
a little while before the gate was undone to enable those
serials to get out?     - A. No sir, I wasn't aware of that.

Becaaise;'±t :h.as"'b.een::put to: you: thatvthererwere: tines :b£ ?-■■■
OfCicacs. inside .gate A waiting; to receive ..people who twere-
going to be let in, do you follow?           - A. Yes sir.

Was that something you had arranged for or not?             -   A. No
sir.

Was that serial, or some of those men that were there, men
that you had intended to go outside through the gate?  Do
you recall or not?  - A. I don't recall sir.

While in the Control Room viewing the scene, viewing the
material that was coming through to you, did you
                      45
                                 D. G. DUCKENFIELD




appreciate that an emergency had developed, or was in the
making outside the turnstiles?  - A. Not initially sir.

But then it was appreciated?     -   A. Yes sir.

Now gate C I think was indeed opened on the two occasions
that our attention has been drawn to on the videos.  - A.
Yes sir.

That first opening of the gate, was that something you had
intended to happen or not?  - A. M o sir.

And when it did happen a number of people came       in through
it.  - A. Yes sir.

Is it right Officer that that opening was not as a result:
of any direction that you gave at that time?  - A. Yes
sir.

The ingress of people on that occasion, did it appear to
you where you    stood and where you viewed matters to have
any impact or    serious effect upon people in the stadium?
   A, No s i r .

In the situation in which you were, foe whatever reason,
did you foresee that people coming in through that gate at
that time might have a serious impact on people sn.the^
terraces?   - A. No sir.

In fact did you give any thought at that time, when con­
templating or considering the question of the gates being
opened, making any provision within the enclosure, that is
between the turnstiles and the terraces?  - A. No sir.

Why was that-? --- •:A. .There were Officers in that area
already s i r .

And what aid you expect that they would do?  - A. I
expected them to monitor the situation, and if they saw
difficulties to take action.

Bur. did you _axpec-t them, actually, to form-a;cordon or-'--     -
anything at that stage or not?       -    A. Mo sir.

When gate C was opened the second time did you anticipate,
rightly or wrongly, that there would be any need to do any­
thing within the enclosure?  - A. No sir.

Had you been looking at all at the situation on the
terraces?  - A. Yes.

And what is your recollection now of the scene of the
people that were there?  - A. A state of normality sir.
                                       D. G. DUCKENFIELD




I chink you have seen some vidao just now of 1988.                  -   A.
Y as sir.

You weren't at the game         in 1988?     -   A. No sir.

The stata of: the terraces according to your recollection
now at the time that gate C was opened the second time,
how does that accord with your understanding then of a
normal state on the terraces?   -  A. A crowded situation
s i r , out n o r m a l .

May I as< you about this.    Did you know that in fact a
ga-te- was made open and forced: open against -the atf'ort-s’ of
Police Officers?    -  A. Quite separately to gate C sir?

Yes.    -   A. No sir.

Did you know that .one of the peripheraL g a t e s , the -
L a p p i n g s Lane perimeter gates, was forced open against the
bolring of it and against the efforts o:f Officers?- -        A.
No sir.

The conversation that you had in the Control Room; with, the

Q. I follow that thinking but what I am concerned about is
   that you appear to have conveyed the impression as part
   of not telling w h a t actually had happened, that it was
   the breaking down of a gate by the fans that had actually
   caused the trouble.     That is what the media picked up and
   that is what the me dia broadcast? - A. When I was in that
   Control Room, ve r y difficult, very tense situation, and
   you have seen the size of the Control Room and from the
   pitch you have seen the difficulties that we were facing.

Q. Chief Superintendent, I don't want to interrupt you but
   that is not an answer to the question? - A. I know, I am
   coming to the point.           There were many people asking
   questions of me.          There were many people wanting decisions
   and the o p e n i n g and. the closing of that door.        M r . Kelly
   came in with Mr. Mackrell, another person wanting an
   iinineSilSt# •'Shswe-if '-to;a difficulty, and I was-in the m i d s t :of
   other things. 'I' tried as best I could to deal with my                  ,-
   own .situation sat isfying my policing needs ....with the crowd
   and in some w a y s - t h i s may seem u n u s ual , -being polite to-
   Mr. Kelly and saying:           "Look, this is the situation", in,
   whatever words I said it and hoping he would leave me
   very quickly so that I could get on with the matter in hand.

Q. The only reason I am asking you this is that in the light
   of your answer to Mr. Woodward, I am wondering why you
   thought it would be less likely to lead to disorder to
   tell the true position than to imply that it was the fault
   of the'fans. ■ Soiae-might say- or might think that that would
   be more -likely to-create disorder? - A V Sir, with hindsight
   today w e can all- look differently at that situation., I acted
   as I believed to be correct in a crisis moment.

           MR. COLLINS:      Yes, very well.

         MR. HYTNER:    May I just correct something Mr. Collins
   has pu-t-because i t may n o t be absolutely ■accurate.,

         ■ '-'-The impression -I have from the vast number, of,,state-. .
  .ments that I have read and from the evidence that has been
   given, is that the hostility of the fans after the match
   towards the Police was in large part, certainly in large
   - p a r t ' m a y liave:-befen in sole part, due., to their perception
   of What the Police -were doing on the pitch, and o n the track.

         MR. COLLINS:   Yes, I am obliged.  I think that may
   well be right and although I think it was a combination
   of the two and actually those who listened to that video
   a little later will hear, I think we all heard on the
   television, fans w ith tickets complaining that the Police
   had opened the gate and let them in to the overcrowded
   pen, so I think it is fair to say it is a combination of
   both.

Q. Mr. Duckenfield, you were saying there was a risk if you
   gave the full truth it might get out to the media and
   cause disorder? - A. Yes.

Q. That prevented you from giving the full truth? - A. Yes, ray
   Lord.

Q. There is nothing to stop you telling the Assistant Chief
   Constable what had happened, was there, when he came into
   the Control Room? - A. No sir,

Q.    Did you tell him? - A. Ho, I think h e .asked          me_ questions sir
      and I rel&ted to -thei incident on 'the pitch.            :
      him the full picture at that time.                       ..__

q.    Did you mention that the gate had been opened;    that fans
      had got in-through an open gate? - A.- I can't be specific,    -
      my Lord-. ''I must have mentioned-about .the situation-on the
      pitch and briefly what had occurred, X;mean about the first
      gate opening, but the full details including the actions
      by Superintendent Marshall and what had fully developed,      .•
     ’I did not give him the full picture.

Q. You did not tell him that you had given authority for the
   gate to be opened? - A. No, my Lord.

   the Police Staff College on the Directing Staff?

You mentioned Maine Road in Manchester.  Does that mean
that you had experience in policing events at that Football
Ground? - A. Yes, I did.

And at any other football ground or not? - A. Mo, mainly
Maine Road.

Maine Road is, speaking from memory, a ground which has
slightly smaller capacity than Hillsborough, I think? - A.
Yes, it is, but in a very similar sort of area.

Does it provide or produce similar problems to Hillsborough
or not? - A. I think all football grounds of that size
and those areas provide similar problems.

The particular problem at Hillsborough which we have identi£ie<
is of-course-this narrow entrance: a t Leppings Lane, but I think
you would accept it is a problem, it is a bottle neck, isn't
it? — A.-Yes> I have been listening to the evidence and I
think bearing      in mind we have policed Hillsborough for a ;
n u mbed of “years -and this is the first occasion that I have-;
noticed it has caused this sort of problem.

Well looking at it now it is plain that it is a problem.
Right?   A. I wou ld say it is a problem if you get circum-. -
stances like we had on the 15th of April.

Do I understand from the answer you have just given that it
was 'nev-e-r f'c^reseeR by you that it would create ar problem?^,
- A. No.                                     -

That- is correct, is it, you never foresaw the possibility
of a problem^-at-Leppings Lane? - A. N o , I., didn.11 .. ; .

You never foresaw that it was a bottle neck or.could produce
a jam with a crowd outside? - A. I think generally speaking                 _
the O-f-ffc’e^^-^ho*-li3ve served there have ioo.ke'd'vuppn it h-,-,-.-. ■■
as i ■naCur’a'l -f-unne;l--for getting fans in" an'd. Jiot pne l.ike.iy;: >
to cause problems.

So it was a surprise to you when this problem arose? - A. I
certainly was sir,.

Let me 'noW'-
            'ckjm^-,'t©''y<!5fur time at South Yorkshire,. .;W e -know-;......
that there was a semi-final held in 1987 at Hillsborough,
that is the Leeds/Coventry match? - A. Yes.

Were you concerned in any way with the arrangements in respect
 of that? - A. Yes, I was concerned in overseeing the
planning of all three semi-finals.

You were, we know, responsible for the            introduction of
the document at our number 11 which is            the update of the
Standing Instructions for the Policing            of Football Matches?
- A. Y e s .
Can I ask you to turn to that- document           please, Mr. Jackson.
It is Tab 11? - A. Yes.

    Q. As we can see from the first page, that is the covering*letter
       from yourself, and it is dated 20th March, 1986, and came into
       being as we can see as a result of the Poppleweil
       recommendations? - A. That is correct, sir.

    Q. I just want to go through one or two specific matters so we
       can just see what your thinking was, because no doubt you
B      intended any future plan for all the football grounds in South
       Yorkshire should comply with the principles set out in this
       document? - A. That is correct.

    Q. Which would no doubt be updated if necessary from time to                          '
       time? - A . Y e s .

    Q.      In fact.,:.'did i.t prove to be necessary .to .update It before the
            match with which we are concerned? - A. No, it has not.         -v:

    Q. One of the recommendations, looking at' y o u r covering -letter,-'-
       Recommendation 10, is the questipn of trailing: o f -steward sv

    Q. Can we go on a bit to page 39,                 "Crowd monitoring,           16":

              "They should detail what methods exist within the ground
              to observe and assist in crowd movement for evacuation
              p u r p o s e s , and should include the closed-circuit
              television facilities if available, with location of
              control points, spotters, etc".

         - A . Yes.

    Q. And you envisaged no doubt that the Police should have an
       input on that to maintain or to achieve the best possible
       means of ensuring that there was a safe evacuation of crowds?
       - A. Yes, this would*be for all, e mergency services and the
       club.

    Q.   Indeed.     Then 18,     "Additional Information” :

    '.      ' :"The following :points are put f o r w a r d ‘far•consideration-:';
               (a)  Local conditions, for example, whether .emergency. .

         - A. Yes.

    Q. That is obviously of very great importance.        There may be .
        evidence here that there was some problem with access to the

    Q. Can I ask you to look at 18(d) at the bottom.                           It talks about:

             . "Therlocation of special equipment, if any, for example,
               white tape, loud hailers, first-aid, seek and search
               lamps, fluorescent jackets and banners".

         - A . Yes.

    Q. Do you know what the position was in relation to liaison
       information about those sort of facilities? - A. I don't, sir.

    Q. And then, on page 40, specifically in relation to stewards,                                No.

              "Stewards should be distributed throughout the ground in
              accordance with a detailed prearranged schedule agreed
              between the Police and management".

         Was there any such schedule as far as you are aware? - A. What
         usually happens at all the football g r o u n d s i n South Yorkshire
         is that the stewards are briefed by the Inspector on the day
         in terms of where they should go and what their
         responsibilities are.

    Q. Yes, but this is your Police recommendations.  Indeed, it is
       your specific standing instruction, and it says in terms:

              "A detailed prearranged scheduled agreed between the
             .Police and th e m a n a g eme nt ’’.

         Was there any .such schedule? - A. Well , n o v because I. think
         that varies from game to game, because sometimes you*have
         small crowds and sometimes you have big crowds, and there is
         no doubt: the.^Divisional Commander will identify with the club
         possibly -the number, of stewards, depending on the .game,. and
         then a briefing will take place at the ground where Inspectors
         will discuss matters with the stewards.

    Q. Was it within your contemplation, Mr. Jackson, that stewards
       should be on the terraces rather than in the stands? - A. I am
       not sure about that, but stewards should be deployed wherever
       they can control the crowds that come in and place them in a
       safevplace'-iri>.rthe Iterraces,. I ,understand,. if. necessary . ■•••: •

    Q . And yoU- were aw are-of that?,   ,-r   A .- Yes..

    Q. This is dated 8 th June 1988.     Perhaps you would take it from
    • •me, Mr. Jackson, that there is nothing in that-which indicates
       that the stewards are going to be on the terraces at all?               It

       or the need for stewards to remain at their posts unless told
       to leave them, and     it deals at the end with emergency
       evacuation procedure. - A. I accept what you say, sir.

    Q.    It is true it does not say in terms the stewards are not to
         deal with the terraces. - A. That is right.

    Q.   It simply does not    indicate they are? - A. Yes.

    0.   It rather suggests  it looks as if the club did not anticipate
         that their stewards would be on the terraces? - A. ..Weil,
         certainly, it is not something I would have anticipated.

Q. For the very obvious reason, no doubt, you c a n ’t expect
   Wednesday stewards particularly to be on away terraces with
   opposition fans? - A. No, I think they should be.

Q. Do you? - A. Yes, I do, indeed.  I think they are firmly

Q.         LORD JUSTICE TAYLOR:          I am sorry, I thought you said a
      moment ago, ” 1 would not anticipate there would be stewards on
      the terraces"? - A. No, what I said, my Lord, it does not say
      in this memorandum here.        I accepted what was said, that irr
      this memorandum it does not say that the stewards should be on
      the terraces.        This is a Divisional Memorandum, but certainly
    - I wc«ld-have expected the. stewards to be involved in all areas
      of the g r o u n d .

Q.      I am sorry then;-- I don't know what it was that I noted down,
        perhaps wrongly, that you said you would;not anticipate.

Q.         MR. COLLINS:   Well, it was that.  May be you did not
        understand the question. - A. I apologise.

O.          LORD JUSTICE TAYLOR:     You would anticipate them to. be on
        the terraces? - A. Yes, I would.

q   .       MR. COLLINS:      Although it may appear from these
        communications that the club certainly did not anticipate they
        would be ;on the •terraces? - A. That i s-rig ht....-

        this, that sadly there was no clear liaison between the Police
        and the club as to whether there would be stewards on the
        terraces, because you seem to be speaking with one voice and
        others with another? - A. Well, my own personal view and, not
        Mr. Mole's view is th a t I would have expected stewards to be
        responsible for seeing that supporters, whether home or away,

                                                    W. JACKSON




     Mr. Jackson I was asking you about the information, and
     y o u were agreeing that it included of course experience of
     past matches, but it would also include intelligence
     Information about the habits, etcetera, of the supporters
     of the relevant teams.    - A. That is correct.

Q.   And that you would ascertain, would you, by getting in
     touch with the Police Force covering that ground?  - A.
     Yes-   There are several ways. We have a Force Liaison
     Officer and he would taka the necessary steps to gather
     all the information from the Forces concerned.

Q.    And.  .in;::’the:ca 3;a:.of Liverpool that would:.-be: the Marshy side- ■
     Police would it?        - A. Yes-it would. .

Q.   And in the case of Nottingham,               East Midlands?     -   A. ^o,
     Nottingham Force.                                              .

Q.   And that was done was             it?   -   A. Yes, that was    done.

Q.    Can I ask you to turn on to page 7 please Mr.. Jackson?
     There is a section headed "Traffic Flow"., section 9?    -
     A. Y e s .

Q.   And you refer to the five main football stadia being in
     residential areas, and then in 9.3 you say:

                    •• ;    "There must be an acceptance     by ■  y-.r-vr-r u-:.:
                         ;persons attending    a football match, -
                          whether on foot or otherwise, that
                    ■    delay and congestion will arise, and                   •
                          must bejvendured when in close proximity         :•
                   /;    -to a ground;   It is our duty, however,-     — - -
         .   .;          to .make every effort to minimise delay. -
                         -and-congestion by whatever means         ~:vv

     As  I read that, and correct me if I am wrong, you are
     talking about delay and congestion affecting those trying
     to go to the match, is that right?          - A.. No, I think I am
     talking ^about-.both r e a l l y , getting people. ;to the-.match- and■
                                                                           ■■
     the-residents-or people who are> shopping- in'the-area.-r

Q.   I see.             But it does start:

                           "....acceptance by persons attending
                           a football match      that delay and

                           however, to make every effort to

                           p o s s i b l e ."

     -       A. Yes         it does say that.
                                                                        .,‘
                                                W. JACKSON
                                                                       - -->*



                                                                  ;•

Q.   B ut: anyway you say that was intended to convey that there
     must be a balancing act really between getting the fans
     into the ground with the minimum of: delay and congestion
     and trying to avoid- too great an effect upon the local
     residents?    - A. That is right sir.

Q. One of the problems that has been I think identified at
   the Lappings Lane is that if the area within the perimeter
   gates-, that is between the perimeter gates and the  "
   turn-stiles, fills up, that creates as it were a stopper in
   the bottleneck, do you follow what I am saying?' - rA.
   Yes.                             ■_

Q. And that      i s ,what happened h e r e ? ; - x\A. That-is correct.' :

Q.   The only way to avoid th.at would seem to be to put the -
     controboafc :the-perimeter gates so that y q u lean" filter^"' '
     people into the acea the other side of -the:, perimeter gat^:
     and ensure orderly queueing.    - A. I am: not quite sure
     what you mean there.    You have got the perimeter gate,
     which is the blue gate, and then you have 'got the turn- -
     stiles.                                        •

Q.   Yes.    -   .A.-   What are you suggesting?

Q. What happened here was t h a t .there was a blockage between
   the perimeter .gates and the turnstiles. ; ■’A."--Right-: ^

Q.   That caused the'initial problem.            -   A.-Yes;           ‘i::.::r   "

Q. what -I--am indicating to you is this:.:, :tsr,‘i v :                     *.
   that the only way to avoid t h a t , ,or one: w a y : ^                   / ■
   is to tens-ure that yo u don ’t let people, .into th^trMcie''a-in' :•

                                            i


Q.   So chat- you-have to control them’ as" they appTOach 1ih'$'
     p a r ime t e r gates . - A. That is ■’
                                           cocrect".- • ~   ~~

Q. And that sort of control can of course create obstruction-
   in Leppings Lane,.can't it? - A> It could.-.,'  ~                                  -

Q. Now the--plan; -the--operational orderwith-whichryxsa w^re ■
   concerned I imagine as the man ultimately in charge’  ,
   provides for the forming of orderly queues by Police
   Officers at the turnstiles.     - A. Yes.

Q.   It does not appear to provide for the control of those
     arriving at the perimeter fence in a similar way.
     A. I think if you look at the plan there are a number of
     serials, Police Officers employed there, and mounted
     Policemen to ensure that there are orderly queues formed.

Q.   It doesn't say that in their instructions.                What they are
                                61
                                             W. JACKSON




     thera for is public order generally.  - A. I think you
     will also find in the order thera are Police Officers who
     are nominated to turnstiles to ensure that they assist ...

Q. Turnstiles, you are absolutely right, and that is
   precisely what I was putting to you, chat the only
   Officers who are detailed specifically to assist in tha
   forming of orderly queues are those who are posted to the
   turnstiles.     A. Wall it is a wellcnown fact that
   mounted Officers do in fact perform that type of duty.

Q. What.I was wondering was whether you or anyone responsible
    for this operational order had'considered the need to
  -
  .police:- positively., :in -the sanse of getting-them to form-'
    queues before they reached the perimeter fence rather than
    at    the turnstiles.     Do you follow what I am putting?
    A.What. "I ;wou Id say tothat is that the-Officers who
    police- that ground have policed it for a long, long while,
    and I am quite sure that is the action they would take.

Q. Mr. - Jackson that is, with respect, not good enough.               Had
    you or          anyone in charge of the planning applied your mind
    to        the policing in the way I. have suggested, that is
    before you get to the perimeter in Lappings Lane rather
    than simply at the turnstiles?                - A. What I would say to
    that .is that .coming, down Leppings Lane you get a number of
  . p e o p l e , d o m i n g -down— and it-is difficult at that'stage,’T " '
    should imagine, lo fora q n e u e s , and of course it is much
    easier when you get closer to t h e .turnstiles.'-'

q.   I think .the--answer :to my question then is "So .' "1 ‘No-one
     had; even'-'applied their minds to that as...   - A. I would
     say the:‘.reason-for that is perhaps it is not a-viable
     proposition.                             .. . ^ .- . > .

q   . You think'not a viable proposi tion?  - A. * Not 'lengthy
      queues-going back;- I think it ‘Would be vary V£ry'
      difficult in terms of football fans coming from different
      directions to form queues of that length.

Q.   I am hot: committing myself to "lengthy queues",‘all I am
     suggesting 'is that policing so that you control', and
     rigidly control, the numbers that can get through the
     perimeter gates into that area between the perimeter gates
     and the turnstiles.   -  A. I am quite sure the Officers
     involved in planning the event, and managing it thera,
     would have addressed their minds to that problem.

Q. Mr. Woodward is saying to me "Serial 19" so perhaps we can
   just look at that Serial's duty in the operational order,
   which is tao 14.  I think, with respect to Mr. Woodward,
   if you have got "Serial 19" ...

     MR. COLLINS:        It is not paginated at all.               It comes

        LORD JUSTICE TAYLOR:        What is the heading at he top?

     MR i C O L L I N S : : The heading at the top of the page i.f
"Serial -IS Leppings ;Lane Turnstiles".        It come-sr immediately/
before a page headed, "Sub Sector 9". •

Serial 18?

And the lower one is "Serial 19" which Mr. Woodward was
drawing to my attention but, as I say with respect to      .
Mr. Woodward, makes the point I was making that this i s '
the serial which is located at Leppings Lane:

 * '^     5r’"-rr. ^en-sure that orderly queues                         , v" "

oh I see,    I beg your pardon, you             are quite right:

           ' ".... will oe located at Leppings Lane

                                            i

I had-fliis.sed that.        I had lumped that together with the
turnstiles.      -    A. Sir if I could make the point on the- —
order:-in-terms >ot ..the deployment of serials , .1 wouldnX-L be.-

and its policy.                                 *

I think the reason I had lumped it in was the heading,
"Leppings Lane Turnstiles", but my understanding of your
answers, whether or not there is anything that can be
treated as including the forming of queueing in Leppings
Lane, that in your approach to this it wasn't something
that you considered to be feasible.  - A. I would con­
sider it feasible near the turnstiles, and perhaps a
certain distance beyond that, but I think the number of
people that come it is more difficult to form queues.

Q.          LORD JUSTICE TAYLOR:  I would like to understand,
      oecause we have been walking round this problem £oc some
      days.  Are you saying that if a large number of people
      turn up, perhaps larger than last year, there is nothing
      the Police can'do about it?  - A. Yes I think thera is my
      Lord.

Q. What do they do?       - A. What we do about it is if we have
   m o u n te d Policeman there, we have Police Officers and
   stewards, then as they approach we will attempt to form them
   in queues.       I think the circumstances t h a t faced the
   Officers on the 15th April was quite different,

      what you would require in a situation like that is
      certainly several hundred Police Officers to try and form
      some cordon to prevent the people crushing up to the turn­
      stiles.        Having said that, the situation in Leppings Lane
      would be extremely difficult because of the topography and
      the residents.            You would start pushing the crowd then
      bacK on to the main road, back into the residential area,
      and probably back to the flashpoint, I. should imagine,
      where Notts Forest fans were coming.               I think the

        situation was wholly excaptional for us.      We had not come
        across that situation before.

q   .        MR. COLLINS:   So what you are telling Lord Justice
        Taylor is effectively this:  because it so happened that
        people arrived later than normal, the South Yorkshire
        Police plan, and the South Yorkshire Police, simply could
        not cope.  - A. On that particular day, which resulted in
        the gates being opened as the only option available to the
        Officer concerned, yes.

Q. So this: was pure:ly a question of people arriving, as they
   ware perfectly entitled to do, it 2.45 or thereabouts.
   A. Weil "if w e ’ could go back and look at the p l a n n i n g a n d
   certainly:'L sent' letters to the Chief Officers of Police
   of Nottingham: and Merseyside, and I sent letters to the
   people who: prepared: the match programme, a«d my Officers
   were on the media, asking people to come early.           I'
   listened on Radio Sheffield to one fan who had come at a
   reasonable time and got in.      I know, reading the papers
   for example, there was a solicitor who appeared here who
   came at 25-to-3. and got in.     If you have a vast number of
   people coming at quartec-to-3 in those numbers then quite
   clearly you are not going to get them in.

I accept that.     You wo u l d expect then that the briA^iJtigao
wo u l d emphasise that Officers must be on the look-out for
that because if they react in the wrong way, that is to
say if they react to an innocent invasion as if it were
a guilty one, it m ay cause people to be the more hurt
because they are kept from getting out of the situation
which is causing trouble? - A. I think you are actually
referring to the situation that occurred actually on the
15th?

Well I am asking you a general question but it is of course
very relevant to the situation that did occur? - A. Could
I tackle it that way then?

Of course. •- A. Because I think that is an important i»sue-> >>
There is no doubt in my mind that probably Police Officers
are more attuned to public disorder t h a n t h e safety^isdden;
because of recent happenings, but they are well awaretofr \
their responsibilities in terms of safety and certainly..-.
on the 15th of- Apri 1 having just v i e w e d the vidiea ^onee^Magr.
that, there seemed to me to be a deal of confusion bath/
w ith spectators and Police Officers in the init ial .s t a g e s .
I hope that perhaps clarifies it.                          -?      ..

The word "confusion" is indeed accepted, but the reason ..that
this is important is that there is a strong body of evidence
which we have heard from the fans that the Police right at
the outset when the first people started to try and get out
seemed t 6 be very slow to reacting to :-t^evreal.ity> and;*,
ap pe a r e d to believe -at the outset that ■they-wer.e>c:it^fc.^hafet.
was happening was what I have called a- ".guilty-invas.ion"^:
Do you follow? - A. Yes, I have spoken to numerous .Officers,
obviously since the incident to get th/s^eel* of ,£jk;a©dc;.^K~r-
clearly-in' the initial stages they were on the fence trying-,
to encourage people to go back and I understand that some —
O f f i c e r s .were in there very very quickly and I think it is^

col lectively 'drroru their own because, they.^.^it-?a.in^;-£t0 ^n ;.'.
do s o .

          To me looking at the video there were difficulties
certainly getting into the fence, you have only got.one
gate, so that was a-problem.         You arerbound^to. ;ge,t. Pol4.ce ....
O ff i c e r s-hanging about: at the back because not . e v e r y b o d y , c
can get in at the gates.

I think everyone w ou ld recognise that,Mr. Jackson, but
the point I am making is this and it does not unfortunately
appear from any of the videos because v/e don't have videos
of the crucial moments between about 5-to-3 and about
3 o'clock or one or two-minutes-past-3, because on the
evidence crushing started clearly at or about 5-to~3.
Do you follow? - A. Yes.

Because it looks as if the barrier in Pen 3 collapsed at
about 5-t o - 3 on the evidence that we have heard so far. . .

   T h a t being so, there is some evidence, and I would like you
   to comment on this, there is some evidence available that
   there were Officers who, for example the gates were opened
   and then closed again and people trying to get out were made
   to go back, because Officers appear to have thought that
   they were facing a guilty pitch invasion rather than an
   innocent one.     Do you follow? - A. I think in the initial
   stages there is every possibility and I would have thought
   most people in the ground thought initially it would be a
   pitch invasion.

Q. That is the point.   So you would not be surprised and from
   your enquiries you are not surprised if at the very earliest
   stage the Police Officers misinterpreted what was happening?
   - a. I would not be surprised at the very early stages
   if some Officers- had interpreted it in that way.

Q. A n d if they- had-'-misinterpreted what was. happening they would
   have made efforts to get the fans to go back a n d not to come
   out', w o u T d h ’-t-they? - A. Yes, they would.              ■;

Q. And they would have been likely to have closed gates and to
   have stopped people climbing up the perimeter fencing to
   get them- to go back? - A. If that was their perception.

Q. If that was their perception at the very earliest stage? -
   A. Yes.

Q. And .as* ;y o u h a v e •very rightly and very f airly .saidt;,i:t. may
   be i n the -/light''of "recent events they were, 'rather^-more
   conditioned to think in terms of guilty rather’.than innocent
   invasions? - A. That is correct.                     ';~v V             : :

Q . Would that -be particularly -in respect of .Liverpool or was
 ' that in general? - A. I think in a general sense in football.




   Officers who are the Officers who had'to deal, with it
   initially, the Operational Order in relation to Serial 1,
   and I bear in mind everything you have said about briefing,
   doe^"Trdthfe'r eittphasise the requirement that .."No.- one. shou;ldy ,
   be allowed -access to the track without consent of ,th$. ...
   Senior Officer except to receive medical attention". - A.
   Yes.

Q. So it does rather emphasise, as I say, the keeping them
    penned in rather than letting them out? - A. It covers
   both aspects though where we are talking about injury
   or medical attention, but there is an emphasis on the pitch
   invasion side.

Q. Do you think with hindsight, Mr. Jackson, that that is,
   and for the future, that that is an emphasis that should
   be diligently cured, or attempted to the cured? - A . I think
   if you look back in hindsight everybody would do things
   differently.
Now we know that Hillsborough staged the 1988 semi-final
between the same teams.      Again w e r e you involved at a i r
in the planning of that or did you leave that to Mr. Mole?
- A   No, the policy is that the planning for all events
such as that, such as the open day at Finningley, it is
done on the Division by a Planning Team because they are
aware of the nitty-gritty of the problem.         It is then
 forwarded to my Ch i e f Superintendent (Ops.), to me, and
 I look at the plan and decide whether I feel it is efficient
and effective.

Did you attend the match in 1988? - A. No, I didn't.

You received/ no doubt,           reports on it? - A. Yes, I did.

And what you say in your statement is ,,th-is:..."The. event: r -
took olaoe -with little or no dif ficuaty:„and, was, describe^ ,
as a s u c c e s s f u l operation"? - A. T h a t is correct. •

 Vnn sav "lit-tie ‘o r 1no difficulty*. •;wfeiclu.suggestsv thst ti*ere..
 was some difficulty? - A. Yes, there was.

 What was -the "difficulty” you were referring, to? - A. At tne
 end o f't he -match there was a small pitch invasion.

 That was by Liverpool supporters when they had won? - A.
 By Liverpool supporters.

         M R ' C O L L I N S : '"And that was -k true-guiltyrinyasion? - -
  - A . Yes,' it was the fact that Liverpool had won of. course
  and nothing untoward came of it.

  Now Mr. Jackson, I appreciate you were not there and you
  had the reports no doubt from your Senior Officers. Were
  the re any c o m p 1ai nts from members of the public, as far
  as you are aware, individual fans who had attended, about
  overcrowding on that occasion? - A. Not as far as I am
  aware.
  Recause there m a y be evidence of some who complained that
• although there w L not any physical injury there was very
  considerable crowding which gave rise to. apprehension ...

      in the minds of some on the ter races.          You are unaware of
      that? - A. No, I was unaware of that.

Q. It is right to say, is it not, that in determining whether                   .
   a particular event has been a success, that is a football
   match has been a success in terms of policing, you get
   no input at all from the spectators? - A. That is correct.
   The only input we would get is if we got letters.

Q. Have you considered ever whether you ought to ask the
   Supporters' Associations, if there are any, whether they
   had any comments that mi gh t help you with policing for the
   future? - A.No, I haven't.

Q. Does i‘t 'Occur to: you that it might not be; a. bad thing to
  - find'out-what the actual consumer,, as i.t.we^e,. has to say?
;.r
    - A. -I 'wouid' have no objection to that. I know the supporters
    are very much aligned to the Club, so I would hope the
    Club-Man-agement would-pass that on .to.

Q. Yes, but the difficulty with a semi-final is you are not
   going to get attending it, certainly in. numbers, the
   supporters of Sheffield Wednesday, are you, because you
   have two foreign teams? - A. I would have no objection to
   that.  You would obviously.have to look at it-in an
   independent way but I would have no objection.

Q. But it wo uld give you certainly an angle which has so
   'fax beeri :ffi-issing?- - -A . Y e s , I think genexa 11 y, ".;ye§ .1 .<

   at about the 20th March 1989 that; Hillsborough was going;
   to';1it>/£:£his:'.laatch?''- A. Yes, that is correct., I .happened’

Q. Mr. Mole" as you knew was very experienced in policing
   the Sheffield Wednesday ground? - A. Yes, he was.

Q. Mr.-’Du^k^fi'eicf;'the- new Chief Superintendent had-;had:, :
   experience o f Hillsborough but that- had been some ten-
   years before and not of course as someone in overall
   control? - A. That is right.

Q. So he was coming to some extent new to whatever problems
   might be created by policing Sheffield Wednesday? - A.
   Mr. Duckenfield was a very very experienced Commander.
   He policed Sheffield United ground.   He also policed the
   City Centre which had numerous activities, matches etc.
   He wou ld be surrounded by very very experienced Ground
   Commanders.

                     felt it w o u l d be more effective having that manpower nearly.

     - A. Yes, I was inasmuch as I meet with my Chief

     me on all matters pertaining to operational i ss ue s.

Q. I went into that with Mr. Mole.  I d o n ’t propose to go over

   Mole's decision in respect of it? - A. Yes, Idid.

Q.   And approved his reasoning as well? - A. Yes.

Q. Now, Mr. Jackson, after the completion of the plan you
   received a copy of the F Division Order? - A. Yes, I did.

                  At this      time onl y t urnstiles A a nd 8 were open.                          There was hardly

                  a n y b o d y using       the    t urnstiles at this stage.                Our serial       duty was to

                   going     into L e p pi n gs L^ne           terraces      or to the seats of the West Stand.

                   despite     having        been s ea rc h ed p re vi o us l y outside          the ground.         F r o m about

outs id e       rather than forming o rd er ly queues.                 Initially         I did see foot

of ficers        i mm e di a te l y outside     o? these      turns ti le s but by now I can only

recall       seeing one        or two m o u n t e d officers.         By now L iv erpool          s upporters

were       cOrfting t h ro u g h the t urnstiles thick and fast.                   All    po ss ib il it y of

searching           people hstd to; be a b a n d o n e d as people were jump in g              the

t urnstiles w i t h o u t t i ck e ts or coining             thro u gh w it h tickets        for     the wrong

end Of the ground.                 These were       dealt    w i t h by either e je ct in g thpm

t h ro u g h a large metal              concertina type gate         next to t urnstile G or

redire c t in g them to the correct                  part    of   the ground.

S everal        fans were        see n to climb o v e r      the wall above the turn st il es               to

gain access            this wa y and they were           s u bs e qu e nt l y ejec te d where      possible.

The    c oncertina         gates were opened on several                occasions as o ff icers             had

cause to eject             numerous       people.     S e a r c h i n g fans by now was

impracticable.

On looking            t h ro ug h the t urnstiles out onto L ep pings Lane                 I could see

a crush o c cu rr in g — the small               e nt rance    gaps to the t u rn st il es were

•bottlenecking'             w i t h people as they shoved from the rear.                      I saw two

y oung      children being          passed along       the    crowds above         peoples heads.

Once the s u p p o r t e rs        had ente re d the ground          I a long w it h al mo st e v e r y

other officer             on our serial were          in un da te d by gangs of people              shouting

a n d c o m p l a in i ng about         the s i tu at io n outside-         T he y said that       people

were       being      crus he d a n d    injured and     people w ou ld die.            Several     fans

did    come         in w i t h obviou s    rib injuries.

I *ve seen a lot of a ng ry people                   in m y 10 years Po li ce           service     but non

as a n g r y as        these     people.      The s it u at i on was       tota ll y out of Police

control.

The a t m o s p h e r e    had    changed frosi being         pleasant to tense a n d that of

anger.          There was also a stench of beer                   in the air.         I had to leave

the t u r nstile a r e a on several               o c c a s i o ns after    being s u m m o n e d by

stewards            to try a n d sort out d i so r d e r l y queues at the g a t © entrance
of the steps              to the se at ed part of the West Stand.                    The   procedure

here was to teftr off a                corner of the ticket once they have e n te re d

and on two oc ca si on s             people tried to enter w i t h torn tickets w h i c h

had obv i o u s l y bee n th ro wn f rom the seats d W r i to the floor.                               The only

o fficers       present       in the W hole a r e a f r o m gate C was our Serial                       of a

sergeant and              10 PCs.

A b o u t 2 . 4 0 p m I recall        the    conce rt in a gate being o pe n ed a g a i n - I

b elieve      in order        to eject someone           but at this       point a       large amount of

fans     surged through.              We str ug gl ed to close them again.                         By now it

was    o r g an i s e d    chaos.     H un dr ed s   of fans w ere milling a r ou n d not

know i n g where           to go.     Alot he ad ed for the         central    tunnel              to the

L e p p i n g s Lane       terraces.        Alot of these fans were alcohol                        effected.

T he r e was nothing           I could do with o ut          causing a violent             public

disorder situation.                  I w a s still      being b o mb ar de d w it h      complaints

a bout    the outside          situation.            By this time    I had     lost track             of time.

T here was one m a n who              came    in w i t h a g roup of people.               He had a can

of beer       in his        hand.     It was     open an d he was       shaking          it causing the

contents to s pr ay about.                   I took     it off him and binned              it.        He then

The    next thing           I k ne w - I can only guess that               it was about 3pm - the

conc e r ti na gates          op en ed again.          I d o n ’t k now why.     A w hole mass               of

suppo rt er s        in their       hundreds     or t housands      just    ran past us.               The

m a j o r i t y h e a d ed for the       central       tunnel.    W e were     powerless             to stop

them.       I had no         radio    c o mm u ni ca ti on but fro m past experiences a radio

w o u l d have been useless              due to the am ou nt of noise an d general

a tmosphere.

A f t er the gate           had been opened on this o cc as i on             it s ee m ed to clear

e er ie an d I was           left a bit bewildered.              The s i tu at io n w ent f r o m one
extreme      to the        other     in a ma tt er        of seconds-         I n o ti ce d about 30

police o ff icers           run thro ug h the are a w here                 our serial was.            there

were    things m e n t i o n e d through the grape vine that                       there       had been a

p it ch invasion.            Our serial        tagged on and              we made our wa y onto the

pitch via the             rear of the S ou th s e ct i o n of the t e rr ac in g a n d a small

seated s e ct i on of the S ou th Stand.                      Once on the        pitch I saw a large

amount of people             on the pitch.            T h e y wer e o b vi ou sl y shocked,            numb an d

dazed.       Some were           injured and others were just w an d er i ng about.                              It

was obvious          that    it     w a s n ’t a pitch invasion.               I saw a lot of a ct iv it y

at the      riot fenc in g          behind     the goal of the West S t an d side.                     Fans

were     climbing up the             fencing an d b eing he lp ed over by Police

officers.           W i t h the general         noise a n d a tm os ph er e a r ou n d the ground at

this stage          I still       c o u l d n ’t see or c om pr eh en d what was              hap pe ni ng as

the front of this                s e ct i on of crowd was m as k ed by other boides.                         I

n oti c e d a lot of fans scram b l i ng                  their w ay up from the t e rr ac in g onto

the West          stand.      I made my way          further        forw ar d to the f e nc i n g and at

this     I saw that         the     central     ter r a c in g     pen between gates 3 and 4 in

the fencing was             ja m m e d   packed w i t h spectators.              The    front       of the

crowd were          pres s e d up a gai n s t      the      riot fencing and the back end

seemed to be          pushing        forward.        The     pen was so full           of    people    it

l ooked impossible               to get a n y t h i n g     else    in.

Police      con t i n u e d to pull         persons over           the    riot f e nc in g $s fans n>ade

their way up.              But    this was slow and sporadic.                   W h e n not helping

people o v e r;the          o f f icer s s e e m e d to be trying            to tell        the back section

of the      crowd to get            back.      Sc o r e s   of other fans c ontinued to                climb up

the h o a rdings          into the West Stand.                As    people    battled to get free

from the crufh at the front                     I could see that some others were                       not

moving.           Their    eyes were        shut an d their faces seemed                    pale.     Bodies

were    so i n t e r m i n g l e d that      it was       i mpossible to me at this stage to

det e r m i n e    their    %ex,     age or a ppearance.                 I then saw an a r m pressed up
                                                                                                        P AGE
                                ■                                                                       R 161

against      the fence a n d as I f o l lo w ed it down there didn't                        seem to be a

body a tt ac h ed to        it          in that the      rest of     it a p p e ar e d on the floor

under other people                  but obs cu rr ed by a dv e rt i si n g    boards.

I remember        looking at either gate 3 Or 4 i-n the fencing.                              ft was open

and other P o l i ce were               trying to ptill people thro ug h the gate wa y but

this was just          'bottlenecking*.

After a p p r e c i a t i n g       the sever it y of the      incident       I then m ade my way

a lo ng the track a n d ente re d the                 crowd via gate         1.     I made my way

t hr ou gh the     crowd towards the               centre south sect io n of the terracing.

As I did so         I was       jostled,       harrassed,     insulted and a bu s ed by some

fans.      The south s e ct io n towards               the S o u th stand end di dn 't seem to

realise what was            hap pe ni ng       but fans became more hostile as                 I reached

the d iv iding metal                fence betw ee n the south and centre               south section.

F ro m here     I could see a heap of bodies                   on top of each other              in the

well    of the t er ra ce s            I think near to gate 3.            Initially       I helped fans

over    the metal       d iv id in g fence from the            centre stand          into the     less

crowded s ou th section.                  At one    point    I n o ti ce d a crash barrier              that

had    collapsed.         It was twis te d and buckled.                 A long s e ct io n o f this

was    then h ur l ed towa rd s            the front     riot fencing.            It hit the top and

landed p it ch side.                 I can't say if this was done in a ng er                  or whet he r

or not     it was      t h r o w n out of the way.            Once    there was       s uf fi ci en t    room

in the     centre      south sect io n after             fans had been removed            I climbed

f al l en an d ended up              in a h e a p at the front.         The       first one    I pulled

a way was a h e av y/ fa t y o ut h in his twenties.                    I don't       recall what he

was wear in g      but his face was              purple.      He was n' t moving         or breathing.

He was a p p a r e n t l y dead.            I laid him on the terracing a few feet back

a n d tried m o u t h to m ou th            r e su s ci ta ti on but this failed to           revive

him.     1 was being            e n co r ed by certain fans towards               the front o f the

large sect io n at              the   rear and the one            in the West standi seat were

hurling a " b a r r ag e         of abuse and hostilities.                  Some fans at the front

w ere   trying      to calm t he m down.                 I then pulled anot he r bpdy off the

pile.      T h i s w a s ,-a teenage male fcrUt aga|;n" I don*t recall                      the

clothing.          His     face was purple an d he seemed dead,                       I t ried m o u t h to

m o u t h r e s u s c i t a t i o n on him too.           I don't k now whether          or not       it was

just a reaction of blowing air                          intq him or whet he r        or not he was

still alive          but there          seemed        t o foe a faint cough response to this.


              T hinking         he may be alive           I looked up for a w a y to get him out

of the      pen.         B y now Pol ice a n d fans were m an ag in g              to rip a s e ct io n of

the     riot fencing a w a y an d              people dead an d         injured were       being      passed

t h r o u g h there a n d also           exit gates         to Police,      fans an d medic al         staff.

At this       I c a r r i e d this se c o n d y o ut h w it h the help of a fan to the

fencing a n d then just                 passed him through.              By now it was        just a

m a t t e r of pulling           bodies off the            heap and getting         them pitch side to

a m b ul a n c e and St.         Johns memb e r s        for medical      attention.        Other Police

a n d fans w e r e        just     pulling dead body after               dead body a wa y from the

pile and getting                them out.         It was     like trying to dig a hole                in dry

sand*       It s e e m e d endless.             Advertising        boards were being          r ipped down

a nd    passed to the            front so that t hey could be used as make                          shift

stretchers.              I d o n ’t know how long            it took but once          e ve ryone had been

cleared from the                t e r r a c e ® the    injured or dead I felt           exhausted.          I

angry.        Items of          clothing and o ther            p r o perty was    col le ct ed that was

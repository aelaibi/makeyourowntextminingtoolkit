                   On       15th April          1989,        I was    on w e e k l y    Le-tfOe,. b u j ^ ^ d    previously' been

                   at the        rear     of the         upstairs        stand.         This    is an area where             the    toilets

                   and       r e f r e shments are.             This duty was            until     the m a t c h started,           when we

                   were       to be     relieved by another                   serial.          Liverpool        s u pporters       started

                   a rr i vi ng and entering                   the stand at about               12.15pm but very few had

                   entered up to ap p r o x                   1.30pm.       Between        1»30--2.15pm more           s u pporters

                   entered        the     ground but            it was a p p a r e n t      that    there were         still       a great

                   m any still          outside          the ground.
It was a p p arent           that a number         of the s u pporters            had been drinking,

but ftqne caused any                problem     inside^JJ^& ground.               Whilst     continuing

                   a d f I could see that                      there was a large             number       of

suppor ters       gat h e r i n g    on the opposite           side of the         road to-the          ground,

on the grass           banking & none of these                 supporters were making any

a ttempt       to enter, the g round even though the kick off was tiot far dPf «

Supporters        that were entering               the     ground were making            specific

complaints        about        pushing at tj=«r’’tfu r n s t i 1 e s .      At this time a mess a g e

was    broadcast           over    the^^^annoy system to fans outside                    the    ground to

stop    pushing.            This a p p e a r e d to. have      no effect <Sr. fans         had started

to scale        the walls          to gain access          to the      ground and/or         escape       the

crush outside.                          ■

It was     now becoming apparent                  tnat     people were        £*exng injured           outsioe

1 a t t e m p te d to help as many of the                   supp o r t e r s as    1 could that were

injured-         Several          became    uns^ggftiy an d      collapsed as they ente r e d                  the /

concourse area.                Wit h other       officers      I helped these           people                 the

recovery        position and e nsured that                  they M @ r e    breathing.          After a

the a m bu la nc e         services     Outside      the    ground for treatment.                    Together

w i t h Pc 2167 Frost              I picked up a y o u h g male            person and        carried him

            returned to the            s tand & concourse where            I saw for the            first       time    the

          ..injuries- tha t had o c c urred on the               pitch-       I returned to^the                 concourse

    •      where     the     fans w e r e , v e r y hostile     t o w a r d s the   police and at              that time.

            I feared for the;'safety of off icers work i n g                        in that area.

            I stayed        in this are a with suppo r t e r s          trying      to t a i k / a d y i s e / a s s i s t

            was     not going     to    continue,     I together wit h other                officers        tried as

           •tactfully as         possible      to advise      the    s upporters       to    leave       slowly.        A

            small     number     of families       did so.       The m a j o r i t y of the supporters were

            na tura lly very a n g r y and upset and d i r ected                    their anger at             the

            office rs       present.

            In the     course     of time a large         number      of supporters            left the         ground

 —            r   SUBJECT:    Incident at Hillsborough Football Ground
                              Sheffield on Saturday 15 April 19^9

                  Neil Antony Parkin PC 928 E1 Hackenthorpe Police Station

                  On 15th April 1989» I was on weekly leave, but had previously been warned to
                  commence duty at Hackenthorpe Police Station at 8.15am that day. This I did
                  with other officers from Hackenthorpe. I was assigned duties as part of serial
                  no.13 which was led by PS 2001 Burman of E1 sub division. We travelled to the
                  ground as a serial arriving at approximately 8,k^am. We then went straight to
                  the North Stand where we occupied our specified seats in serials as previously
                  directed. We remained seated until briefing took place at 10am. Immediately
                  after briefing, we had a packed lunch, again in the North Stand, to be on our
                  points by 1115am, for the gates opening at 12 noon.
                  My specific duties related to the Leppings Lane Stand, in company with Pc 1*1-23
                  Newbould, were before the match to patrol the concourse area at the rear of the
                  upstairs stand. This is an area where the toilets and refreshments are. This
                  duty was until the match started, when we were to be relieved by another serial.
                  Liverpool supporters started arriving and entering the stand at about 12.15pm
                  but very few had entered up to approx 1.30pm. Between 1.30-2.15pm more supporters
                  entered the ground but it was apparent that there were still a great many still
                  outside the ground.
                  It was apparent that a number of the supporters had been drinking, but none caused
                  any problem inside the ground. Whilst continuing to patrol the coneours a view
                  was available onto the perimeter wall,gates & road, I could see that there was
                  a large number of supporters gathering on the opposite side of the road to the
                  ground, on the grass banking & none of these supporters were making any attempt
                  to enter the ground even though the kick of was not far off.
                  Supporters that were entering the ground were making specific complaints about
                  ptashing at the turnstiles. At this time a message was broadcast over the tannoy
                  system to fans outside the ground to stop pushing. This appeared to have no
                  effect & fans had started to scale the walls to gain access to the ground and/or
                  escape the crush outside.
                  It was now becoming apparent that people were being injured outside the ground.
                  A number of supporters were entering the concours area with minor facial injuries
                  and breathing difficulties after being caught in the pushing outside. Both
                  myself and Pc 1*4-23 Newbould gave what aid we could in the circumstances. At
                  this time I was made aware that a gate was open & a large number of fans began
                  entering the concours area, again some injured and all angry. A large number of
                  fans directed their anger in abuse and threats at Pc Newbould and myself as they
                  entered the concours area.
                  I remained in the concours area as supporters continued to enter & I attempted
                  to help as many of the supporters as I could that were injured. Several became
                  unsteady and collapsed as they entered the concours area. With other officers I
                  helped these people into the recovery position and ensured that they were breat
                  hing. After a short time it was apparent that these people would have to be taken
                  to the ambulance services outside the ground for treatment. Together with Pc
                  2167 Frost I picked up a young male person and carried him out to the rear of
                  the Leppings Lane stand where he was lefi: vomraitting in the care of the ambulance
                  service & a friend. I returned to the stand & concours where I saw for the first
                  time the injuries that had occurred on the pitch. I returned to the concours
                  where the fans were very hostile towards the police and at that time I feared
                  for the safety of officers working in that area.
Gen/2             I stayed in this area with supporters trying to talk/advise/assist them in what
                  ever way possible.

             As the disaster became more clear and it was obvious that the game was not
             going to continue, I together with other officers tried as tactfully as possible
             to advice the supporters to leave slowly. A small number of families did so.
             The majority of the supporters were naturally very angry and upset and directed
             theii* anger at the officers present.
             In the course of time a large number of supporters left the ground quietly &
             slowly as requested & were consoled & advised as they left.
             When the Leppings Lane stand had been cleared together with other officers I
             made my way to the North Stand for the de brief.
             I returned to Hackenthorpe Police station with other officers finishing duty
             at 6pm.

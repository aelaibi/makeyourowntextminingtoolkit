                I am a Detective Sergeant          currently attached to the South Yorkshire

                Police Drug Squad,



                On the 15 April        1989 (150489)    I was working    in uniform in order to

                police the FA Cup semi final between Nottingham Forest and Liverpool

                to take place at the Sheffield Wednesday football               ground.



                I commenced duty                 a.m.   (0800)    that day at Police Headquarters

^J) ® W * 4^*'^Cogether with sJL                   ug squad officers who were to form part of a

                Midlands Station in Sheffield City Centre



                At 9.00 a.m.       <0900)    that same morning we attended at the gymnasium,
                                                                           PAGE
                                                                           S3592

West Bar Police S t ^ f i        attended a briefing that was carried out
                                             7 N % fp b   ? '
by Acting Super il            KING and Super jfnt^/faen V13 AT ES . At that

briefing our duties         e outlined as pubiflc order control at the

station,   together with the task of ferrying both Liverpool and

Nottingham Forest supporters to                 'at had been provided to carry

them to the gr oun d.



Whilst at thjr briefing we were joined by a further Sergeant, Police
     /V ///7$>
Se r geant,     HNS jO N , a uniformed officer from D2 sub division, ‘hat

officer was         •anger to the other members of the serial and, after

the necessary introductions,      the serial made    its way to the Midlands

Station arriving at approximately 9.45 a «m (0945).



From that time until approximately 1.30 p.m.         (1330) a number of normal

Saturday service trains were met and attempts made to sieve supporters

from normal   commuters.    All supporters were encouraged to travel by

the waiting PSV's straight to the ground;         two sets of P S V s   standing

in separate areas to convey rival f a n s . •



At about   1.30 p.m.    (1330) on the arrival    of the last group of

Nottingham supporters,      I and my serial were instructed to board the

last few P S V ’s, one PC per P S V , and act as escorts to the ground.



I boarded the last PSV together with Detective Consi

The journey to the ground was uneventful,         the No11ing'h^Trr^'upporters

being well behaved.



The only thing of note on the journey was the number of supporters who

were drinking outside the pubs on the way to the ground,           especially

along Penistone Road.
                                                                                    PAGE      3
                                                                                    oocvOi?
                                                                                    wvSJ7£.



I arrived at the ground at around 2.00 p.m.                (1400),    the Nottingham

Supporters alighting directly outside the Spion Kop.



I then rendezvoused with my, serial            in the gymnasium,        reporting to
     N i o On i
Inspector Sewell, who delegated my serial as a reserve.



At around 2.20 p.m.           (1420)   that same inspector    informed me that the

serial was to be used as prisoner e s c a r y .           Half to take their meal at

that time,        half to act as immediate W c o r t s .



The serial was split a<s follows



                         ON/I              and D                 meal
                                                            ' 2 5 2 ^

I had been provided with a radio at the initial briefing that had been

tuned to the West Bar Police Station match control.                     I had, on my

arrival at the ground, altered the frequency to the Hillsborough

Cont ro1.



However, whilst taking my meal             I had turned off the radio as present

were numerous senior officers who were monitoring transmissions.



Shortly after 3.00 p.m.           (1300)   I was approached by Ins

who instructed me to take the remains of my serial                   to the track area

in front of the Leppings Lane end as there w a s v U r o u b l e           in the

crowd8.
                                                                       PAGE
                                                                       S3S92

Together with DC KETTON,    DC FOX and TDC SMITH,    I went to the

playing area via the ramp in front of the Spion Kop,          On walking

onto the perimeter track    I saw that ti^rre were a large number of

people spilling from the Leppings L ^rfe end onto the playing a r e a »



The match was in progress and I saw that the Stadium electric clock

was showing 3.05 p.m (1503).



I immediately Went to the corner flag area at the north s t a n d’s

junction with Leppings Lane.     On my arrival   I was surrounded by

people,   none of whom were injured.    I/saw that the area of terracing

near to the corner flag had clear a/ea^ a n d ^ b e g a n   to remove people

from the track and push them bacy on/o Vv? t e rr ac i ng .



I had my radio working but because of the uproar around me could not

hear any messages.



For some five minutes    I continued to attempt to clear the track area

in my immediate vicinity,    but with little success.       Only then did I

realise that more people were being allowed to spill onto the pitch,

this leading to the realisation that this was something more than

crowd trouble,



I, and Detective Constable KETTON w ho wasy^ita^ding nearby to Police

the terrace gate,    returned to the gymna/i|im/ VI there discovered that

people had been killed.



Things were chaotic at this stage and so I returned to/^trne pitch.           As

I did so X saw that hoardings were being torn up, btraies placed on

them,   they were being ferried towards the Spion Kop end and into the
                                                                                            PAGE
                                                                                            S3592

             area outside the gymnasium.



             I returned to the track area where     I had previously been standing and

             found that the atmosphere was becoming extremely hostile.              Supporters

             were spitting and swearing at the Police and I began to fear that a

             riot was about to break out.



             On turning I saw that a cordon of Police w e re forming towards the

             centre of the pitch.



             I remained at the Leppings Lane end, at the gate in the fence,                 for

             some five minutes assisting one or two spectators who appeared

             somewhat shocked.    I then made my way towards the P o l i c y / cordon, as .1

             /did so I met a group of people carrying a body on a j / i e cfe of Jnoarding
   VJUAQ w                                                             y      /   y y
       y     They were having difficulty and so I a s s i s ^ d   t hey wit,/ tXty bady^ to

                   Further to the statement that I prepared following the Hi 1 1sbo rough

                   Football Stadium disaster on the 15th of April                            1989 (150489)   I would

                   like to add the following.

                   Where   I refer to the group of supporters                     carrying the body on an

                   advertising ^oaj^flTng, they were going towards the Hop End and had put

      35^2-        the stretcher down in about the middle of the Notts Forest half of

                   the pitch.      All     I remember of the body was that it was male,                      late

Ji                 twenties,     heavily built.            I seem to recall          that


               J   to the gyrrm^s i         where
                                                       he was obviously dead.              I helped carry the body

                                                        I left it outside with the other fans and a PC

                   who helped carry it.                I don't know who the PC was or where he was

                   stationed.       I am unable to describe the deceased person further than

                   that.

Dear) Sir/Madam,

     c J' would like to give you a written account of my own personal   events that
tookiplace at the tragic F.A. Cup Semi Final at Hillsborough last Saturday.          I
hope that in sending it to you, many people may be given sane sort of insight
into what actually happened that terrible afternoon.        I also hope that the
injured and bereaved are not offended or upset in any way by this letter,
PI        read on:-


      We got into the ground quite early on, myself and
We di in't bother looking for a pub as we know, they were all closed.          Besides
alcohol was banned on the coach anyway, so we didn't miss what we'd never had.
Anyway it was 2.00 p.m. when we went through the turnstile.              had to leave
me   It   this point as he was seated in the North Stand.    My ticket was for the
Leppiigs tanp Terrace.      I bought a programme, went to the toilet, and then
headed for the section stated on my ticket; Terrace Section B.        I was in this
bit List year, it's right behind the goal.      I'm feeling pleased about that.          I
walked through the long tunnel that leads you straight onto the Terrace.


       A i 2.10 p.m. approximately, I've chosen my place to stand and watch the game
from.      It's halfway between the wall of the West Staiid and the perimeter fence
and sHghtly to the left of the goal from where I'm.standing.         Actually, the
double-fenced partition is nearer to me than any other fence etc., which
separates Section B from A.      It's only a few minutes later that three of my
frifics from the Spion Kop see me, and cane over to stand with me. Their names
are                                     whose surname escapes me at the moment.


    Th 2 time is now about 2.20 p.m. There is a sudden surge behind us and all
four o I us are pushed down and left. I remember shouting something unpleasant
in a|}p jyance. Already though the terrace does seem to be almost full. Still
you've got to put up with it and I remember it being very packed from last year.
Time passes and all the time it's getting more an more crowded.


    The players came out at 2.50, and I had to struggle to release my aims to
applaud than.    At this point,        says she's starting to feel a bit crushed.       I
looked to my left and remarked on how Section A was half empty.       It was only a
few minutes later that there seemed to be another large influx of fans, but I
can't honestly remember if there was another surge or not.       Anyway by now it
was obvious that too many were in my Section.       I knew thatbecause my feet are
off the ground (I'm 6 feet tall too), and because I've been turned side-on by
the crush I turn my head in wait for the kick-off.


    The match starts and iirmediately       shouts to me that she must get out. I
could see she was in pain.     I tried to move myself, but I couldn't.        and
     are the same.     People seem to be shouting to the Police from the front but
I didn't know what they were saying.       Slowly but surely, I was getting carried
nearer and nearer to the partition fence.       Still the crush increases. People
are beginning to groan around me.       It wasn't long before I found myself trapped
against the fence itself. Now I began to feel really scared.       I accidentally
drop my programme, and make the stupid mistake of dropping to my knees to pick
it up.     I picked it up in total darkness and went to stand up, I couldn't.       I
was trapped underneath.     I panicked, I thought something terrible was going to
happen to me.     That did it I summoned up all the strength in my legs, and
forced myself back up between the crowd.       God that was close and I knew it.      I
had to get out of there.     I heard        shout me.   He was on the other side of
the fence on the 4 foot gap between the two sections.        I tried to climb the
fence but I couldn't.     I'm trapped again.    At that moment the man next to me,
who was a hell of a big lad jumped up and climbed over the fence.        In that
split second I moved into his space and jumped up myself. I was over.
 slapped my back.    At that point        vanished, I donâ€™t know where he went.     I
 stayed where I was for a short while helping half a dozen or so other people
 get over.    Several of them patted me in gratitude.


     I moved down the gap then, through the gate and onto the pitch itself.
 Already casualties were being laid on the pitch, filling the penalty area.         I
 ran over and put people who needed it, in the recovery position.       Up to now
 everyone had at least been conscious.


     On turning round and looking at the terrace, the scale of things started to
 hit me.     People were crushed, and I mean crushed against the perimeter fence.           I
walkeci right up to the fence.     People pleaded with me to help the, sane with
horribly contorted faces.       What could I do?   I felt so bloody useless.    I
decided to climb the fence, and together with other fans and several policemen
we managed to get a fair few out, over and onto the pitch.          I was ranting wildly
at the crowd, pleading with than to push back.        Of course, now I know that was
just impossible.    The time by now must've been about 3.15.


       Eventually I climbed back down.     I 'd heard one lad shout that the best
thing to do would be to rip down the mesh.         I agreed.   I asked one policeman if
wire-cutters or hanmers were available.       They weren't.     We quickly resorted to
just pushing and pulling in unison on the fence, me, fans and police together.
Cutting our hands as we did it.       Three sections of mesh were either ripped out
or rolled up and tied with rope.       Straight away people were passed through to
us.    Some conscious, some to my mind unconscious.       (The thought of fatalities
still hadn't crossed my mind).       These people were laid out right at the back of
the goal, a dozen or more.       I went over shortly after to see what I could do.
It was then I saw it.    Death was on this ground.       A lad no older than a teenager
was laid at my very feet, a jumper covering his face.          My words rang out,
"My God, please don't tell me they're dead".         No-one answered, but then I knew
the answer anyway.


      I didn't have time to dwell on it, as I noticed on my other side that a
policeman and another fan, plus a St. John's Ambulanceman, were trying to revive
two fans laid out.     I went straight over to help.      I asked the policeman if I
could help because being honest, I don't think he was totally sure what to do.
(Thankfully, I'd taken a first aid course in work, only 8 weks ago).           He was
glad of the help,    and together we set about trying to save this man who was
only in his twenties.     I did the heart massage, the bobby did the
mouth-to- mouth.     We were at it a few minutes, then we swapped over.        I had
trouble at first, as I kept having to remove the man's vomit from my mouth.             By
know his pupils were dilated, and he was going blue.           His tips and nails were
purple.    This was cyanosis - if we didn't get his heart going soon, he would
either die or suffer permanent brain damage.         "Live you bastard", I screamed at
him.     Still we kept at it.    No sign of any proper help as yet.      It finally came
at around 3.30.     Ambulanceman arrived on the pitch with oxygen.         Almost at the
gamp time, an ambulance arrived on the pitch, and stopped behind the goal next
to us.    Two girls came over, declaring themselves as nurses and took over from
me and the policeman.     One nurse said to the other, that there was a very weak
pulse,     he was taken straight into the ambulance.      His heart had started again.
I turned to a W.P.C. standing next to me, and told her almost coldly, "I've just
saved M s life".     She replied, "I bet you feel proud about that".     Strangely
enough, I didn't feel anything.     I just felt absolutely numb.     I then went over
to the other victim to help the ambulancemean and the other fan as best I could.
Again, we managed to get his heart going.     Better still, this man even started
breathing.    Between the four of us, we'd prevent at least temporarily, two more
deaths.     Both men were driven away in the ambulance.


    The next think I remember is hearing Kenny Dalglish's voice over the
tannoy.     This means that the time was about 3.50 p.m.   I looked around at the
pitch.     Police, fans, casualties everywhere.   Advertising hoardings were strewn
across the grass after being used as makeshift stretchers.      Again I went around
the injured and offered any help I could.     Then I turned and looked at that
dreaded terrace once more.     Only now at about 4.00 p.m., were gaps visible in
that pen.     I couldn't believe the last hours events.


    I spoke to several policemen about the causes and consequences of this
tragedy.     Scxne of them could only described as shell-shocked.    I sympathised
with them.     In the circumstances they'd done the best they could.     I blame the
senior officers for lack of organisation of their P.C.'s, who ultimately were
put in the same position as the fans.     I'm positive a lot of deaths could've
been avoided, if gates and fencing mesh had been dealt with earlier.


    A man walked up to me with a bucket of water, and a pile of cups.           He
offered a drink and I was glad of it.      I knelt down to sip the water.       It was
the only time that entire day that events caught up with me.        I began to cry.
A W.P.C. instantly came over to me to offer ccmfort.       Quick as a flash, I
stopped crying, stood up and said I was O.K.      I asked if it was O.K. to leave
the ground now.     Yes said another policeman.   I finished my drink, gently placed
the cup on the pitch and trudged off back into the terrace.         I crossed
death-ridden steps and slowly left the ground.      I was muttering all the way to
Penistone Road where the coaches waited.


    I met                 again, and eventually boarded the coach.      It wasn't until
we got to Manchester that we stopped at a services and had the chance to ring
hone.     I finally contacted my family at approximately 7.00 p.m.     They'd been
frantic with worry for four hours.     We got back quite quickly and I had a very
emotional reunion with my relatives at about 8.00 p.m.       I had trouble sleeping
at first, as even now two days later, I can still see the faces of those
trapped fans.   I don't suppose I'll ever forget than.   I'd seen things that
ordinary people like me just don't normally see in a lifetime.

     I hope people may be able to understand a bit better what it was like to
experience that traumatic day.   I'm not trying deliberately to point any
fingers specifically, although I do think senior policemen had something to do
with it.   We shall see.


     God bless and protect those lads and lasses who died for Liverpool F.C. last
weekend.   We shall never forget them.   Their was the ultimate sacrifice.   None
of them will ever walk alone.




                                   Yours sincerely,

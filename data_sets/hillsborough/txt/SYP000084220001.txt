                SOWER^Y.            The iHU'ocation of personal                 radios was one between two and

                the serial was so divided.                       I worked with PC 3068 S O W E R B Y .

                Phase      1 of our duties was to supervise Nottingham Forest ^supporters

                who were arriving by train at the Sheffield Midi;                                                      o n.

                These supporters were then to be placed onto buses-ind transported to

                Hillsborough escorted by Police Officers.                            In turn PC SOWERBY and

                myself also escorted fans on one of the buses.                            The fans        in general

                                                                                                          \
                                                                                                              \

were boisterous and there were obvious signs that drink had been

consumed so much so that arrests for drunkeness had ealier been made

b y several officers.            On depositing the supporters at the Penistone Rd

end of the Hillsborough ground,              PC SOWERBY and myself returned on

the empty b u s , ready for a further collection of fans f?om the railway

station.

We we re returni ng at 1.20pm <1320) when we had occasion to 1eave the

bus at the junction of Shalesmore and Shepherd St.                         Th^s was because
                                                                             \
there had been a road accident and young child had been injured.

Traffic was very heavy at this time and at a standstill.                         Assistance

was rendered to the child and the road was cleared and traffic allowed

to m o v e .   When further assistance arrived PC SOWERBY and myself

continued our return journey to the railway station.

At 1.45pm (1345)        this same day, whilst         in Sheaf St outside the Midland

Railway Station PC SOWERBY bead occasion to arrest a

for   being    drunk   and   disorderly.     As   a   result   of   this    I also   had    to
           n \3ioio   ^t/         /    r)
arrest a Nicholas PARKER? for the' safrief.             A further arrest was made by
     nrrn'Z I       ~
PC2273 HEPPLETHWAITE / f a                                again for being drunk and
                             /         7~7        j
disorderly.

Arrangements we rV'then made W o r all            these men to be transported by

transit van to the Central Charge Office at Bridge Street.                           Due to the

volume of traffic         it took time for the transit van to arrive and also

to get to the Charge Office.            During this time my personal                 radio had

become faulty,         believed through a poorly charged battery.                    At the

Charge Office the prisoners were processed and I in turn contacted PS

HITCHBORNE at West Bar Central Room to arrange transport when

available to transport myself, PC SOWERBY and other officers to

Hillsborough to take up further duties.                  Whilst at the Charge Office

we were made aware that an i nc ident had occurred at Hil lsborough but

exactly what no-one seemed to know at this time.
                                                                                          PAGE      3

It became apparent that urgentyassi stance was being requested at

Hills-bprou^n and together w ^ h            PC SOWERBY I joined up with Detective

SergeanX ^ ^ EY^and DC E/LJ^.' DS VAREY drove us to the Penistone Rd end

of 't'We Hillsborough i%adfi urrTT         On entering     into this part of the

ground to make my way to the gymnasium,                 to receive instructions from a

senior officer,         I could only at this time see there was chaos and also

loss of life.          Supporters and police officers were bringing dead and

injured to this part of the ground.                 Many being carried on advertising

boards     converted to makeshift stretchers.

A number of officers           informed me what had occurred and I immediately

with PC SOWERBY went onto the ground making my way to the Leppings Ln

end of the ground.           Whilst making my way across the ground I was

confronted by numerous Liverpool               supporters,      some obviously hysterical

and in grief.          Many adverse     comments were made to me and I avoided

them not wishing to add to p r o b l e m ^ to what             I could see was a tragic

i nci d e n t .   I assisted people wjro w e j/e y ty iT y q   on the f l o o r ei ther

through slight injuries o V ^ n o c k .          Dur i ng Ctrl's* time I was s pat a t ,

kicked and swore at with comments               like "its your fucking fault".

Again appreciating that many of these people were                     in total shock        I

tried with others to console them and prevent further trouble.                             It was

also at this time that many supporters from Liverpool were becoming

very agitated and starting to vent their feelings towards the

Nottingham Forest end of the ground.                 This problem had obviously been

recognised and a cordon of police officers were formed across the

width of the pitch.

There was a large group of supporters who had made thei r way to the

entrance to the players ti^nnat ifld many heated words were being

exchanged.         With othe r^of f i ce rs Nf^stepped in to try and help resolve

the problem.         I remained at this post for the rest of the afternoon.

During this time many supporters approached me and other people who

                                                                                       S2848

         were members of the F .A. and the two football          clubs.    Some were

         wishing to make genuine enquiries,          others to   complain,   but a vast

         majority were coming just to offer abuse,          violence or accuse.        It was

         apparent that many of these people were much the worse for drink.

         Eventually as the pitch and the ground cleared I had become detached

         from my serial,        1 went to the gymnasium at the rear of the South S t a n d .

         I there located officers from my serial who had taken bodies from the

         crowd and were stayi ng with them for identification pur po s e s . When I

         had accounted for my serial          I then returned into Penistone Rd and

         alighted a bus that was taking Liverpool          supporters back to the

         Midland Railway Station.          This journey was very slow obviously due

         to the heavy volume of traffic.

         At 5.30pm <1730>        I returned to the Midland Station and resumed duties

         of supervising supporters.           I also tried to see to the needs of

         several    officers who by now had become very distressed as regards

         their   involvement     in this incident.     I arranged for them to be

         relieved and returned to West Bar Police Station.

         At 6 . 4 5 pm (1845)   I returned to West Bar Police Station.        After a

         conference and de-brief          I retired from duty at 8.00pm    (2000).

                                                                          8. Bough SIGNED

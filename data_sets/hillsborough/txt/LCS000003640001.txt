Dear
                           Be: Hillsborough Disaster

      I know I write on behalf of all the Local Authorities and Agencies who have
collaborated following Hillsborough to express our appreciation of the work
undertaken by the Centre, When we were confronted by the challenge and the
opportunity to organise services in April we realised how ill-equipped we were,
tfe had       for your assistance and you arrived on our first working day, Sunday#
16th April.
     During that day, as well as briefing senior staff and providing us with a
framework within which to plan and consider our actions, you also provided an ad
hoc presentation for that group of staff who had arrived on a voluntary basis to
hagtn work* That first session with staff had a dramatic effect and people began
to understand the work that was required and w h a t they would be taking on* Our
agreed training programme which the Centre for Crisis Psychology has provided has
been very successful in meeting the needs of staff involved over the last two months.

     During the first week after Hillsborough your briefing tor so many people we
have lost count, helped them to understand the service requirements for the future.
Senior staff from Social Services, Voluntary Sector, Probation and the Health Authority
were all involved in these sessions. The last day of that programme, Saturday, you
did a briefing session for local authority members.   This has enabled us to continue
work with a very understanding and committed group of politicians* All the people
involved in that part of the programme have fed back the same consistent appreciation
of your input. The sessions provided a contest for our developing services in both '
practical and conceptual terms.
     The Training Workshops which have been the major commitment have enabled staff
omhoi>iHng npr>r» some very intense work to gain both skills and confidence. Every
comment from staff who have been through those workshops has been positive about the .
relevance and pertinence of the content and the quality of the presentation.

     Nonet of us believed "it would ever happen to us". We were, therefore,
poorly prepared and poorly trained. The Centre has worked hard and diligently to
remedy this with us. With Hindsight we know that training should have preceded
the disaster, but with the work from the Centre for Crisis Psychology we have very
quickly caught up with meeting the training needs.

     On a personal note can I thank you for the support you have given me during a
very stressful period.   I have appreciated being able to draw on your experience and
wisdom. That is something that it is extremely difficult to quantify and cost, but
I know only too well how valuable that service is.


                                     Yours sincerely,

..... with regard to the followin~ points that Professor Maunder has, r~l~e~-
    1. He has examined the fencing at Hillsborougb and he thinks there Is scope

                       for. the perimeter fence (some of this) to be converted so that they.can
                       be removed quickly, by way of quick release bolts. Please can you have

                       some pFincipal ~rounds visited and photographs taken as to whether this
                       is feasJb]e. This is an urgent requirement for Professor Maunder’s
                       Sublaission to   Lord Justice Taylor.
         2. Jn the 1950’s many thousands of people packed in to these grounds. Is it
                       poss~bJe for archive photographs at the clubs, say the ones that we choose
                       above, to be researched in conjunction with the Health and Safety Executive
                       to see if we can identify the identity of packing. . ...............

8tB~!~7:    EXAMINATION OF PERIMETEr FENCES



In accordance wlth the matters raised by Professor MAUNDER, I have visited
the football stadiums shown below and examined the perlmeter fencing.
1. WEM~LEY STADTI]H
    There are two types of perimeter fencing presently in Use at Wembley.
    Type one was originally erected in 1977 as a result of pitch invasions
    at international football matches. Within the last two years these
    have been modified by the addition of two lateral metal strips across
    the diagonal sloping spikes. The gates are opened by releasin8 bolts
    at the top and bottom. The gate space is measured at 3"8". There are
    35 of these gates, each manned by a Steward.
    The second type of gate has been fitted since the Hillsborough
    Disaster. The mechanism consists of a lever which is secured by a
    piece of plastic strip. When the lever is pulled the plastic strip
    breaks, releasing the gate. The whole fence opens out onto the track.
    The space available for access is 10’3" There are seven of these
    gates in use and each one is manned by a Steward.

    Type two is easy to operate and gives quick access to the pitch in the
    case of emergency.

    Lateral fences are only used to divide standins/seating areas.

    A statement from Mr G WISE, Site Controller, is attached together with
    a newspaper extract concerning the erection of fences in 1977.

2   HIGHBUEy, LONDON
    Highbury is the home ground of Arsenal F.C., the current League
    Champions. They do not have and have never had perimeter fences.
    They do have a retaining fence approximately 3 feet high, which has a
    moat approximately 3 feet deep by 3 feet wide behind it. Police
    Officers patrol the track and the Club have not experienced any
    problems with pitch invasions.

    There are lateral fences behind each goal. At the rear of each
    lateral fence is a transfer gate which is manned by a Police Officer.

3. OLD TRAFFORD, MANCHESTER
    The home ground of Manchester United F.C.

    Perimeter fences were first erected behind the goals and Old Trafford
    in 1974 following a pitch invasion at a local derby match. It
    extended to the rest of the ground in 1976.
2.


         There are 29 gates, each of which operate on a quick release lever
         system. When opened the gate space measures 3’4". The Club, which is
         one of the best supported in the country, have never had problems with
         overcrowding and have not felt the need to modify the system since it
         was first installed.

         Behind the visitors end lateral fences have been fitted each of which
         has a transfer gate at the rear.
         All transfer gates and perimeter gates are manned by Police Officers.

         Attached is a statement from[             I, who has been employed by
         Manchester United FC for 29 years and is presently Assistant
         Secretary. i           [ has kindly provided photographs of the existing
         perimeter fencing at 01d Trafford and also the latest fencing to be
         fitted at Brighton and Hove Albion FC which is a bolt release system
         with the double gates opening out to give access to the pitch.
         Viewing for spectators is less restricted through these gates.
         A Manchester United perspective on the National MembershipScheme is
         also attached.

     .
         VILLA PARK, BIRMINGHAM

         The home ground of Aston Villa FC where the other 1989 Semi Final
         match between Everton and Norwich was played.

         Perimeter fences were first erected at Villa Park in 1978/1979
         season. They are now erected in front of standing supporters, both
         home and away, and also in front of seated away supporters. The
         fencing has only been slightly modified by the addition of i" spike to
         the top to prevent spectators climbing over.

         The gates are opened by releasing a bolt and each gate is manned by a
         Police Constable. The gate space measures 3’8". There has been no
         modification since the Hillsborough Disaster.
         A statement fromI              , Assistant Secretary is attached.

5.       THE HAWTHORNS, WEST BROMWICH

         The home ground of West Bromwich Albion FC. West Bromwich Albion are
         in the Second Division, having narrowly missed promotion to Division
         One last season.

         Perimeter fences were first erected in 1974. They have been
         strengthened over the years and about 8 years ago an additional ’rake’
         was added to the top of the fences to prevent spectators climbing
         over.


                                                                      Cont’d /
3.


     The gates are opened by releasing a bolt and the gate space is 4’5"
     All gates are manned by Stewards.

     Fences are only erected in front of home and away standing supporters.

     Since the events of Hillsborough the inside of the gates in the
     perimeter fencing have been painted fluorescent orange to highlight
     that they are emergency exits. A statement fromI
     Ground Director, is attached.
GENERAL

Only Wembley with the introduction of their type 2 fencinglgate have made
any major changes in the light of the Hillsborough Disaster.

All the grounds staff were of the opinion that existing arrangements would
ensure the safe evacuation of any pens or terraced area.

No advantages were seen in the suggestion of quick release system whereby
the whole fencing collapsed onto the pitch, as it was thought that
spectators were likely to trip and stumble in an attempt to reach safety.

None of the Clubs has photographs readily available to indicate crowd
attendances in the 1950’s, but will research their archives and forward
any suitable material. It may be worth approaching the BBC for footage of
previous semi-finals held at Hillsborough.

            I am presently employed as Site Controller at Wembley Stadium I have

            held this position {or almost two years. Prior to this I ~,Jas a Chie{

            Superintendent in the Metropolitan Police and I have a vast experience

            of" policing {irst class #ootball maches.

            Perimeter ~ences ,,.,ere ~’irst erected at Wembley Stadium in September

            ¯ 1977 as a result o{ pitch invasions by {ootball {arts at International

            Matches. These ~’ences a,.,ere motile’led in the last t~,.,o yers by adding

            t~o metal stands across the diagonal sloping spikes as an additional

            saf’ety precaution ~or those attempting to climb over’ them. In the light

            o{ the incident at Hillsborough seven ne~m perimeter

            gates ,,~er’e installed o~ a different type v+hereby on pressure o~ a

            lever a plastic seal is broken enabling the ~,:hole {ence to pivot open.

            We also revie~,~ed our other safety arrangements and systems~ Since ~he

            perimeter {ences ~,~ere erected ~,~e have had no problems o{
                                                                            PAGE 2

         o~ercro,,~ding and our emergency plans are ~requently updated~

         I do not negotiate ~,~ith the {ootball asociation in respect o{

         perimeter ~ences but deal with the local police and 8rent Council~

         As a result o{ the Hillsborough Disaster a decision was made that the

         perimeter ~ences ~ould be removed ~or this years FA Cup Final bet,~een

         ~ould have con{ormed to everybodys request to stay o~ the pitch but

         this ~as not the case, at the end o{ the game about two hundred {ans

         came onto the pitch and once the FA Cup was presented more came onto

         the pitch su{{icient to prevent the players doing a lap o{ honour~

           I Inave been employed by Manchester United ~ootball club ~or twenty

           nine years and presently hold the post of" assistant Club Secretary.

           Perimeter f’ences were ~irst erected at Old Trai~f’ord in 1974 behind

           both goals as a result ol~ a pitch invasion at a local derby match.

           This was extended in "1976 to completely surround the playing area~

           The system operates on a quick release lever mechanism on all twenty

           nine gates~ Each gate is manned by" a uniiPormed Police o{{icer~

           Behind the visitors end there are lateral i~ences which divide the area

           into small pens with a ma;<imum capacity ol~ 867 persons and an average

           ol~ 750 persons.

           At the rear ol~ each lateral i~ence is a gate which again is manned by

           a    Police oi~i~ i cer ~

           Each ol~ the pens had an emergency gate which leads onto the playing

           area
                                                                            PAGE

         The system works well. There have been no problems with overcrowding

         and no modi{ication has been required~

         As a result o{ the tragedy at Hillsborough, the replay o{ the FA Cup

          semi {inal between Liverpool and Nottingham Forest ~,~as played at Old

         Tra~ord~

          As a result o{ what happened a decision was made to leave the

          perimeter gates open, but manned in respect {or peoples {eelings~

          This was a one o{{ situation and in {uture games these gates will be

          closed and manned~

          Manchester United FC have river made any suggestions to the Football

          Association in respect of" perimeter {ences.~

        FOOTBALL: NATIONAL
        MEMBERSHIP SCHEME


     A UNITED PERSPECTIVE
                                                 A UNITED PERSPECTIVE



    FOOTBALL: NATIONAL MEMBERSHIP SCHEME
    BACKGROUND AND CLUB POLICY
    The impending legislation to bring about a National Membership Scheme
    for football will have a far-reaching and possibly devastating effect on our
    national game.

    It is widely recognised that the presence of hooligans in and around our
    stadia has, for many years, been a very real deterrent to the vast majority of
    the general public who want nothing more than an enjoyable afternoon
    out.

    Consequently, clubs like Manchester United have invested huge amounts
    of money, time and energy in creating an environment which provides
    safety and comfort for spectators whilst at the same time offers every
U   assistance to police officers responsible for crowd control. Appendix A
    records this in detail.

    No-one would deny that in any large gathering there is a potential for
    public disorder. The way clubs like Manchester United deal with that
    potential offers, perhaps a more acceptable way forward than does a
    compulsory membership scheme which would effectively deter, or at least
    seriously inconvenience, a huge number of people who are perfectly
    law-abiding and respectable. Manchester United positively and actively
    encourages school groups and youth associations to attend matches.
    Indeed, by way of an example, much good has stemmed from
    accommodating joint visits of youngsters from Ulster and Eire. Leaders see
    this as a most effective way of harmonising the different factions.
    Futhermore, a National Membership scheme could be seen by both public
    and media as totally unfair in that it would appear to discriminate against
    football when there is a background of incidents, too numerous to list, at
    other venues or occasions where serious disorders take place. As part of its
    policy Manchester United makes tickets available to supporters of the
    opposition club. These are for specially segregated areas where buffer
    zones of empty paddocks and rows of seats, (at considerable cost in lost
    revenue) are employed to ensure that there is no contact between rival
    groups. The police presence is appropriate and the supporters are
    supervised to and from their transport. The Old Trafford stadium is
    extensively covered both internally and externally by Closed Circuit TV
    system operated by the police.
                                               A UNITED PERSPECTIVE



BACKGROUND AND CLUB POLICY (continued)
There is a long history of total co-operation and liasion with the local police
and no decisions on crowd control or match arrangements are taken
without full consultation with senior officers.

The implementation of internal policies plus the wider use of Closed Circuit
TV together with the increased level of police intellegence gathering has
shown remarkable achievements. Successful stadium management is also
an integral part of the overall scheme and the falling arrest and ejection
figures for Old Trafford over the years support this contention. (See
Appendix C).

Football, at top Club level, has long ceased to be merely a game. It is a
multi-national business, a fact which is supported by the type of companies
which use the 103 Private Boxes and Executive Suite areas which cater for
over 1,000 patrons. Those resposible for entertaining clients from both
home and abroad would not do so if the atmosphere in and around the
stadium was anything like that described by certain sections of the media.




VOLUNTARY MEMBERSHIP SCHEME
When the Government announced the introduction of a 50% voluntary
membership scheme, MUFC was one of the first clubs to see the real
potential in terms of closer involvement with supporters. Successfully
reaching a target of 40,000 members, a wide range of incentives were
offered to those who joined. Club membership can create a real sense of
’belonging’ to a particular Club and offers great possibilities to supporters
and Clubs alike. The policycontinues even though the Club has actually
lost revenue through the added complication of restricting entry to certain
areas of the stadium to members only.

There is great concern that the imposition of the National Membership
Scheme will cost the goodwill and co-operation of many supporters who
will suffer delayed entry and related inconveniences. Crowd control
depends almost entirely on the public’s co-operation without which a
situation may become unmanageable. It is generally recognised that a
supporter who ceases to attend for any reason rarely returns.

3   VOLUNTARY MEMBERSHIP SCHEME (continued)
    Although Manchester United has maintained the 50% Membership
    Scheme for eighteen months, there has been no noticeable change in the
    behaviour of supporters. A recently introduced amendment to the scheme
    allows members three occasions to bring a guest for whom they are
    responsible. At the recent fixture against Liverpool, 1740 casual fans
    attended and there are no reports of any problems or incidents arising
    from their presence.

    IMPLEMENTING A COMPULSORY SCHEME
    Having stated support for the broad concept of membership, MUFC is
    totally convinced that compulsory scheme is most unlikely to be effective
    in its main aim. This is based partly on the existing capacity of computers
    and turnstiles.

    We have yet to be shown the computer hardware that will do the work
    successfully. Manchester United has run a computerised Box Office for
    more than fifteen years now and it is well known that what is promised by
    computer companies rarely, if ever, performs to anything like its supposed
    potential in’real’ situations where they may have had no experience.
    Average attendances at Old Trafford are around 40,000 but on occasions
    this figure can go as high as 56,000. Experience shows that around 50%
    arrive in the last 30 minutes before kick-off and this number increases
    substantially for evening matches. Appendix B shows the flow of
    admissions on a recent night match. It was suggested in some quarters
    that supporters need to change their habits and arrive earlier but
    constraints of work, domestic responsibilities and travel arrangements do
    not always allow the necessary extra time.

    In order to get spectators into the stadium, there have been experiments
    with later kick-offs but this has merely resulted in spectators arriving later
    whilst many have experienced difficulties with public transport on the
    homeward journey.

    Manchester United use 92 turnstiles which, when operating at full capacity,
    barely cope with the numbers entering. There is no additional space to
    ~ncrease the number of turnstiles. Nor, for the same reasons, could
    ’full-height’ entrances be installed. Additionally we do not have the space
    to provide any kind of ’holding’ area. There is much to admire in the Luton
    Town initiative in isolation, but it must be borne in mind that there are
    fundamental differences between their scheme and the National
     Membership proposals.

Ii                                                A UNITED PERSPECTIVE



     IMPLEMENTING A COMPULSORY SCHEME (continued)

     Firstly they have sufficient space to create an outer ring of floor-to-head-
     height turnstiles and secondly, the majority of their support comes from
     the immediate area. It must also be noted that their average attendance is
     around 10,000. At Luton’s recent fixture with Arsenal, a large number of
     away supporters are reported to have attended the match. Interestingly,
     crime statistics report that, since their membership scheme started, there
     has been a higher than national average increase in violent crime in the
     locality of Luton’s stadium, higher even than the rest of Bedfordshire.

     There is concern that there appears to be no provision in the proposals to
     cater for the casual attender. It is totally unrealistic to assume that the
     majority of people who may wish to attend a game sometime during the
     season will take the trouble to register. There is no evidence to suggest that
     trouble comes from the genuinely casual attender, yet football would
     almost cetainly lose his patronage whilst the troublemakers would be
     Within the scheme until caught and convicted. Current thinking suggests
     that no provision is planned to keep non-members and convicted
     hooligans away from precincts of English football grounds at the time of a
     match. If this is so, then every law-abiding spectator is at considerable risk
     of being attacked and having his card stolen. As a result, the culprit would
     be inside the stadium whilst the victim remains outside! Moreover, the
     proposals suggest that under no circumstances would the victim be
     allowed access to the match as he wouldn’t have a membership card.
     Hardly fair treatment under such circumstances.

     Another area of concern is the supposition that clubs will be able to build
     interview/detention rooms in all admission areas. Apart from physical and
     practical probems that this would pose, it highlights the demands that will
     be made on the numbers of police and ground stewards required to deal
     with card rejections, the subsequent enquiries and the consequential
     queue problems. Of particular concern is the possibility of an adult and
     child being separated through card malfunction.

     Reference was made earlier to the situation of companies using Executive
     Suite facilities. Since the demand for these facilities exceeds supply, a
     number of companies purchase season tickets and find these an excellent
     way to entertain prospective clients.

                                                 A UNITED PERSPECTIVE



     IMPLEMENTING A COMPULSORY SCHEME (continued)
     Clearly different visitors use the tickets and it is by no means unusual for
     someone to arrive as late as the Friday afternoon prior to a game and
     express an interest to attend a game. Membership restrictions would
     render such a visit impossible and we would be seen to be doing a great
     disservice to the region’s commerce and industry.

     The recent MUFC Annual General Meeting illustrated that shareholders
     were more concerned by the National Membership proposals than the
     main agenda items. Supporters of many years standing voiced concern at
     how inappropriate the plans were for dealing with a relatively small and
     manageable problem.

     Like many clubs, Manchester United regularly allows registered charities to
     collect funds outside the turnstiles on matchdays. To encourage volunteer
     collectors complimentary standing passes to view the match are supplied.
     Unless they were members these volunteers would be excluded as would
     H.M. Forces who are often invited to Old Trafford when on good will visits
     or recruitment drives.

     SUMMARY
     Manchester United firmly believes that Club memebrship is a valid tool in
     the fight against hooliganism. Schemes must be devised which encourage
     supporters to join, positively discriminating in their favour. Good stadium
2¸   management, increased use of CCTV, greater powers to the police and
     judiciary would go a long way to eradicate the problem. A compulsory
     membership scheme, however well intentioned, will do little more than
     drive away ordinary well-behaved members of the public whilst leaving the
     problem unsolved. In our opinion no scheme could satisfactorily
     discriminate between genuine supporters and those whose sole purpose is
     to cause trouble.
     It is often noticed that the football hooligan thrives on publicity. It was
     interesting to note therefore that whilst British press and TV actively
     sought out troublemakers in West Germany last summer and carried
     reports of their excesses as main stories, the German coverage was much
     lower key, thus depriving the hooligan of what he appears to desire most -
     notoriety.

     To fully appreciate the extent of Manchester United’s anti-hooliganism
     policies, a visit on a matchday would be most useful. Manchester United
     would welcome such an opportunity to exhibit our policies in action.

         1910: The Old Trafford stadium is opened designed with expansion in mind.

         1949: Old Trafford is re-opened.

         1957: Flood-lighting is installed.
    j~
         1959: Stretford End standing area is roofed.
4
         1965: Major re-development of the stadium with the club’s first cantilever
         stand and the country’s first private boxes. A policy of segregation was
         adopted and the standing sections were split into separate areas each with
         their own turnstiles, toilets and refreshment facilities.

         1966: After visiting fans had mixed with United fans on the Stretford End
         leading to skirmishes, extra barriers were added and lateral passageways for
         police were installed.

         1970: Cantilever stands were extended.

         1971: An object thrown from the crowd, landed in the opposition goal area.
         United created an exclusion area on the terraces behind the goal at that end
         of the pitch. Additionally, the Club was ordered to play away from Old
         Trafford for two ’home’ games.

         1974: Facing relegation, fans invaded the pitch just before the end of the
         game against Manchester City. Substantial fences were erected along the full
         width of the pitch at both ends of the ground.

         1975: More cantilever stand developments and restaurant facilities are added.

         1976: A good humoured pitch invasion ’celebrated’ the end of the season. As
         a result the fencing was increased to completely surround and protect the
         pitch.

         1979-1985: Further cantilever stand developments adding more restaurant
         facilities, a museum and most importantly, a family stand where adults must
         be accompanied by children.
         With all developments at Old Trafford it has been Club policy to build shallow
         terraces giving police and stewards easier access to spectators. The number
         of pens has been increased, particularly at the visitors end thus giving
         flexibility in match arrangements. Before CCTV, police used high-powered
          binoculars for crowd surveillance.

    EJECTION AND ARREST STATISTICS - ADDITIONAL COMMENTARY.
    The graphs illustrate that during the last ten years ejections and arrests at
    Old Trafford on the occasion of football matches have substantially
    reduced in number.

    As a percentage of numbers attending the fixtures, arrests and ejections
    are very low.

    During the 1984/1985 season, three well-attended fixtures occurred which
    merited a higher than normal police profile and between them they
    accounted for 73 arrests which were mainly for public order offences of a
    minor nature such as pushing or swearing.

    A marked decrease in acts of violence along with greater police powers
    under the law have enabled the police to devote more time to taking action
    against other offences. Swearing and racial abuse accounts for the slight
    increase in numbers arrested and ejected during the last two seasons.

   MEMBERSHIP SCHEME


A UNITED PERSPECTIVE
                                             A UNITED PERSPECTIVE



FOOTBALL: NATIONAL MEMBERSHIP SCHEME
BACKGROUND AND CLUB POLICY
The impending legislation to bring about a National Membership Scheme
for football will have a far-reaching and possibly devastating effect on our
national game.

It is widely recognised that the presence of hooligans in and around our
stadia has, for many years, been a very real deterrent to the vast majority of
the general public who want nothing more than an enjoyable afternoon
out.

Consequently, clubs like Manchester United have invested huge amounts
of money, time and energy in creating an environment which provides
safety and comfort for spectators whilst at the same time offers every
assistance to police officers responsible for crowd control. Appendix A
records this in detail.

No-one would deny that in any large gathering there is a potential for
public disorder. The way clubs like Manchester United deal with that
potential offers, perhaps a more acceptable way forward than does a
compulsory membership scheme which would effectively deter, or at least
seriously inconvenience, a huge number of people who are perfectly
law-abiding and respectable. Manchester United positively and actively
encourages school groups and youth associations to attend matches.
Indeed, by way of an example, much good has stemmed from
accommodating joint visits of youngsters from Ulster and Eire. Leaders see
this as a most effective way of harmonising the different factions.
Futhermore, a National Membership scheme could be seen by both public
and media as totally unfair in that it would appear to discriminate against
football when there is a background of incidents, too numerous to list, at
other venues or occasions where serious disorders take place. As part of its
policy Manchester United makes tickets available to supporters of the
opposition club. These are for specially segregated areas where buffer
zones of empty paddocks and rows of seats, (at considerable cost in lost
revenue) are employed to ensure that there is no contact between rival
groups. The police presence is appropriate and the supporters are
supervised to and from their transport. The Old Trafford stadium is
extensively covered both internally and externally by Closed Circuit TV
system operated by the police.
                                               A UNITED PERSPECTIVE



BACKGROUND AND CLUB POLICY (continued)
There is a long history of total co-operation and liasion with the local police
and no decisions on crowd control or match arrangements are taken
without full consultation with senior officers.

The implementation of internal policies plus the wider use of Closed Circuit
TV together with the increased level of police intellegence gathering has
shown remarkable achievements. Successful stadium management is also
an integral part of the overall scheme and the falling arrest and ejection
figures for Old Trafford over the years support this contention. (See
Appendix C).

Football, at top Club level, has long ceased to be merely a game. It is a
multi-national business, a fact which is supported by the type of companies
which use the 103 Private Boxes and Executive Suite areas which cater for
over 1,000 patrons. Those resposible for entertaining clients from both
home and abroad would not do so if the atmosphere in and around the
s’iadium was anything like that described by certain sections of the media.




VOLUNTARY MEMBERSHIP SCHEME
When the Government announced the introduction of a 50% voluntary
membership scheme, MUFC was one of the first clubs to see the real
potential in terms of closer involvement with supporters. Successfully
reaching a target of 40,000 members, a wide range of incentives were
offered to those who joined. Club membership can create a real sense of
’belonging’ to a particular Club and offers great possibilities to supporters
and Clubs alike. The policy continues even though the Club has actually
lost revenue through the added complication of restricting entry to certain
areas of the stadium to members only.

There is great concern that the imposition of the National Membership
Scheme will cost the goodwill and co-operation of many supporters who
will suffer delayed entry and related inconveniences. Crowd control
depends almost entirely on the public’s co-operation without which a
situation may become unmanageable. It is generally recognised that a
supporter who ceases to attend for any reason rarely returns.
                                              A UNITED PERSPECTIVE



VOLUNTARY MEMBERSHIP SCHEME (continued)
Although Manchester United has maintained the 50% Membership
Scheme for eighteen months, there has been no noticeable change in the
behaviour of supporters. A recently introduced amendment to the scheme
allows members three occasions to bring a guest for whom they are
responsible. At the recent fixture against Liverpool, 1740 casual fans
attended and there are no reports of any problems or incidents arising
from their presence.

IMPLEMENTING A COMPULSORY SCHEME
Having stated support for the broad concept of membership, MUFC is
totally convinced that compulsory scheme is most unlikely to be effective
in its main aim. This is based partly on the existing capacity of computers
and turnstiles.

We have yet to be shown the computer hardware that will do the work
successfully. Manchester United has run a computerised Box Office for
more than fifteen years now and it is well known that what is promised by
computer companies rarely, if ever, performs to anything like its supposed
 potential in’real’ situations where they may have had no experience.
Average attendances at Old Trafford are around 40,000 but on occasions
this figure can go as high as 56,000. Experience shows that around 50%
arrive in the last 30 minutes before kick-off and this number increases
substantially for evening matches. Appendix B shows the flow of
admissions on a recent night match. It was suggested in some quarters
that supporters need to change their habits and arrive earlier but
constraints of work, domestic responsibilities and travel arrangements do
 not always allow the necessary extra time.

In order to get spectators into the stadium, there have been experiments
with later kick-offs but this has merely resulted in spectators arriving later
whilst many have experienced difficulties with public transport on the
homeward journey.

Manchester United use 92 turnstiles which, when operating at full capacity,
barely cope with the numbers entering. There is no additional space to
increase the number of turnstiles. Nor, for the same reasons, could
’full-height’ entrances be installed. Additionallywe do not have the space
to provide any kind of ’holding’ area. There is much to admire in the Luton
Town initiative in isolation, but it must be borne in mind that there are
fundamental differences between their scheme and the National
Membership proposals.

                                                   A UNITED PERSPECTIVE



      IMPLEMENTING A COMPULSORY SCHEME (continued)

      Firstly they have sufficient space to create an outer ring of floor-to-head-
      height turnstiles and secondly, the majority of their support comes from
      the immediate area. It must also be noted that their average attendance is
      around 10,000. At Luton’s recent fixture with Arsenal, a large number of
      away supporters are reported to have attended the match. Interestingly,
      crime statistics report that, since their membership scheme started, there
       has been a higher than national average increase in violent crime in the
       locality of Luton’s stadium, higher even than the rest of Bedfordshire.

      There is concern that there appears to be no provision in the proposals to
      cater for the casual attender. It is totally unrealistic to assume that the
      majority of people who may wish to attend a game sometime during the
      season will take the trouble to register. There is no evidence to suggest that
      trouble comes from the genuinely casual attender, yet football would
ii,   almost cetainly lose his patronage whilst the troublemakers would be
      Within the scheme until caught and convicted. Current thinking suggests
      that no provision is planned to keep non-members and convicted
      hooligans away from precincts of English football grounds at the time of a
      match. If this is so, then every law-abiding spectator is at considerable risk
      of being attacked and having his card stolen. As a result, the culprit would
      be inside the stadium whilst the victim remains outside! Moreover, the
      proposals suggest that under no circumstances would the victim be
      allowed access to the match as he wouldn’t have a membership card.
      Hardly fair treatment under such circumstances.

      Another area of concern is the supposition that clubs will be able to build
      interview/detention rooms in all admission areas. Apart from physical and
      practical probems that this would pose, it highlights the demands that will
      be made on the numbers of police and ground stewards required to deal
 L    with card rejections, the subsequent enquiries and the consequential
      queue problems. Of particular concern is the possibility of an adult and
      child being separated through card malfunction.

      Reference was made earlier to the situation of companies using Executive
      Suite facilities. Since the demand for these facilities exceeds supply, a
      number of companies purchase season tickets and find these an excellent
      way to entertain prospective clients.

      IMPLEMENTING A COMPULSORY SCHEME (continued)

      Clearly different visitors use the tickets and it is by no means unusual for
      someone to arrive as late as the Friday afternoon prior to a game and
      express an interest to attend a game. Membership restrictions would
      render such a visit impossible and we would be seen to be doing a great
      disservice to the region’s commerce and industry.

      The recent MUFC Annual General Meeting illustrated that shareholders
      were more concerned by the National Membership proposals than the
      main agenda items. Supporters of many years standing voiced concern at
L’,   how inappropriate the plans were for dealing with a relatively small and
      manageable problem.

      Like many clubs, Manchester United regularly allows registered charities to
      collect funds outside the turnstiles on matchdays. To encourage volunteer
      collectors complimentary standing passes to view the match are supplied.
      Unless they were members these volunteers would be excluded as would
      H.M. Forces who are often invited to Old Trafford when on good will visits
      or recruitment drives.

      SUMMARY
      Manchester United firmly believes that Club memebrship is a valid tool in
      the fight against hooliganism. Schemes must be devised which encourage
      supporters to join, positively discriminating in their favour. Good stadium
      management, increased use of CCTV, greater powers to the police and
      judiciary would go a long way to eradicate the problem. A compulsory
      membership scheme, however well intentioned, will do little more than
      drive away ordinary well-behaved members of the public whilst leaving the
      problem unsolved. In our opinion no scheme could satisfactorily
      discriminate between genuine supporters and those whose sole purpose is
      to cause trouble.
      It is often noticed that the football hooligan thrives on publicity. It was
      interesting to note therefore that whilst British press and TV actively
      sought out troublemakers in West Germany last summer and carried
 i    reports of their excesses as main stories, the German coverage was much
      lower key, thus depriving the hooligan of what he appears to desire most -
~J    notoriety.

      To fully appreciate the extent of Manchester United’s anti-hooliganism
      policies, a visit on a matchday would be most useful. Manchester United
      would welcome such an opportunity to exhibit our policies in action.

STADIUM DEVELOPMENT & CROWD CONTROL MEASURES: A UNITED POLICY
1910: The Old Trafford stadium is opened designed with expansion in mind.

1941" Bombing badly damages the structure of the stadium.

1949: Old Trafford is re-opened.

1957: Flood-lighting is installed.

1959: Stretford End standing area is roofed.

1965: Major re-development of the stadium with the club’s first cantilever
stand and the country’s first private boxes. A policy of segregation was
adopted and the standing sections were split into separate areas each with
their own turnstiles, toilets and refreshment facilities.

1966: After visiting fans had mixed with United fans on the Stretford End
leading to skirmishes, extra barriers were added and lateral passageways for
police were installed.

1970: Cantilever stands were extended.

1971: An object thrown from the crowd, landed in the opposition goal area.
United created an exclusion area on the terraces behind the goal at that end
of the pitch. Additionally, the Club was ordered to play away from Old
Trafford for two ’home’ games.

1974: Facing relegation, fans invaded the pitch just before the end of the
game against Manchester City. Substantial fences were erected along the full
width of the pitch at both ends of the ground.

1975: More cantilever stand developments and restaurant facilities are added.

1976: A good humoured pitch invasion ’celebrated’ the end of the season. As
a result the fencing was increased to completely surround and protect the
pitch.

1979-1985: Further cantilever stand developments adding more restaurant
facilities, a museum and most importantly, a family stand where adults must
be accompanied by children.
With all developments at Old Trafford it has been Club policy to build shallow
terraces giving police and stewards easier access to spectators. The number
of pens has been increased, particularly at the visitors end thus giving
flexibility in match arrangements. Before CCTV, police used high-powered
binoculars for crowd surveillance.

EJECTION AND ARREST STATISTICS - ADDITIONAL COMMENTARY.

The graphs illustrate that during the last ten years ejections and arrests at
Old Trafford on the occasion of football matches have substantially
reduced in number.

As a percentage of numbers attending the fixtures, arrests and ejections
are very low.

During the 1984/1985 season, three well-attended fixtures occurred which
merited a higher than normal police profile and between them they
accounted for 73 arrests which were mainly for public order offences of a
minor nature such as pushing or swearing.

A marked decrease in acts of violence along with greater police powers
under the law have enabled the police to devote more time to taking action
against other offences. Swearing and racial abuse accounts for the slight
increase in numbers arrested and ejected during the last two seasons.

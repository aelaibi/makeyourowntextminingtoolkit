                the youTTh^that I a t w m p t e d   to resuscitate, I can only say that he was

               a white male ag-sid between 18 and 20 y e a r s .        He was heavy build,     He

               was wearlr^i^^ep^111 jeans and I think he had a blue denim shirt on

                when I was- working on him just outside the 18 yard bo;< on the extreme
    fn/T7
                right hand of the box as you look towards the Leppings Lane end of

-j^ j-^         the ground.



                I gave mouth to mouth for about 4 or 5 minutes but with no success.

               Eventually a fireman arrived carrying oxygen but the lad was beyond

                help.    I am convinced that he had been dead for some time.

         We placed t„he youth onsa wooden hoarding and carried him off to the

         other end of 't'heN^round.        There was maybe 7 or S fans i n c 1udi ng

         myself    carrying the makeshift stretcher.        I was carrying the rear

         right hand corner.



         We got to the\gyfnnasium and had difficulty getting the stretcher

         through the door.         We had to leave the hoarding outside and physically
Ca t
         carry the body in.

         There was somebody in the gym.           I can't remember who it was, who was

         directing us w h ere to lay the body.         There were several there already

         laid out in rows.



         Other fans were arriving with m^Hce bodies and were again struggling                   to

         get through the door.          I made myselSf useful where I could helping and

         guiding them tlnxough the door.          I remained at the gym in this capacity

         for maybe 15 minute's or so.          I then went outside to the right where

         there's a small      car paNj;.    This was being used as a reception area for

         the injured.      Again I just made myself useful       by making    people as

         comfortable as possible and also assisting them onto ambulances as
          *      X
         they arrivei



         Another    person that       I remember trying to resuscitate was a large man,

         aged 38 to 4 Q \ e a r s ,   he had gingerish receeding hair.       I was doing

         ttm^heart massage on him while another fan gave mouth to mouth.                  There

         was no siglr/ of life and after a suitable        length of time we went onto

         someone else.

FOREWORD


The previous Institution re p o rt on load te s tin g of s tru c tu re s published in 1964
was review ed by th e Science and R esearc h C o m m itte e of th e Institution who
decided t h a t a revision was necessary to ta k e acc o u n t of changes to British
Standards and Codes of P r a c tic e in th e la st 20 years.             Like its predecessor th is
re p o rt is intended to give guidance to th e engineer called on to prescribe a te s t
and to be a useful r e fe r e n c e when th e re le v a n t clauses of c u rre n t sp ecification s
a r e reviewed.


Covering a wide possible rang e of m a te ria ls, com ponents and s tru c tu re s th e
advice contained in this re p o rt is gen era l in n a tu re .         In draftin g th e re p o rt th e
c o m m itte e has aim ed it a t m em b ers of th e In stitution with general engineering
knowledge and s tru c tu ra l engineering ex p erien ce but for whom te stin g is an
unusual a c tiv ity . It is not intended to be a handbook for te stin g lab o raties.


The te x t contains guidance and advice and does not give specific te stin g
req u irem en ts.   In Appendix 1, som e of th e te s t req uirem ents in s tru c tu ra l codes
presently c u r re n t a re sum m arised but th e a c tu a l codes should be consulted for
d etailed and u p -to -d a te inform ation.


Although load te stin g is described in this rep o rt, it should be seen as one of
s everal     options    av ailable   for   d eterm in in g   p e rfo rm a n ce   of   s tru c tu re s   and
s tr u c tu r a l com ponents.   O th er possible processes should be explored such as
m a te ria l te stin g including N.O.T. and sampling techniques prior to any decision
to«undertake load te stin g .


Load te stin g s tru c tu re s and s tr u c tu r a l com ponents o fte n to failure requires c a re
and fo rethought to a n tic ip a te and m inim ise th e e f f e c ts o f failure and th e
a t te n d a n t risks of dam ag e and injury.




DEFINITION

For the purpose of this re p o rt th e following definition has been adopted:

T est load             - th e load th a t is added to th e s tru c tu re to achieve th e to ta l
                         load level ap p ro p ria te to a te s t

1      SCOPE

1.1     G eneral

S tru c tu re s to be te s te d a re of alm o st in finite v ariety . R ecom m endations in this
r e p o r t a re th e r e fo r e s ta te d in te r m s as g en era l as possible, and they a re not
intended to r e s tr i c t th e engineer's use of his d iscretion in any p a rtic u la r
in sta n ce. It must also be realized t h a t th e recom m en dations can n o t override any
m an dato ry re q u ire m e n t to which th e design or c o n stru ctio n of a s tr u c tu r e may
be subject. Although th e reco m m en d atio n s a re in principle applicable to s ta tic
t e s t s on m ost kinds of s tr u c tu re , th e re p o rt excludes consideration of
re q u ire m e n ts p a rtic u la r to te s tin g bridges, liquid-containing s tru c tu re s,
foundations and piles.                 The re p o rt does not deal specifically with te s ts on
s tru c tu ra l models, nor w ith lab o rato ry te stin g of m a te ria ls. N either does th e
re p o rt deal with dynam ic te stin g , for which specialist advice should be sought.

T e sts considered in this re p o rt a re applicable mainly to new s tru c tu re s . When it
is required to check th e loadbearing c a p a c ity of an old s tru c tu re , particu larly
when its stre n g th depends on unusual s tru c tu ra l form s, it may be necessary for
th e engineer to modify th e t e s t to suit p a rtic u la r c ircu m stan c es. A tte n tio n is
draw n to a n o th e r Institution r e p o rt Appraisal of existing s tru c tu re s, which gives
guidance on req u ire m en ts for load te s tin g existing s tru c tu re s .

T ests will generally be u n d ertak en to d e m o n stra te t h a t a s tru c tu re and its
com ponent p arts a re s a tis fa c to r y for th e ir intended purpose. This will e n ta il
satisfying req u ire m en ts for both stre n g th and serv ice ab ility when th e y a re
defined in re le v a n t Codes of P r a c tic e and Standards.

1.2 Limitations of static tests

changes in te m p e r a tu r e and hum idity or su sceptibility to flu c tu a tin g loads. The
engineer may find it desirable to seek e x p e rt advice on th e se m a tte rs .

2       STATIC TESTS
2.1     Reasons for testing

Although in th e norm al course of ev en ts s tru c tu re s designed to a u th o rita tiv e
specificatio ns are not required to be te s te d , te s ts may becom e necessary in a
number of c ircu m stan c es including th e following:

        When safety and s ta b ility a re to be determ ined by ensuring th a t s tresses,
        strains, displacem ents and deflection s, including distortions, do not exceed
        p redeterm ined c r i te r ia , and th a t c o m p lete or p artial failure is to be
        avoided.

        Similarly, when serv ice ab ility and durability a re to be assured, by keeping
        stresses, strain s, disp la cem en ts and deflections including distortions within
        p red eterm in ed c r ite ria .

        When it is necessary to d e te rm in e th e adequacy of a design to m e e t
        intended c r ite r ia , or to optim ise a design.

        When a s tru c tu re or p a rt of a s tr u c tu r e is not am enable to reliable
        calculation

        When a routine check or a random sam ple of a mass-produced s tru c tu re or
        p a rt of a s tru c tu re is required.

        When te sts a re required on sam ples, or in exceptional cases on all
        s tru c tu ra l units produced, to assess th e qualities of units being put into
        service. (These te s ts a re ap p ro p ria te for quality assurance schemes.)

        When m a terials or design m ethods a re used o th e r than those of the r e le v a n t
        sp ecificatio n or code of p ra c tic e .

        When th e re is doubt or d isag ree m en t as to w hether th e s tru c tu re or some
        p a rt of it com plies with re le v a n t design rules, or as to w heth er th e q uality
        of m a te ria ls or workmanship is of th e required standard.

        When it is proposed to im pose loads g r e a te r than, or d iffe re n t from , tho se
        in the original design, and when it is n ecessary to verify th e c a p a c ity of th e
        s tr u c tu re to sustain th e se d iff e r e n t loads.*

      "i Whenever s tr u c tu r a l in te g rity is in doubt       or   suspect     becau se    of
        .deterioration^ a c c id e n ta l dam age, or fire .*

2.2     Types of test

The purposes of d if fe r e n t types of te s t which may be carried out a re described
below.

        T ests to d estru ctio n

        T hese te s ts d e te rm in e th e u ltim a te s tre n g th of a s tru c tu re , and hence th e
        load fa c to r th a t will resu lt from applying a given working load. Conversely
        th e working load th a t will be perm issible with a given load fa c to r can be
        determ ined.

        During te s t s to destru ctio n , th e behaviour of th e s tr u c tu r e should be noted
        a t loads rep resen tin g both s e rv ic e a b ility lim it s t a t e loads and u ltim a te
        lim it s ta t e loads if th e se a re achieved befo re th e a c tu a l failure load.

        S tru c tu ra l developm ent te s ts
                                                                                              ♦


       T ests c arried out on prototyp es, or on one or m ore s tru c tu re s of a new or
       unproven design to d eterm in e th e adequacy of th a t design to m e et intended
       serv ice ab ility re q u ire m e n ts or o ther c r i te r ia , as specified. These te s ts are
       usually continued to d estru ctio n .

       Any m argin betw ee n required applied load and failure may indicate over­
       design or fu rth er developm ent p o te n tia l.

       Q uality control te s ts

       These te s t s a re perform ed on sam ples of s tr u c tu r e s or s tru c tu ra l units to
       ensure t h a t th e ir quality conform s to th e sp ecificatio n s.

       Such te s ts would be n o n -d estru ctiv e if c a rrie d out on every mass-produced
       assem bly but may be d e s tr u c tiv e if c a rrie d out on a lim ited sam ple.

       Site a c c e p ta n c e te s ts

       The purpose of s ite a c c e p ta n c e te s t s is to check behaviour of a s tru c tu re or
       p a rt of a s tr u c tu r e so as to assess its ad eq u a cy for service. The te s t load
       can re p re s e n t known design working loads or, m ore usually, an overload to
      >establish th a t th e re is an a d e q u a te m argin of s a fe ty under service loads.

       A s tr u c tu r e can be te s te d to assess its ability to c a rry loads th a t may be
       d iffe re n t from th o se for which it was originally designed.

       When th e r e is a reason to believe t h a t th e re is an e x tr a c a p a c ity in the
       stru c tu re a r e s tr ic te d overload may be cautiously applied to provide an
       indication of th e m agnitude of this c a p a c ity .

       If a s tr u c tu re fails to m e e t a c c e p ta n c e te s t req u ire m en ts in regard to
       reco v e ry of shape a f t e r load rem oval, it may so m etim e s be a c c e p te d if it
       m e e ts th e req u ire m en ts of a specified r e - t e s t .

       R esearch te s ts

       T ests on s tru c tu r e s or p a rts of s tr u c tu r e s may form p a rt of a program m e of
       researc h into behaviour of s tru c tu re s and m a terials. Depending on th e
       o b jects of th e researc h , add itional c r ite r ia may need to be ta k en into
       acco u n t, but th e gen era l recom m end ations contained in this re p o rt will
       probably apply to such te s ts .


       O th er types of te stin g

       A tte n tio n is draw n to th e possibility of isolating or rem oving com ponents
       from a s tru c tu re , for te s tin g in controlled conditions. Such a procedure
       may be less costly th an in situ te stin g .

       Model te stin g and m a th e m a tic a l modelling a re not d e a lt with in this rep o rt,
       but a tte n tio n is drawn to b e n e fits th a t they can yield, such as econom ies in
       te stin g , and predicting behaviour under load.


2.3    Re-tests on modified structures

If any a lte ra tio n s a re proposed in a s tr u c tu r e as th e resu lt of a te s t, th e engineer
will need to consider w hether such a lte ra tio n s n e c e s s ita te a t e s t on the modified
s tru c tu re or w hether behaviour of th e s tr u c tu r e as originally te s te d can be
regarded as indicative of th a t of th e a lte r e d s tru c tu r e . P articu la r a tte n tio n may
need to be paid to any dam ag e t h a t m ight have o ccurred in th e firs t te s t.

 3      TEST REQUIREMENTS
 3.1    Introduction

 In general te s t req u ire m en ts of a s tru c tu re will be governed by provisions of a
 re le v a n t Standard or Code of P ra c tic e . When th e engineer is em pow ered to use
 his own d iscretion, or re le v a n t guidance is not available from Codes of P ra c tic e ,
 reco m m endations in this section may be found to be useful.


 3.2    Scope

 B efore an ap p ro p ria te te s t program m e can be defined it has to be decided
 w hether th e response of th e s tru c tu r e to its load environm ent is likely to be
 s t a t i c or dynam ic.

 In re a lity all s tru c tu r e s and loads a re dynam ic in n atu re, and s ta tic response
 s ta t e s are special cases within th e dynam ic s p e c tra . T here a re no simple c le a r -
 c u t rules for distinguishing b etw een th e s e s ta te s for m ost s tru c tu re s and th e ir
 loading.        However, for sim plicity, many s tr u c tu r e s and th e ir loading
 en viro nm ents may be tr e a te d as s ta t ic conditions for both analysis and te stin g .

 It is th e re fo r e im p o rta n t to define for p r a c tic a l purposes w hat may be considered
 as s ta t ic or dynam ic behaviour and th e conditions in which such behaviour is
 likely to occur so th a t th e engineer can decide how b e s t to fo rm u la te his t e s t
 program m e.


3.3    Static behaviour

A s tr u c tu r e or p a rt of a s tru c tu re can be considered as behaving s ta tic a lly if its
response to a p a rtic u la r loading can be p re d ic te d by considering th e m agnitude of
th e loads, th e p ro p erties of m a te ria ls and th e g eo m etry of th e s tr u c tu r e alone,
i.e. a s tr u c tu r e whose stiffn e ss rem ain s c o n s ta n t a t th e s ta tic value for th e range
and type of loading it is subjected to and no sig n ifican t a m p lificatio n of th e
s ta t ic response occurs b ecause of th e n a tu re of th e load environm ent.

F or the m ajority of building and civil engineering s tru c tu r e s loads t h a t occur less
freq uently than once an hour and a re applied over a period of m ore th a n 1 min
will produce a s ta tic response. It is im p o rta n t th a t such loads should be applied
a t a uniform r a t e if dynam ic e f f e c ts a r e to be avoided, since th e governing
c r ite rio n for s tr u c tu ra l response is th e r a t e of loading.

3A     Dynamic behaviour

A s tr u c tu r e or p a rt of a s tru c tu re can be considered to behave dynam ically if its
response to a load is am plified by th e n a tu re of th e load and thus exceeds th e
s t a t i c response. Loads th a t induce dynam ic response a re those th a t have a
frequency close to a natu ral frequency of th e s tr u c tu r e . Loads th a t a re applied
a t a frequency t h a t is significantly lower than th e fu n d am en tal (lowest) n atu ral
frequency will not induce a significant dynam ic response. Loads t h a t a re applied
a t a frequency th a t is higher th an th e fu n d am en tal n a tu ra l frequency m ay e x c ite
a higher freq u en cy m ode o f vibration. The fu n d am en tal freq u en cies of civil
engineering s tru c tu r e s m ay be as low as 0.1 Hz for a la rg e suspension bridge or
0.25 Hz for a ta ll building or may be higher th a n 100 Hz for som e

    is th e r e f o re im p o rtan t. Types of s tr u c tu re , or p arts of a s tru c tu re , th a t may
    exhibit a dynam ic response a re large can tilev ers, long span lightw eight
    co n stru ctio n and ta ll or slender s tru c tu re s .

    Testing recom m endations in this re p o rt apply only to circu m stan c es w here th e
    loading produces a s t a t i c response in th e s tr u c tu r e or where dynam ic response is
    insignificant.


    3.5    S ta tic te s ts on s tr u c tu r e s

    Subsections 3.8, 3.9 and 3.10 defin e some perfo rm a n ce envelopes for s ta tic
    behaviour and specify ap p ro p ria te t e s t load regim es t h a t could be applied to
    circ u m s ta n c e s com monly arising in th e work of th e engineer. It is im p o rtan t
    th a t th e engineer should consider his specific req u irem en ts and define his own
    p erfo rm a n ce envelopes. If th e s e d iffer from those th a t follow, t e s t req u ire m en ts
    should be modified accordingly.


    3.6    T e st loads

    3.7    Bedding-in loads

^   For many types of c o n s tru c tio n it is desirable to bed-in th e s tr u c tu r e prior to
    load te stin g .    The need for bedding-in loads will vary with th e type of
    co n stru ctio n and s tr u c tu r a l m a te ria l. The o b je ct is to s e ttle th e s tr u c tu r e on its
    supports and release any fric tio n a l re s tr a in ts or o th e r stresses th a t may have
    been inco rporated during co n stru c tio n or m an u factu re .

  The level of bedding-in load should be s u fficien t to deform th e s tr u c tu r e but
 \5hould not exceed th e design se rv ic e load] or th e re-assessed serv ice load in
  c ircu m stan c es w here d e te rio ra tio n has o ccu rred or th e s tr u c tu re is suspected of
  containing a s tru c tu ra l d e f e c t.     The bedding-in load should be applied and
  rem oved in a t le a s t1[fiyel in c re m e n ts with th e d eform ations being m onitored
  during th e load cycle. The s tr u c t u r e can be considered to be s a tisfa c to rily
  bedded-in when it has reco v e red to its original position fa 10%1 a f t e r a loading

    Bedding-in loads m ay not be necessary where isolated com ponents a re te s te d in
    laborato ry conditions or w here th e r e is good control of load conditions and
    assembly.

           3.8.1           O bjectiv e

           The purpose of this ty p e of te stin g is to establish if behaviour of the
           s tr u c tu r e is likely to be s a tis f a c to r y for its purpose in serv ice . This t e s t
           may be made in c irc u m s ta n c e s where design and c o n stru c tio n is
          thought to be as originally intended but a change                      of use or o ther
          req u ire m en t is necessary, where dam age has o ccu rred or        som e shortcom ing
          has been incorporated into th e s tr u c tu re , w here               th e s tr u c tu r e is
          d e te rio ra tin g , or where repairs have been c arried o ut to      a d e te rio ra te d or
          d e f e c tiv e s tru c tu re .

          3.8.2         C rite ria for load req u ire m en ts

          C rite ria in serv ice are th e a c c e p ta b ility of long-term d eform ations under
          th e p erm an en t dead load and defo rm a tio n s arising from s h o rt-te rm imposed
          and wind loads, and the ability of th e s tr u c tu r e to c a r ry its full serv ice
          loading safely.

          3.8.3         T est loads

      ff', The serv iceab ility te s t load will norm ally be specified in th e relevant
         \ Codes of P r a c tic e and should be applied in 5 to 10 in c rem en ts. Each
          \ in c re m e n t should be applied over a period of not less th an 1 min t<5 avoid
           1shock or im p act e f f e c ts but should o therw ise a t te m p t to sim u late th e real
           'build-up of load on th e s tr u c tu r e in service.

         Whenever p ra c tic a l, th e distribution of load should be th e sam e as th e
         w orst ca se assum ed in design unless th e reasons for te stin g req uire
         particu lar em phasis to be placed on an o th er co n figuration of loading.

         In general th e te s t load should be rem oved in th e sam e number of
         d e c re m e n ts over a sim ilar period as was used in th e loading cycle.

         Where th e t e s t load is not specified in th e re le v a n t Code of P ra c tic e or is
         not applicable to th e p articu lar c irc u m s ta n c e s of th e s tr u c tu r e being
         considered^; th e t e s t load may be chosen as th e maximum th e s tru c tu re
  y      should sustain w ithout suffering p e rm a n e n t d efo rm a tio n or damage,' or
         (0.25 x dead load* + 1.25 x imposed load), w hichever is th e less.

         Although th e loading conditions being sim ulated will be tr e a te d in general
         as s ta tic , it may not be ap p ro p ria te to use th e lo a d -te s t procedures in this
         subsection in cases w here th e imposed load has a large tra n s ie n t com ponent
         or w here fa tig u e is a likely          mode of failu re.         Insuch cases, it may be
         n ecessary to establish th e c h a ra c te ris tic s of th e load in order to devise a
         su ita b le te s t load regim e.

         3.8.4         M easurem ents and observations

         S ufficient m easu rem en ts of d e fle c tio n should be ta k en to enable th e
         m aximum d e fle c tio n and th e d e fle c te d shape of th e s tru c tu r e to be

* This assum es th a t th e s tr u c tu r e or p art of th e s tr u c tu r e under t e s t is already

3.9   Testing for u ltim a te c a p a c ity

      3.9.1      O bjective

      The purpose of this te s t may be to:

                show t h a t th e s tr u c t u r e will support th e design load ap p ro p ria te to

      T hese objectives may be m e t using a basic procedure adapted in d e ta il to

      cap a city and q u a lita tiv e info rm atio n regarding d e fo rm a tio n c h a r a c te ris tic s
      of th e s tru c tu re .

      The aim of q u a n tita tiv e d a ta co llection should                be    to   monitor      th e
      d eform ation behaviour of th e s tru c tu re under t e s t .

Some circu m stan c es in which te s ts may be applicable are:

          when a batch of com ponents or p a rt of a s tr u c tu r e is believed to be
          substandard in a way th a t is d ifficu lt to assess by o ther means (e.g.
          poor bond of re in fo rc e m e n t in c o n c re te construction)

           used (e.g. w here bearings or fixings have lim ited m ovem ent                     or
           where la te ra l bracing by o th e r m em bers may be invalidated                  by
           excessive d eflectio n of th e main s tru c tu re )

           w here consequences of a c c id e n ta l dam age are required to be
           investigated.

3.9.2     C rite r ia for load req u ire m en ts

In many instances these re q u ire m e n ts may be m ore com plicated than in
serv iceab ility testing, since dead and imposed loads will be fa c to re d
d iffe re n tly , and o ther com binations of dead and imposed load may be
required to produce w orst load envelope. C onsideration should be given to
th e m ost adverse com bination of dead and imposed loads.

3.9.3     Test loads

Values of fa c to re d loads will norm ally be specified in th e re le v a n t Code of
P ra c tic e from which th e m ost adverse com binations for th e p articu lar
s tr u c tu r e can be d eterm in ed .

A number of load com binations may be required to produce ap p ro p ria te
lim iting conditions for flexure, sh e a r and torsion. In cases w here sp ecial
in fo rm ation is required on eac h ty p e of behaviour a number of s e p a ra te
te s ts should be carried out.

If th e load in service is not s ta tic th e n c a r e should be ta k en to ensure th a t
th e q u a si-sta tic t e s t load is chosen c o rre c tly .

Few s tru c tu re s should fail a t th e design load ap p ro p ria te to th e u ltim a te
lim it s ta t e , although some may be perm an en tly deform ed. If th e t e s t is to
be c arried through to failure, additional loading should be applied a t the
engineer's d iscretion .

3.9.4     M easurem ents and observations

M easurem ents of d eflectio n should be ta k en a t s u fficien t locations to
enable maximum deflectio n and d e fle c te d shape of th e s tr u c tu r e to be
d eterm in ed . D eform ation m e asu re m en ts are required to establish th e load

linear behaviour. It should be a n tic ip a te d th a t th e range of d e fo rm a tio n

                                               -11 -

      During th e . te s t , w herever practica b le, any cracks or existing d e fe c ts
      should be m onitored during th e loading cycle. As th e load approaches th e
      maximum value, p a rtic u la r a tte n tio n should be paid to support conditions
      of th e s tru c tu r e and to behaviour of any la te ra l or secondary bracing
      p resen t.

      Any physical changes during th e te s t th a t a f f e c t stiffn ess of th e s tr u c tu r e
      such as debonding of floor screeds should be noted.

     If failu re occurs and is du ctile in c h a ra c te r, it may be possible to record
     th e sequence of events as failure approaches. Where failure is likely to be
     sudden or w here id e n tificatio n of th e mode of failure is specifically
     required, a video recording system could be a useful additional aid since
     sev eral locations can be m onitored and a recording of th e sequence of
     ev ents may be slowed down and reviewed.

     The purpose of this ty p e of te stin g is to improve a product beyond th e point
     a t which calcu latio n s can be used to p redict p erfo rm a n ce, or to c o m p are
     a c tu a l p e rfo rm a n c e w ith th a t predicted by d iff e re n t c alcu la tio n

     3.10.2     C r ite r ia for load req u irem en ts

     T est-load req u ire m en ts should re f le c t as far as possible th e re q u ire m e n ts
     of th e s tr u c tu r e in service.            This will norm ally involve te stin g for

     G eneralized minimum stan d a rd s for these te s ts will norm ally be given in
     th e re le v a n t Code of P ra c tic e or by specification. It is im p o rta n t to
     consider the proposed application of th e s tr u c tu r e to identify any loading
     cases not included in re le v a n t standards or specifications.

    P a rtia l loading should be considered if this is likely to a rise in p r a c tic e

      3.10.3     M easurem ents and observation

     M easurem ents and observation should be a t le a st as com prehensive as those
     given in th e subsections on serv iceab ility and u ltim a te load te stin g . In
     many cases, additional inform ation will be required to define more closely
     s tr u c tu r a l behaviour both a t specified locations within th e s tr u c tu r e and in
     te rm s of overall p erfo rm a n ce.

     As a g eneral principle, sim plicity is to be p referred to com plexity since it
     is b e t t e r to make a few c ritic a l m e asu re m en ts th an to make many sim ilar
     m e asu re m en ts most of which may not add sub stantially to th e inform ation
     concerning s tr u c tu r a l behaviour.

     (a)        to ensure th a t th e p e rfo rm a n ce sp ecification or req u irem en ts are
                a d e q u a te to define s tr u c tu ra l p e rfo rm a n ce in service.

     (b)        to ensure th a t th e s tr u c tu r e does in f a c t comply in all resp ects
                with th a t sp ecification.


3.11 Some factors that may affect testing

     3.11.1     Load sharing in floors and roofs

     In most types of floors and roofs dispersion of load (i.e. load sharing)
     b etw ee n a d ja c e n t com ponents occurs. In s tru c tu re s designed to span in one
     d ire ctio n only, lim ited tw o-w ay spanning a c tio n occurs as a re s u lt of
     la te r a l con nections b etw ee n main com ponents and th e geo m etry and edge
     fixity conditions of th e co nstruction.

     The overall e f f e c t of this is th a t when a point or line load is placed on a
     single com ponent, load sharing occurs b etw een a d ja c e n t com ponents, and
     th e s tre n g th of several of the com ponents may be com bined to support th e
     applied load. In order to ensure th a t th e section of floor or roof being
     te s te d is being loaded in acc o rd an ce with th e intentions of th e te s t, th e se
     e f f e c ts must be allowed for or rem oved.          The m ost c e rta in way of
     rem oving th e se e f f e c ts is to isolate physically th e p art of the s tr u c tu r e
     being te s te d and to load th e isolated a re a . However, this is unlikely to be
     p ra c tic a b le in most in stan ces and where th e r e is continuity may be
     undesirable. Such isolation should only be considered w here th e re is no
     s tr u c tu r a l con tin uity.

     A p ra c tic a l a lte rn a tiv e is to load an a r e a of th e c o m p le te floor or roof
     using a loaded width a t le ast equal to th e span of th e sectio n being te s te d .
     If such an a r e a is loaded w ith th e full t e s t load, th e c e n tre of th e loaded
     a r e a will as a rule be carryin g its intended t e s t load.

A nother approach is to apply th e load te s t to an individual com ponent, to
a t te m p t to d e te rm in e load-sharing c h a ra c te ris tic s of th e s tr u c tu re and to
co m p en sate for th e se in th e te s t program m e.

An ap p ro x im ate e s tim a te of th e se c h a ra c te ris tic s may be obtained by using
a rolling load to obtain th e in situ stiffn ess of each com ponent in th e floor
or roof. D eflections of a d ja c e n t p arts of th e s tru c tu re to t h a t being te ste d
may then be m easured, and from th e in situ lo a d /d eflectio n c h a ra c te ris tic s ,
an e s tim a te of load d istribution within th e floor or roof may be made.

As loads in c rease th e load distribution c h a ra c te ris tic s of th e s tru c tu re may
change. T h e re fo re this tech n iq u e may be useful only up to a load level
ap p ro p ria te to th e serv ice ab ility lim it s ta te .

3.11.2     T e m p e ra tu re m ovem ents

Some s tr u c tu r e s will d eform considerably because of                        d iffe re n tia l
te m p e ra tu r e e f f e c ts across th e constructio n, e.g. roofs.              D eflec tio n
m easu rem en ts ta k e n during th e te s t may contain elem en ts of            te m p e ra tu r e
d eflectio n , and if th e r e a re changes in conditions on e ith e r             side of th e

One way of taking acc o u n t of th e se e f f e c ts is to monitor m ovem ents of th e
s tr u c tu r e in re la tio n to te m p e r a tu r e changes several days prior to load
te stin g to establish a 'fo o tp rin t' of m ovem ent with d iffe re n tia l te m p e r a tu r e
readings. The s am e te m p e r a tu r e m easurem ents can then be ta k en during
th e t e s t , and if changes of te m p e r a tu r e occur, te m p e ra tu re -in d u c e d
deflectio n s can be d ed ucted from th e to ta l readings taken.

3.11.3     T e m po rary supports and s a fe ty s tru c tu re s

Any s a f e ty s tr u c t u r e e r e c te d to support th e load in th e e v e n t of failure
during a te s t should be cap a b le of supporting a t le a s t tw ice th e sum of the
to ta l load of th e co n stru c tio n and its te s t load or ancillary equipm ent. This
assum es th a t th e s a fe ty s tr u c t u r e will be very close to th e s tru c tu re being
te ste d so t h a t in th e e v e n t of failu re im pact e ff e c ts are minimized.

In complying with th e s e req u ire m en ts, it has to be borne in mind t h a t a
space m ust be le f t to enable th e s tru c tu re to d e fle c t freely during te stin g .
When te stin g for u ltim a te c a p a c ity w here deflections a re likely to be large,
it may be advisable to have rem o vable blocks th a t can be progressively

4     MEASURES TO BE TAKEN BEFORE TESTING

4.1    Preparation

Load te stin g is p o tentially hazardous. C a re must be ta k en to minimise dam age
and to p rev en t injury. Application of loads in excess of tho se to be m et in
se rv ic e may produce unexpected results and th e failure of s tru c tu re s or
com ponents under load can release stored energy suddenly. When planning a
t e s t , it is w orth considering th e options available for applying loads or
d isp la cem en ts and th e d iffe re n t behaviour of th e t e s t piece a t failure th a t
d if fe r e n t m ethods of load application produce. W hether th e m a te ria l is ductile
or b rittle will influence this choice.

Dead loads applied by sandbags, w a te r tanks e t c can be e ff e c tiv e and relatively
cheap but c a re is n ecessary to lim it th e re lease of p o te n tia l energy on failure of
th e te s t piece. Jack s can o fte n provide an in c re m e n ta l loading system with the
option of an in c re m e n ta l d isplacem ent. This can be useful when te sting du ctile
m a te ria ls beyond th e ir ela s tic range. Screw jacks may be m ore suitable than
hydraulic jacks when in c re m e n ta l displacem ents a re adopted.

F ailure loads should be p red icted as far as possible from th e m a te ria l stren g th s
of th e s tr u c t u r e or com ponent before te stin g but th e s e predictions may be wrong
and should only be ta k e n as a guide to a n tic ip a te d perfo m a n ce under te s t . The
u n ex p ected can and does happen.

In preparing a s tr u c t u r e for te s t it m ust be a s c e rta in e d th a t th e ap p ro p riate
conditions o b tain. With c o n c re te , masonry or o th e r m a te ria l with age-depend ent
p ro p e rtie s , th e proper period of tim e for ageing m ust elapse in ap p ro p riate
conditions of te m p e r a tu r e and humidity b efo re te stin g .

If th e t e s t is in s itu , p recau tio n s ag ainst th e w eath e r may be necessary. Even
when th e te s t is indoors, sunshine may cause undesirable e f f e c ts with a s tru c tu r e
t h a t is p a rtic u la rly sen sitiv e to te m p e r a tu r e changes.

In all load te s ts th e r e a r e likely to be som e hazards to persons involved with th e
t e s t and so m etim e s to th e public. A tte n tio n is draw n to th e need to observe
s ta tu to r y req u ire m e n ts relatin g to health and s a fe ty and to th e responsibility of
em ployers and em ployees to ta k e reasonable ca re .

Supports should usually be provided just below th e s tr u c tu r e or load to prev en t a
dangerous collapse, and in any case prior co n sid eratio n should be given to sa fe ty
of personnel in th e e v e n t of a collapse, w h eth er e x p e c te d or not.


4.2   Survey of condition of structure

The s tr u c t u r e should be care fu lly exam ined for d e fe c ts of m a te ria l or assembly
b e fo re, during and a f t e r load te stin g .

D e fe c ts existing prior to te stin g may lead to untypical behaviour. They should
be recorded and drawn to th e a tte n tio n of th e eng ineer. Whether d e fe c ts should
be re c tifie d b efo re proceeding w ith th e te s t is a m a tte r th a t will depend on the
p a rtic u la r circ u m s ta n c e s ; in a routine t e s t of a s tru c tu ra l m em ber it may be
desirable to deal w ith th e m em ber e x a c tly as it is supplied, while if a c c e p ta n c e
of a single large s tr u c tu r e is in question it may be ap p ro p ria te to modify or
re p a ir it prior to te stin g .
                                             -   15   -




Among d e fe c ts may be spalled, crac k ed or broken c o n c re te ; splintered, r o tte n or
c rac k ed tim b er; bent, corro ded or o th e rw ise dam aged m etal; im p e r fe c t or
missing fasten e rs; d e fe c tiv e masonry; and poor, broken or crac k ed welds.

4.3 Expected behaviour of structure

In general, s tru c tu re s should not be te s te d w ithout th e engineer having
d e term in ed th e likely mode of failu re and calcu la ted th e e x p e c te d
lo a d /d eflectio n curve. Where previous ex p erien ce is available this would be
useful for determ ining such d eflectio n s and u ltim a te load. In th e case of s ta t ic
te s t s this enables load in c re m e n ts to be defined which ensure th a t a d eq u a te
inform atio n is c o llected so t h a t th e load a t which e lastic behaviour ceases or a t
which failure occurs may be closely defined. Where th e failu re load is d iffic u lt
to e s tim a te a c c u ra te ly , possibly b ecause Code of P ra c tic e provisions a re not
re le v a n t and th e re a re no previous te s t s to re fe r to, care fu l consideration should
be given to th e likely behaviour of th e s tr u c tu re and to th e number of in c re m e n ts
(or d ecrem en ts) of th e load.

P relim inary low load te s ts may be useful in confirm ing w hether th e assum ed
behaviour is re alistic; th e y may also help identify th e most useful locations for
in stru m en ta tio n , c a m e ra s , e t c .

For reasons of s a fe ty an d /o r to p rev en t dam age to equipm ent it may n ot be
a p p ro p ria te to ta k e all m e a s u re m e n ts on or close to th e s tru c tu re .


4.4   Test arrangements

Measuring equipm ent should be s u fficien tly sensitive to record m easu re m en ts
ex p ec ted , i.e. th e m axim um load a tta in e d should preferably be re g iste re d
b etw een 50-70% of th e range of th e equipm ent.                 The equ ipm en t should be
ca lib ra te d prior to and p re fe ra b ly a f t e r th e te s t.

Load should be applied w ith o u t shock or vibration and should be increased to th e
steady r a t e t h a t is co n tro lled by a load p a c e r or o th e r m achine. Where m achines
w ith load platens a re used th e s e should be f la t and able to r o ta te , preferab ly on a
ball seating, prior to load ap p licatio n in ord er to ac c o m m o d a te uneveness.

No p a rt of th e support for th e loading a rra n g e m e n t should red u ce in any way th e
load being applied to th e s tr u c t u r e . P a rtic u la r c a re needs to be ta k en w ith
purpose-built rigs to ensure th a t th ey provide reac tio n s to loads th a t have
ad eq u a te stiffness and sta b ility .

On c e rta in s tru c tu re s, m e a su re m e n ts t h a t would normally be made manually
could distrub o th e r recording devices, and consideration should be given to using
re m o te m ethods of m e a su re m e n t, which also have th e ad v an tag e of s a fe r
working. W herever possible d e fle c tio n m easu re m en ts with re sp e c t to supports
should be made from a c o m p letely independent fram ew ork.

5      TESTING PROCEDURE
 5.1   Method of load application

T e st loading should be both applied and resiste d in a m anner sim ulating as
a c c u ra te ly as is reasonable and p ra c tic a b le th e actu al serv ice conditions.
L a te r a l support to p arts in com pression should also re p re se n t service conditions
a c c u ra te ly . In a d v e rte n t e c c e n tric itie s should be avoided a t points of loading and
re a c tio n , and c a re should be ta k en to ensure th a t no in a d v erten t re s tra in ts a re
p re s e n t. Where it is clear th a t th e re is div ergence from serv ice conditions,
e ith e r in loading or in re s tra in t, due allow ance for it should be made by th e
en gineer.

When dead weights, such as sandbags, bricks or iron weights, a r e used, they
should be applied in such a m anner as to avoid the possibility of arching; hanging
weights should be sim ilarly s e p a ra te d so th a t one does not influence another. If
loose sand or o th e r sim ilar su bstance is used as loading, c are is needed to avoid
non-uniform ity of a c tio n arising from fric tio n or cohesion within th e m ass.'

An a lte r n a tiv e for applying a d istrib u ted load is th e use of a ir /w a te r bags; also
th e red u ctio n of atm o sp h eric pressure on one side of th e e le m e n t/s tr u c tu re being
te s te d has th e sam e e f f e c t as d ire c t application of distributed dead w eights.
When th e load is applied via th e se m eans through a series of manifolds c a re
needs to be ta k e n to ensure t h a t th e loading is d istributed as specified by having
an a d e q u a te number of m a n o m eters. The to t a l load should be m easured by load
cells. The re a c tio n to a ir /w a te r bags may in c e rta in circu m stan c es need to be
provided by part of th e s tr u c tu re under te s t, and due allow ance m ust be made for
this.

It is so m etim e s possible to apply load to one p a rt of a s tr u c tu r e by means of
springs or o th e r straining system s, th e re a c tio n to th e se loads being sustained by
som e o th e r p a rt of th e sam e s tru c tu re . Such m ethods should be tr e a te d with
reserv atio n on th e grounds th a t th e y a re unlikely to sim u late th e load condition
being in v e stig ated . When such m ethods a r e used, c a r e should be taken to ensure
t h a t any d e fo rm a tio n in th e s tr u c tu r e resulting from th e se re a c tio n forces does
not influence th e behaviour of th e part under te s t . Similar system s may also be
used for applying la te r a l loads to s tru c tu re s , th e re a c tio n being undertaken on
an o th e r s tr u c tu r e or ground fixings.            It should be noted th a t dead load
re p re s e n ta tio n through independent jacks or sim ilar system s could e ffe c tiv e ly
s tiff e n th e s tru c tu r e .

Loads should be applied gently so as to avoid im pact, and a t such a speed and in
such a p a t te r n as to avoid un in ten tio n al local over-loading d e trim e n ta l to th e
s tr u c t u r e . Subsequent rem oval of load should be e ff e c te d with equal ca re . If the
lo a d /d e fle c tio n relationship is required a f t e r th e maximum load has been passed,
s tra in or d e fo rm a tio n con trolled loading by, for exam ple, screw jacks may be
a p p ro p ria te . It is im p o rta n t to en sure t h a t loads and in stru m en ta tio n can follow
th e m ovem ent of th e s tr u c tu r e being te s te d w ithout in terruption or abnorm al
re s tr a in t.
                                               - 17 -

The ra te of loading will be governed by consideration of in-service conditions
which th e te s t will s im u late and by o th e r fa c to rs such as th e m ethod of loading,
th e kind and size of dead w eights available (when used) and th e am ount of
inform ation which it is hoped to obtain from th e te s t. In m ost te s ts , w hether for
a c c e p ta n c e or to d e stru c tio n , it will be desirable to apply imposed loads in a
series of increm ents, and to rem o v e it by decre m en ts, so th a t a continuous
picture may be o btained of th e p erfo rm a n ce of th e s tru c tu re . The engineer
should proceed with cau tio n during th e t e s t and be prepared to reduce th e
m agnitude and r a te of app lication of th e increm ent in th e la te r stages of th e
t e s t . If it is known prior to th e t e s t t h a t th e s tru c tu re will behave approxim ately
linearly up to th e maximum te s t load then it is suggested t h a t betw een five and
te n regular load in c rem en ts be used. Where non-linear behaviour is e x p ec ted or
experienced then more in c re m e n ts may be necessary.


5.2 Observations during test

Where p ractica b le, crac k s an d /o r locations showing signs of previous m ovem ent
should be m onitored during loading and unloading cycles. If as a result of th e
loading or unloading cycles th e re has been a significant increase in th e
m agnitude or ra te of cracking or o th e r d eform ation when th e s tru c tu re has co m e
to re st, co nsideratio n should be given to re te stin g to d e te rm in e if th e e f f e c ts are
likely to be cum ulative with additional loading cycles.

The incidence and d ev elo p m en t of d e fe c ts during th e te s t should be noted a t
each in c rem en t of loading and d e c re m e n t of unloading. C racks in c o n c re te or
masonry should be m easured with a hand m icroscope with ey e -p ie c e scale or with
a special crack -m easu rin g rule; s u rface tr e a tm e n t, e.g. with w hitew ash, or
b r ittle lacquer, is helpful. C racks in welds may be m ore readily identified by an
o il-an d -talc tech niqu e or by a p e n e tra tin g dye which may be flu o rescen t. If a
crac k appears in a weld during th e loading sequence th en an appraisal should be
made of the possibility of weld failure and its consequential e f f e c t on th e
s tru c tu re b efo re th e loading seq uence proceeds fu rth er.

The use of still or cine photography and video recordings can be useful. It is
helpful if th e load and t e s t id e n tific a tio n code can be indicated in th e
photographic record or in any asso c ia te d co m m en tary .


5.3   M easurem ent of load

A ccuracy o f load -m e asu re m en t is im p o rtan t. With dead w eights such as sand or
bricks, inaccuracy may arise from v ariation s in size or from change of m o istu re
c o n te n t. It should be noted t h a t iron w eights, billets and tanks of w ater do not
suffer from this disadv antage.

M easurem ent of th e {force e x e rte d by a hydraulic ram or jack cannot be assessed
sufficiently a c c u r a t e l y T ^ m e a n s of a pressure gauge, unless th e system has been
calib rated . It is b e t te r to use a c a lib ra te d load cell or proving ring in series with
th e jack. If p ra c tic a b le , th e to t a l load on a ir /w a te r bags should be m easured by
load cells a t re a c tio n points ra th e r th an depend on m e asu re m en t of fluid
pressure.
 Where th e req u ire m en ts for load te stin g a re defined in codes and standards, th e
 load fa c to rs and numbers of te s ts will be p re d e te rm in e d to achieve a meaningful
 resu lt. O utside th e req u irm en ts of such codes and standards th e s ta tis tic a l
 significance of th e results of te stin g should be considered, p articularly if only
 one te s t is undertaken.

 In te stin g for u ltim a te c ap a city , it is im p o rta n t t h a t th e distribution and
 configuration of th e te s t load is as near as possible to th a t assumed in design.
 The ap p ro p ria te load c a p a c ity should be d e te rm in e d by considering:

        th e maximum load th e s tr u c tu r e is required to c a rry in service, i.e. th e
        design load ap p ro p ria te to th e serv iceab ility lim it s ta t e

        th e probability of exceeding th e serv ice ab ility load

        th e variability of th e s tre n g th of m a te ria ls in th e s tru c tu re

        th e variab ility of th e stre n g th of th e s tru c tu re being te s te d

        th e consequences of failure of th e s tru c tu re .

When the m aximum te s t load has been applied, readings of load and/or deflection
should be m onitored a t intervals until th e s tr u c tu r e has for all p ra c tic a l purposes
co m e to re s t.       A ction may be n ece ssary to m ain ta in th e maximum load.
R eadings should then be ta k e n during th e unloading cycle a t similar load
d e c re m e n ts to those on th e loading curve. The final reading should be taken
when th e s tr u c tu r e has com e to re s t a t th e end of th e unloading cycle.

Although in general it is recom m ended t h a t a c c u ra c y of loading and of load
m e asu re m en t be controlled to within + 2%, in som e circu m stan c es (e.g.
prototypes) an a cc u racy within + 5% is a c c e p ta b le .


5 A     M easu rem ent of s tra in and d ed u ctio n of s tre s s

C alcu latio n of s tre ss from stra in m e a su re m e n ts is usually unnecessary in
a c c e p ta n c e te stin g of ordinary s tr u c tu re s , b u t th e r e a re occasions when it may
be required, m ore usually in asso ciatio n with a d e s tru c tio n te s t , in order to
o b ta in p recise inform ation. It is beyond th e scope of this re p o rt to re fe r in
d e ta il to th e m u ltitu d e of e x p e rim e n ta l m ethods t h a t exist. The advice is,
how ever, pro ferred th a t many of them a re com plex both in operation and in
in te rp r e ta tio n , so th a t th e ir use should not be a tte m p te d unless th e necessary
e x p e rtis e is available. B rittle lacqu er or w hitew ash techniques a re useful to
establish zones of high stress c o n c e n tra tio n w ith out becom ing involved in
d e ta ile d assessm ent of stress.


5.5   M easu rem ent of d e fo rm a tio n

The d e fo rm a tio n m e a s u re m e n t m ost com m only required in te s ts of stru c tu re s is
t h a t of d eflectio n in th e dire ctio n of th e applied loading. To en sure acc u racy ,
co m pensation m ust be made for any m o v e m en t of supports. When te s ts continue
over an ex tended period, c a r e m ust be ta k e n to ensure t h a t measuring devices
a r e not disturbed and th a t p e rm a n e n t datum re fe re n c e s a re available for
checking. Measuring devices should w herever possible be m ounted independently
o f th e s tru c tu re being te ste d ;       if this is not possible, th en th ey should be
                                                  - 19 -

positioned on a p a rt of th e s tr u c tu r e where m ovem ent is insignificant re la tiv e to
th a t of in te re s t.   If it is necessary to co m p en sate for te m p e ra tu re -in d u c e d
e f f e c ts (see subsection 3.11) su fficien t te m p e r a tu re readings should be ta k e n
during loading and unloading cycles to enable th e deflectio n arising from
te m p e ra tu r e changes to be d eterm in ed .

Similar gauges fixed to id e n tic al but unloaded elem en ts                 can be used to
co m pensate for variations in te m p e r a tu r e and humidity.


D eflections a t each in c re m e n t of load should be recorded and plo tted and th e
behaviour of th e s tr u c tu re review ed during th e t e s t . C are should be ta k en to
ensure th a t th e s tr u c tu r e com es to re s t b efore th e n ext load in c rem en t is__
applied. The next in c re m e n t of load should never be applied b efo re plotting the; h
reading from th e previous in c re m e n t - a u to m a tic recording of results via an x-y
p lo tte r or a visual display un it is useful in this re s p e c t. This is necessary in case,
th e engineer has to am end im m ed iate ly th e te s t program m e as a result of any?
abnorm al behaviour. Such a curve will serve as a check against m istakes and wills
show up any irre g u la ritie s in th e behaviour of th e s tru c tu re and so enablej
particu lar weaknesses to be in v estig ated as th e te s t progresses. •                       U-

If deflectio ns a t a c o n s ta n t load occur over a significant period, th e te s t should
be te rm in a te d and th e s tr u c tu r e considered to be a t u ltim a te lim it s ta te .

If th e s tr u c tu r e has not been loaded to failure, readings of d eflectio n s may be
ta k en on th e unloading cycle, th e final readings being taken when th e s tru c tu re
has for all p ra c tic a l purposes co m e to re s t a f t e r all th e te s t load has been
rem oved.

O ther deform ations t h a t m ay be of significance in assessing th e stre n g th of a
s tru c tu re are those arising from form s of com pression instability - sideways
bowing, tw isting and local buckling, th e l a t t e r p articu larly in re s p e c t to thin-
p la te elem en ts - and also m o v e m en t and/or distortion of joints and fa s te n e rs.
The incidence of any of th e se should be noted and its progress recorded
throughout th e te s t . As a s tr u c tu r e nears failure th e length of th e tim e ta k e n to
read manually a num ber of dial gauges can give misleading resu lts. T h e re fo re,
th e use of a u to m a tic recording devices, such as linear tran sducers and
datalogg ers, is strongly recom m ended.              In c e rta in m e tal s tru c tu re s where
developm ent of p la stic strain s can be e x p ec ted , it may be useful to em ploy a
m eans such as a s tra in -se n s itiv e lacquer for th e ir id e n tificatio n and ex am in ation.

The point a t which c o n tro l of defo rm a tio n ra th e r than control of load becom es
th e te s t crite rio n should be noted.


5.6   Inspection of te s t e d s tr u c t u r e

5.7    Assessment of test

A q u a lita tiv e assessm ent of a te s t , as well as th e num erical results, is most
im p o rta n t. Observing a te s t gives th e engineer a 'feeling' for th e behaviour of a \
s tr u c tu r e which cannot be expressed easily just in te r m s of num erical results. It {
is only from a te s t to failure th a t th e real mode of failure and tr u e cap a city of a :,j
s tr u c tu r e can be determ in ed .


5.8    Reporting of test

Testing of a s tru c tu re cannot be said to be co m p leted until th e resu lt has been
properly rep o rte d , th e e x te n t and d e ta il of th e re p o rt depending on th e aim s of
th e te s t.

A re p o rt on a ro utine con trol t e s t (subsection 2.2) will usually reco rd m erely th e
load, th e d eflectio n , th e am ount of recovery on rem oving th e load, and w hether
d e fe c ts app ear during th e te sts; it will o fte n be convenient to use a simple form
recording th e se .

R e p o rts on te s ts for o th e r reasons (subsection 2.2) may vary g re a tly in scope,
ranging from a full-scale laboratory re p o rt with tables, graphs, drawings,
photographic evidence and inform ed co m m en t on behaviour, to a b rie fe r
do cum ent recording m erely salien t fe a tu re s of p erfo rm a n ce.

In every re p o rt it is desirable to re f e r to conditions in which th e te s t took place
and to p recise loadings, tim es, defo rm a tio n s and reco v e ries. Behaviour t h a t is
not understood (p articularly if to ta lly unexp ected) should be highlighted in th e
re p o rt. Every re p o rt should bear th e d a te of th e t e s t and be signed by th e
en gineer in ch arg e of th e te s t.

Where te s t s a re c arried out on p ro to ty p es of s tr u c tu r e s not am enable to
c a lcu la tio n , or when th e m a terials or design m ethods a r e not those of re le v a n t
sp e c ific a tio n or code, c o m p lete records of th e p ro to ty p e te s te d should be kep t so
th a t it can be estab lished th a t th e a c tu a l s tr u c tu r e is identical with th e
p ro to ty p e te s te d . T hese records should include d e ta ile d drawings and a d etailed
descrip tion of th e behaviour of th e s tr u c tu r e under te s t .

 IStructE report: Demountable grandstands
Scope



This document draws together information1’2’3 that a chartered engineer should be
aware of when designing or analysing demountable spectator stands.
   In the context of this document, demountable stands are considered to be
structures assembled from suitably connected single and/or part-assembled
components supporting a level or stepped platform. In general it is expected that they
will not be in a position for periods longer than one m onth and that after dismantling
the constituent parts will be reused many times. It is assumed that they will have to
conform with Building Regulations A l , A2 and A3 and B1 and B3.4
   Much of the material is naturally common to the design of all stands whether
perm anent or demountable. Special emphasis is however placed on those items that
are likely to be of greater importance in the design of demountable stands. It
concerns:
  stand occupancy, access and egress
  loading
  foundation design assumptions
  analytical procedures and
  inspection responsibilities
  It should also prove helpful when assisting his client to draw up the brief before
going out to tender. A clear brief to the supplier is essential to avoid
misunderstanding later.

3.4 A cceptance test
This test is intended as a non-destructive test for confirm­
ing structural perform ance. The assembly should prove
capable of sustaining the test loading given in subsection
3.3.

3.5 Strength test
The strength test is used to confirm the calculated capacity
of the structure or com ponent. Before carrying out the
strength test the specimen should first be submitted to and

    The actual yield strength of the m aterial should be
 determ ined from coupon tests*, and an average yield
 strength value taken from such tests.
    A t this load there should be no failure by buckling or
 rupture of any p art of the specimen, and on removal of
 the test load, the recovery should be at least 80%.
    The design strength and factored load are as defined in
 subsections 2.4 and 2.5.

4.7 Balustrading and handrails
D em ountable grandstands should be fully protected with
front, side and rear safety rails. These rails should comply
with the relevant local licensing authority requirem ents,
but the following general rules should be observed:
     End safetyrails
     1100mm high of closed- or open-mesh construction such
     that a 100mm sphere cannot be passed through any part
       Side rails should resist a horizontal load of l.OOkN/m
     run at their top rail position.
     Rear safetyrails
     1100mm high of closed- or open-mesh construction such
     that a 100mm sphere cannot be passed through any part
        R ear rails should resist a horizontal load of
     l.OOkN/m run at their top rail position
     Front rails
     F ront rails should resist a horizontal load of 1.5kN/m
     run at their top rail position
     Front balustrade (infrontofgangway)
     1100mm high of heavier construction to resist a horizon­
     tal load of 3.00kN/m run at their top rail position.
  All access stairways and ramps should be fully protected
with safety rails.

4.8 Stairways and ramps
All access stairs and ramps, w hether internal o r external,
should be so constructed as to have at least Vih fire
resistance10,11. Stairways need not be closed in or covered,
but steps should be well defined and dimensioned as given
in subsection 4.4.
   W ith internal stair units (constructed within the grand­
stand m ain understructure) it is often difficult to restrict
the num ber of risers to 16. W here this occurs, the relevant
local licensing authority should be approached for a
dispensation. W here poor light conditions exist in an
indoor arena, emergency lighting and clear signs should
be fitted to all stairways and ramps.

4.9 Voids and additional structures
By nature of their construction, dem ountable grandstands
have large voids underneath the main seated areas. These
voids become the resting place for paper, cartons and
other combustible materials that can be ignited, un-noted,
by a carelessly discarded cigarette end or even by
vandalism. These areas should be cleared of litter as often
as possible but at least after each perform ance. Litter is a
m ajor fire hazard to spectators. In addition, it should not
be possible for infants to gain access to them.
   It is now a common feature to use the voids under very
large grandstands to provide space for purpose-built
hospitality suites or rooms. Each box or room becomes an
integrated part of the grandstand understructure and
usually provides a glass-fronted viewing room just below
the first level of seating. By nature of their use hospitality
boxes present a certain fire hazard, and it is therefore
essential that these additional structures are constructed
from m aterials that have at least Vih fire resistance.

has been excavated locally unless backfilled with suitable
consolidated material.
  Soleplate spreaders are most commonly of tim ber, but
may sometimes be of precast concrete. Care is required
to ensure, by ‘bedding in’, full and even contact of
soleplates with the ground. Cavities should be filled, and
loose m aterials compacted. W here foundations are not
level or are uneven, appropriate packing may be em­
ployed. C are should be taken that this does not prom ote
instability.
   In the case of tim ber soleplates, which should prefer­
ably be not less than 35mm thick and 220mm wide, the
concentrated column loads may be assumed to spread
down at a slope of 2:1 horizontal to vertical along the
grain, and 1:1 across the grain.
  The edges of any excavation should be protected
against erosion by wind or water.
   In certain cases where baseplates are larger and stiffer
than those generally employed, the use of plywood
soleplates at least 19mm thick is permissible.

5.4 A ssessm ent o f ground conditions
If part of a perm anent structure is to be used, either its
strength needs to be confirmed by the designer or
conservative calculations need to be made.
   All other forms of base must be assessed either by a
visual exam ination, which may be augm ented by digging
a small pit, o r by a site survey which could take the form
of soil analysis, o r m ore probably a direct load site test.
W hen m aking an assessment, consideration should be
given to existing and possible future w eather effects, e.g.
frozen or dried out ground may give false inform ation on
bearing strengths of soil in m ore norm al conditions.

  by the contractor. Any deviations should be substantiated
  and supported by additional docum entary evidence. The
  results of the inspection should be recorded in writing and
  action taken to correct any faults. O n completion of a
  satisfactory inspection the client should be informed and

       W hen in use, gangways and walkways should be kept
   clear at all time, by a sufficient num ber of stewards who
   should be thoroughly briefed on safety and fire drills and
   should be present until the stand is cleared.

   adopted to prevent climbing of structures to gain un­

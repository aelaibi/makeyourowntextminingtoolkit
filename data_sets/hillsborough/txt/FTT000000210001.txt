321. MINUTES

     The Minutes of the last meeting held on 27th October, 1982 together with
a report of the meeting held in Liverpool on 11th November, 1982 were taken as
read and signed by the Chairman as a correct record,

322. ARISING OUT OF THE MINUTES - PORT VALE F.C.

     Mr. Taylor reported briefly on this claim and in view of the fact that
Corderoy's were not convinced by the advice that the club had received from its
Architects, he suggested, and it was agreed, that the best way to assess the
claim would be for the club to instruct Structural Engineers to make a survey
of the stand and report. The Trustees would then consider the claim again.

323. RETROSPECTIVE CLAIMS

     After carefully considering all the submissions, correspondence and minutes
appertaining to theseoclaims it was unanimously agreed that although good verbal
submissions had been made on the 11th November the written documentation did not
support them. However, it was agreed that further consideration of these claims
should be deferred until after the Trustees had completed their review of the
overall administration of the Trust funds from 1975 to-1982, and considered
future policy, particularly on the question of priorities.

324. DRAFT ACCOUNTS

     It was agreed to defer consideration of the draft accounts until after
Mr. Barclay had met Mr. Colin Foster on 8th February. It was agreed that the
provision in respect of the retrospective claims should be included as a
liability until the Trustees' final determination had been agreed.

     Mr. Barclay would also discuss the question of a payment to Hampden,
Queens Park, out of Income Account.

     The Secretary was instructed to write to Orient F.C. requesting repayment
of the loan made to then in respect of Income Tax and to Preston North End
regarding the loan of £75,000 made to them.

     It was decided that when the accounts were forwarded to the Football
Trust and the Football League Management Committee, as the Trust Deed demanded,
a very simple report should accompany then. This would then be followed by a
Continued/2



detailed report when the claims for retrospective grants and future policy had
been determined.

325. SCOTLAND

     Mr. Wharton and Mr. Barclay reported on the proposed meeting with Scottish
Clubs on ls^ February at Dunblane, When they would discuss the procedures for
grant claims and the financial position of some of the Scottish clubs. Hampden
Park would also be considered particularly in relation to the possibility of
paying grants out of Income Account.

     Mr. Barclay was to have a meeting with the Scottish Education Department
on 31st January when it was hoped that the Scottish Office policy and priorities
in respect of Scottish Clubs could be clarified.

     The date for a full meeting of Trustees in Scotland was suggested for
Thursday 21st April 1983. Mr. Wharton was asked to look into the programme
for the Trustees which might necessitate their staying overnight.

326. POLICY

     The Trustees unanimously agreed that their future policy should be considered.
It was accepted that this policy could be affected by the Chester Report which
was now being put together and the Secretary was asked to enquire if F.G.I.T.
could obtain a copy of this Report when published. Taking the above points into
consideration it was: decided that proposed meetings with all bodies to whom the
Trustees reported should be deferred until after receipt of the Chester Report
and completion of their own policy review.

     After mgch discussion the following points emerged as priorities to be
discussed more fully at the next meeting

     1. Safety (a) Designated Clubs (b) Non-Designated Clubs; distinction
between maintenance and safety work; extent of safety claims from Non-Designated
Clubs; Designation of 3rd and 4th Divisions and Scottish 1st and 2nd Divisions;
possibility of persuading the Home and Scottish Offices into re-thinking their
regulations; encourge.clubs, to reduce their capacities to less than 10,000
with majority seating thus reducing on-going maintenance, rateable values etc.

     2. Consideration of a test case for appeal which would set a standard for
other clubs; •

     3.   Ensuring:the new procedures are enforced;

     4.   How far along the safety line has the Trust gonef

     5. Improvements - time to invest in success - more money where largest crowds
are, always ensuring that money is available for safety work.

     6.   Dixon Wilson report - compare with experience current estimates.

          Designated Clubs: Safety Certificates

     8.   English, Scottish and Irish views on priorities.


     It was agreed that these points, together with others that would emerge,
would need thorough discussions and that any policy must be a flexible and
continuing process.

     The report might commence with a general review of the administration,
the present financial position and anticipated future cash flow.

327. NORTHERN IRELAND

     The Trustees received a letter from the accountants stating that the tax
position in Ireland was the same as in England. This meant that any grants to
Irish Clubs (Windsor Park in particular) could be paid out of Income Account,
if the club was in a position to benefit. Mr. Barclay was to consider the
subject with Mr. Foster.

     The question of grants to the Irish Clubs, other than Windsor Park, was
deferred to be discussed within the concept of general policy.

328. INVESTMENT POLICY

     Mr. Davidson agreed to look into the possibility of F.G.I.T. using the
same investment policy as the Football Trust as described in their letter
dated 24th November, 1982.

329. ELECTION OF TRUSTEES

     It was reported that Messrs. Davidson, Finney and Wharton had been
re-elected as Trustees.

330. ADMINISTRATION FEE

     It was agreed to increase the administration fee tothe Football League
from £1,750 per annum to £3,500 per annum.

331. PROCEDURES FOB CLAIMS

     Several claims were brought ibo the notice of the Trustees as a result of
clubs not obtaining prior approval of work in accordance with the new procedures.

     Very strong views were expressed on this subject and Messrs. Corderoy & Co.
were instructed to inform clubs that if this procedure was not adhered to in the
future, claims would not be accepted. It was agreed the claims from clubs
ignoring the laid down procedures should be rejected, subject to appeal where
it was requested.

     Consequently, a claim by Wimbledon F.C. in respect of repairs to crush
barriers and pitch perimeter fencing was rejected.

     At the request of the Scottish Trustees it was decided to write to
East Stirlingshire, Celtic and Queens Park to ask for an explanation as to why
this procedure had not been adopted. These claims would then be considered
at the next meeting. .

Dear Sirs,

                                Report on the possible accommodation

                                         for the disabled at Leppinqs Lane

             As requested, we have pleasure in reporting on the possibilities
of accommodating the disabled at the Leppings Lane end of the ground.


             To be consistent with our previous schemes and reports associated
with accommodation for the disabled, we have assumed that not less
than thirty wheelchairs are to be accommodated, each with a helper.
However, we know that as many as 38 have been admitted on occasions,
and we suspect that if better facilities are provided, more disabled
persons will wish to attend.                                                            We have, therefore, been generous
where possible with the sizes of platforms for the wheelchairs.


Requirements

              We see the basic requirements for the location chosen for
siting the disabled to be as follows, though not necessarily in
order of priority.




                                         An Unlimited Company, Registered in England - No. 1833144
                                                                  SHEET   2


EASTWOOD & PARTNERS


a)   An acceptable viewing point which, at the same time does not
     obstruct the view of the other spectators.


b)   Good access to the viewing area by way of ramps with a
     preferred slope of not greater than 1 in   12.


c)   A protective cover over the disabled.


d)   Toilet facilities.


e)   Car parking facilities.


f)   A separate entry door for the wheelchairs, and a turnstile
     if a charge for the helper is considered appropriate.


Possible Locations

     Three possible locations have been selected for consideration.


1)   On the lower area of terrace, at the North-west corner.


2)   On the terrace, in front of the north end of the West
      stand.


3)   On the terrace at the South-west corner.


Space required

     To accommodate say thirty disabled in wheelchairs each with
a helper, sitting side by side, approximately thirty-six metres
of platforms not less than 2.1m wide are required.    This represents
an immediate loss of 408 standing spectator places at the allowed
packing density.     The construction of ramps and possible sterilization
of some of the adjacent terracing will increase that figure depending
upon the location.


Location No. 1 - North-west corner (see Figures 1 and 2)

      Two raised platforms would be required one behind the other,
to accommodate thirty, or possibly a few more, disabled.      The view
from this position is good and other spectators could stand in front
without impairing the view of the disabled.
                                                                    SHEET   3


EASTWOOD & PARTNERS


     If the area occupied by ramps is included, the number of
standing places lost by the facility will be about 586.     There
would be just over 60 people on the platforms.


     Provision of a simple clear plastic sheeted roof would not
create difficulties and it is unlikely to obstruct the view of the
spectators standing in the rear section of the North-west corner,
behind the parapet wall.


     A toilet would be required but this can be situated either
under the West stand, with the entrance door in the gable wall,
or under the suspended terracing of the North-west corner itself.
There is ample room for a toilet in that general area.


     Car parking for the disabled could be provided in the car park,
at the back of the South stand, towards the Leppings Lane end.
However, the obvious disadvantage of that location for car parking
is that the route into the disabled enclosure would by necessity,
be through or at least alongside any visiting spectators.


     Provision of a separate entry door and turnstile gives rise
to difficulties.   Ideally, the door needs to be not less than one
metre wide.   Two alternative arrangements seem possible.    One is
to admit the wheelchairs through gate A with a ramp leading towards
the higher area behind the West stand.   The other is to sacrifice
two existing turnstiles admitting home spectators to the West stand
or North west terrace.


     We have been told that difficulties exist already with admissions
at the Leppings Lane end of the ground for both home and visiting
spectators and the loss of two more turnstiles is probably
unacceptable without building at least two replacements.     The
arrangement of turnstiles at that end of the ground would need
careful consideration and it may result in having to reposition walls,
fences and barriers (some of them built during the summer of 1985)
in addition to constructing more turnstiles.   This would involve
                                                                     SHEET   4


EASTWOOD & PARTNERS


considerable expense.    The cost of providing the ramps and
platforms on the terrace together with a roof is likely to be
 in the order of £14,900.      In addition a further £6,600 would
need to be budgeted for a toilet.      The cost of the work which
may be required to build new turnstiles, alter walls, fences
and barriers cannot be assessed at this stage, without knowing
the exact requirements for the admission of spectators into that
end of the ground.    If the disabled were to be admitted through
 gate A, constructing a ramp and altering the existing fences
would cost about another £3,000.


      A steward would also be needed to operate a gate at the top
 of the ramp to prevent spectators at the back of the West stand
 going into the North stand.


     A possible variation to this scheme would be to provide
 access to the platforms from the pitch.      The advantage would then
 be that, although a long way away, the present toilet facilities
 under the North east corner could be maintained.      Access into
 the ground from Penistone Road with car parking at the back of
 the gymnasium could also be maintained.      This would mean that
 the present arrangements for admission at Leppings Lane end could
 remain without further cost.      One disadvantage is that a further
 328 standing places, making 914 in all, would be lost because of
 the extra length of the ramp and the effective sterilization of
 the terrace in front of the platforms.      Another disadvantage
 for the disabled is that it is extremely difficult to push wheelchairs
 along the fine gravel which was laid on the perimeter track, before
 the start of the present season.


     Although it is a long way for the disabled to travel from
 the back of the   gymnasium     to their viewing position, they
 would not have to mingle with visiting spectators.
                                                                    SHEET    5


EASTWOOD & PARTNERS


Location No. 2 at the back of the terrace, in front of the
west stand (see Figures 3 and 4)

     Unless two raised platforms are constructed, which would
probably occupy an unacceptable area of terracing, one platform will
hold only about twenty six wheelchairs    (52 persons including helpers).


     The slope of the terracing in this area is much shallower
than in Location No. 1 and if the disabled are to be given a view
of the game, then spectators ixr front will have to be excluded from
immediately in front of the platform.     Including the area occupied
by a ramp, the number of standing places lost will be about 980
with about 52 people on the platform.


     A simple canopy could be provided easily, by cantilivering off
the existing concrete parapet wall at the front of the west stand.


    The remarks made about the provision of toilets, car parking
and entrance for Location No. 1 also apply to this location.


     The cost of providing the ramps and platform on the terrace
together with a canopy will probably be about £11,200. As with Location
No. l/£6,600 needs to be added for a toilet.


     Access could again be provided from the pitch but this would
result in the loss of about another 63 standing spaces bringing
the total loss to 1,043 with 52 people on the platform.


     Another variation to this scheme would be to construct the
platform at the front of the terrace with access from the pitch.
The view would not be as good but could be improved significantly
by raising the platform "to just above perimeter track level.       A
roof would be required but this need not be an elaborate construction,
perhaps clear plastic sheeting on a     steel   frame.   We calculate that
a total of about 670 standing spaces would be lost but the platform
can be made slightly longer at the north stand end and perhaps thirty
wheelchairs could be accommodated.    This variation would be more
                                                                    SHEET   6


EASTWOOD & PARTNERS



expensive at say £13,500.     The disabled would have to be wheeled
round from the Penistone Road end of the ground but the existing
toilet facilities would be available for their use.


Location No. 3    -   South-west corner (see Figures 5 and 6)

     Three raised platforms would be required to accommodate thirty
wheelchairs.    The view from this position is also good and a few
spectators could stand in front of the bottom platform without
spoiling the view of the disabled.


     The number of standing places lost by the construction of the
platforms and ramps will be about 550 with say 64 people on the
platforms.


     Because there are three platforms, one in front of the other,
the roof structure over them will heed to be more substantial,
though the design will not present difficulties.     The roof can
be constructed using clear plastic roof sheets on a steel portal
frame.


     A toilet would be required but this can be situated easily
beneath the west stand, with the entrance in the south gable wall.


     As with the other two possible locations, car parking could
be provided at the back of the south stand.     Construction of a
separate entry door and turnstile would not present difficulties.
These could be built into the boundary wall just a few metres away
at the rear of the south-west corner terrace, but substantial fencing
would be required to isolate the disabled from visiting spectators
in that area.


     The cost of providing the ramps and platforms on the terrace
together with a roof will probably be about £13,600.     In addition a
further £6,600 would be needed for a toilet and say     £5,000 for an
entrance, turnstile and fences.
                                                                 SHEET 7

Limitations imposed on the use of the terrace by the introduction
of facilities for the disabled


     In addition to the loss of standing spectator places, there
will be a loss of freedom in the use of the terracing if facilities
for the disabled are provided at the Leppings Lane end.     At present
the use of the various pens is very adaptable.    On most occasions
the visiting supporters are restricted to the two pens to the south
of the centre.   This is quite adequate for most games.    However,
there are exceptions, notably when Manchester United and Liverpool
are the visiting teams, and, if successful at the time, Newcastle
United, Everton and perhaps Chelsea and Arsenal, when the whole
end has to be allocated to the visitors.


     On such occasions as those, the comfort and safety of the
disabled must be carefully considered and it may mean that a
capacity crowd could never be achieved if segregation of the
disabled from the visitors was believed to be necessary.


A possible alternative location, North Stand (see Figures 7 and 8)

     Bearing in mind that a toilet for the disabled has been completed
recently, under the North-west corner terrace, we believe that an
earlier scheme which was proposed, should be re-considered.


     Before a recent match, we spoke to a few of the disabled who
regularly attend both home and away matches.     We told them of the
club's wish to provide improved accommodation.     They told us that
they would not by choice want to sit at the Leppings Lane end of
the ground.


    The earlier scheme involved the removal of three partial rows
of seats along the front of the North stand, and the construction
of a timber deck in the front two rows to give a level platform.
Access to the platform would be by way of a ramp at the Spion Kop end
of the stand.
                                                                     SHEET   8


EASTWOOD &■ PARTNERS



      A canopy would not be required because sufficient protection
is given   by the stand roof.    Car parking would continue to be at
the back   of the gymnasium, and access would be through the new
entrance which is to be built on Penistone Road.      A separate
door and turnstile could be incorporated into the new entrance if
it was considered appropriate.


      The greatest disadvantage to the proposal is that it involves
the loss   of about 180 seats.   However, we have been told that at
the most   there are three occasions during a season when those
seats are taken.     At this season's prices that represents a
loss of revenue of £2,970.       To lose a minimum of 550 standing
places, as at location 3, at Leppings Lane end, represents a
 loss on three games of £5,775.     (The loss figures are gross
 including V.A.T.)


      The construction costs on the North stand would be far less
 than for any of the schemes described at the three locations
 at Leppings Lane end.    The cost of the timber deck, ramp and
ballustrading is likely to be about £8,900.


      We think it highly likely that there would be strong support
 from the Officer Working Party for keeping the disabled facilities
 in the general area of the North stand, and there may be very
 strong opposition to placing them at the Leppings Lane end, where
 there would be difficulty in segregating them from away supporters
 on the big match days.


 Summary

 a)   The construction of facilities for the disabled is possible
      at three locations at the Leppings Lane end.


b)    The views from the South-west and North-west corners are
      better than the view from in front of the West stand.
                                                                      SHEET


EASTWOOD & PARTNERS




c)   The loss of standing spectator capacity is least at the South­
     west corner, being about 550 compared with      586 in the North­
     west corner and     980 in front of theWest stand.


d)   The construction costs for the platforms, including a roof
     or canopy for each, together with access ramps and fences
     at each location are as follows:-


     1)     North-west   corner                  £14,900
     2)     Terrace in   front of West stand     £11,200 or £13,500
     3)     South-west   corner                  £13,600


     To add to each of the above figures is a sum of say £6,600 for
     toilet facilities.     The cost of providing additional turnstiles
     together with alterations to fences, walls and barriers cannot
     be assessed at this stage but we would be pleased to report
     on the possible arrangement of turnstiles at that end of the
     ground incorporating an access and turnstile for the disabled.
     However, we would need to discuss the specific requirements
     with you before making a start because of the many possible
     arrangements.


e)   There are likely to    be difficulties over segregation and
     if   it is decided to proceed with one of the schemes at
     the Leppings Lane end, the comments of the Officer Working
     Party will need to be received at an early stage.


f)   We   believe that the disabled may not feel comfortable
     atthe Leppings Lane end of the ground if surrounded
     by visiting spectators whose behaviour may be unpredictable.
     We therefore recommend that further consideration is given
     to the proposal of siting the disabled facility in the
     front rows of the North stand.      Good toilet facilities and
     car parking already exist at the Spion Kop end and an
     access ramp can be constructed easily alongside the gable wall
     of the North stand.      The cost of the work is also relatively
     low.    We estimate that it would cost perhaps £8,900 for the
     construction work.

     All the cost figures given are exclusive of V.A.T. and
     professional fees.


g)   We look forward to receiving your further instructions
     but will, of course, be pleased to report in more
     detail about one or more of the proposed schemes
     or to report on other possible alternative locations
     for the disabled, if you so wish.

 Dear Sirs,

 Sheffield Wednesday Football Club PLC
 Facilities for the Disabled and the Hillsborough Tavern Entrance Lobby

 I refer to previous correspondence and in^particular to your letters
 of 17th July.

 As far as the facilities for the disabled are concerned the Building
 Surveyor has now made the following comments on the proposal

          "Even with the use of preservatives, the longevity of a
          timber construction is likely to be shorter than for a
          metal frame structure.

          The ramp is proposed to be positioned on one of the main
          emergency routes of egress from the adjacent Kop, and it is
          considered that any addition to the present fire load in
          that area could be dangerous in the case of an accidental
          or malicious fire occurrence.

          Since the structure is stated to be removeable, a metal frame
          should also be of advantage to achieve fixity between sections
          and less susceptible tc damage on'dismantling.

         To avoid the creation of a void under the wheelchair deck,
         the filling of the space is very desirable - a vermiculite or
         pearlite cementicious mix could be used so as to provide minimal
         additional weight.

         The durability of the continuous non-slip deck coverage
         cannot be guaranteed. A repeat of the symptoms of the Bradford
         occurrence should be avoided"


                                                                              Continued

                                                                             73^005

May I suggest that in order to progress the matter further, it might be
appropriate for direct discussions to take place between yourselves and
Mr. Butler on Sheffield 73^162,

As far as the Tavern is concerned I note in your letter of 17th July that
you make no reference to the Club applying for consent under Public Entertainment
Licence Condition 13 in respect of alterations to The Hillsborough Tavern. I
would advise you that such consent is required before any works commence
and I trust that the Club will make the appropriate application.

 I have passed a copy of this letter onto the Club as usual.

    Dear Sirs,

     Sheffield Wednesday Football Club PLC - Facilities for the Disabled

     I refer to previous correspondence and in particular to your letter of 3rd
     June.

     I believe that both the Fire Authority and the Building Surveyor would prefer
     the minimum ramp width to accord with BS5810 1979 but the Bulling Surveyor has
     commented that the single directional flow in this instance may, however, be
     satisfied with the lesser dimension of 1025 mm.

     In addition the Building Surveyor has now let me have the following comments on
     the proposal

               "I am however unhappy that the whole of the construction is proposed to be
               in timber. The longevity of the support legs of the ramp must be
               questioned, and the creation of a void under the timber boarded wheelchair
#              standing area appears to create a future fire hazard.

               Concrete mass filling for the wheelchair standing area would be preferred.

               I note that the ramp is described as being "removable". I would prefer to
               see this constructed of a metal frame so as to achieve non-combustibility,
               longevity and aid fixity between sections*

               I trust that further constructional details will be received from Eastwood
               & Partners before the structuue is fabricated."

     I look forward to receiving your further comments in due course.

     Yours faithfully,

 Further to the above proposal as detailed in the letter dated 2 March 1987 and

 a)   The timber platform that is to be built over the front three rows of the
      North Stand to be so constructed that no debris, cigarette ends etc can fall
      through and accumulate underneath.

 b)   The width of the ramped approach is not in accordance with BS 5810 1979
      Access For The Disabled, which states in Section 2, paragraph 6.2.1
      that the width should not be less than 1200 mm. ?

Dear Graham,

                         Disabled Facilities and
                     Staircase to the "Tavern”

    Keith Addy rang just before lunchtime today to say that he
wishes us to obtain tenders for the enclosure of the staircase
leading to the tavern.     I cannot obtain tenders ready for the
May board meeting but perhaps for the June meeting.
    He also advised me to hold work on the disabled facilities.
He said that the facility is likely to be done some time next
season.
                            Yours sincerely,
                                                   WE/JAS/S LW/ 8 6 5 8

Dear Keith',

                       Facility for the Disabled

       Please find enclosed two copies of an artists impression of the
proposed facility for thd disabled.    We prepared these preliminary
prints on our limited equipment but if you consider the Impression
to be satisfactory for your purpose we can have some printed properly,
without the join line down the centre.    The original is a penaand ink
drawing, 580 x 380, cm stiff white paper.

                              Yours sincerely,

    For the attention of Mr. D. Bownes


    Dear Mr. Bownes,

               Sheffield Wednesday Football Club pic.
                       Facilities for the Disabled

         You will have probably gathered, whilst reading through the
    fil©s, that the Club have been actively considering, for sor?,e
    time now, accommodation fol; the disabled.    Various locations
    throughout the ground have been investigated.     It seems likely
    that the Board of Directors will decide to have constructaa,
    facilities for the disabled at the front of the North stnnd,
    towards the Spion Kop end.
        A proposal has been drawn up to show a possible arrangraent
    of a viewing platform occupying the front three rows over a
    length of approximately 30m.     Six prints of our Drawing Number
    7771/2A are enclosed showing the general arrangements.
        The disabled will be under cover, as are paying spectators,
    at the front of the stand.     The roof projects beyond the front
    wall by approximately 5m and it is only under extreme rain and
    wind conditions that spectators get wet whilst sitting in the
    still very popular first few rows of seats.

    t'                                                                           2




                Access onto the wooden platform will be by way of a ramp
         alongside the gable wall.     This is shown on the side elevation.
         A guard rail will be erected on top of the existing wall and
         a timber partition erected at the back of the area.
                The facility is also within just a few metres of the new
         disabled toilet which was completed toward the end of last
     year.
                In addition, on big match days, there will also be the
         facility to allow more disabled spectators into the ground by
         locating them on the perimeter track, where they now sit to
     watch matches.
                Car parking is also available at the back of the North stand,
     within easy reach of the proposed facility.
                We, therefore, believe that the proposed site for the disabled
         is the moat readily converted and most convenient situation in
         the ground.    It would be much appreciated if the comments of the
     Officer Working Party could be sent to- us, fairly quickly, so
         that' the next stages in the provision of the facilities can
     be started.


                                  Yours sincerely.

Dear Graham,
              Following the last Board meeting I undertook to let
you have a couple more copies of each of the three reports
that were sent to you by hand.
              Unless I hear from you to the contrary, I will assume
that when sending other reports to you in the future,                                         I should
include one for each member of the                                      Board plus say two for yourself.
If you later decide that this is wasteful, I shall, of course,
be very pleased to reduce the number!


                                                      Yours sincerely,

Dear Sirs,

                        Report on the possible accommodation

                              for the disabled at Leppings Lane

             As requested, we have pleasure in reporting on the possibilities
of accommodating the disabled at the Leppings Lane end of the ground.


             To be consistent with our previous schemes and reports associated
with accommodation for the disabled, we have assumed that not less
than thirty wheelchairs are to be accommodated, each with a helper.
However, we know that as many as 38 have been admitted on occasions,
and we suspect that if better facilities are provided, more disabled
persons will wish to attend.                                       We have, therefore, been generous
where possible with the sizes of platforms for the wheelchairs.


Requirements

             We see the basic requirements for the location chosen for
siting the disabled to be as follows, though not necessarily in
order of priority.




                              An Unlimited Company, Registered in England - No. 1833144
                                                                 SHEET   2


EASTWOOD 8- PARTNERS


a)   An acceptable viewing point which, at the same time does not
     obstruct the view of the other spectators.


b)   Good access to the viewing area by way of ramps with a
     preferred slope of not greater than 1 in 12.


c)   A protective cover over the disabled.


d)   Toilet facilities.


e)   Car parking facilities.


f)   A separate entry door for the wheelchairs, and a turnstile
     if a charge for the helper is considered appropriate.


Possible Locations

     Three possible locations have been selected for consideration.


1)   On the lower area of terrace, at the North-west corner.


2)   On the terrace, in front of the north end of the West
     stand.


3)   On the terrace at the South-west corner.


Space required

     To accommodate say thirty disabled in wheelchairs each with
a helper, sitting side by side, approximately thirty-six metres
of platforms not less than 2.1m wide are required.     This represents
an immediate loss of 408 standing spectator places at the allowed
packing density.     The construction of ramps and possible sterilization
of some of the adjacent terracing will increase that figure depending
upon the location.


Location No. 1 - North-west corner (see Figures 1 and 2)

     Two raised platforms would be required one behind the other,
to accommodate thirty, or possibly a few more, disabled.     The view
from this position is good and other spectators could stand in front
without impairing the view of the disabled.
                                                                    SHEET   3



EASTWOOD 8- PARTNERS


     If the area occupied by ramps is included, the number of
standing places lost by the facility will be about 586.     There
would be just over 60 people on the platforms.


     Provision of a simple clear plastic sheeted roof would not
create difficulties and it is unlikely to obstruct the view of the
spectators standing in the rear section of the North-west corner,
behind the parapet wall.


     A toilet would be required but this can be situated either
under the West stand, with the entrance door in the gable wall,
or under the suspended terracing of the North-west corner itself.
There is ample room for a toilet in that general area.


     Car parking for the disabled could be provided in the car park,
at the back of the South stand, towards the Leppings Lane end.
However, the obvious disadvantage of that location for car parking
is that the route into the disabled enclosure would by necessity,
be through or at least alongside any visiting spectators.


     Provision of a separate entry door and turnstile gives rise
to difficulties.   Ideally, the door needs to be not less than one
metre wide.   Two alternative arrangements seem possible.    One is
to admit the wheelchairs through gate A with a ramp leading towards
the higher area behind the West stand.   The other is to sacrifice
two existing turnstiles admitting home spectators to the West stand
or North west terrace.


     We have been told that difficulties exist already with admissions
at the Leppings Lane end of the ground for both home and visiting
spectators and the loss of two more turnstiles is probably
unacceptable without building at least two replacements.     The
arrangement of turnstiles at that end of the ground would need
careful consideration and it may result in having to reposition walls,
fences and barriers (some of them built during the summer of 1985)
in addition to constructing more turnstiles.   This would involve
EASTWOOD St PARTNERS


considerable expense.     The cost of providing the ramps and
platforms on the terrace together with a roof is likely to be
in the order of £14,900.       In addition a further £6,600 would
need to be budgeted for a toilet.      The cost of the work which
may be required to build new turnstiles, alter walls, fences
and barriers cannot be assessed at this stage, without knowing
the exact requirements for the admission of spectators into that
end of the ground.     If the disabled were to be admitted through
gate A, constructing a ramp and altering the existing fences
would cost about another £3,000.


     A steward would also be needed to operate a gate at the top
of the ramp to prevent spectators at the back of the West stand
going into the North stand.


    A possible variation to this scheme      would be to provide
access to the platforms    from the pitch.    The advantage would then
be that, although a long way away, the present toilet facilities
under the North east corner could be maintained.       Access into
 the ground from Penistone Road with car parking at the back of
 the gymnasium could also be maintained.      This would mean that
 the present arrangements for admission at Leppings Lane end could
 remain without further cost.      One disadvantage is that a further
 328 standing places, making 914 in all, would be lost because of
 the extra length of the ramp and the effective sterilization       of
 the terrace in front of the platforms.      Another disadvantage
 for the disabled is that it is extremely difficult to push wheelchairs
 along the fine gravel which was laid on the perimeter track, before
 the start of the present season.


    Although it is a long way for the disabled to travel from
 the back of the   gymnasium     to their viewing position, they
would not have to mingle with visiting spectators.
                                                                    SHEET   5


EASTWOOD St PARTNERS


Location No. 2 at the back of the terrace, in front of the
west stand (see Figures 3 and 4)

     Unless two raised platforms are constructed, which would
probably occupy an unacceptable area of terracing, one platform will
hold only about twenty six wheelchairs    (52 ptersons including helpers).


     The slope of the terracing in this area is much shallower
than in Location No. 1 and if the disabled are to be given a view
of the game, then spectators in front will have to be excluded from
immediately in front of the platform.     Including the area occupied
by a ramp, the number of standing places lost will be about 980
with about 52 people on the platform.


     A simple canopy could be provided easily, by cantilivering off
the existing concrete parapet wall at the front of the west stand.


    The remarks made about the provision of toilets, car parking
and entrance for Location No. 1 also apply to this location.


     The cost of providing the ramps and platform on the terrace
together with a canopy will probably be about £11,200. As with Location
No. l/£6,600 needs to be added for a toilet.


     Access could again be provided from the pitch but this would
result in the loss of about another 63 standing spaces bringing
the total loss to 1,043 with 52 people on the platform.


     Another variation to this scheme would be to construct the
platform at the front of the terrace with access from the pitch.
The view would not be as good but could be improved significantly
by raising the platform to just above perimeter track level.        A
roof would be required but this need not be an elaborate construction,
perhaps clear plastic sheeting on a     steel   frame.   We calculate that
a total of about 670 standing spaces would be lost but the platform
can be made slightly longer at the north stand end and perhaps thirty
wheelchairs could be accommodated.      This variation would be more
                                                                    SHEET   6



EASTWOOD St PARTNERS


expensive at say £13,500.     The disabled would have to be wheeled
round from the Penistone Road end of the ground but the existing
toilet facilities would be available for their use.


Location No. 3    -   South-west corner (see Figures 5 and 6)

     Three raised platforms would be required to accommodate thirty
wheelchairs.    The view from this position is also good and a few
spectators could stand in front of the bottom platform without
spoiling the view of the disabled.


     The number of standing places lost by the construction of the
platforms and ramps will be about 550 with say 64 people on the
platforms.


     Because there are three platforms, one in front of the other,
the roof structure over them will need to be more substantial,
though the design will not present difficulties.     The roof can
be constructed using clear plastic roof sheets on a steel portal
frame.


     A toilet would be required but this can be situated easily
beneath the west stand, with the entrance in the south gable wall.


     As with the other two possible locations, car parking could
be provided at the back of the south stand.     Construction of a
separate entry door and turnstile would not present difficulties.
These could be built into the boundary wall just a few metres away
at the rear of the south-west corner terrace, but substantial fencing
would be required to isolate the disabled from visiting spectators
in that area.


     The cost of providing the ramps and platforms on the terrace
together with a roof will probably be about £13,600.     In addition a
further £6,600 would be needed for a toilet and say    :£5,000 for an
entrance, turnstile and fences.
EASTWOOD St PARTNERS



Limitations imposed on the use of the terrace by the introduction
of facilities for the disabled


     In addition to the loss of standing spectator places, there
will be a loss of freedom in the use of the terracing if facilities
for the disabled are provided at the Leppings Lane end.     At present
the use of the various pens is very adaptable.     On most occasions
the visiting supporters are restricted to the two pens to the south
of the centre.   This is quite adequate for most games.    However,
there are exceptions, notably when Manchester United and Liverpool
are the visiting teams, and, if successful at the time, Newcastle
United, Everton and perhaps Chelsea and Arsenal, when the whole
end has to be allocated to the visitors.


     On such occasions as those, the comfort and safety of the
disabled must be carefully considered and it may mean that a
capacity crowd could never be achieved if segregation of the
disabled from the visitors was believed to be necessary.


A possible alternative location, North Stand (see Figures 7 and 8)

     Bearing in mind that a toilet for the disabled has been completed
recently, under the North-west corner terrace, we believe that an
earlier scheme which was proposed, should be re-considered.


     Before a recent match, we spoke to a few of the disabled who
regularly attend both home and away matches.     We told them of the
club's wish to provide improved accommodation.     They told us that
they would not by choice want to sit at the Leppings Lane end of
the ground.


    The earlier scheme involved the removal of three partial rows
of seats along the front of the North stand, and the construction
of a timber deck in the front two rows to give a level platform.
Access to the platform would be by way of a ramp at the Spion Kop end
of the stand.
EASTWOOD St PARTNERS



      A canopy would not be required because sufficient protection
is given   by the stand roof.   Car parking would continue to be    at
the back   of the gymnasium, and access would be through the new
entrance which is to be built on Penistone Road.     A separate
door and turnstile could be incorporated into the new entrance if
it was considered appropriate.


      The greatest disadvantage to the proposal is that it involves
the loss of about 180 seats.     However, we have been told that    at
the most there are three occasions during a season when those
seats are taken.    At this season's prices that represents a
loss of revenue of £2,970.      To lose a minimum of 550 standing
places, as at location 3, at Leppings Lane end, represents a
 loss on three games of £5,775.     (The loss figures are gross
including V.A.T.)


      The construction costs on the North stand would be far less
 than for any of the schemes described at the three locations
 at Leppings Lane end.    The cost of the timber deck, ramp and
ballustrading is likely to be about £8,900.


      We think it highly likely that there would be strong support
 from the Officer Working Party for keeping the disabled facilities
 in the general area of the North stand, and there may be very
 strong opposition to placing them at the Leppings Lane end, where
 there would be difficulty in segregating them from away supporters
 on the big match days.


 Summary

 a)   The construction of facilities for the disabled is possible
      at three locations at the Leppings Lane end.


b)    The views from the South-west and North-west corners are
      better than the view from in front of the West stand.
EASTWOOD St PARTNERS




c)   The loss of standing spectator capacity is least at the South­
     west corner, being about 550 compared with 586 in the North­
     west corner and 980 in front of the West stand.


d)   The construction costs for the platforms, including a roof
     or canopy for each, together with access ramps and fences
     at each location are as follows:-


     1)     North-west   corner                 £14,900
     2)     Terrace in   front of West stand    £11,200 or £13,500
     3)     South-west   corner                 £13,600


     To add to each of the above figures is a sum of say £6,600 for
     toilet facilities.      The cost of providing additional turnstiles
     together with alterations to fences, walls and barriers cannot
     be assessed at this stage but we would be pleased to report
     on the possible arrangement of turnstiles at that end of the
     ground incorporating an access and turnstile for the disabled.
     However, we would need to discuss the specific requirements
     with you before making a start because of the many possible
     arrangements.


e)   There are likely to     be difficulties over segregation and
     if   it is decided to proceed with one of the schemes at
     the Leppings Lane end, the comments of the Officer Working
     Party will need to be received at an early stage.


f)   We   believe that the disabled may not feel comfortable
     atthe Leppings Lane end of the ground if surrounded
     by visiting spectators whose behaviour may be unpredictable.
     We therefore recommend that further consideration is given
     to the proposal of siting the disabled facility in the
     front rows of the North stand.      Good toilet facilities and
     car parking already exist at the Spion Kop end and an
     access ramp can be constructed easily alongside the gable wall
     of the North stand.      The cost of the work is also relatively
     low.    We estimate that it would cost perhaps £8,900 for the
     construction work.

     All the cost figures given are exclusive of V.A.T. and
     professional fees.


g)   We look forward to receiving your further instructions
     but will, of course, be pleased to report in more
     detail about one or more of the proposed schemes
     or to report on other possible alternative locations
     for the disabled, if you so wish.

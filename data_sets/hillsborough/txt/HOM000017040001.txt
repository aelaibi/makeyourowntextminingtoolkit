             6th June, 1989




             Dear Lord Justice Taylor,

             I enclose another letter that I have received from an old
             friend, whose son was injured in the football tragedy at
             Hillsborough, which Mr.       ^nd his family attended. I have
             no doubt that you will be interested to read such serious and
             considered criticism of police control of the crowd inside and
             outside the ground.

             Yours sincerely,




                                       t-Q i
             Lord Justice Taylor,
             c/o R. Whalley, Esq.,
             Secretary to the Hillsborough Enquiry,
             Home Office,
             Queen Anne's Gate,
             LONDON SW1

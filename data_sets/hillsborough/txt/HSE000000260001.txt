You spoke to me i-v»o     day. I understand C.Nicholson of RLSD is expecting
to be called to         j with the Coroner or his deputy and a police
officer from the wesr Midlands inquiry team.             the AD will also
 attend to ensure there is no misconception bn enforcement or
administration issues.

                        OVERCROWDING:               HILLSBOROUGH INQUEST

       I attach a copy of a letter from Mr Mervyn Jones to Dr
       Nicholson which gives us warning that the Sheffield Coroner
       will re-convene the Inquests on the Hillsborough victims on 19
       November.

       As you will see from the letter, it is more than likely that
       SEL staff will be called to give evidence on matters arising
       from our technical work. You are aware, of course, that our
       evidence has to be limited to the technical work.  If the
       Coroner wishes to explore broader policy matters relating to
       HSE's role in this matter, there would, I think, be obvious
       advantages in having a member of your branch available to give
       evidence.

       As you can also see from the letter, Dr Nicholson will be
       meeting the Coroner shortly to discuss RLSD's evidence.   If it
       transpires at that meeting that input on policy matters is
       required, I have asked Dr Nicholson to contact you directly.

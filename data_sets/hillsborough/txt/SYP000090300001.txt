                   where       to    go.         There       were       plenty          of    stewards          to       direct              me    and    I went

                   upstairs          to     the       seating       area.            This      would       have          been           about       1450       h rs.

                   About       ten    minutes           or    so    later                      joined          me.         The          other       two,

                                                             had    had       tickets          awa,y f r o m            m e.        During          the       ten

                   minutes          I was        waiting       for                             as    looking             around              the    ground.              I

                   noticed          that        the    two    centre               fs to       the    terraces                 were          full       and    that

■£ /               there       appeared           to    be    p l e n U f of         spaces         either          side           of    these          two

                   pens,        The       match        kicked       off       and       I settled          back          to        watch,          after       a

                   few    minutes          my     attention             was       drawn       to    the    terraces,                    there       appeared             to

                   be    some       fans        climbing       out       of       the    pens       and    falling                 on    the       ground          and

                   some    people           were       putting          coats        over      people          lying           on       the       pitch.           My

                   first       reaction           was    that       the       fans       were       fighting,              it       wasn't          until

                   another          fan     ran       passed       me    and       shouted          that       his       brother              had       been       killed

                   and    that       h e 9d      been    crushed.                 I decided          after          watching                 all    of    this          that

                   I would          get     down       onto    the       fti'tch t o          give    them          a    hand           to    carry

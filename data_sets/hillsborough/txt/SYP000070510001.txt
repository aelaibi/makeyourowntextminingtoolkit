      increased steadily up until 3.g6 pm <1500) with the majority of Notts

      Forest fans coming through t/iese particular turnstiles being orderly

    kf*£>t just after 3.00pm           <1500)   I went through the fejtir of the South Stand

      time.      We walked down the players tunnel and turned right along the

      South S t a n d .    At this time I saw the game was in progress and the

      ground appeared to be full to capacity.                    As I looked towards the West

      Stand I saw the people on the terraces below were surging forward

      to the fences    in the middle section *C N ' and ’C S * in particularly -

      over the t o p .    1 could also see supporters climbing f ro,m ythe terraces

      into the     stand a b o v e .     I could see officers trying to contain

      supporters who were on the perimeter j^fack and side lines and more

      officers moving into this area to t/y and contain supporters from

      over-spilling onto the pitch.                 y carried on walking around the

      perimeter track and across t h e A r o n t         of the Spion Hop which appeared

      full to capacity with Notts Rarest supporters.



      Upon arrival at the gymnasium we were immediately directed back to the

      pitch.      As I went back onto the perimeter track I saw that the game

      had been stopped and that Liverpool               supporters had converged around

      the goal mouth at the West Stand side.                  I was directed to form part

      of a cordon in front of the Spion Hop as Notts Forest a'uppo rte rs were

      beginning to get aggravated about the game being suspended and were

      surging towards the fences.                 At this time    I saw w Liver pool supporter

      run from     the Liver poo 1 crowd on the pitch across/the half way line              and

      into the     Notts        Forest end. He was shouting^ayd goading the Notts

Forest fans and ga/sturing two fingered signs/at them.                 I was

instructed by a /enior officer to get him ok f the pitch,                  I

approached him fis Police Constable &Q G o d V py came up behind him and

detained him. / The man was about 30 years of age and wearing a red

and white s hi r t .        He   carried on shouting and swearing and was

pfoviously drank as he           smelied very strongly of dr i n k .   Police

Constable Gt/dley took           him from the pitch and I was joined by Sergeant

Turner.      As I looked across the pitch I saw that more Liverpool

supporters were on the pitch and that a number of them were                    lying on

the ground,       several    of them looked in obvious     pain,   it was only at

this point I realised some of them had been injured and immediately

went to assist.         I went to a young man of about          15 years old,     who was

lying on his back clutching his lower abdomen and complaining of pain.

I loosened his clothes and saw a/young girl              in a St J o h n ’s ambulance

uniform.         I asked her to get/a stretcher to move the boy.               She never

returned but a man also in JBt J o h n ’s uniform approached with a

stretcher.        Sergeant       Tuirner and myself with two other officers who            I

d o n ’t know,    carried thy boy across the pitch to the side of the

gymnasium where othex injured people were being treated by medics.

We went directly back with the stretcher and saw that there were more

injured in the same area.             We found another man who was semi

conscious.        He was     laid on the stretcher and carried by us to the

gymnasium where there were at least twenty people                laid on the

gymnasium floor.            As a medic attended to him we       left the gym with the

stretcher to go back to the pitch.               I overheard conversations at

this time claiming          people had died in the crowd.          It was only at this

time I realised the severity of the incident.                As I returned to the

pitch for a third time,           I saw that it was    covered with supporters and

Police,    hoardings around the pitch were being ripped up by supporters

who were carrying them to stretcher             the injured from the pitch.           I

returned to the same area with the stjp«tcher where                I saw a man on the

floor being given heart massage and/mouth to m o u t h .              He was about 35

years of age wearing a red and wMite shirt and of heavy build.                         His

face was blue and his eyes o

                            He appeared dead and did not respond to

reviving.      We placed him on the stretcher and covered his face,                     /k

we crossed the pitch I saw bodies at the other end and neai                            b

Spion Kop.      Some were    covered,   others were being         resuscit.            t

several   looked dead.       We carried these dead men to the g y m n a s i u m .

There were at least a dozen dead outside the gym and as we entered

with the deceased               tretcher there were at least another dozen

bodies inside.      A          icer called Detective Constable Locking                  (POL

DC LOCKING)    from £          _Rd told one of us to stay with t h e

body.     Thi s was d           n officer who had assisted us, m y s e 1f and

Sergeant Turner then went back to the pitch.              This time at the West

Stand side there were no more injured or dead on the pitch.



I heard a Liverpool      fan shouting    ’You bastards,      you fucking killed

them.’      He was ignored and ran across the          pitch towards the South

Stand.    I saw an officer     I know from West Bar Police Station.               He

stated how he had been pulling supporters             from the terraces.         He said

that one man he had pulled out was dead and that as he tried

to revive him, Liverpool       fans shouted     'Murderer,       you killed h i m . ’

He was extremely upset and I stayed with h                             e until   he was

assisted by members of his serial.



I was directed to form part of a cordon ac
                                                                           V

I did with other officers,        two of whom we?-           „        _ i nal serial ,

and we thought it best to stay together at this time.                    While   in this

cordon and facing the Liverpool         fans,   several   came up to us obviously

in shock and very upset,        looking for family and friends who they had
                                                                         4


lost in the       confusion.     Then there were other fans who seemed

completely unconcerned         for the dead and injured.         Some        asking why the

game   couldn’t continue,      others asking when the         replay would be.

                                                                 f

I was told all the gates had been opened and peop/e asked to leave the

stadium but for about fifteen minutes the crowd/ didn't seem to

di ss i pa te .   After about thirty minutes when /he g round had almost

cleared, myself and two colleagues went to l/eppinqs Ln where we joined

with members of our original          serial.         /     \J       "

On reflection there was a distinct contrast between Liverpool and

Notts Forest supporters.            The Notts Forest fans seemed to be more

orderly and       better behaved,    causing no problems at all.               From the

stand I was       originally in on turnstile duty there were no problems                   at

all and all the fans seemed well          behaved and arrived early.               I did

not have a radio but from what          1 was told by the Sergeants,            a lot of

Liverpool     fans were arriving      late and were not       in the ground for the

start of the game.         As I walked from the players tunnel at the start

of the game,      I saw that the majority of Liverpool           fans on the terraces

had converged on the centre terraces            behind the goal mouth with spaces

apparent on the wings of these terraces.                  This was noticeable as the

rest of the ground was full to           capacity.

            to be the same body to which I have made                  reference    (38).



            In my original           statement    I make    reference to conveying EDWARDS to the

            other bodies        lying near to the Spion Hop.              My statement appears to

            indicate that I assisted to remove these bodies from the pitch into

            the qyrrs.    This       is not the case.        1 did not    remove any-^tfece/        from

             I am a Police Constable in the South Yorkshire Police and I am

             presently station at West Bar Police Statiorn, Sheffield.

            At 0800 on Saturday 15th April 1989 I commenced duty at West Bar

            Police Station.        My duties that day were in connection with the FA Cup

             semi-final being staged at the Sheffield Hillsborough Football ground

             between Liverpool and Nottingham Forest.

            My specific duties that day were the escort of Nottingham Forest fans

             from the Midland Station to the football ground with Serial 7 under

             the supervision of Sgt. 795 BOUGH.          On conclusion of this duty we were

             to remain on standby at the gymnasium of the football ground to be

          ^ d e p l o y e d as necessary.


      4     About 1505 on the same day and date I become aware of what looked like

            an attempted pitch invasion from the Leppings Ln Stand where the
                                                                         PAGE     2


Liverpool fans were kept.       As a result of a message received I made my

way towards that Stand directly across the pitch.

Upon my arrival at the    Leppings Ln end    it became obvious that

overcrowding in the terrace had caused       a serious crush and all     around

me there were supporters lying dead, dying or injured. I assisted in

giving first aid wherever possible and I subsequently gave assistance

in carrying dead bodies to the gymnasium which we carried on

advertising hordings.

I assisted in earring two bodies from the pitch of Leppings Ln end

which we placed outside the gymnasium        where there were already

numerous other bodies laid out.       I am   not able to identify either of

the bodies I carried off the pitch except to say one of them was a

male, white aged approximately 50 years, heavy build, silver white

hair which was slightly balding.

Upon arriving at the gymnasium for the second time.         I saw that

officers were starting to move bodies into the gymnasium where a

mortuary was being set    up.

I assisted a number of    offiers to carry one body inside the gymnasium

who had been brought to the gym by persons unknown.        The body, who was

subsequently identified as Brian MATHEWS, was laid out in the

gymnasium and I was told to remain with him        until he was identified.

The full details of the deceased were        later found to be a Brian

MATTHEWS 38 years,   19.10.50 of                             Liverpool.

At 1555 on the same date I was present when a                   certified

MATTHEWS   dead.   I then remained with the body whilst enquiries were

made to contact relatives of all the deceased.

At 0325 on Sunday 16th April 1989 I accompanied the deceased to a

viewing area in the gymnasium where he was identified to me by his

           I am Mrs Mary Corigan formerly McGrath and I live at the above

           address with my husband,                            and three children,,    I am

           the natural mother of Keith McGrath who was born in Mill Rd

           Hospital Liverpool on 18th September,        1971.      Keith’s father is

                      and we all live at this address.



           Keith went to a normal school and was educated up until the age of

           sixteen years.     Throughout his childhood he only suffered the normal

           coughs and colds.     After leaving school he took up occupation as a

           Trainee painter.



           Kei t h’s General Practioner is Doctor Dover of Edge Hill Health

           Centre, Liverpool.       To my knowledge the only visible scar my son has
                                                                   PAGE       2


is to his index finger on his right hand.



On Saturday, 15th April, 1989 (150589) my son Keith got up just prior

to 8 o ’clock he ate breakfast with his Grandmother who lives in the

adjoining house to us (number        He returned to our house to

prepare himself to go to the football match, he got dressed and was

ready to leave about 9.50 am (0950 hrs) my brother                      was

giving him a lift to the pick up point at Cowdry Rd, and the Coach

company used was Amberline,   I believe he was meeting a group of lads

there about 15 - 20 but I don't know any of thei r names.



As far as I can recal1 on the day in question my son was wearing

denim jeans - baggy style, a white shirt with light brown stripes, a

white T shirt with a bull dog at the front and Liverpool fixtures at

the back, he was wearing brown brogue shoes only one of whi ch I was

given back,   I would describe this as being tan in colour,   leather

upper with pattern in leather, laced and sized international 43.         I

would like the matching shoe returned to me at a later date if it is

found.   My son left his coat on the coach and this has since been

returned to us.   No other property is missing.



My son had a ticket for the Leppings Ln standing in Liverpool Area

valued at Six Pounds one part of this is retained by me whi ch I

declined to give to the Police.

           I have 27 years experience as a police officer*          I have held a

           supervisory position for 21 years.          I have policed football matches

           at Sheffield Wednesday F.C., Sheffield United F,C, and Barnsley F„C»

           for a total of 9 or 10 years on and off.          I policed most major

           marches and demonstrat ions in the City Centre of Sheffield between

           1983 and 1987.      I have policed 4 semi-finals - all at

           Hillsborough.     I have policed all disputes involving the National

           Union of Mineworkers, and sundry other disputes.          I enjoy big

           occasions and believe that firm but fair policing is the key to

           successfully managing big crowds.



           In April 1988 I was a Ground Commander at Hillsborough Football

           Ground, Sheffield, when Nottingham Forest F.C. played Liverpool F.C.
I worked inside the ground and apart from minor problems of

drunkenness,    theft, and the discharge of a pyrotechnic during the

match, the game passed off without serious incident.



The earlier rounds of the 1988-89         Cup competition produced the

identical fixture and it was learned in March 1989 that this would,

once again, be played at Sheffield Wednesday’s football ground at

Hillsborough;    the match to take place on Saturday,   15 April   1989

(150489) KO 3*00pm (ISOOhrs).



As a Deputy Divisional Commander I expected to play a key supervisory

role on the day, and my then Divisional Commander, Chief

Superintendent B L Mole, discussed with me at a fairly early stage

the question of my duties.      I had worked mostly inside the ground in

•1988 and therefore I agreed this year to perform an outside duty,

taking charge of the policing of the Liverpool fans.



In due course meetings were set up which were attended by police

officers from 'F' Division and elsewhere, along with representatives

of the Local Authority, Public Transport, Ambulance, and the like.

Chief Superintendent Duckenfield, who was to take over the Division

on Chief Superintendent Mol e’s transfer, was also present.



A planning/logistic5s team was set up, headed by Chief Inspector Beal

and Inspector Sewells     they commenced to prepare a detailed

Operational Order to cater for the match.



Shortly after 6 April 1989 I received from Inspector Sewell a

detailed Operational Order, setting out the minutiae of detail
•associated with the game.



During the ensuing week I read the order through and noted my own

role and responsibilities.



I noted that I was to be in charge of Sector 2 (Liverpool) and that I

would be assisted by Chief Inspector Roy Waring, Sector 2Aj       and

Chief Inspector Roger Purdy, Sector 2 B «



I have known both officers many years and worked closely during the

late 1970s with Chief Inspector Purdy.        Both officers have police

experience of working in the Hillsborough area and had performed duty

at he ground before.    Both officers had, to my knowledge, good and

valid experience at major public order events.



Both officers had my full confidence.



Sector 2 was split into two other Sectors, 2A and 2B.        Sector 2A was

the area to the South of the Leppings Lane area (for which Chief

Inspector Waring was responsible);      Sector 2B for the North West

area (for which Chief Inspector Purdy was responsible).



The chain of command devolved to Inspectors,      of which there were 3 in

Sector 2A and 4 in Sector 2B .



Additionally,   I was responsible for coach searching in two locations,

i.e. in Oughtibridge Village, about two miles from the ground

(Inspector Wardle)?    and Tankersley, about six miles from the ground

(Inspector Morton).    Also,   6   mobile "Tango" units under the direct

control of Inspector Walker and Inspector Robinson.
                                                                    PAGE   4




I was not actually in charge of the serials of police officers

employed on turnstile duties at Leppings Lane.       These M/ere part of

the Ground Commander’s - Superintendent Greenwood - responsibilities,

but it was always my intention to be in the area of the Leppings Lane

turnstiles as the crowds built up.     I noted that Chief Inspector

Creaser was in charge of this particular area, aided mostly by *F*

Division Inspectors, Sergeants and Constables.       The officers

involved have a wealth of experience in handling football crowds and

most officers were known to me personally.



I had thus no qualms that given a normal situation the number of

officers involved was right and struck the correct balance between the

maintenance of law and order - the necessity to search fans for

offensive weapons and detect crime without an oppressive police

presence - at what should have been a pleasant afternoon of sport.



At 10am ClOOOhrs) Friday 14 April    1989,(140489)   I attended a Senior

Officers’ briefing at the Sheffield Wednesday Football Club.        All

Inspectors and the two Chief Inspectors working with me in Sector 2

were present.   Chief Suprintendent Duckenfield gave a detailed

briefing from a prepared brief., and this was complemented by a briefing

by Superintendent Murray,, who was to be in charge of the police

control post.   Inspector Sewell then gave details of administration/

meals, etc.



When these officers had concluded their address I took my Chief

Inspectors and Inspectors to an area off the North Stand where I

personally briefed them in detail as to what I required from them.

I had earlier prepared notes of what was required of us collectively
                                                                        PAGE      5


and that I required from them personally, and I spoke to these

notes,         I have kept these notes and they are available for inspection.



I provided an opportunity for questions and asked Chief Inspectors

Waring and Purdy if they had anything to add.         Some questions were

asked.



Some of my Inspectors were from 5A 5 Division and 5C 5 Division and

were not totally familiar with the area.         I therefore took them to a

transit van and with PS Fidler took these officers on a guided tour

of the locality and pointed out certain areas of concern,         such as

Leppings Lane roundabout,       coach and minibus parking,   pubs and off

1i censes.



I asked all the officers to ensure that they read the Operational

Order and were familiar with its contents prior to attending at

Hillsborough the next day.



Later that day I received from Inspector Sewell a miniaturised Order,

which I condensed so that I had a pocket sized overview of the duties

involved in my sector of the operation,



I added to this the colour coding of the tickets for the various

sections of the ground.         I have retained this document.



At 8.10am (OSIOhrs) Saturday 15 April 1989 (150489),         I came on duty

at Hammerton Road Police Station.         The day was fine and sunny.       The

M/eat h e r   was warm and ideal for a major sporting event.



At 9.20am (0920hrs)       I left Hammerton Road Police Station with Chief
                                                                    PAGE      &


Superintendent Duckenfield and               a Force Press Officer,

We went to the entrance to the police area at the rear of the North

Stand,   Other officers were congregating there and M/ere,   in due

course, moved into pre-arranged seating in the North Stand.



At lOam (lOOOhrs) Chief Superintendent Duckenfield gave a briefing.

He was followed by Superintendent Murray, DS Charlesworth and

Inspector Sewell*    Each officer spoke about particular aspects of

the policing of the event.



At the conclusion of the general briefing Serial Inspectors were

invited to brief their Serials in accordance with their general and

specific instructions contained in their orders.



I spoke to Chief Inspectors Waring and Purdy and re-affirmed what I

considered to be the salient points of our duty i.e. searching,       coach

reception and general standards of behaviour,      I told the officers

that I would patrol on foot throughout the Sector and they could

expect to see me out and about right up to kick-off*      I distributed a

one-sheet overview of Serial deployment, along with a list of pubs in

the locality M/here the landlord had been seen and asked his

intentions,   i.e. either to close or operate a selective door.



About 10.15am <1015hrs> I went into the gym where I consumed a snack

meal and took the opportunity of speaking to most of my Sector

Inspectors individually„     I distributed copies of the document

mentioned above.    Manpower at my command was 2 Chief Inspectors,      11

Inspectors, 30 Sergeants and 227 Constables.     This did not include

the Mounted Officers, Dog Handlers? or the Chief Inspector, 2

Inspectors, 4 Sergeants and 40 Constables M/ho u/ould be working
                                                                     PAGE         7


outside the Leppings Lane turnstiles prior to kick-off.



About 10*45am (1045hrs) I commenced foot patrol in the Leppings Lane

area, checking that barriers had been placed at the ends of streets

opening on to Leppings Lane*      The purpose of the barriers is to

prevent access by fans and minimise the nuisance to local residents

caused by fans (a) using the back gardens and gennels as toilets?           and

<b> trying to climb over walls and      fences to gain free access into the

ground *   Most of   the barriers were in place and each set was    manned

by 2 Constables,      I met and spoke to all these officers and asked

them if they knew what their duties were.       All appeared to know what

was expected of them.



Inspector Selwood    was in charge of this area and we met briefly and

discussed what to    do about an Audi   car which was causing an

obstruction in the mouth of Vere Road*



I then continued to Leppings Lane roundabout and on into Penistone

Road North and Claywheels Lanes      all the time meeting and speaking to

policemen and women but checking that they had been briefed as to

thei r duties *    I paid part i cular attent ion to the Claywheels Lane

coach reception Serials (Seri-als 34 and 35 - PS Sherratt and PS

Lindop respectively) as a key role was required in respect of them so

far as ticket checking and standards of behaviour were concerned.



Some fans were already moving about at this time and going from

public house to public house looking for those which were open.



I remember sharing a joke with the manager of the newly refurbished

Travellers Inn in Penistone Road North.       The pub was closed and the
                                                                         PAGE


car park was thus available for use.         Our joke concerned how much he

could charge to allow fans to park on it.         All this area was well

policed and I was happy that everyone seemed to know what they were

doing.



I then patrolled back towards the ground and into the liiddlewood Road

area,         I continued as far as the main shopping area, all the time

meetin and speaking to police officers about their duties.          In the

shopping arcade I met and spoke to two officers and the security

manager of the precinct.         We discussed possible problems involving

stealing from shops, as had occurred in -
                                        1988»         I then popped my head

round the door of Thresher's Off Licence in Middlewood Road.         Two

female staff were working.         Thefts had occurred there in 1988 and        I

therefore assured them that the police were not far away if there was

trouble.



There were already substantial numbers of fans wandering about the

streets and I M/as saddened to see that most      were openly drinking

alcohol from cans and litre bottles.         Many were carrying four packs

and I u,'as asked by a group of fans where they could find pubs that

were open.         All the fans I encountered were Liverpool supporters.

I spoke to one man M/ho was drinking from a can of strong lager and

had another 3 cans in his possession.         I expressed the view that

mf e r e   he to drink all the lager he had in his possession he might

later have difficulty getting into the match.



I patrolled back towards Wadsley Lane, arriving there about 12 noon

(1200hrs).         Crowds were now starting to build up.   Many Liverpool

fans were wandering about and I was being asked M/here open pubs could

be found.         Again, many fans were openly drinking cans of beer and
                                                                       PAGE


lags r .     Fast food out lets were very busy indeed*



About this time I heard some radio traffic concerning two public

houses.       The first was the Fox Inn in Foxhill which was said to be

very busy indeed.         This was not surprising as the landlord had

publicly expressed his intention in the Sheffield Star that he had

obtained an extra 10 barrels of beer for consumption by Liverpool

fans.       The pub had apparently been drunk dry in 1988*      I radioed

control and asked that officers visit and see the landlord and warn

him about serving drunks.



The second pub was the Horse and Jockey in Dykes Hall Road, where 100

200 persons were said to be drinking outside*          Again this concerned

me.        I contacted a Dog Van at the junction of Middlewood Road and

Wads ley Lane ,     PC Roger Pearce M/as a passenger in this van, which

was being driven by a Dog Handler from Nottinghamshire Constabulary.

I spoke to PC Pearce and directed them to go to the Horse and Jockey

and monitor developments.



I then continued patrol along Middlewood Road out of city as far as

Barnett's Off Licence,          This was closed and was being guarded by a

male constable and a female constable.          I spoke to both officers.

I then crossed the road where I saw the manager of Willis'

Supermarket.       These premises also have an off licence facility.          I

spoke to the manager     M/ho   gave me the erroneous impression that drink

was not being sold.



I continued my patrolr walking down Leppings La n e r past the

turnstiles and into Penistone Road North*          The time M/as now about

1 pm (1300hrs>.      A lot more fans were wandering about.       I adjusted
                                                                        PAGE   10


the points of two groups of officers,    firstly to prevent coaches

entering Leppings Lane for unloading purposes?      and secondly to

prevent obstruction outside a fast food outlet near Leppings Lane

roundabout *



I met Inspector Mi 1lett at the end of Claywheels     Lane and we

arranged for a policewoman, who was directing coaches into that road,

to be given a fluorescent waistcoat to increase her visibility and

personal safety*



I continued towards the Wadsley Bridge railway station and en route I

met Chief Inspector Purdy*    There was some radio traffic that

Mounted officers had stopped a transit van full of fans and this was

parked on the Comet car park of Kilner Way*       The Mounted officers

suspected drink was on board and required assistance«       There were a

lot of police officers about but as we were not far away ourselves I

decided to go to the scene.    On arrival at the car park I saw a non­

descript minibus which M/as filled to capacity with mostly male

fans.   They were truculent and all appeared to have been drinking.

They M/ere not drunk*   I took charge    of this situation and with other

officers invited each of the passengers     out of the van one by one.

With the exception of the female all     were searched,   as was the van.

I remember one of the males claiming     tobe an e;<-policeman   from

Cheshire and he provided his service number.       The search was

negative and I gave the people some advice about their behaviour and

directed them towards the ground.       I permitted them to leave their

van in Kilner Way rather than remove it to Wardsend Road*



With Chief Inspector Purdy we returned back along Kilner Way.            The

Gateway Supermarket was doing a roaring trade as its 'off licence'
                                                                     PAGE    11


section with a queue of fans buying drink through a door,        There is

a large grass verge outside Halfords at the junction of Kilner Way

and Halifax Road and I estimated that 100-150 persons, mostly male,

were lying or sitting on the grass drinking from cans and bottles in

the bright sunshine*      At this time there was no trouble, and despite

what seemed to me to be far too much drinking going on fans were well

behaved*



I continued back down Halifax Road towards Claywheels Lane.        I

remember seeing a coach stopping in Halifax      Road and fans

disembarking.      I went across to this coach   with Chief Inspector

Purdy and spoke to the driver*      He assured me that his passengers

knew where they could rejoin the coach after the match as they had all

been before in 1988*      There was not much I could do about this

situation at that stage so I let it go at that*



I returned to the Claywheels Lane area and by radio checked with the

Serial Sergeants that coach parking was going to plan.       There were

no problems and room for another 15-16 coaches at this stage*



I continued into Middlewood Road where I met Inspector Humphries,

We discussed the progress of the operation to date*       There was then

some radio traffic that youths were causing a nuisance in Wadsley

Lane by urinating in gardens*      Again I was   near to Wadsley Lane so I

decided to patrol in that area, and with Inspector Humphries I walked

up the road*



There were now very many Liverpool fans about *      Many were

drinking*      They were mostly male*   Some fans were picnicking in

their cars.      We encountered two youths walking down Wadsley Lane*
                                                                        PAGE


One had a half full pint glass, the other had a half-full half-pint

glass,      I asked them what they thought they were doing.      Both

mumbled a reply to the effect that they had had a drink at the pub,

I suggested they return the glasses to the pub and after a little

hesitation they accepted this advice and turned about, ostensibly to

return to the Horse and Jockey,      We followed them for a short

distance,



On arrival at the end of Mar 1 cl iffe Road I saw the off licence was

very busy indeed,      About 30 males M/ere standing or sitting on the

pavement outside.      All were drinking a variety of intoxicating

liquor,     I saw some drinking wine.   The majority were drinking beer,

lager and cider.      Some of these persons were clearly intoxicated and

I spoke to two or three youths about their behaviour.         At this point

a 'Tango' van drew up, under the command of Police Sergeant Miller,

I told him to keep an eye on these youths and also the crowd drinking

outside the Horse and Jockey,



With Inspector Humphries I returned back down Wadsley Lane towards

Middlewood Road,     As I passed the Park Hotel   (which had closed for

the day)    I saw groups of fans.   They were drinking on the pub

forecourt and were chanting football slogans,      I told them to shut

up and save their shouting for inside the ground.       There were five

constables nearby and I told these officers to keep an eye on them,



I returned once again back along Middlewood Road to the top of

Parkside Road,      It was now busy with fans, and cars very much in

evidence,      I saw a large group of skinheads moving along Middlewood

Road and I followed this group for a time.
                                                                          PAGE


Shortly before Spin (1400hrs)    I heard some radio traffic that the

special train had arrived at Wadsley Bridge Station and that the

passengers and escorting Serials (Serials 36 and 37) plus Chief

Inspector Purdy and Mounted officers were en route to the Peniston

Road turnstiles.



I patrolled towards the turnstiles,     pausing en route to clear youths

from the roadway outside the Four Lanes Cafe.           I instructed two

constables to prevent the overflow of fans into the road.



Leppings Lane was now becoming increasingly congested.              Crowds were

building up.       There was considerable open drinking going on and the

fast food outlets were very busy.       There   were   no problems at this

stage and in my view there were ample police officers in the area to

help and assist fans to find the right entrance and carry out the

preventive role described earlier.



Fans   were   entering the ground.   A lot   were   stood around.      I saw

four or five 'F ’ Division CID officer, all dressed in casual

clothing.       Their brief was to keep an eye open for criminal

activity,     i.e. pick-pocketing, and I was pleased to see them in the

area although I did not acknowledge their presence.



I was now effectively the most senior officer in the vicinity of the

turnstiles,     although Chief Inspector Creaser was in charge up to the

point, assisted by Inspectors Sykes and Purdy.



Serials 16, 17, 18, 19, 4 Sergeants and 40 Constables         were    on duty,

along with Mounted officers from South Yorkshire and Merseyside.
                                                                       PAGE


The area was busy, noisy and colourful.        The crowds were not a lot

different from a normal match day at that stage, although there were

many more people about,.     The majority seemed to be from the

Merseyside area.



It seemed that many fans had come without tickets to get in.           I

heard many passing to and fro asking other fans for 'spares'.           This

toing and froing was constant and there seemed no desire or urgency

on the part of fans to gain entry to the ground.



Foot officers,    in accordance with our usual practice? were stationed

outside each turnstile chatting to and searching fans as they queued

to pass through the stiles.        Other officers   were   actively

encouraging fans to enter the ground.



Mounted officers were actively shepherding people into the turnstiles

area to get them into the ground.        I was not anxious at this stage

and as I surveyed the scene I considered events were proceeding to

plan.   I remember discussing with Inspector Sykes, the most senior

and experienced of the Inspectors, how we would handle the non-ticket

holders post kick off, and    we   agreed that we would try to contain

them in Leppings Lane and, as has happened in the past, they would

probably find someone with a radio on which they could listen to the

game.   I did not wish fans to roam the roads around the perimeter of

the ground at M/ill or unsupervised as this has caused problems in the

past for local residents*



By 2.15pm (14-
             15hrs> Leppings Lane was full of fans moving in both

directions.      I estimate the numbers at about 6-8 thousand.        They

were spilling off footpaths into the roadway and making movements of
                                                                         PAGE     15


vehicles difficult.    Many fans continued to drink from cans           and I

continued to hear people asking others for spares.



My own position M/as in Leppings Lane roadway itself at ground level,

where I continued to monitor events, talking to policemen and fans.



The traffic situation gradually deteriorated and by 2.25pm it became

apparent that we would have to close Leppings Lane to motor

vehicles.    Inspector Sykes and I discussed this and I contacted

match control asking that the road be closed at Leppings Lane

roundabout and at Catch Bar Lane..         My request M/as acknowledged but

for some reason M/as not immediately effective.         Traffic continued to

come along Leppings Lane from the direction of the roundabout and

some service buses came down from Middlewood Road.          I walked up

Leppings Lane to the traffic lights at the junction M/ith Catch Bar

Lane where there was a queue of 3 service buses being held up by a

constable.   The constable asked what he was to do and I told him to

let the buses go through.    I then radioed match control and repeated

my request the Leppings Lane should be closed but added that they

should contact                       of South Yorkshire Transport and

advise him that buses would need to be diverted away from Leppings

Lane.   These measures are not usually necessary on normal match days,



I left a constable on duty at the junction and walked back towards

the turnstiles.   Most officers-   M/ere    now actively suggesting     to fans

to enter the ground.   The time M/as about 2,30pm (1430hrs),



I continued to actively involve myself in crowd control,         especially

in the vicinity of turnstiles A-G,          These consist of 3 double

turnstiles and one single turnstile and feed spectators directly into
                                                                        PAGE   16


a large concourse at the rear of the West Stand and Terrace.            All

the turnstiles were open and were admitting a steady stream of fans

into the ground.      I saw Inspector Purdy to the right of the

turnstiles and he M/as keeping an eye on the queues.         The Stand area

turnstiles 1 to 16 M/ere all working and again a steady stream of

s pe ctato rs we re mov ing through.



The crowd outside the turnstiles at this stage appeared reasonably

good humoured and I was neither frightened nor anxious for anyone's

safety.     I heard nothing from match control other than continuous

radio traffic describing relatively minor problems here and there

inside and outside the ground.         However, as time progressed the

situation at the turnstiles began to deteriorate.



At one stage I remember moving on the outskirts of the crowd outside

turnstiles A to G to the relatively free area beside Gate C.            The

crowd M/ere contained by an open,      chest height, steel barrier and Gate

B.   This is a fairly narrow area.         I saw Inspector Purdy watching

movement and also Detective Superintendent McKay and PC Bocking, who

were observing the crowd for pickpockets.         There was a lot of

pushing and shoving going on which was causing discomfort within the

press, and four or five Mounted officers were within this part of the

crowd, trying to maintain order.         I recollect that I entered the

crowd myself and shouted loudly to people to stop pushing and shoving

as this was hurting people at the front,         I used phrases like,

"Don’t worry, yo u ’ll all get in";      "Don’t push", etc. et c .   Sadly this

had very little effect and I pushed my way back out through the press

to the rear of the crowd.       I believe that my actions were filmed by

a BBC TV cameraman M/ho had been standing on the parapet of the river

bridge,   for as I forced my way out of the press the camera team
                                                                     PAGE           17


passed me walking down the road towards the rear of the South

Stand,       The taller of the two men, M/ho I do not know but have been

regularly at incidents in Sheffield previously,       said words to the

effect that I M/ould have a better view if I went to the position he

had occupied on the parapet of the bridge.



I took his ad vice and M.»ent to the bridge and d i m bed onto the

parapet.       From this position I could see over the heads of the crowd

and the only area which was obscured in part was the aperture of Gate

B.       The time was about 2.40pm <1440hrs>.



A vast and progressively more unruly crowd M/as now assembling *          It

M/as   a volatile and seething mass of people.     They M/ere pushing and

shoving as more and more people continued to arrive in the area.               At

one point I saw a youth of perhaps 11 or 12 years start to scale the

facade above the West Stand turnstiles.         He reached the top and a

great cheer went up but he clearly did not enjoy M/hat he saM/ on the

other side and returned back to the crowd.



My attention returned to the area in front of turnstiles A-G.         I saw

Inspector Purdy standing on top of the steel barrier between the

queuing area and the road to the South Stand.        He M/as balanced like a

tight rope walker and was shouting and clearly doing his level best

to maintain a semblance of order.       The Mounted officers were in the

thick of this press and M/ ere clearly having the most difficult

time,.      Their horses m/ere struggling and I saw anxiety written on the

face of more than one officer.



The crowd build up continued to increase and it seemed to me that

tempers were becoming frayed.
                                                                   PAGE     18




I tried to radio control that I needed assistance quickly and a

tannoyed announcement over the turnstiles loudspeakers to urge people

to queue in orderly fashion and also that PC Buxton, who normally

drives a Landrover equipped u/ith a public address facility,    to come

directly to Leppings Lane to assist me.      I did not get an

acknowledgement from control, although I heard PC Buxton come over

loudly and clearly saying,    "I'm on my way",    I cannot now say with

certainty how long it took for PC Buxton to arrive but I recollect

looking over my shoulder at some stage and seeing PC Buxton speaking

into the microphone in the Landrover which was in the road in

Leppings Lanes   I could not hear what he was saying due to the noise

of the crowd.



Having no acknowldegement of my request for a tannoy I guessed that

some technical fault had affected the radio system.       I therefore

changed my multi channel set from Channel 25 (the match channel) to

Channel 35, which is Hammerton Road Channel, and asked the controller

to pass on my request for a tannoyed announcement on ground control

by telephone.    I subsequently learned that this was passed at

2.44pm (1444hrs) and actioned, but I cannot remember ever hearing what

was broadcast.



Over the next few minutes the scenes outside the turnstiles

deteriorated very rapidly indeed.      An enormous crowd continued to

converge on the turnstiles.     There was total confusion as many did

not know M,'hich area they had to queue in to gain entrance, and the

signs above the turnstiles are rather poorly marked.       Very many

seemed to be under the influence of drink.       Fans at the rear pressed

forward with total irresponsibility and disregard for the safety of
others.     The best efforts of Foot and Mounted officers failed to

deter them.      There did not seem to be much movement through the

turnstiles and it seemed that people were fighting each other to go

through.      Some started to climb over turnstiles.     I saw one fan

actually travers a ledge over the river on the outside of the bridge

to bring him nearer to the turnstiles.      Some scrambled on the river

bank itself.



As I watched I felt someone pushing at my ankles and I interpreted

this as an attempt to push me off the bridge into the river.          I

jumped down and remonstrated with a man.      He appeared drunk.          I

remember he was M/earing sunglasses and these fell off his face, only

to be crushed underfoot by others in the crowd.        I could only

remonstrate with this man and he was soon swallowed up in the crush.



By about 2«45pm (1445hrs) the crowd was jammed against the turnstiles

in all areas but the press was worst against turnstiles A-G.          Fans

were swarming over the gates,    parapets and facade of the

turnstiles.      I recollect seeing Inspector Bennett on the roof above

turnstiles 1-16.      He did not send the fans back down into the

crowd.     The turnstiles and gates were effectively under seige.

There M/as absolute bedlam.     People were kicking and fighting each

other and clearly many were absolutely terrified.       The Mounted

officers were absolutely valiant but their work was of little avail.



Inspector Purdy gesticulated to me and I climbed from the parapet of

the bridge and forced my M/ay to the right hand of the blue heavy

steel perimeter gates.      He joined me and we spoke to each other

through the gates.
                                                                    PAGE


Inspector Purdy told me that people at the front of the crowd by

turnstiles A-G were being crushed and asked me to open gates.        He

was not specific as to which gates he thought should be opened but

his anxiety was apparent.     It confirmed my perception? unprecedented

in my experience, that this was no ordinary crowd of fans but an

enormous press of people determined to enter the stadium come what

may,   I was, nevertheless,   unhappy to agree to the requests to

implement it would lead to uncontrolled access to the stadium and

negate all our efforts to prevent hooliganism inside,     I told him

that we would have to hang on.    He responded by saying that unless

gates were opened people would be crushed,     The look of extreme

anxiety remained on his face,     I took account of the fact that this

was an Inspector speaking to me and I made my mind up immediately

that the only practical way to prevent deaths outside would be to

open the gates.    I nodded to Mr Purdy and told him I would contact

ground control.   He returned to his position by the steel barrier and

I pushed my way back to my vantage point on the bridge parapet.



The situation was unchanged and was worsening by the minute.        It had

outgrown our capacity to manage it effectively.     The situation was

unprecedented in my experience.



I saw a beer can thrown from within the crowd jammed in front of

turnstiles A-G,    It hit a Mounted officer and the contents ran down

his coat.



I radioed ground control and asked for the gates at the Leppings Lane

end of the ground to be opened.    There M/as no acknowledgement.



Initially I thought my own radio was defective so I jumped down from
the bridge and pushed my way across to Inspector Ellis.      I asked him

for his radio, which I remember was an old Burndept type,      I called

ground control in Inspector Ellis5 presence and repeated my request

for gates to be opened at the Leppings Lane end.      There was no

acknowledgement.



I again returned to my vantage point and scrambled onto the bridge

parapet.      Once again I believe I changed channels to 35 and asked

the staff at Hammerton Road Control Room to pass on my request to

open gates,      I believe my message was acknowledged but as I changed

back to the match controlr radio cover had clearly resumed,         I

repeated my request that the gates at Leppings Lane should be opened

and said that unless it was done quickly someone would be killed.



It is difficult to put into words now the scene of which I and other

police officers were a part.      Radio messages were almost inaudible

due to the noise*      The situation at the turnstiles was obviously

frightening as more and more fans pushed to gain entrance.         There

M/as no semblance of queues,   neither was there any self-discipline or

o rde r .



About 2,48pm (1448hrs) I saw C Gate opened slightly from within the

ground,     This was not immediately apparent to the crowd in the

turnstiles area A-G as the gate was invisible to them from where they

were standing.      A trickle of people passed through the gate,        I saw

Insector Purdy physically pulling people from the press under the

barrier and thrusting them bodily through the gate.



A Mounted officer was by the gate, as were numerous foot officers,

and it seemed to me that the action of opening C Gate brought a
                                                                      PAGE   22


little respite to the area in front of the turnstiles, but this

lasted only seconds as the crowd was topped up by others still

pushing in Leppings Lane.



After a short period C Gate was closed.       Large numbers of persons

were still flooding into the area.       The crowd now spilled out over

the road to the South Stand.



Mounted officers then, of their own volition, succeeded in closing

the heavy blue steel perimeter gates,     clearly with the plan in mind

of relieving the crush on the turnstiles.       These officers stationed

themslves behind the gate.      Fans continued to climb over the walls

and parapets of the turnstiles in large numbers,     but whether this was

to prevent their being crushed or to gain free entrance to the

ground,   I cannot say.



The heavy steel perimeter gate was being shaken and was clearly

coming under enormous pressure.       I believed that it would only be a

matter of time before it was knocked down completely and the thought

crossed my mind that our horses would be impaled on the points of the

metal   rails of which the gate was constructed.



About 2.52pm <1452hrs> the gate burst open and the Mounted officers

were brushed aside.       A crowd of people surged through into the

turnstile area and service road.



I remember looking across at Gate A which provides access to the

North Stand.     I had not earlier seen this gate opened.     It was under

pressure and was being shaken by a large press of people.       I radioed

ground control and asked for the North Stand gate to be opened, and
                                                                     PAGE   23


after a short time this was done*       Fans entered but I cannot say now

in what numbers.       I noted there were police officers on both sides of

the gate and they seemed to be quickly in control of the situation*



The desperate push to enter the ground continued in the front of

turnstiles A-G *     The Mounted officers were still trying to control

the situation-      About the same time Gate C opened again and

simultaneously there was a roar from inside the ground*       This

excited the atmosphere even more-       A large number of fans - I cannot

say how many - entered through the gate*       I cannot say to what area

of the ground they went.



Some still went in through the turnstiles but the crush visibly

dimi nshed *



I did not see Gate B opened at any stage-



Shortly after 3pm M500hrs>      there was a radio message passed that

there was trouble inside the ground and a general     request was made

for every available officer to assist*



There   were   still large numbers of people in Leppings Lane so I sent

about 30 men insides      the remainder stayed in the vicinity of the

turnstiles.



There M/as further radio traffic that there were injured people inside

the ground*



It quickly became apparent that there had been a serious incident on

the Leppings Lane Terrace and soon the concourse at the rear of the
                                                                       PAGE


West Stand was thronged with fans coming from the tunnel.           Some were

carrying injured comrades-       These persons had the appearance of

having been crushed*



Some casualties appeared dead, although I could not say how many or

from M/hat area they had come*



All police officer present responded immediately and we tried to

bring order to a scene of pandemonium and chaos*          Many officers

were trying to resuscitate   people, using mouth to mouth

resuscitation and cardiac massage.



Whilst officers were trying to save lives of fans the conduct of

other fans was deplorable*       A drunken man   swore   obscenely at me and

I was spat upon-



We were joined at the back of the West Stand by many other police

officers, then, by first one, then a growing fleet of ambulances*

Ambulances could not enter through Gate C so as best we could we

tried to get casualites down through the concourse to the roadway by

the gate-   They were there separated into three groups - those

apparently dead, those seriously injured, and those less seriously

hurt-   At some stage I spoke to a senior fireman and asked him for

some sheets to screen bodies which were being placed in the road*              I

recollect asking for the major incident boxes to be brought from

Hammerton Road Police Station to the ground*



All officers present were employed attempting to bring some order to

the very difficult situation*

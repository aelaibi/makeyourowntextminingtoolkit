                        LORD JUSTICE TAYLOR INQUIRY

                           ORAL EVIDENCE - DRAFT



     I AM CHIEF SUPERINTENDENT TREVOR DAVEY OF THE WEST YORKSHIRE POLICE AND

I AM CURRENTLY THE PRESIDENT OF THE POLICE SUPERINTENDENTS' ASSOCIATION OF

ENGLAND AND WALES - WHICH IS AN ANNUAL APPOINTMENT.     ACCOMPANYING ME TODAY

ARE CHIEF SUPERINTENDENT PETER WALL OF THE HAMPSHIRE CONSTABULARY, THE FULL

TIME ASSISTANT SECRETARY OF THE ASSOCIATION,       CHIEF SUPERINTENDENT DAVID

CLARKSON OF THE WEST YORKSHIRE POLICE WHO HAS BEEN RESPONSIBLE FOR ELLAND

ROAD, THE HOME GROUND OF LEEDS UNITED FOOTBALL CLUB, FOR THE PAST 2 YEARS,

CHIEF SUPERINTENDENT ROY MELLER OF THE WEST MIDLANDS POLICE WHO, UNTIL

QUITE RECENTLY, WAS THE DIVISIONAL OFFICER WITH RESPONSIBILITY FOR VILLA

PARK FOR 3 YEARS AND CHIEF SUPERINTENDENT          BERNARD   LUCKHURST OF THE

METROPOLITAN   POLICE WHO HAS BEEN CLOSELY INVOLVED WITH ARRANGEMENTS AT

WEMBLEY STADIUM.



     BETWEEN US WE HAVE 150 YEARS POLICE SERVICE, 45 IN THE SUPERINTENDING

RANKS.



     FIRST OF ALL,   I WOULD LIKE TO THANK YOU SIR FOR GIVING US THE

OPPORTUNITY TO ADDRESS YOU BEFORE YOU FINALISE YOUR REPORT INTO THE

HILLSBOROUGH STADIUM DISASTER.



     FOR YOUR INFORMATION, OUR ASSOCIATION HAS A MEMBERSHIP OF APPROXIMATELY

2,100 SUPERINTENDENTS AND CHIEF SUPERINTENDENTS THROUGHOUT ENGLAND AND

WALES.   ITS OBJECTIVES INCLUDE AMONGST OTHER THINGS - TO MAINTAIN AND

IMPROVE THE PROFESSIONAL STATUS OF THE RANK AND TO CONSTITUTIONALLY ENJOY

THE RIGHTS OF CONSULTATION ON ALL MATTERS RELATING TO OUR DUTIES AND

RESPONSIBILITIES.   IT WAS WITH THESE OBJECTIVES IN MIND AND IN RESPONSE TO


                                     1
PARAGRAPH    19 OF YOUR INTERIM REPORT THAT WE WROTE TO MR WHALLEY, YOUR

SECRETARY, SEEKING THE OPPORTUNITY TO GIVE ORAL EVIDENCE AT THIS INQUIRY.



     AS OUR MEMBERS FILL THE ROLE OF OPERATIONAL COMMANDERS AT FOOTBALL

GROUNDS THROUGHOUT ENGLAND AND WALES AND HAVE BEEN RESPONSIBLE OVER THE

YEARS    FOR DEALING SUCCESSFULLY WITH ESCALATING VIOLENCE AND DISORDERLY

BEHAVIOUR ASSOCIATED WITH FOOTBALL FANS, WE HAVE A GREAT DEAL OF EXPERIENCE

IN CROWD CONTROL AND WE URGE YOU, SIR, TO CONSIDER OUR OPINIONS WHEN MAKING

YOUR FINAL AND LONG TERM RECOMMENDATIONS.



     SINCE THE PUBLICATION OF YOUR INTERIM REPORT IT HAS BEEN THOROUGHLY

DEBATED IN THE 43 BRANCHES OF OUR ASSOCIATION.      IN ADDITION, AT OUR ANNUAL

CONFERENCE THIS    YEAR,   THE EVENTS AT HILLSBOROUGH, THE REPORT AND YOUR

RECOMMENDATIONS FEATURED HIGHLY ON THE AGENDA.



     AS YOU WILL BE AWARE, WE HAVE WRITTEN TWO LETTERS TO THE INQUIRY AND

OUR PURPOSE HERE TODAY IS TO ENLARGE UPON THE COMMENTS WE MADE.



     WE HOPE YOUR FINAL REPORT WILL SET A BLUEPRINT FOR FOOTBALL COMMAND

AND CONTROL FOR THE FORESEEABLE FUTURE.     THE SERVICE AS A WHOLE HAS TAKEN TO

HEART,   AND ADOPTED THE RECOMMENDATIONS IN YOUR INTERIM REPORT AND THE

SUPERINTENDENTS' ASSOCIATION IS COMMITTED TO PREVENTING FUTURE TRAGEDIES.



     FOLLOWING MATURE REFLECTION, OUR MEMBERS BELIEVE THAT IMPROVEMENT IN

PUBLIC SAFETY WILL ONLY BE BROUGHT ABOUT IF ALL AGENCIES INVOLVED WITH

FOOTBALL ACCEPT THE NEED FOR CHANGE AND ALSO GIVE THEIR FULL AND WHOLE

HEARTED COMMITMENT TO PREVENTING FUTURE TRAGEDY.




                                     2
     IN OUR OPINION, YOUR INTERIM REPORT HAS DISPROPORTIONATELY ATTRIBUTED

THE BLAME ON THE POLICE SERVICE.     IT IS PLEASING TO SEE THAT YOU QUOTE FROM

DOCTOR JOHN HABGOOD WHO SAID AT THE HILLSBOROUGH MEMORIAL SERVICE THAT

"EVENTS OF THE MAGNITUDE OF HILLSBOROUGH DON'T USUALLY HAPPEN JUST FOR ONE

SINGLE REASON, NOR IS IT USUALLY POSSIBLE TO PIN THE BLAME ON ONE SINGLE

SCAPEGOAT".    WE TRUST YOUR FINAL REPORT WILL REFLECT THAT PHILOSOPHY AND

REDRESS THE IMBALANCE.



     WE ACCEPT OUR ROLE.    WE ACCEPT OUR RESPONSIBILITIES, BUT THE DANGER WE

SEE IS THAT TO PLACE THE MAIN BLAME UPON ONE AGENCY WILL GIVE OPPORTUNITY

FOR OTHERS TO AVOID THEIR RESPONSIBILITIES.    FOR EXAMPLE, THE CAPACITY OF A

GROUND OR OF A PEN OR TERRACE DEPENDS NOT UPON THE NATURE OF THAT AREA, BUT

UPON THE CAPABILITY OF THE TURNSTILES TO ADMIT CUSTOMERS WITHIN A SET

PERIOD.   WHILST THE POLICE OPERATIONAL ORDER DID NOT ADEQUATELY PLAN TO COPE

WITH THE MASS OF LATE COMERS, NEITHER WAS THE GROUND CAPABLE OF DEALING

WITH THEM.    IT WAS THE RESPONSIBILITY OF THE LICENSING AUTHORITY, THE SAFETY

TEAM AND THE CLUB TO ENSURE THAT THIS REQUIREMENT WAS MET.



     THE GREEN GUIDE, AS AMENDED FOLLOWING THE POPPLEWELL INQUIRY,        SAID

TURNSTILES SHOULD BE OF SUCH NUMBERS AS TO ADMIT SPECTATORS AT A RATE

WHEREBY NO UNDULY LARGE CROWDS ARE KEPT WAITING FOR ADMISSION.   HILLSBOROUGH

AND OTHER GROUNDS CANNOT MEET THAT CRITERIA BOTH DUE TO THE NUMBER OF

TURNSTILES AND THEIR OPERATION BY INEPT STAFF.       PERHAPS, THEREFORE, THE

OVERRIDING CONSIDERATION      WHEN DETERMINING CROWD CAPACITIES SHOULD BE

TURNSTILE THROUGHPUT.




                                       3
     WE WERE UNHAPPY TOO ABOUT THE REPORT PLAYING DOWN THE CONTRIBUTORY

FACTOR OF THE DEMEANOUR OF THE FANS, PARTICULARLY IN RELATION TO ALCOHOL.

THE BLOOD ALCOHOL LEVELS FOUND IN THE VICTIMS COULD BE TAKEN TO INDICATE

THAT THE MAJORITY WERE IN DRINK.



MAXIMUM CAPACITIES FOR TERRACES



     WHILST WE AGREE WITH THE PRINCIPLE OF YOUR RECOMMENDATIONS 1 TO 3, THE

REALITY OF THE SITUATION IS THAT ACTION TAKEN IN AN ATTEMPT TO REDUCE

DENSITY IN FACT HAS NOT DONE SO. FANS STILL CONGREGATE IN HIGH DENSITIES IN

CENTRAL AREAS LIKE, FOR EXAMPLE, BEHIND THE GOALS,         LEAVING FRINGE AREAS

UNOCCUPIED,   EVEN THOUGH THE CROWD CAPACITY HAS BEEN REDUCED.           ANOTHER

RESULT OF THIS CHANGE HAS BEEN TO LOCK OUT FANS FROM THE SECTIONS OF THE

GROUND WHICH ARE THEORETICALLY FULL.       MANY DO NOT GAIN ACCESS AT ALL.   MANY

BECOME ENRAGED THAT THEY CANNOT GAIN ACCESS TO THE PART OF THE GROUND THAT

THEY WISH TO,     YET THEY CAN SEE FREE SPACE THERE.         EQUALLY MEMBERS OF

SUPPORTERS CLUBS WHO HAVE GAINED ADMISSION BECOME AGITATED THAT THEIR COÂ­

MEMBERS CANNOT JOIN THEM WHEN THEY CAN SEE WHAT APPEARS TO BE FREE SPACE.



FILLING AND MONITORING TERRACES



     WHILST WE ACCEPT THAT THE WRITTEN AGREEMENT SPECIFIED MAY NOT BE A

CONTRACT,   NEVERTHELESS   IT DOES IDENTIFY AREAS OF RESPONSIBILITY AND

ACCOUNTABILITY WHICH ANY LITIGANT MAY SEIZE UPON.         EXTREME DIFFICULTY IS

BEING EXPERIENCED BY LAWYERS REPRESENTING POLICE AUTHORITIES, FOOTBALL CLUBS

AND LOCAL AUTHORITIES IN ARRIVING AT A MUTUALLY AGREED              DIVISION OF

RESPONSIBILITY.   AS FOOTBALL IS A COMMERCIAL ENTERPRISE, OUR VIEW IS THAT

THE RESPONSIBILITY FOR FILLING AND MONITORING TERRACES MUST LIE WITH THE
        fi&opo-o
CLUB. REASONABLE DISTRIBUTION OF TICKETS BY THE CLUB IS ESSENTIAL. WE HAVE


                                       4
REPORTS OF TICKET SALES RESULTING IN HOME AND AWAY FANS BEING ALLOCATED TO

THE SAME AREA.



FENCES AND GATES



     THE CONFLICT OF INTEREST AND CONFUSION WE HAVE NOTED BETWEEN A POLICE

OFFICER ACTING SOMETIMES AS SUCH AND SOMETIMES AS A STEWARD OF THE CLUB, IS

ILLUSTRATED BY THE REQUIRED ROLES OF THOSE WHO MANAGE CROWD DYNAMICS AND MAN

PERIMETER GATES.       THE CONFUSION, IN THE MINDS OF BOTH POLICE AND FANS, IS

EXACERBATED BY THE LACK OF COMMON STANDARDS IN POLICE AND STEWARDING

PRACTICES THROUGHOUT THE 92 CLUBS IN THE FOOTBALL LEAGUE.



     SHOULD A POLICE OFFICER ALLOCATED THE RESPONSIBILITY ENVISAGED IN

RECOMMENDATION 9 EXERCISE THE POWERS OF A CONSTABLE, FOR EXAMPLE BY MAKING

AN ARREST, HE WOULD NEED TO BE RE-PLACED.      WE ADVOCATE THAT THIS IS AGAIN A

ROLE FOR A STEWARD.



     CONSTANTLY WE ARE TOLD THAT STEWARDS CANNOT MEET THE STANDARDS REQUIRED

TO ENSURE SAFETY.     WE ARE TOLD THEY CANNOT MONITOR OR MANAGE CROWDS, CANNOT

USE CUTTING EQUIPMENT ETC.      IT IS UP TO THE CLUBS TO RECRUIT SUITABLE STAFF

AND PAY PROPER      REMUNERATION    INSTEAD OF RELYING ON ELDERLY OR YOUNG

SUPPORTERS.



     SO FAR AS RECOMMENDATION 10 IS CONCERNED,        POLICE OFFICERS ARE NOT

TRAINED IN THE OPERATION OF CUTTING EQUIPMENT, WHEREAS MEMBERS OF THE FIRE

SERVICE ARE.       HOWEVER,   OUR CENTRAL POINT REMAINS THAT THE PROVISION OF

TRAINED STAFF TO ENABLE THE CLUB TO MEET THEIR OBLIGATIONS FOR THE SAFETY OF

PERSONS ATTENDING MATCHES SHOULD NOT FALL TO THE EMERGENCY SERVICES BY

DEFAULT OF THE CLUB.


                                        5
CRUSH BARRIERS



     WE ENTIRELY AGREE WITH YOUR RECOMMENDATIONS.



SAFETY CERTIFICATES



     WHILST WE ACCEPT THAT DIFFERENT GROUNDS POSE DIFFERENT PROBLEMS AND

SOME LOCAL FLEXIBILITY MUST REMAIN, WE ARE CONCERNED ABOUT COMMON STANDARDS

AND ABOUT THE ROLE OF THE LOCAL AUTHORITY.          IN SOME CASES THE LOCAL

AUTHORITY WILL BE THE OWNER OF THE GROUND.     PRESSURE CAN BE BROUGHT UPON

COUNCIL OFFICERS BY COUNCILLORS WHO MAY ALSO BE DIRECTORS OF THE CLUB.

THERE IS CLEAR NEED FOR SOME MEANS OF INDEPENDENT SCRUTINY AND ENFORCEMENT

OF COMMON STANDARDS TO ENSURE PUBLIC SAFETY.



     WHILST WE SUPPORT THE CONCEPT OF CONSULTATION IN RECOMMENDATION 17, IN

STADIA OWNED, LICENSED AND ADMINISTERED BY LOCAL AUTHORITIES, FOR EXAMPLE,

LEEDS UNITED, THE APPOINTMENT OF AN ADVISORY GROUP UNDER THE CHAIRMANSHIP OF

THAT SAME LOCAL AUTHORITY, MAKES MATTERS EVEN WORSE.



DUTIES OF EACH FOOTBALL CLUB



     WE SUPPORT RECOMMENDATIONS 18 - 25, HOWEVER, THERE ARE INSTANCES OF

DOUBLE BOOKING AND TURNSTILE FRAUD WHICH CREATE OVER CROWDING.   THESE CAN BE

REGULAR FEATURES AT SOME CLUBS AND LEAD TO DISPARITY BETWEEN POLICE

PERCEPTION OF CROWD DENSITY AND COMPUTER FIGURES. SOME INDEPENDENT AUDIT

SYSTEM IS REQUIRED.   SO FAR AS RECOMMENDATION 22 IS CONCERNED, WE WOULD URGE

COMMON STANDARDS OF COLOUR AND DESIGN THROUGHOUT FOOTBALL LEAGUE CLUBS.




                                      6
POLICE PLANNING



     WHILST WE SUPPORT RECOMMENDATIONS 26 - 30 WE ARE CONCERNED THAT BLANKET

DOCTRINE LEADS TO THE WASTAGE OF POLICE RESOURCES, ESPECIALLY AT SMALLER

CLUBS (WHICH ARE THE MAJORITY IN THE FOOTBALL LEAGUE).         THE NEED FOR A

RESERVE IN THOSE CASES IS DOUBTFUL.

     WE FULLY SUPPORT THE NECESSITY FOR AN UNCOMMITTED RESERVE AT THE LARGER

CLUBS.   HOWEVER, THOSE OFFICERS HAVE ONLY BEEN OBTAINED TO THE DETRIMENT OF

POLICING ELSEWHERE AND AT NO EXPENSE TO THE CLUB.



     WE WOULD LIKE TO SEE RECOMMENDATION 29 STRENGTHENED BY REPLACING THE

WORD "SHOULD" IN THE FIRST SENTENCE WITH "SHALL".      FURTHERMORE, WE NEED THE

AUTHORITY IN CERTAIN CIRCUMSTANCES TO BAN A MATCH BECAUSE OF THE RESOURCE

IMPLICATIONS     DUE TO OTHER    PRE PLANNED EVENTS.     THIS IS PARTICULARLY

NECESSARY IN THE EVENT OF RE-PLAYS.



COMMUNICATIONS



     WE WHOLEHEARTEDLY SUPPORT THE RECOMMENDATIONS, HOWEVER THE REALITY IS

FAR FROM THE EXPECTATION.       POLICE CONTROL ROOMS IN MANY CASES ARE TOTALLY

INADEQUATE FOR EXISTING DEMANDS.     THERE IS WIDE VARIANCE IN THE STANDARD OF

EQUIPMENT.



CO-ORDINATION OF EMERGENCY SERVICES



     WE ENDORSE YOUR RECOMMENDATIONS 35 - 38.




                                        7
FIRST AID MEDICAL FACILITIES AND AMBULANCES



    WE SUPPORT RECOMMENDATIONS 3 9 - 4 3 .



PHILOSOPHY OF COMMAND



     ONE SENTENCE IN PARAGRAPH 282 OF YOUR REPORT HAS CAUSED CONSIDERABLE

CONCERN AMONGST OUR MEMBERS.   OUR TRAINING AND EXPERIENCE CLEARLY SHOWS THAT

THE OFFICER IN COMMAND OF AN INCIDENT MUST NOT LEAVE THE CONTROL ROOM.    HIS

ROLE IS CO-ORDINATION AND CONTROL OF THE WHOLE INCIDENT.   HAD MR DUCKENFIELD

LEFT HIS CONTROL ROOM TO "SEE FOR HIMSELF", THE CO-ORDINATION WOULD HAVE

BEEN EVEN MORE DIFFICULT.   HAD MR JACKSON ACCEPTED COMMAND, MR DUCKENFIELD'S

ROLE WOULD HAVE CHANGED.



FOOTBALL SPECTATORS ACT



     WE SUPPORT THE PRINCIPLE SET OUT IN THE ACT, HOWEVER, MANY OF OUR

MEMBERS ARE LESS THAN CONVINCED THAT THIS NEW LAW WILL BE EFFECTIVE.

GREATER PROBLEMS STILL MAY BE CAUSED BY ITS INTRODUCTION.    THE REALITY MAY

BE THAT ADDITIONAL TURNSTILE DIFFICULTIES AND CROWD PROBLEMS OUTSIDE THE

GROUND WILL OCCUR.   TO EFFECTIVELY POLICE THE SCHEME AND DEAL WITH OFFENDERS

MAY NEED MORE NOT LESS POLICEMEN.      IN ADDITION WE ARE CONCERNED THAT ANY

PROPOSED FOOTBALL MEMBERSHIP AUTHORITY SHOULD BE COMPOSED AS AN INDEPENDENT

LICENSING AUTHORITY AND NOT CONSIST WHOLLY OR MAINLY OF THOSE WITH A VESTED

INTEREST IN THE SPORT.



     IN THE LONG TERM SERIOUS ATTENTION MUST BE PAID TO THE REQUIREMENTS OF

INTERNATIONAL OR EUROPEAN BODIES WHICH REGULATE THE SPORT.        WE HAVE NO

FACTUAL INFORMATION ON WHICH TO BASE OUR VIEW, BUT FEEL THAT FUNDAMENTAL
CHANGES MUST BE MADE.      THE NATURE AND STRUCTURE OF THE SPORT IN THIS COUNTRY

AND THE GROUNDS AT WHICH IT IS BASED WILL, WE FEEL, MAKE THEM QUITE

UNSUITABLE AS BASES FOR INTERNATIONAL OR EUROPEAN SPORT.



REPRESENTATIONS MADE BY LETTER



     IN OUR LETTER OF THE 14TH JUNE WE MADE REFERENCE TO THE CLEAR NEED FOR

THE ESTABLISHMENT OF A CENTRALLY FUNDED FOOTBALL INTELLIGENCE UNIT.       WE ARE

PLEASED TO SEE THAT PROGRESS HAS BEEN MADE.      HOWEVER, WE WISH THAT THAT UNIT

SHOULD BECOME NOT JUST A CLEARING HOUSE FOR INFORMATION CONCERNING THE

BEHAVIOUR AND STRATEGY OF FANS, BUT A REPOSITORY OF POLICE GOOD AND BAD

PRACTICE, SUCCESSES AND FAILURES SO THAT FORCES MAY BENEFIT FROM THE TOTAL

EXPERIENCE OF OTHERS.



     WHETHER OR NOT OUR PRECISE SUGGESTIONS ABOUT TICKET TOUTS ARE SEEN AS

ACHIEVABLE, THERE IS A REAL NEED FOR ACTION AND AUTHORITY TO REDUCE THE

NUMBER OF FANS WITHOUT TICKETS WHO ATTEND ALL-TICKET MATCHES IN THE HOPE OF

GAINING ENTRANCE.



     THE ALCOHOL FACTOR IS ALSO OF CONCERN.      THE SPORTING EVENTS (CONTROL OF

ALCOHOL)   ACT,   I9 8 5   HAS REDUCED THE BRINGING OF ALCOHOL TO MATCHES AND

CONTROLLED ITS SALE AT GROUNDS.        THIS HAS HAD THE EFFECT OF ENCOURAGING

GREATER CONSUMPTION OF ALCOHOL BEFORE ARRIVAL.       THE BEHAVIOUR OF CROWDS OF

WHOM A LARGE NUMBER WHILST NOT DRUNK, HAVE TAKEN DRINK, IS VOLATILE AND THEY

ARE LESS PATIENT AND LESS EASILY MANAGED.         PUBLIC NUISANCE AND DISORDERS

HAVE LED TO THE INTRODUCTION OF AREAS IN SOME TOWNS WHERE PUBLIC CONSUMPTION

OF ALCOHOL IN THE STREET IS BANNED.           CONSIDERATION SHOULD BE GIVEN TO

CREATING MORE SUCH AREAS, ESPECIALLY IN THE VICINITY OF SPORTS GROUNDS AND

OF ENCOURAGING THE IMPOSITION OF MEANINGFUL PENALTIES.


                                         9
     WE MAKE A BRIEF REFERENCE TO "GREEN FIELD SITES".       THIS IS A LONGER

TERM ISSUE, BUT IF ENGLISH FOOTBALL IS TO TAKE ITS PLACE UPON THE EUROPEAN

STAGE, THEN LOCAL AUTHORITIES AND THE CLUBS MUST SERIOUSLY ADDRESS IT.   WHEN

OPPORTUNITY OCCURS FOR REDEVELOPMENT, THEN SPORTING FACILITIES WITH PROPER

ACCESS AND PARKING SHOULD BE A PRIORITY.



     IN OUR SECOND LETTER, THAT OF THE 19TH OCTOBER,         I ENDEAVOURED TO

PRESENT A SUMMARY OF THE REPRESENTATIONS MADE TO US.   THE SINGLE OVERRIDING

FACTOR THAT HAS BEEN STRESSED AGAIN AND AGAIN IS THE ENORMOUS COST OF

POLICING If OOTBALL AND THAT OTHER PUBLIC ENTERTAINMENTS ARE NOT REGARDED IN

THIS SPECIAL WAY.    FOOTBALL IS POLICED TO THE DETRIMENT OF SERVICE TO THE

PUBLIC IN GENERAL.   POLICE OFFICERS HAVE BEEN DRAWN IN TO FILL A NEED, HENCE

LEGAL OPINIONS WHICH LEAVE CONSTABLES UNSURE AS TO WHETHER THEY CAN ACT WITH

THE AUTHORITY OF THEIR OFFICE OR WHETHER THEY ARE AGENTS OF THE CLUB.



     AGAIN WE LOOK TO COMMON STANDARDS, FOR EXAMPLE, IF IT IS DECIDED THAT

INSIDE A GROUND IS TO BE POLICE RESPONSIBILITY SOME COMMON FORMULA SHOULD BE

DEVISED FOR RECOMMENDED MANPOWER LEVELS, ACCORDING TO A PREDICTED CROWD-

THERE SHOULD ALSO BE A COMMON CHARGING SCALE, FAR TOO MANY CLUBS RECEIVE

POLICING ON THE CHEAP AND OTHERS EXPECT THE SAME BENEFITS.



     POLICE DIVISIONAL COMMANDERS ARE REQUIRED TO WORK TO FINITE BUDGETS AND

WITH SPECIFIED RESOURCES.   THE ARRANGEMENT OF MATCHES AT PARTICULAR TIMES OR

ON PARTICULAR DAYS, CAN HAVE AN ADVERSE IMPACT ON THOSE BUDGETS.   POLICE CAN

ONLY EXPRESS THEIR CONCERN IN AN INDIRECT WAY.   THE LOCAL AUTHORITY CAN USE

THE SAFETY OF SPORTS GROUNDS ACT, 1975.    THE FIRE BRIGADE CAN USE THE FIRE

SAFETY AND SAFETY OF PLACES OF SPORTS ACT, 1977 TO BAN MATCHES.    BOTH HAVE,

THEREFORE, GREATER AUTHORITY IN SAFETY MATTERS THAN THE POLICE.




                                     10
     THE ROLE OF A POLICE SUPERINTENDENT OR CHIEF SUPERINTENDENT IS

DEMANDING AND RIGHTLY SO, BUT ANOTHER CONCERN OFTEN EXPRESSED IS THE LACK OF

STATUTORY LEGAL COVER.   VERY STRONG COMMERCIAL PRESSURES CAN BE BROUGHT TO

BEAR FOR MATCHES TO BE PLAYED IN ACCORDANCE WITH THE WISHES OF THE CLUB AND

THE MEDIA.   TO DELAY A KICK-OFF, OR TO HOLD A MATCH AT A PARTICULAR TIME ON

A PARTICULAR DAY CAN AFFECT CLUB REVENUE TO A SUBSTANTIAL DEGREE.         AN

OFFICER EXERCISING THE AUTHORITIES AND RESPONSIBILITIES WE BOTH CONSIDER HE

SHOULD, HAS THE RIGHT TO EXPECT THAT IF PROCEEDINGS ARE BROUGHT AGAINST HIM

FOR PERFORMING HIS PUBLIC DUTY, HIS LEGAL REPRESENTATION WILL BE PROVIDED

FROM PUBLIC FUNDS.

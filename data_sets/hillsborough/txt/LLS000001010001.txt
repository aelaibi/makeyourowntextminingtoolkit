  Strain      was    being    laid   on.     We     g ot   to    the    train    station and      found
that   we   had     to pay.    £9.80   for       a train       ti cket.

we did speak to a policeman.           He told us that that incident was caused by Liverpool
fans   fighting.      1 told him that we saw no fans fighting.
            I saw no policemen being attacked at any stage.                    We did seehysterical
people looking for friends and trying to push other people and policemen aside
when   looking for their relatives and friends.
            As a result of being crushed in that crowd, I was bruisedacross                      my back
and chest and neck.          I went to see my GP, Dr                      at

kept off work for two days.          My wages were paid in full during that time.

Assistant..
            I have already given astatement to the Police, who are investigating                        the
incident.
            I would also like thisstatement to be submitted to the Government Public

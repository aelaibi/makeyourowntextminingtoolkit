return         the   fans  to Sheffield  Midland.   The   serials  will
a c c o m pa n y   the same groups as the inward journey.    Once  fans

LIVERPOOL


            All Liverpool coaches should leave the HI Motorway at Exit 36
            (bankers ley) end travel via the A61 to designated parkinc areas.

            Tbe geographical location of Liverpool, coupled with the countrywide
            support enjoyed by the Club, suggests that coaches could veil approach
            tiae ^stadium by other routes, particularly the A616. If th.is is the
            case, then they nust be brought to the designated coach perking area.

            ^be serials engaged on duty at Tankersley and Oughtibridae will
            operate selective stop and search procedures to ensure (a) passengers
            have tickets, (b) they are not in possession of alcohol end (c)
            tbey are not drunk. When this has been done, each coach vill have
            z=. adhesive sticker placed on the nearside of the windscreen and it
            vill be alleged to proceed to the designated parking arei.

                  coaches will be allowed to travel to the ground without specific
            escort, although menbers of the Road Traffic Motor Cycle King will
            be providing overall rrobile supervision. All coaches will be directed
            z z the traffic island at Leppings Lane where in the first instance,
            tbey will park in Claywheels Lane. Once this area is full then
            coaches will be directed to park on the 'out lane’ of the dual
                                                                                I
                rriageway in Halifax Road, parking to ccrrmence at the tap of tbe^
            cr >=i.1 carriageway and then work towards the stadiun.

   5    All coaches will park before being permitted to set down passengers
         t±i=reby ensuring that the occupants know exactly where tc return to
         ac oacrpletion of the football match.

   6    S&ere it is discovered that passengers on a coach are no: in possession
         cf tickets, or are in breach of legislation concerning alcohol at
         Sporting Events, then Ground Control will be informed for consideration
         as to returning such vehicles out of the Fbrce area under escort. V

   7    Inhere individual passengers only are involved wh have ccnsimsd alcohol
         ir. such amounts that they are drunk, or axe in possession of alcohol,
         t±sn they should be arrested and detained pending transDcrt.

             KSSST                                                       V      1 \3

   8    Nottingham Forest supporters vho travel by coach will be encouraged to
         use the Ml ‘motorway leaving at Exit 34 (Tinsley). This aspect of the
         operation will be dealt with by 'D' Division Officers and is the
         szioject of a separate order.

   9        'ZEse coaches will be parked in the South Yorkshire Transport Garage,
            Harries Road South and, if necessary, Rawson Spring Road.

      T R w c n v w e - Li v e r p o o l




Transit vans, etc. carrying Liverpool supporters vill
be encouraged to travel via the M62 and Ml motorways
leaving the latter at Junction 36 (Tankersley).
However, it is envisaged that such vehicles vill also
approach the stadium from the Flouch (A616).


Such vehicles will be stopped and thoroughly
searched to ensure that they are not carrying
alcohol and the passengers have not consumed the
same to an extent where they are drunk.


All passengers will be checked to ensure that they
are in possession of tickets.


The vehicles vill then proceed to the designated
parking area in Wardsend Road North where passengers
will alight and walk to the ground.


It is not feasible to attesTpt to channel such
vehicles through one 'checkpoint' and therefore
it will be the duty of all serials on duties outside
the stadiur, to monitor and check such vehicles and
their occupants.


Should any vehicle arrive, without having been
checked on the outskirts, ■which is found to be
carrying passengers without tickets or in breach of
the legislation relating to the carriage and
consumption of alcohol en route to sporting events,
then Ground Control will be inferred for consideration
as to returning the vehicle to tie motorvay for escort
If necessary, the driver and passengers will be dealt
with for breach of the relevant legislation by way
of surmons or arrest, dependant on their individual
condition.

H7TE:     Iterr. 8 above outlines the contractual agreement between the

Refusal is merely a bar to entering the ground and not a crzLminal offence.
Vfcene a search is conducted with consent, it is a search vithin tije
neaning of the Police and Criminal Evidence Act 19S4. Senion 3 {i ) of the
Ac t requires an officerto make a record of the search in vriting unless
it is not practicable to do so and large scale searches srrt as those at
football matches fall within this section. There is rot therefore a
requirement to corrplete a Form PACE/ 1.

             I refer to the correspondence frooj-Qiief Superintendent (MS) in
             respect of the above,              '~ *

             Enclosed for information is a copy of the Certificate issued by
             the then South Yorkshire County Council in Decamber 1979* Also
             attached is a copy of the first Draft prepared by the City Council
             in August 1987.

              Referring to the latter could I draw your attention to paragraphs
              k , 5 & 6 which have been totally deleted from the new draft.
              Similalrly could I draw your attention to paragraph 10 which outlined the
              duties of stewards. To some degree the first draft Bade the stewards
              answerable to police officers. In the latest draft the reference to
              police has been totally removed.

              Generally speaking the new draft certificate ,apart from matters
              relating to the police, is reasonably consistent with the first
              draft. However you may consider it appropriate at some stage to seek
              the views of Chief Superintendents Broomhead and Duckenfield.

 Th e r e   is one difficulty with the two team*,                   and that is wi t h regard

It   is our     intention today that       this match will          take place wi tho ut any

public disorder and we must ensure the safety of the public,                                both

inside and outside the grounds             and segregate the opposing fans*



This will mean         control   by Police Officers         and     in addition to ensure

things    run smoothly there will          be no obstruc ti on of the h i gh wa y and

we must    be ex tremely vigilant to ensure that there is no darri-age to

property,       either   in the ground or      in the vicinity of the ground.

       To ensure that supporters from Nottingham Forest, do not flow alrr.g

       the back of the South Stand ana towards the Leppincs Lane End                   have

       created a sterile area along the back of th that stand.



       T i ckets are colour-coded and clearly identified fcr the section* of

       and give     information accordingly.    Copiss   if the tickets are cn

       display on the information boards.



       If teams are drawing at full time today there will           beextra tirae,     and

       all our plans need to be adjusted accordingly.



      There is one difficulty with the two teams,          and that is with regard

       to identification of the fans by colours.          Those of you with footiall

      knowledge will appreciate that both Liverpool and Nottingham play in

       red in normal    league matches, and their supporters usually wear red

      and white.

From: Chief Superintendent PEMBERTON                Station:
To:   Mr JONES                                      Date:      17 May 1989


SUBJECT:   COMMUNICATIONS




I refer to your request in which you want a brief report for the attention
of Andrew Collins QC, with regard to "radio logs". There were two methods
of logs used by the South Yorkshire force on Saturday 15 April 1989.
Appendix "A" refers to an extended incident log which was created
throughout the whole force commander control system. This connects any
station with a commander control availability to make an entry on the
extended incident log which related to the semi final policing. The
incident log was created by Superintendent MURRAY under the following
terms of reference.

Semi final - Liverpool versus Notts Forest,

This incident created a recording of all information/incidents relating to
the above fixture. Groups to note its existance and use are required.
There is an entry timed at 0828 from Superintendent MURRAY indicating that
this message is to be left open as instructed and all messages to do with
the semi final to be entered on this message. The document then is a
printout of the computerised entries made on the force commander control.
I draw to your attention to one entry dated 1444. This is an entry
inserted at that time from FI Hamilton Road Police Station by Pc BARNES.
(A statement from this officer is being obtained). The message recorded
states "From Superintendent MARSHALL FI, request contact ground to tanoy a
request for people not to push at Leppings Lane entrance". Passed to
Police Sergeant GODARD, ground control. It is believed that difficulties
in radio communication on the ground control led to Superintendent
MARSHALL changing his radio channel to contact his local police station
for they in turn to contact the ground control by telephone means.

 Appendix "B" refers to a second log. This is a ground control log created
 again by Superintendent MURRAY and referred to in his statement. As the
 ground control commander he identified a weakness through a post match
 briefing through the lack of a log during the 1988 semi final. It was his
 intention for this year to create a log which he did and which starts 0800
 control operative PS 616 and PC 1035. The log then relates to various
 incidents throughout the morning and concludes at 1421 hours. It is
 believed that there is only one tape recording of ariy radio messages and
 that related to the force control room and this is being transcribed at
 this moment but is believed not to possess too much important evidence.
 Neither the local sub divisional radio nor the ground control radio were
 tape recorded and there are no sound recordings of the messages in that
 box.

 Actions are well advanced to obtain statements from the persons involved
 in the ground control and should be on hand by Friday at the latest.

CONCLUSIONS
 This man was involved in a mass movemsnt of the crowd at the semi final football match
 at Hillsborough on Saturday 15th April, 1989.
 This man appeared to be normally developed and healthy and I have found no natural disease
 which could have caused or contributed to his death. In my view he had a normal
 expectation of life for his age. He had clearly, at some tine, been pressed against sane
 solid object, such as a rail, which had marked across the front of the lower pelvis.
^Ultimately he was unable to move his chest in respiration, and thus perished from
 asphyxia. There is new no medical reason why the body may not be disposed of.

CONCLUSIONS

From the history available to me I am informed that. Raymond

CHAPMAN disjd in the ’Hillsborough incident1.

Autopsy revealed evidence of severe asphyxia i<. terms of

cyanosis and petechial haemorrhages within the face and uppec

chest.
                                                                  H*




It is my opinion that death was a result of traumatic asphyx

The appearances are consistent with severe intensive blunt

compression of the chest and possibly abdomen       and are entirely

consistent with the general history of the circumstances
available to me relating to the death.

Hr. CHAPMAN, who was middle'aged, displayed only mild hardening

of his coronary arteries and in my opinion the natural disease

present was totally insufficient to contribute in any way

towards his death.

Autopsy'" revelled 'no"-evidence to' suggest that any second party

was maliciously involved in the death of this individual by

ditect purposeful violence.

Autopsy revealed that Raymond CHAPMAN could have been expected

tu have* had a normal Ii       «xpectanc:y.

A specimen ot’blood for alcohol estimation was handed to D c .

D.M. Gre^m.

-Death in.my opinion was not due to natural causes and there is

no contraindication to cremation.


CAUSE OF DEATH

I   a)   Traumatic asphyxia.

                 *■                   Estimated Terrace Capacity

           I refer to the telephone call between Mr. Bo wnes and my Prin ci pa l                           Di s tr i c t
           Surveyor, Kr. Butler, earlier this afternoon.

           The approximate holdin g capacities pr o du c e d for the s t a n d i n g terrace
           areas do not take account of any turnstile ingress limitations, or
           those of egress or emergency egress l imi ta ti on s since it is my u n d e r s t a n d i n g
           that the Fire Authority will consider all these matte rs b e i n g that they
           have the primary function of estimation of terrace capacity.

           These figures therefore need to be c a re fu ll y c h ec ke d with those p r od uc ed
           by the Fire Authority to ensure that a c co u n t is taken of the need for
           any further limitations for the purposes of the pr o po se d ce rti f i ca te
           amendment.

           My calculations ba sed on the "green g ui de " m o d i f i e d         by the T ay l o r Inquiry
           recommendations give the following:-

           1.   Spion Kop                        t    1 8, 200
           2.   North Vest Terrace (Upper)              2, 30 0
           3.   North Vest Corner (Lower)                   63 0          (Pen 7)

           In accordance with our consultations, figure s               have not      b e e n pr o d u c e d    for
           Pens one to six o f the West Terrace.

           I would appreciate the sight of the Fi re Au t ho r i ty figur es before the
           Certificate is amended.

                  Mr. Broomhead

                SUBJECT:
                                   NORTH WEST TERRACING - HILLSBOROUGH FOOTBALL GROUND
                                   SWFC v SHEFFIELD UNITED - 21 NOVENEER 1989


                  Approximately five minutes before the kick off at 8 pm I went to the rear
                  of the North West Terracing where I saw 200/300 people standing in the
                  gangways and at the bottom of the stairwells being unable to gain access
                  into the terraced area. Having examined the situation I realised that
                  there was no way this number could safely be accommodated within that
                  terraced area and I made immediate plans to have them transferred to
                  available seating within the North Stand.       Whilst carrying out this
                  exercise I was informed by Chief Inspector Beal that a further 100/150
                  spectators w’ere still outside in Leppings Lane waiting to be admitted.

                  On my instructions the turnstiles were closed and were not re-opened
                  until the people who had been unable to gain access to the North West
                  Terracing had been placed in the North Stand.         Having successfully
                  achieved this I then arranged for the spectators who had been waiting
                  outside to be also accommodated within the North Stand.

                  I am concerned that the present Safety Certificate allows 2300 people to
                  be accorrmodated within the North West Terraces as a contingency, and
                  having discussed the matter with Superintendent Sleath and Mr. Mackrell,
                  Secretary of the Sheffield Wednesday Football Club, we are all agreed
                  that this figure should now be revised to 1500 maximum.

            S h e f f i e l d Wednesday F o o t b a ll C lub FLC

            Subsequent to a meeting at Haumerton Read Police Station on 22nd November
            to discuss various natters arising fran the match between Sheffield
            Wednesday and Sheffield United on 21st November, I have had cause to
            revise the recccnrended holding capacity for this area of the ground.
                                                           ,  /   ■
            You will recall that the present capacity figures were produced within
            hours, on list August, 1989/ and therefore only a paper exercise was
            carried out in that restrictive time.                  :.

            A site visit earlier today revealed the extent of the area of terrace
            partially blinded by the screen between the North West Terrace and the
            North Stand.

            A c c o r d in g ly t h a t a rea h a s b een e m itte d from t h e g r o s s a v a il a b le a r e a o f
            terr a ce,                                     ,

            The holding capacity of the remaining areas has been re-calculated and
            modified In accordance with the Taylor reconrnendations,•giving a resultant
            figure of 1,700.

            Eastwood and Partners drawing number 1610/64E has been used for the layout
            of this area. In a telephone conversation between Mr Strange of Eastwood
            and "Partners and rrty Principal Structural Engineer, late this afternoon, it
            was intimated that this drawing nay not be accurate, and that the gross
            available space may be slightly smaller than is shown on the drawing.

            Until the area has been resurveyed and revised drawings received, I would
            recortnend that the holding capacity for the Upper North West Terrace be a
            maxirrtzn of 1/500.

Dear Sir

HILLSBOROUGH FOOTBALL GROUND - T H jB NORTH VEST TERRACE

A s you are aware, on the e v e n i n g of 21 No v emb er 1989 Sheffield We dne sda y played
Sh ef f ie l d Un ited at the H i l l s b o r o u g h Stadium.           A s a c o nt in g en c y the n o r t h vest
terrace was taken into use to accomm od at e the Sh ef fi eld U ni te d fans. - The present
c a p a c i t y of this terrace is 2300 but, in the v i e w of the officer in charge on the
night - Chief Superintendent Ne s b i t ’F ’ Division - that nu m b er cannot be safely
accommod ate d.           A p p r o x i m a t e l y fiv e minut es before the ki ck-off there were 200/300
p e o p l e standing in the ga n g w a y s and at the b o t to m of the stairwells, bei ng u n a b l e
to gain access into this terrace.                            Having examined the situation, Chief
Superin ten de nt Nesbit c o n c l u d e d that this number of people cou ld not be safely
a cc o m m o d a t e d w it hin the t er r a c e d area and made pl ea s to have them transferred to
anothe r part of the ground.                        Wh i l st this exercise w a s being carried out it was
see n that a further 100/150 spectators w er e still o u ts id e in Leppings La ne
w a i t i n g to be admitted.                T h e s e people, too, were ac c o mm o d at e d in the no r t h stand.

It w i ll be seen that around 450 people could not be acc om modated and this was at
a time w h e n tickets had b e e n sol d w h i c h should h av e en s u r e d that the capacity
w o u l d not have been exceeded.

It is the v i e w of Chief Sup er i nt e n de n t N esb it that the ca pa c it y for this north
w e s t terrace should be reduced, and he has held p r e l i m i n a r y disc us si on s w i t h the
S h e f f i e l d W e d n e s d a y F oo t b al l C l u b Secretary, Mr G r a h a m Mackrell, who has agreed
that a realistic figure shoul d be 1500 maximum.

                                                                                                 .y ^

Clearly, urgent a tt e n t io n needs to be g i ve n to this matter since the fixture next
w e e k on 29 N ov e mb e r - Sh e f fie ld We d n esd ay -v- L iv e rp ool - is expected to draw a
good crowd and it w o u l d s ee m that lessons had not b e en learnt if on that night
ga tes had to be cl osed b e f o r e the official m a x i m u m capac it y had been reached.

I await you r ea rly reply.

         1.1           On Wednesday, 22nd November, 1989 at the request of the South Yo r ks hir e
                       Police, Officers from the Administ rat io n and L eg a l Dep ar tm en t , the
                       Depart men t of Land and Planning and the South Y o r k s h i r e Fire Service
                       attended at Ha m m e r t o n Road Police Stati on to vi ew extracts from the
                       Police video of the football match that had taken place at Hil ls borough
                       Sports Stadium the night before.

         1.2           The Police hi ghl ig h te d the problem that had be e n exp er i en c e d by a
                       number of spectators in the North W es t U ppe r Te rr ac e of     theG r oun d                    and
                       the action they had taken to alleviate the problero.^

         1.3           It was suggested that in the absence of further data, a revised
                        capacity of 1,500 be placed in this area and that the General Safety
                        Certificate in respect of Sheffield We d ne s d ay F o ot b a ll Club be amended
                        to reflect this.     It was pointed out by the Police that the Club had no
                        obj ect io n to this and the proposal was con firmed by Mr. Mackrell on
                        behalf of the Club on Thursday, 23rd November, 1989.

         1.4           The General Safety Ce rt ifi cat e was amended wit h the approval of the
                       Chairman of the General Purposes Panel on Friday, 24th November, 1989.
                       I attach a copy of the amendment.

         2.1           Mr. Butler informed my Chief Lic ensing Officer (Sports Grounds), Mr.
                       Der ric ot t, in a telephone conversation at a p p r o x i m a t e l y 10.30 a.m. o n
                        23rd November, that Mr. Strange of Messrs. Ea s t w oo d & Partners,
                       Con sul t in g Engineers, had spoken to Mr. Sherriff, Principal Structural
                       Engineer, De pa rtm en t of Land and Planning, and su g ge ste d that the plan
                       on which capacities had been calculated for the North West Upper
                       Terrace of the W e s t Te r r a c e was incorrect.

         2.2           Mr. Butler confirmed this in a m e m o r a n d u m to me dated 23rd November,
                       1989, and received by my Chief Li ce nsing Offi cer at 11.30 a.m. on 24th
                       November, 1989.  I w o u l d draw your a t t en t i on to paragraph 6 of the

 Dear Mr Jon-is

i'n c o n f i r n a t i o n of your telephone con ve rsa ti on wiin my Deputy Ciiief Constable,
lir ? haves tarlis;;* too^y, i w r i t e in r e l a t i o n to a c d i t i o n a l f a c t s wnich nave
ween uncov-reo, p e r t a i n i n g zo the Upper n o rt h West Terracing a t tne Hillsborough
Stadium ana, in p a r t i c u l a r , in r e l a t i o n to the c a l c u l a t e d c ap ac i t y t o r tftat
area of cne ground.                                                                .

When tne se m Final ioo< place on lb Apri 1 19o» the c a p a c i t y f o r ;.ie upper
/ ( ' «cSt terrace was e.,woo ano, obviously> tiiat numoer or t i c k e r s would
De sold. Following toe d i s a s t e r , t h i s s e c t i o n of tne ground renaineo unused,
n e v e r t h e l e s s , the Local ^ u t . i o r i t y in l i n e with the recommendations of Lord
J u s t i c e T aylor, r ea ss ess ed tne c a p a c i t y as Z,3uu. As tr.e season progressed
i t uecane necessary to use tne Upper riorUi West Terrace as an emergency contingency
area to accom oda te v i s i t i n g f ans , and t i n s was encapsulated in tne Safety
C e r c i t i c a t e issued oy tne Local Au th o ri ty .

Before the evening of             i.'ovember lyo* only a few nundrea s p e c t a t o r s had
been accommodated in the ar ea r e f e r r e d to but on the evening mentioned i e :
21 November 19u‘j S h e f f i e l d Wednesday played S h e f f i e l d United a t the Hillsborough
Stadium in the Zenith Data Systems Cup. As wi l l be a p p r e c i a t e d , th er e was
much local i n t e r e s t in t h i s match and with the consent of the Local Aut hority
Advisory Group, the Upper North West Terrace was used to accommodate S h e f f i e l d
United f an s. I r ep ea t t h a t a t t h i s time the a u t h o r i s e d ca p a c it y hao been
as sessed as 2,300 and t h a t amount o f t i c k e t s , o r t h e r e a b o u t s , were sold f o r
i n i s area.

F iv j m u t e s before kick o f f the area was f u ll and no more s p e c t a t o r s could
be s a fe ly accommodated. I t was seen t h a t th ere was between 2uu ana 3uu people
standing in the gangways to the t e r r a c e and a t the bottom of the s ta ir w e lls
w aiting to gain access, but due to the d e n sity o f the crowd they were unable
to do so. The Chief Superintendent in charge, Hr N esbit, concluded t h a t
no more sp e c ta to rs coulo be s a fe ly accommodated w itnin th is te rra c e area
and those who were waiting to gain access were taken to another p a rt o f the
ground. Whilst th is e x erc ise was being c a r r ie d out i t was seen th a t a fu rth e r
100/150 sp e c ta to rs were s t i l l outsid e the t u r n s t i l e s in Lepplngs Lene, waiting
to be admitted.
During the game i t was necessary f o r s p e c t a t o r s comfort to remove a f u r t h e r
350 from t h i s t e r r a c e . Estimations are t h a t once s p e c t a t o r s had been removed
about 1,700 people remained but they were s t i l l c l o s e l y packed.

As s t a t e d pr ev io u sly t h i s was the f i r s t time since the Semi Final on 15 April
1939 when the area had been a t c a p a c i t y , and i t was abundantly c l e a r t h a t
the number o f s p e c ta to r s shown on the c e r t i f i c a t e , i e : 2,300 could not be
accommodated, but a t the time of the Semi Final the fixed c a p a c it y f o r t h i s
are a was 2,800. Immediate d i sc us si on s took place between Chief Superintendent
Nesbit and the S h ef fie ld Wednesday Football Club S e c r e t a r y , Mr Graham Mackrell,
and they agreed an emergency f i g u re of 1,500 maximum. On 23 November 1989
I wrote to Mr H M Webster - copy l e t t e r enclosed - the Head of S h e f fi e l d
Admi nistration and Legal Department ad vi sin g him of our concern and a special
meeting of the General Purposes Panel was c a l l e d f o r 2.00 pm on Monday 27
November 1989.

Between t i mes, i t was discovered from an o f f i c e r of the Council, Mr
           [ the Safety in Sports Ground O f f i c e r , t h a t the plans which the
Local Aut ho ri ty used to determine the c a p a c i t y f o r the North West Upper Terrace
had been drawn to a s c al e which showed the t e r r a c e to be l a r g e r than i t a c t u a l l y
was.

At the meeting on 27 November 1989 an emergency item was introduced which
encapsulated the information contained in t h i s l e t t e r to t h i s p o in t. A copy
of the notes f o r t h i s meeting are included.

There was prolonged di sc us sio n as .to the r e v i s e d c a p a c i t y f o r t h i s area o f
the ground and Mr John Strange, who was r e p r e s e n t i n g Eastwood and P ar tn er s
a t the meeting, suggested t h a t the c a p a c i t y to be fi x ed a t 1,400 will allow
time f o r exa ct c a l c u l a t i o n s to be made, but he was sure t h a t the f i g u re o f
1,400, w h i l s t e r r i n g on the si d e of s a f e t y , would not be too f a r from the
exa ct f i g u r e . So, on 15 April 1989 we had a c a p a c i t y of 2,800 which has
now been reduced to 1,400, a re duction of 100%I

At the meeting, the question was never asked, or indeed, considered r e l a t i v e
to th e accuracy of the plans f o r the Leppings Lane Terrace on which the c a p a c it y

  .T.ents and -hcse scaled frcm the craving based upon that
  provided by the Club.             Instead of -he 23CO which had
  noticnailv been considered to be the capacity cf the upper
  North West corner, the total area available would only take
  2242 on the basis of 54 spectators to ICnr .
          The discrepancy between the drawing and the actual measurement
  is net in any way apparent frcm a visual inspection of the terrace.
  At the time when we were reporting in 157 3, we were made
  aware that in September 1970, follcwing a report by the Club's
  previous consultants the police had agreed a capacity for the
  elevated North West corner cf 2,000 spectators.              That figure
  cr a higher one had been used in all the major games frcm the
  World Cup in 1966.             There was thus no reason for us to be alerted
  in 1978/79.         We enclose a copy of the 1970 report and the Chief
  Constable's letter to the Club dated 30 September 1970.
          Obviously we have been concerned about the possibility that
  the calculations for the terrace in front of the West stand might
  also have been based on a misleading plan.              Cur check measurements
  have shown that the actual area is such that it could accommodate
  the 'notional1 number of spectators with a slightly lower density
  than 54 per 10m2 .


                                       Yours sincerely,

D e a r Mr.   Taylor,

                Capacity of Hillsborough Stadium

          T h a n k you for y o u r letter cf PCth July encl o s i n g a
copy of the Chief Constable's letter Gated loth July in
c o n n e c t i o n with the G r o u n d Capacity of Hillsbor-.urn
Stadium.

        I und e r s t a n d the w o r d s "scientific c a l c u l a t i o n 1 were
u s e d by y o u r ^oodsel f in the original terms of reference
to u s but in the a b s e n c e of any known formula we have
de a l t w i t h this .•natter by empirical means.

          Ve assembled a small crowd of people in our drawing
o f f i c e to represent a sample of a crowd stondin^ reasonably
close to :etner.      V.'e then established a co efficient of 1.34*
liner-1 feet per p ers on on each step of terrace, each person
be in:* allocated the full depth of the terrace w h a t e v e r its
dimension.

          We then referred to o u r detailed surveys of the terrace
tnd we also measured on site the known usable length of the
t e r r a c e steps, rr^kin^ due allowance for j^n^ways, passageways,
stairways, etc. and the length of eacn section was aivided
by the coefficient to e s tablis h the capacity.

     Ve re.-ard the fore j. i n ’ c . s an interim a p p r o a c h to the
problem, until such time as the coefficient could be checked
by the use of crowd c o u n t i n g devices.

                                      Yours sl pcerely.

H. McGee Esq.,                                   . 8        May 1986
Chairman, Sheffield Wednesday Football Club PLC,
c/o Presto Tools,
Penistone Road,
Sheffield 6.



Dear Chairman,
                    Roofing of the Kop _
         Z have pleasure in enclosing a copy of the latest
programme for the works.    You will see, thatthia shows only a
few items not completed by Saturday.# 23 August.      These should.
not interfere with the admission of spectators.      The programme
is tight, and a lot of windy or wet weather could make it
difficult to keep to programme.     But the whole team has the .
right spirit.
         At the progress meeting with the contractor held
yesterday all critical path items were in line with the programme.
Socae non-critical items are up to one week late, but these do
not cause any concern at present.
         The crane is due to arrive on site on Wednesday, 14
May, and will be erected before the weekend.      Steelwork erection
will commence as programmed on 19 May.      Our inspectors reports
on the blast-cleaning and painting of the steel are complimentary.
         Beevor Concrete appear to be well up to programme and
my engineer's report on the concrete units which have already been
cast says the quality of finish is good.
         I am going away on holiday for just over two weeks,
starting next weekend.     Richard Sastwood and Alan Wood^-(t*s§> of
my partners) will both be available should any emergency arise,
whilst I am away.
            You very kindly asked me to let you know our fee
position.       Attached is a schedule of fee accounts for all
the work we have done for the club in the last 16 months
since January, 1985.       The years work on the Leppings Lane
end, the south stand deck, painting the north stand, testing
crush barriers and general safety work and negotiations was
all charged for on 9 December.       We drafted the accounts in
such a way as to maximise the grants for the club whilst at
the same time giving discounts.        The photocopy of the carbon
of my letter of 9 December will explain all this.
            I           sent our first invoice for services in connection
with the Kop on 17 February.       You will probably know that
the fees which I agreed with Dick and Keith represent a
substantial discount on the normal scale.           I have also not
charged for the abortive designs for a Kop roof with boxes,
nor for the studies on the south stand roof which were carried
out last year.      I also do not intend to charge for the abortive
work in changing all our drawings to oait the concrete and steel
deck, a completely new set of calculations for the Town Hall,
and then changing back again.       As a result we are now losing
heavily on the project, but of course th4jnsis a payback in the
form of publicity.
            Z refrained from sending interim fee accounts for the
Koproof, the first of which was due in August 1985, when our
sketch designs were approved by the club and planning consent
obtained.       By February we had finished all design (the
first design) and were due to 85% of our fees.           You will see
that at that stage we were owed a total of £80,682 plus £1 2 ,1 0 2
V.A.T.   We received £25,000 <£21,739 fees plus £3,261 V.A.T.) on
17 March.       This almost cleared the accounts for last years work.
Including the fees for the Kop, the outstanding fees are now
£58,942.98 plus £8,841.45 V.A.T., making £67,784.43 in total.
            Z very much appreciate your raising the point.

                                 Y o u r s sincerely,
                                                           RKG/KH

               Facilities for the Disabled in the Worth Stand
     We have now prepared our fee account which Z have pleasure in
enclosing.
     You will see that this has been made out 00 a time basis
mainly because we were subjected to a great deal of time wasting
by the local authority and the working party.        You will recall
that there were arguments about the width of the ramp, about the
hand rails,and particularly about the level of the safety rail
in front of the wheelchairs.       Z became heavily involved in the
arguments, including a special visit to satisfy myself that what
we were proposing was right.    John had to arrange a spepftll
meeting with membersof the working party.     A number of alterations
had to be made to our drawings although we did manage to limit the
extra expenditurepa£2D$ having a horizontal rail approximately attthe
eye level of the people in the wheelchairs.
     It will be seen that my time has not been charged for.         He have
also not charged for travelling expenses and prints of drawings
both of which are admissible in the normal conditions          engagement.
We have also then deducted 10% from the hourly rate charges.
In total, our various discunnts add up to about 20% of the bill
which naans that we have worked it i   k
margins, without discount, usually wor)
You will also recall that we paid our i
cartoon showing the facility for use ix
was £100 which we have been pleased tc
contribution.
     With all good wishes for Christaai


                              Yours six

The directors present herewith the audited accounts of the company for the year ended 31st May, 1985.
Financial Results and Dividends
The revenue account is set out on page 3. The directors recommend no dividend be paid.
Review of ihe Year
The principal activity of your company continues to be that of a professional football club.
The Season 1984/85 will be remembered by all connected with the club for our successful return to the 1st Division
after fourteen years absence. We finished in eighth position: a very creditable performance in our first season back
In the top flight when we were challenging for a place in Europe until virtually the last match.
In the Milk Cup we again reached the quarter final, eventually losing to Chelsea after three memorable games which
were each watched Tby crowds in excess of 36,000.
In the RA. Cup a 3-2 away defeat a l the hands of Ipswich Town saw our exit in the fifth round.
Our Central and Northern Intermediate sides also had better seasons finishing 6th and 9th in their respective
leagues.                                                                  ,
Nigel Worthington received his Northern Ireland International Cap whilst Tony Gregory and Kevin Pressman both
received their-England Youth International Caps.
The average home gate for league matches was 27,000 and our supporters received national acclaim for their
exemplary conduct by being awarded a T o p of the Kops** award by a leading national newspaper.
Our successful season, however, has been tempered by severe crowd disturbances at matches in which our club
had not been taking part and fn particular by the tragic disasters at the Bradford City ground and the Heysel
Stadium In Belgium. The subsequent re-actions by H.M. Government and the football authorities will have far
reaching effects on soccer generally in this country and may inevitably adversly affect our club a t least in the short
term.
Financially our year was also very satisfactory showing a surplus before tax of £-498-579 despite having paid out
transfer fees totalling £667.750 against those received of £592,500. The club continued with its policy of improving
the amenities for spectators by spending the sum of £492,000 on additional facilities.
The directors wish to thank, on your behalf, all the piayers and staff for their excellent efforts during the season and
in particular Howard Wilkinson, our manager, and Dick Chester, our secretary, forthe very creditable achievements.

The only change to the directors' interest in the share capital and debentures in the year was a purchase by K. T.
Addy of 2 ‘A' ordinary shares.
The directors who retire by rotation are Messrs M, Sheppard and C. L Woodward who, being eligible, offer
themselves for re-election.
Fixed A ssets
The changes that occurred in the foced assets during the year are set out on pages S &7. in view of the specialised
use of the freehold land and buildings at Hillsborough, the directors ere unable to give an indication of the excess of
the market value over book value. The buildings will continue to be maintained to their present standard and it is not
considered appropriate to provide depreciation on the freehold stadium.
Auditors
A resolution to re-appoint the auditors, PanneJi Kerr Forster, will be proposed at the annual general meeting.

       9. Taxation

          Corporation tax on the investment income at 30%
          The company has accumulated tax losses totalling approximately £450,000 which are available to offset
          against any future taxable profits arising from trading activities.
       10. Directors Emoluments
           No emoluments have been paid to the directors during the year.
       11. Fixed Assets - Tangible
          The Increase in book value at 9th January, 1975 to £1,000,000 followed a professional valuation by Messrs
           Eadon Lockwood & Riddle on that date of £2,312,000. This valuation was made on the basis of depreciated
           replacement cost, but in view of the specialised nature of the stadium, the directors felt it was inappropriate
           to include the asset in the accounts at that figure. As there Is no Intention to dispose of the property, no
           provision has been made for an estimated potential tax charge of £128,000 which would arise on a sale at
           book value.

  Auditors’ Report to the Members
  We have audited the financial statem ents on pages 3 to 10 in accordance with approved Auditing Standards. These
  accounts have been prepared under the historical cost convention as modified by the revaluation of the freehold
  stadium.
  For the reasons stated in the Directors* Report, the company has not compiled with Statement of Standard
  Accounting Practice No. 12 in that no provision has been made for depreciation on the freehold stadium.
  Except for the effects of accounting for depreciation on the freehold stadium in the manner described in the
  preceding paragraph, in our opinion, the financial statem ents give a true and fair view of the state of affairs of the
  Club at 31st May 1985, and of the surplus and source and application of funds, for the year then ended and comply
  with the Companies Act 1985.

    The directors present their annual report on the affaire of the company, together with the accounts and auditors' report,
    for the year ended 31st May, 1957,

    Principal Activity and Business Review
    The principal activity of the company continues to ,be that of a professional football club.
    After a good start ?twas somewhat disappointing to finish in thirteenth place in the First Division. hut once again we fared
    well in the RA. Cup only to lose ai home to the eventual winners Coventry (Sty in the 6th Round.
    Nigel Worthington and Skjgi Jonsson once again regularfy represented their countries. Cad Bradshaw, Tony Gregory,
    David Hirst and Kevin Pressman an played for England al Under 19 level as did Scott Cam at Under 17, and this bodes
    well for the future of the dub.
    The highspot of the year however was the opening of the new Kop complete with its magnificent roof, surely the finest
    structure of its kind in the Football League, by Her Majesty the Queen on 12th December 1$8S.Aday for all of us to reniember.
    We wish to take this opportunity, on your behalf, of thanking all members of staff fortheir valuable work done during th&year.

    The directors who retire by rotation are Messrs. H. E. McGee and K. T. Addy who, being eligible, offer themselves for
    re-election.
    Charitable Donations
    Charitable donations amounted to £1,370 in the year.
    Fixed A ssets
    The changes that occurred in the fixed assets during the year are set out in Note 10 to the accounts. In view of the specialised
    use of the freehold land and buildings at Hillsborough, the directors are unable to give an indication of the excess of
    the market value over book value. The buildings will continue to be maintained to their present standard and ft is not
    considered appropriate to provide depreciation on the freehold stadium.
    Auditors
    The directors win place a resolution before the annual general meeting to re-appoint Arthur Andersen & Co. as auditors
    for the ensuing year.
    By Order of the Board,
    G. H. MACKRELL, Secretary

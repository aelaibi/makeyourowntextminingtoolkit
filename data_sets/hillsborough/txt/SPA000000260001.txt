SOUTH YORKSHIRE POLICE AUTHORITY

15 DECEMBER 1989


REVENUE BUDGET AND CAPITAL PROGRAMME 1990/91

Report of .the Chief Constable and Clerk and Financial Officer

1     Guidelines

1.1   The 1990/91 Budget has been prepared in accordance with the guidelines
      looo   Su     5°Vth Yorkshire Joint Consultative Committee on 27 September
      1989. The guidelines are for budgets to be prepared on a cash limited
      basis derived from:-

      (a)   a ’standstill’ budget, calculated after deduction of the £1.868 m
            gross savings made in 1989/90; and
      (b)   the higher of:

            (i)    the 1990/91 standstill budget less 2%; or
            (ii) the 1989/90 original budget plus 5%.
1.2   Additionally:-

      (a)   a schedule of potential developments be prepared including those
            items which can be financed by savings or policy changes.
      (b)   workforce implications be identified in all options.
1.3   By submitting the Budget for consideration now, this report and the
      attached papers gives members an opportunity to examine the budget in
      detail, consider the options and their impact on the Authority and
      recommend a budget strategy. Final decisions can then be made at a later
      meeting.
1.4   The 1989/90 base position

      As noted above, the starting point for calculation of the standstill
      position for 1990/91 is the actual budget level for the current year.     In
      arriving at this position in February 1989, the Authority:-
      (a)   made reductions of 2% (£1.868 m gross) in the original base.
      (b)   approved a small development programme, including additional
            staffing, amounting to £0.397 m gross in 1989/90 (£0.599 m in a full
            year).

      The proposed savings in 1989/90 were categorized as follows:-
      (i)    Category ’A ’    -     Those amendments to the standstill budget
                                    which arose from late information and firm re ­
                                    assessment of costs which could be achieved
                                    without difficulty. (£0.614 m)
                                          -   2-


       (ii) Category ’B ’      -     Reductions which could readily be imposed
                                     upon spending departments and which could
                                     therefore be readily controlled and monitored
                                     but which might be affected by unforeseen
                                     problems arising during the year. (£0.254 m)
      (iii) Category ’C ’            Reductions which would be difficult to
                                    achieve or which might give rise to an
                                    unacceptable reduction in the standard of
                                    service. Should savings be achieved elsewhere,
                                    approval to virement would be sought in order
                                    to partially restore the situation. (£1.000m)
      In preparing this package of reductions to the Police Authority to 10
      February 1989, it was reported that in many cases the proposed new levels
      of expenditure could not be maintained beyond one year without the need A
      for substantial compensating increases in future years in order to r e s t o r ^ ^
      the desired standards. It was estimated that only just over half the
      proposed 1989/90 sources of savings should be seen as potentially
      repeatable in 1990/91.
2     The Local Government and Housing Act 1989
      The Act brings about a number of changes to local government finance which
      will have a significant effect on the way in which the Authority presents
      its finances for 1990/91 and subsequent years.
2.1   Block Grant
      Under the new arrangements for financing local government all Revenue
      Support Grant (formerly Rate Support Grant) will be paid direct into a
      Collection Fund administered by each South Yorkshire District Council.
      Specific Police Grant will however still be paid direct to the Police
      Authority. In 1989/90, Block Grant amounted to 22% of the total Police
      expenditure.                                              ^
2.2    Precepts

       The Authority will precept for its net expenditure requirement on each of
       the Collection Funds in proportion to the adult population in each
       District. This precept must be issued before 1 March.
2.3    Standard Spending Assessments (S S A ’s)
       From 1990/91 the Authority will be notified of a Standard Spending
       Assesment (SSA) which is the Government’s Assessment for each Authority of
       what it should cost to provide services locally to a common standard. The
       SSA, which replaces GREA, is also the basis for calculating Revenue
       Support Grant.
       The provisional SSA   for the South Yorkshire Police Authority has been
       notified as £49.201   m. This is an increase of £5.25 m (11.9%) over the
       equivalent GREA for   1989/90. The A u t ho r it y’s budget expenditure will be
       shown alongside the   SSA on the Community Charge notice.
Capital Controls
Another major change brought about by the Act is that relating to Capital
Expenditure. As from 1990/91 a control on spending (ie, by the current
capital allocation mechanism) will be replaced by a control on borrowing
(ie by credit approvals.)
For the first time, Police will come within the Gove rn me nt ’sbasic control
system. Up to now, the Home Office has operated a scheme by scheme
approval system for major projects. Discussions are still proceeding
with Home Office as to how they intend to operate the new system, but it
appears that they intend to retain a large degree of involvement on a
scheme by scheme basis, while working within the overall requirements of
the new system. Home Office have also stated that they will not pay
grant towards the cost of capital expenditure incurred beyond the level of
the approvals they will be giving to Authorities.
A further significant change on capital finance which will affect the
authority fromm 1990/91 is the change in the method of payment of specific
grant on capital schemes. At present, grant is paid on the financing
charges as they arise. In future, a 51% capital grant will be paid as the
capital expenditure is incurred. It is the Home O f f i c e ’s intention also
to "buy-out" existing commitments to future grant on financing charges by
way of a commutation payment.
The Act also makes radical changes to the way in which A u t ho ri ty ’s make
provision for debt repayment. Each Authority must make provision for
repaying a prescribed proportion of its outstanding debt. Whilst
regulations have yet to be issued it appears that this will be set at 4%
for Police Authorities. In the short term this will result in a
significant additional burden on the A u t ho ri ty ’s finances resulting in an
additional £376,500 being required to be charged to the revenue account
for debt redemption in 1990/91.
Finally, new controls will mean that expenditure on vehicles plant and
equipment, which has previously been treated as outside the Home O ff ic e’s
control system, will now form part of the total. The Home Office have
already announced that they envisage a significant shortfall in resouces
nationally. Taken together with the announcement that grant will not be
payable towards expenditure in excess of the annual guidelines, this could
mean additional costs falling on the Authority. Further details are
awaited from the Home Office.

Forecast Outturn 1989/90
Appendix A shows that the latest estimated outturn for 1989/90 is:-

The A u th or it y’s pay, price and operational contingencies have been fully
committed, and potential sources of savings utilized. The authority has
agreed that the overspending must be borne by reserves.
The A u t h o r i t y ’s forecast outturn for the current year was discussed at the
meeting of F & G P on 27 October. The estimated total over-commitment at
that stage was £1,679,000 was made up as follows:-

      At the time of the October report, the detailed revised estimates had not
      been completed. The latest forecasts indicate that the estimated call on
      reserves of £284,000 has now reduced to £198,500.
      Appendix Al/2 of this report analyses the main variations between      the
      original and revised estimates for 1989/90.
4     Budget guidelines for 1990/91 - overall implications
      The guidelines require the Authority to build into its base the reductions
      implemented in the current year. Allowing for inflation, these can be
      assessed at £2.05 m. In addition, the guidelines ask the Authority to
      exemplify the effect of a further 2% reduction on the standstill budget,
      estimated at approximately £2.1 m. The Chief Constable will be advising
      members separately on the operational implications of these reductions.
      In addition, members will recall that Her M aj es ty ’s Inspector referred
      to resources and the effects of financial restrictions in his recent
      address to the Police Authority. He has now formally written to the        ^
      Authority and his letter makes further reference to the issue. A copy of^|
      H M I ’s letter appears elsewhere on the Agenda.
5     Kev Issues for the 1990/91 Budget and Capital Programme
5.1   The basic guideline requires the Authority to start from astandstill in
       policy terms; within that guideline, there is only limited scope for
       changes in emphasis or direction. The development programme (Appendix
       G) lists the potential changes or improvements. In addition, paragraph
       9 refers to VFM investigations, the results of which might provide
       the resources to implement some of the developments.
5.2   While the policy content of the budget is unchanged, therefore, and the
       figures represent a rolling forward of the current y e a r ’s forecasts, there
       are several key issues which to a large extent determine the size and
       shape of the whole budget, and these are central to any consideration of
       reductions or increases in expenditure. They can be identified as
       fol1o w s :-
       (a)   Uniformed establishment                                               ^
             This represents 64% of total costs. The current authorised strength
             of the force is 2,978 which includes an increase of 27 officers in
             1989/90 as approved by the Home Office and allowed, as development,
             an addition to the Revenue Estimates for 1989/90. Recent
             restrictions on recruitment are expected to result in the actual
             strength at the start of 1990/91 being 68 below the authorized
             strength. Calculation of the standstill provision allows for this
             shortfall to be recovered during 1990/91. An allowance of 1% of
             total Basic Pay is deducted to allow for turnover.
       (b)   Force overtime
             The provision for Force Overtime needs to be substantially increased
             in 1990/91 to take account, firstly, of the manning requirements at
             football grounds dictated by the Taylor Enquiry Report and secondly,
             to provide for a total of ten "Public Holidays" as against six which
             fall to be provided for in 1989/90.
                                   -   7-
       With staffing returned to the approved 1989/90 level, and the
       possibility of a further increase in strength for 1990/91, it would
       not be necessary to seek restoration of the £300,000 cut made in
       1989/90 on the provision for normal overtime. The level of overall
       provision for "Special Events" overtime should continue to require
       funding from reserves or Operational Contingency for any major
       event.
(c )   Civilian Staff and Workpeople

       Estimated strengths at relevant dates are shown in the Manpower
       Statement, from which it will be seen that there is little committed
       growth during 1990/91 apart from the recovery of losses arising from
       the recent temporary cessation of recruitment. Provision is made for
       new posts to cover cleaning and janitorial requirements at
       Attercliffe Sub Divisional Headquarters which is due for completion
       during the year. An allowance of 2% is deducted for turnover.
(d)    Police Pensions

       There has been a substantial increase in the number of retirements
       during 1989/90, to date which has required a substantial increase in
       provision for pensions and for lump-sum payments. A current analysis
       indicates that there will continue to be a potential for an increased
       level of retirements through 1990/91. Provisions have been based on
       an assumption of 6 retirements per month - an increase of 12 in the
       year 1990/91.
(e)    Training

       A sum of £50,000 was cut from the provision for external courses for
       the current year. The effect of this was to curtail a substantial
       part of the training programme, particularly as affecting CID
       courses. A detailed examination of training requirements for 1990/91
       indicates that partial reinstatement of this cut (£28,000) will
       suffice.
(f)    Premises-Related Expenses
       A cut of £100,000 was made in the premises repair and maintenance
       budget for 1989/90 in order to achieve the budget reduction target
       without impacting on manpower. This area of the budget has suffered
       in earlier y e a r s ’ cuts exercises. It is recognized however that
       while the option of cutting back on maintenance is attractive and
       relatively easy to achieve in the short term, it creates bigger
       problems for the future. The Audit Commission has reported
       nationally that Authorities should give higher priority to their
       stock of buildings and a request is made in Appendix C for partial
       restoration of the 1989/90 cut.

The standstill budget   forecast    1990/91

Appendix C sets out the draft standstill budget and capital programme.
The revenue budget total is made up as follows:-

                                                                  £000

Specific items for which special dispensation is
sought in order to minize the effects of one-year
only cuts in 1989/90*                                               485


                                                                47.503
In estimated outturn terms, the comparison between 1989/90 and 1990/91
represents an increase of 16.4% assumingthat an operational contingency
of £1 m is provided in addition to the forecast above. The increase is a
mixture of inflation (actual and estimated) and unavoidable commitments
and changes (both increases and decreases). This change between the two
years is analysed in detail in the Variation Statements included at
Appendix B.

These statements draw attention to the detailed reasoning behind the
 special dispensation’ items referred to in the table above at *.
Briefly, however, these items are put forward in this way in order to
viS5!i9ht t h e .Chief Co nstable’s concern that building the value of the
1989/90 cuts into the 1990/91 base will have a serious effect on force
effectiveness in certain areas.

The Police budget can be broken down into the following broad headings:-
                                                %

Uniformed manpower                             68

Pensions                                        7

Civilian manpower                               8

Capital financing                               3

Agency (including Common Police Services)       3
Other running costs

                                              100


This shows that there are significant ’f ix ed ’ costs within the budget
(pensions; capital finance; to a lesser extent agency costs). The only
way of reversing part of the 1989/90 savings without increasing the base
would be to make compensating savings in the variable parts of the budget
The table above shows that apart from general running costs, which amount
to 11% of the total, the only source would be to seek reductions in
employee costs; the Chief Constable will be referring to this issue.
Inflation Assumptions
Appendix E sets out the build-up of the pay and price contingency and the
inflation assumptions which underly the forecasts. These are in summary:-
                                                %

Police Pay (September 1990)                     9
Other pay awards (various dates)                7
Pensions Increase (April 1990)              7.6
Rent Allowance                               40 (last updated 1988)

Prices                                          6

Implication of a 2% reduction on standstill in 1990/91
Section 6 of this report has dealt with the standstill forecast. A 2%
reduction on standstill would require additional savings of £2.090 m
gross (£1.034 m net).
The Chief Constable will be advising members directly on the implications
of the reductions. At this stage, no analysis is provided with this
report.
Potential Developments
Appendix G of this report sets out the Chief Cons ta bl e’s proposed
developments. In total these amount to £776,500 gross (£380,500 net) in
1990/91.
 Financing of Developments from Savings or Policy Changes
The guidelines require the Authority to consider VFM saving which could
be used to finance developments elsewhere within the budget. The VFM
programme is now underway and the following areas have been identified for
current and future st udies:-
 allowances               civilianisation           Property management
 catering                 laundry services          Delivery systems
 car leasing              vehicle utilization       Building cleaning
 telephone charges
 use of training centre
 Until the investigations are completed, it is difficult to be Pr®£ise
 about the results. Where savings are achieved, it is suggested that they
 be reported to the Authority, the options available being:-
 (i)       to produce a saving in budgeted expenditure
 (ii)      to approve a transfer within the existing budget

 (iii)     to approve developments

10     Available finance from reserves
10.1 As noted in the early part of this report, the Authority will not receive
      revenue support grant. Apart from miscellaneous income its finance will
      be derived from specific grant, precepts on the Collection Funds, and
      internal reserves.
       The level of reserves as at 31 March 1989 stood at £2,717,000, of which
       £1,000,000 was earmarked for the operational contingency in 1989/90.
10.2 Present forecasts of reserves available to the Authority at 31 March 1990
      are:-

                                                           £
       (i)    Original total 1 April 1989              2.717.000
       (ii)   Original Contingency utilized to
              finance the bulk of the Autho ri t y’s
              share of the cost of the West
              Midlands enquiry.                         1. 000.000

                                                        1.717.000
       (iii) Projected budget overspend charged to
             reserves per section 3.                      198,500

       Projected reserves at 31 March 1990             £1,518,500

11     Other Commitments

11.1   Reserves of £1.5 m represent approximately 2.8% of the A u th or it y’s net
       expenditure for the year. The Authority has traditionally provided an
       operational contingency of £1 m, and the costs following Hillsborough hav
       illustrated the need for the Authority to have adequate cover for
       unforeseen contingencies.
       Operational Contingency
11.2   It is recommended that at least £1 m is set aside as an operational
       contingency for 1990/91.
11.3   Other potential costs
       Members have been kept up to date with forecasts of the likely cost of
       the inquiries for Hillsborough, and the potential insurance liabilities.
       Future commitments could arise from:-
       (a) The cost of any enquiries undertaken by West Midlands which fall in
            1990/91. (The Home Of fi ce ’s open ended undertaking to grant aid the
           Authority extends only to costs incurred in 1989/90).
       (b) Settlement of claims, and apportionment of liability which goes
           beyond the level of the authority’s insurance cover.
      Last year, members also considered the possible implications of the World
      Student Games. It was decided not to raise additional finance during
      1989/90, but it is worth noting that the Games will take place early in
      the financial year following 1990/91, and that significant pre-Games
      commitments are anticipated.

      In setting the level of the A u th or it y’s claim on the Collection Funds, it
      will be necessary to take a view on the extent to which the Authority
      needs to set aside or raise finance to cover possible commitments over and
      above the normal budget.
12    Conclusions

      (a)   The Authority is asked to approve the revised estimates for 1989/90.
      (b)   Members are asked to note the content of this report and agree to
            forward a summary of the 1990/91 forecasts to the SYJCC for further
            consideration and advice.

At a b o ut           1.30 pm             (1330)          we all         took     up our         p o s ition at P oint 3,               and

at     that        time        the S p i on H o p was                    pretty empty,             as was        the       others.       I

would         say they were a quarter                                   to half        full.       Where at about 2.43                   pm

(1445)           the S p i on Ko p a n d S o u t h St a n d s were more                                   or    less       full   but    the

pa c k e d       in the           centre areas                    but    the ends were             pretty empty.

Up     until          the m a t c h           c o m m en ce d we were               not       r e q uired to perf o r m any

okay.            At     this        point          in time          there        seemed        no sign of serious                 injury.

T here        seemed such a lot                            coming        out so we            decided       to sit         them d o w n , as

the      game         had stopped,                   on the         corner        of      pitch.

P h i l i p and      I s ta r t e d   to as s i s t      these     people.         Their    injuries

were m a in ly        crush     injuries an d we did what we                       could.

At a bout 5 . 15         pm/5.30       pm    (1715/1730),            I sought       p e r m i s s i o n to stand

down.          This was      g ra n t e d by I               the     nursing       officer     in charge of

the    post.         U n f o r t u n t e l y , I do not      know her        surname.         We went        home.

Du r i n g all       this    incident,        I felt       t ot a l l y helpless        due    to the        vast

n um b e r s    of   injured.         If a n y on e      showed signs         of    life    by m o a n i n g   or

g r o a ni n g we had to          leave      them and go to those                  that were      not.

I did not see any alco h o l                  drunk        or brought        to the     game,     nor    did     I see

any    violence.            I was     too busy w i t h my a s s i s t a n c e         to the      injured.

required.

With     regard to the            people      I assisted,            I cannot       recall     any details           of

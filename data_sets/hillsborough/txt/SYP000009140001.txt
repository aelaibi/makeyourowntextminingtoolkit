Whilst              here           I yas       approached                      by    a Police              Constable           from         the       tunnel         who

        hair       and    in    his          rin dd 1 e    twent ie s .               He    was       plump          b u t had        a    large

        I remember             he    only          had     one t r a i n i n g            shoe       on        his one          foot.

        As    I    remember          at        this       point,        1 think             somebody             got       hold       of       me     and     took

        me    to    the    back          of     the       goal     at       Leppings             Ln       end    and       took       me       to     a

        blue       in    the    face.              He     had     no    pulse             and    was       not       breathing.                 I commenced

        to    give       mouth       to       mouth        resuscitation.                        I was          doing          this       for       two     to

        three       minutes          but        I was        gaining             no       response             and    was       in m y         opinion

        dead.           Some    fans          brought           some        hoardings                over       and       took       this       casualty

        away       and    across             the     pitch        towards             the       gymnasium.                 I would             describe

        this       casualty          (C ) as            being      a yw h i t e           male,       about          18    to    19       years           old,      of

        slight          build.           I    cannot         remember- what                     colour          hair       he    had       and        I    can't

        remember          what       he       was       wearing.

        the       oxygen       cylinder             was      three          quarters             full.           I saw          two       persons           at

        this       time    with          a     c a s u a l t y ,as      marked              SD ’ o n           the H i l l s b o r o u g h            Ground

 wearing          a    light          coloured          shirt,

 I approached                   this       casualty             *0’ with          the          resuscitator                   and      offered          it

 to    the    doctor             who       refused          it.        The       doctor             said       he         d i d n ’t t h i n k it    was

 sufficient                for       the    use    he       wanted          it.        He       said          something              about    he

 needed       a       ball       or    mouth       to       mouth.           All       I       can       remember             about     casualty

 ’D 5 w a s       that          he    was    a white             male       and    had          no       shirt       on.

 I then       went          across          to    another             casualty,                as    marked               ’E*    on the

 Hillsborough                   Ground       Hap,           I noticed             this          person          as    he        was    unattended.

 I went       over,             he    was    dead.              As    I checked                his       pulse       he       was     not    breathing

 and    blue          in    the       face.        This          casualty          was          a    white          male,        about       late

 teens       or       middle          twenties,             I can't          remember                what       he    looked           like       but      he

 had    dark          clothing.              Some       supporters                then          came          along       with        some

 hoardings.                 The       casualty          was          placed       on    and          the       fans       took        him    away

 across       the          pitch       towards          the          gymnasium.

As     I walked             towards          the       centre          of    the       pitch.                 I saw       a    Police        Constable

Police        Constable.                    He    was       leaning          up    against                the       Police           Constable's

 legs.        I examined                   the    Officer             and    deduced                he    was       suffering           from

 exhaustion.                    I gave       him       some          oxygen       via          the       resuscitator.                  He    came

 round       and       stood          up a f t e r      about          four       minutes.                He    stated           he    had    been

On     entering             the       gym    I saw          a    large       rmm ber/'of                 bodies       were           being    searched

distress          laying          on    the        floor         against          the       wall        of     the       gymnasium                 on    hi s

face,       with       a    friend          of    his       next       to       him.        He     had       got        chest        injuries               and

breathing             difficulties.                    As    I    remember             he     -said h i s           name        was                 and

was    the                                                                                                          We       gave      him         oxygen

and    instructed                Leading          Fireman                                   to     find        a    doctor.               The

casualty          at       this       time       was    lucid.              He    told        me       he    had        his     ticket             in    his

back       pocket          and    h e ’d        let    him       in w i t h o u t        even          looking           at     his       ticket.

A    doctor       came       over,          examined             him       and    stated           he       w a s n ’t a n        urgent            cas e ,

but    1 w a s n ’t         happy       with          this       diagnosis             as     this          casualty            kept          drifting

off    towards             unconsciousness.                       We       got    another              doctor           to    come        over

eventually             who       examined             him    and       said       he    was        a    priority               case.           He       gave

him    a    saliva          drip       and       he    was       taken^eff'f           to     hospital.                  I would              describe

this       casualty          as       white       male,                    2 0 ’s,     f a i r hair,               short        style,

Just       after       this       StatToVi O f f i c e r               FLETCHER             informed               me    that        all       crews

were       to    return          to    our       applicance,                which        I did          on     my       own     as     I didn't

know       where       my    own       crew       were.

Back       at    the       appliance             at    Leppings             L n , the         crowd          were        coming           out       of      the

ground.           They       were       orderly             but    the          position           of       the     fire        appliances

were       restricting                exits,          causing          a    bottleneck                 and     frustration                    amongst

the    fans.           In    view       of       this       I organised                the       Fire        Appliance               to       be    moved

away       and    thus       improving                the    fans*          exit       from        the       ground.

One    of       the    Senior          Fire       Officers             staff          cars       was        also        causing           a    blockage

in    that       it    completely                blocked          the       pavement             in     front           of    the      sweet            shop

and    fans       were       climbing             over       the       car.

I    then       organised             for       this    car       to       be    moved        out       of     the       way      to      prevent

any    more       distress.                 I    c o u l d n ’t    find          my    crew        in       the     area        so     I returned

to    the       qymnasiurn.

I    met    up    with       our       crew       and       returned             to    the       fire        appliance.                   We       left

Mr Storr, on information received from Mr Martin Brandon Bravo MP,
tells me that there is an event to be organised in the House of Commons
(date not known) at which a superintendent at the South Yorkshire
Police will present extracts of video tape footage from the
Hillsborough disaster.   It came to the Private Office here on the basis
of a tentative enquiry whether the Home Secretary would like to be
present - wisely refused.


2.   But I thought you and other copy recipients should know of it and
if it is possible, tactfullytto discover how this event came to be
arranged it would be helpful to know.

Mr McDonald
1 .    In response to your minute of 11 May, I asked Mr Turner
to look at the Popplewell papers afresh, and to justify our
apparent   lack  of   action   on  the   Building  Regulations
recommendations.  His advice to me is below, and I think we do
have an answer to any criticism.
2.      As you know, the Building Regulations operate at two
levels.     They already include (and did at the time of
Popplewell) legal requirements intended to minimise internal
and external fire spread.   So far as I am aware, these legal
requirements have never been criticised.   The second level is
the approved Document, which provides "practical guidance
respect to the requirements......."     The criticism made by
Popplewell (which we accept) is that, in the case of single
storey stands, the guidance is inadequate in certain respects.
The report recommended that the approved document should be
amended urgently.
3.     in December 1986,    the Home Office produced their own
revised Green Guide.    What Mr Turner is saying is that this
document (paras 147-152) provided all the interim guidance
that could be given on this point, and that we were involved
in its preparation.    We may not have met the letter of the
Popplewell recommendation, but the Home Office Green Guide is
an authoritative guidance document in its own right.        My
conclusion is that what Popplewell was asking for has been
done, even if it has not been done in precisely the way that
he had in mind.
 4.        As      you know, we are still reviewing the technical
 content of Part B of the Building Regulations (fire).           It is
 by far the most complex (and arguably the most important) part
 of the whole review, and BRAC set up a separate Fire Panel to
 carry out the work.           Our timetable is that draft proposals
 should be            ready for initial   consideration   by BRAC   in
 S e p t e m b e r ^ and I shall do everything possible to get a
 consultation paper out very early next year.           On this basis,
 the amending regulations should be made and the revised
 published by the end of next year.
 5.    x know that there are one or two gaps in this line of
 argument - including why we did not say what we intended at
 the outset.   Moreover, John Patten's recent PQ reply (below)
 does not exactly help.   Neverhteless I believe that it is a
 defensible explanation.
 6 .    While I am ready to discuss, I was not around when
 these events took place, and I doubt whether there is anything
 that I shall be able to add.

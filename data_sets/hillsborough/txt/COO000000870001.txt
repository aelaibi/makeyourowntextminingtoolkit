PRIME MINISTER
FOOTBALL MEMBERSHIP SCHEME


Miss Sinclair's note analyses the consequences of the House of
Lords' vote on Monday.                       The problem arises because the
Harmar-Nicholls amendment does not do v*?hat he claimed -
                     -             -                —    ---

instead of requiring the football membership authority to
consider phasing the scheme in, it ends up requiring phasing.
Lord Belstead will now speak to Lord Harmar-Nicholls to see
if, when the defects of the amendment are explained, he will
withdraw it.             This is unlikely.              More likely is that he will
accept a Government amendment which achieves what he said he
wanted.        This could, however, cause difficulties with some of
the others who voted for the amendment who want phasing to be
a requirement.                    An amendment limiting the scheme to First and
Second Division clubs was strongly argued for but in the end
not pushed to a vote.

The Chief Whip is slightly more concerned than implied by
Miss Sinclair's first paragraph.                          The status quo always has
its attractions and it would have been easier to get the
Commons to vote for the original Bill than vote to reverse a
change made in the Lords.


The issue of phasing or limiting to larger clubs hinges on the
displacement argument.                       The Government's case is that there is
now hooliqani-sm at the smaller cluhs and that if hooligans
cannot get into the big matches, they will transfer their
^activities to smaller matches.

                                                        It will be difficult to
persuade people of this as it is not entirely consistent with
what the Governmen£is arguing elsewhere.                           The Government
argues that there is not simply a fixed quantum of hooligans
which is simply moved around, but that the nature of football
matches actually creates it, and that the atmosphere of the
big matches is particularly conducive.                          I confess to being
sceptical on whether hooligans who cannot get into Chelsea or
West Ham are likely to find that Brentford or Leyton Orient
provide the platform they are looking for.

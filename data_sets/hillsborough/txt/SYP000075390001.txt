              SO minutes walk from the ground. We wa 1ked,«^!fown Leppings Ln a nd I saw

               various Policemen blocking off the I t r L r w r      roads a n d a small   cordon of

              Police stopping ppnple drinking. We arrived at the outer perimeter

               They were n o t i n Queues.      I definitely saw one Policeman

               and there we r e/6f f i ce rs there but I c a n ’t say how many". The crowd was

               pushing and shoving but there was no hooligan di sord er . I was               in the

               mass of the crowd/ror about 5 minutes,            when I saw that the right hand

               colTceVtina gators w ere open. Prior to this           I heard shouting from the

     V         front that P e o p l e   were getting    crushed and I saw people being dragged

               over the turnstiles,        because of the crush.       There was a release of the

               crush but the flow was orderly through the gates.               I saw a number of

               Policemen directing us into the main concourse. People were milling

               around but there was no crush. There was a tunnel which appeared to be

               the only way in. At this time            I was with                              and

                       and later joined by                                                      wen]

               guite high up. We followed the sign which went rj>*ind the staemi and

/)             onto the terraces and stood just by the sidj^of the P'olice control

XM    '        point. We stood about half way down the^Xerracing.               With me were

              match had already sjfrarted wher^/we arrived.            A matter of minutes     later I

               saw that there ware        people spi 11 ing//mito the pitch as they had c 1 imbed

                   pleading with him. Things we/? obviously getting bad and eventually

                   the jTiatch s t o p ped. There was now chaos on the pens behind the goal

                   When the match stopped I saw Stewards «              Policemen.     The      oliceme;

                   people coming onto the (pi t^Kji netead of helping them to get out of the

                   pens.   I saw people lying on the floor that were obviously injured.

                   to the sides.     The si         eased very slowly and I first saw

                   a m bulance about 3.3Qpm (153Q). We stayed on the terracing until about

                   the impression that they were more/concerned about a pitph invasion

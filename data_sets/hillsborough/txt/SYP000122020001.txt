                  SUBJECT:        FA CUP SEMI FINAL - 9 April 1908


                I refer to the enclosed correspondence regarding the above event. I have
                liaised with the officers concerned with the preparation, control and
                supervision of the above event and we have noted locally the lessons that
                were learned and the improvements that can be made for any similar future
                event. Generally I was well satisfied with the event and I will confine this
                report to matters which effect the Force Operations Room and F.oad Traffic
                Department;-' -

                COMMUNICATIONS

                On the day more use than normal was made of the radio link between ground
                .control at Hillsborough and the Operations room in attempting to contact
                those units equipped with both ground control and UHF radio. This was
                entirely due to difficulties in personal radio transmissions which were
                effected for most of the event by breakthrough from local radio. The
                Superintendent (Communications) is aware of this and an immediate survey
                of the equipment was made after the event, but the fault could not be traced.

                TRAFFIC FLOW AND CONTROL

                Transmissions in relation to problems with traffic, from mobile units and
                the spotter plane were being received at Operations room and were not
                monitored at ground control. It seems sensible to me that for future 'semis*
                all matters relating to the control and movement of traffic should be
                supervised by Operations room, with the exception of the local arrangements
                made immediately outside the ground when the final whistle is blown.

                F00T3ALL TRAFFIC SIGNS

                Purpose made signs have been requested in the past, but for financial
                reasons have not been approved. , Such signs are extremely beneficial and
                it is pleasing to note that Superintendent Brougham is looking into this
                aspect.

                SEARCHING OF COACHES FOR ALCOHOL ABUSE ETC.

                The effect of alcohol on football supporters is well known and I would not
                wish to see any relaxation of enforcement of the laws relating to the carriage
                of alcohol on coaches etc. It is appreciated that this can cause some traffic
                congestion, but surveys are being carried out on the major roads approaching
                the city to ■establish where this can be carried out to cause minimum
                inconvenience to traffic flows.

                CLOSE CIRCUIT TV LINK WITH WADSLEY BRIDGE STATION

                A TV monitor was sited in the control roan giving pictures from Wadsley Bridge
                Railway Station. This monitor took up valuable room in the control area and
                was of little use and I would not wish such a system to be implemented in the
                future.                                 ' ;

            SUBJECT:   Items for de-briefing re F.A.      Semi-final 9th April 1988

            On Saturday 9th April I was duty sergeant in the Operations
            Room and I would like to submit my observations concerning
            the football match.

            1. Operational Orders

               Traffic       - no problems w ith this order other than the
               fact that no call signs had been allocated to the three
               public order patrols at Woodall Services, Ml. It was not
               until they came on the air that we knew who was on this
               detail. It was necessary to then create a duty rota on the
               computer and allocate callsigns (X 1 0 1 ,X 1 0 2 ,X 1 0 3 ). It would
               have been m uch better if this had been catered for in the
               order.

               'F' Division - no problems, other than the fact that Operations
               Room did not receive a copy of the order. One was obviously
               copied from another held at headquarters.

              1D' Division - this order catered very well with 'D' Division
              involvement, the precise details of primary and secondary
              routes being useful. One problem encountered was that the
              traffic signals  on the Ml exit slip roads at Catcliffe
              were not turned off; officers were working traffic against
              the lights. This matter was subsequently resolved but should
              be catered for in any similar operation.

              Dog Section - Operations Room did not receive a copy of any *
              order or duties in relation to duties at the match. It was
              a fairly lengthy task creating a duty rota on the computer
              for all the dog handlers involved and in future advance
              duties for such operations should be supplied in advance.

           2. Use of spotter plane

              As you know we did have problems initially with air to
              ground communications, but once these problems had been
              resolved the assistance cf the spotter plane became
              invaluable. Prior to the match, Operations Room were given
              good accounts of traffic flow into Hillsborough and traffic
              hold ups were reported. It was then possible to give
              instructions to officers on point duty,via other match
              controls, to ease the hold ups.

              Ironically, there was a two mile tailback reported on the
              A616 at Oughtibridge - traffic building up through Warncliffe
              Side to Deepcar. The hold up was on Low R o a d ,Oughtibridge
              where public order patrols manned by the Underwater Search
              Unit were stopping and searching vehicles travelling into
              city.
                           -2-


   After the match, the spotter plane was of great assistance
   in identifying why traffic could not leave the area of the
   ground.

   One major problem highlighted, and rectified by the air
   observer, was that officers on point dut y were working
   against each other. One would have rel eased traffic whilst
   the next officer in line would be stoppin g it. It was then
   possible to synchronise their instructions to traffic to
   keep the traffic flowing. One point that should be made to
   beat officers on traffic points is that after the match they
   should give priority to football traffic leaving Sheffield,
   giving long runs through junctions. This was not the case
   on Saturday and I had to make repeated requests,via Match
   controls, for this to be done.

3. Radio Procedure and Transmissions

   Unfortunately there was some confusion regar ding which Force
   Radio Channel was being used for the match. As far as Operations
   Room was concerned, Force Channel 1 was reserved for all
   mobiles engaged on the football duty. 'D' and 'F' Division
   were expecting channel 2. This m att er was rectified and channel
   one was used.

   Channel 1 monitored all motorway patrols and any vehicle with
   specific duties in relation to the match. A total of 87 mobiles
   were working on this channel and obv i o u s l y at this level
   transmission time is at a premium. P.C. Ragg was the controller
   in Operations Room and I choose this point to state what an
   excellent job he did.

   As always some officers were sufferin g from 'verbal diarrohea'
   making life very difficult for the radio operator. Officers
   persisted in telling Operations Room ev ery time they saw a
   coach or took up escort of it. In my vi e w this type of
   transmission is unnecessary as it is v i r t u a l l y impossible for
   this type of information to be rec o r d e d and retransmitted
   when coming in thick and fast. The on l y transmission of this
   type required is where we-have a co a c h co ntain ing unruly
   supporters, etc. or where "specific instructions or enquiries
   are given. Perhaps this point should be made at future briefings
   and included in o r e r s .

4. Press Officer

  I am aware that Superintendent Pratt had been detailed to
  deal with the media concerning the match, and we had speech
  w i t h Mr. Pratt thoughout the day, but it would have been
  useful if there had been a press officer on d u t y at Headquarters
  throughout the day to take care of all the press calls.

  The Operations Room Inspector and Sergeant act as press
  officers out of hours and like any other Saturday numerous
  press calls were being received. Some wer e in relation to the
  match, others were routine press calls about incidents that
  had occurred Friday night - Saturday morning.
                       -3-




A press officer on duty at headquarters would have allowed
both the Sergeant and Inspector to give total supervi sion
to -ttte-T'anning of the Operations Room and football d e tail
instead of having to keep breaking off to answer press
en qu i r i e s .

Generally, the operation went well and was certainly an
improvement on last year's operation. This report is
respectfully submitted for your information.

                                 -   2-

Assistant Chief Constable (Operations)

The report at 1A is passed for your information only. It makes a few valid
points about the policing of this year's semi-final which need to be borne in
mind for future events.

There is one aspect that Sergeant _______ spoke to me about which he has not
included in his comments and that was his request to the SYMAS Control Room at
Rotherhan: to be more selective in passing 999 Ambulance calls to us during the
Saturday afternoon. Our impression on the day was that they had reduced the
number of calls passed in contravention of their normal policy and we felt that
was very beneficial. In fact, we now know - following our meeting earlier this
week - that in fact it just happened that 999 calls were very low that day and
they passed them all. As you know that request of ours was one of their gripes
at our recent meeting. However, by next year our revised joint policies will
obviate that area of difficulty.

I have a few comments of my own concerning the policing that day as follows

You will appreciate this was my first semi 'outside the ground', with the
responsibility for Operations & Traffic. By and large it was okay, but I think
the management of traffic flow can be improved. Many of the officers deputed to
traffic points in both 'D' and 'F' Divisions really had little idea of what they
were expected to do. Many appeared never to have worked traffic before and
their signals were sloppy and gave a poor impression. Many I spoke to had no
idea of the overall traffic strategy and had been deputed to a particular
traffic point both before and after the match with no understanding of how their
actions might influence the overall situation. I consider that one way to
improve that might be for Divisions -€o perhaps be a little more selective in who
they choose to depute to key traffic points, and once those persons have been
nominated, then I feel that for the purposes of the operation they should come
under the aegis of Traffic and all attend a pre-match briefing by ourselves so
that all know just.-what is what. I would envisage the use of maps and aerial
photographs and videos to illustrate the overall picture. That would leave
Divisional Commanders and Sector Commanders outside the ground to deal with the
crowd control, public order, liquor, etc., etc., with the control of traffic
under a single co-ordinated command.

Staying with traffic, you will be aware that at one stage we had a tail back of
some 2 i miles from Tinsley to Catcliffe on the Ml. Had we not adopted a one-off
course of action to resolve that, many Notts fans would have missed the start of
the match. We would need to cater for such a contingency next year.




                                                                 continued .....

                    SUBJECT______ F.A. SEMI-FINAL       -   11.4.88



                The match 'signing' on the motorway was pathetic, as was the route signing for
                both sets of fans. We need to consider the acquisition of LARGE CLEAR and
                easily portable signs as a matter of urgency. We were trying to encourage
                Northbound match traffic to use only the nearside lane of the Ml North after
                Catcliffe and the only signs we had were 18" square propped up at intervals on
 ^              the hard shoulder where no one could see them. We should consider flexible
 - u — c C— I signs that we could attach 'gantry style' to the overhead bridge at the A57
              I junction North (and also bridges on the motorway for Southbound spectators which
Jtf.t,        I Sive Clear instructions to visiting fans and which they cannot fail to see).
         .   I Subject to your agreement, I will arrange for Superintendent Brougham to
      / %< •   research that area and report relative to cost etc. I do not envisage any great
                sum being involved.

             The spotter plane was - as always - a real asset, but although we thought we had
             it right this time and the communications worked at rehearsal, they failed us on
             the day. We will try again on Spring Bank Holiday when Middlesborough come to
             Oakwell versus Barnsley.

             If you agree in principle with these very general comments, I would intend to
             circulate these papers to the Divisional Commanders concerned for their
             information and future discussion.

       Sir,

       In respect of your memorandum concerning the above subject, I forward
       herewith a report by Superintendent Murray and endorse the caiments
       made therein.

       M y only additional ccrrment concerns traffic, and I would agree with
       the ccmments made by Superintendent Anderson that in future at such
       events, i.e. semi finals, there may well be merit in traffic being
       dealt with separately from the policing of the football match. I
       would not be adverse to this suggestion and feel that it would be
       beneficial to all concerned. However, I would not wish to see similar
       action at normal football matches and feel that our existing
       arrangements are completely adequate.
       I submit this report for your information please.

                            FOR THE POLICING OF FOOTBALL MATCHES -
                            •EVACUATION AND STEWARDING1




               The Interim Report of the Carmittee of Inquiry into Crowd Safety
               and Control of Sports Grounds, under the Chairmanship of
               Mr Justice Popplewell, was published in July 1985 end has been
               supplemented by Home Office Circular 54/85 which urges, amongst
               other things, chief officers of police to respond quickly and
               constructively to the spirit of the recommendations.' The report
               contained 24 reconmendations including the following:

               Recortmendat ion 1

               'Evacuation procedures should'be a matter of police training
               and form part of the briefing by- police officers before a
               football match.'                    •

               Recommendation 10

               'Stewards in all grounds should not only be trained in fire
               precautions and fire fighting but should also be trained
               in how best to help the police in evacuation.'

               As you are aware, evacuation plans and the training of stewards
               have been examined. A cannon framework makes reference to plans
               far simpler and allows officers with limited knowledge of the
               stadium to contribute more effectively and with greater speed
               in an evacuation situation.

                In.drawing up thq suggested format it was acknowledged that
                considerable flexibility is necessary to take account of the
                many local factory that make each ground unique.

                Whilst responsibility for the training of stewards lies firmly
                with the club, the police have a vested interest in maximising
                the crowd management potential of non police resources at sports
                grounds. To this end it is felt the police should provide a
                significant input into the training of stewards and that the new
                appendix on stewarding (attached) provides a satisfactory basis
                for ensuring adequate standards are achieved and maintained.

                Appendix 'L', page 35 of the South Yorkshire.Police Standing
                Instructions for the Policing of Football Matches, should now be
                removed and replaced with the new Appendix.'L' pages 35 - 43,
                attached hereto.

                Page 2 of the Index of the Standing Instructions should also.be
                amended so that the last line reads - Appendix 'L' 35 - 43
                Hrergency Evacuation Procedures/Stewards.




GEN/2
Following the abolition of the County Councils on 31 March 1986,
District Council Officers will be responsible for Safety of Sports
Ground Act matters as from 1 April 1986, together with representation
of the Local Building Authority, Fire Service and Police. It is not
envisaged that this will have any significant effect on established
procedures and the working party will continue to function as outlined
at paragraph 16.1, page 11, of the Standing Instructions. Reference
made however in that paragraph to South Yorkshire County Council
should be amended to read 1District Council1.

      F ollowing d i s c u s si o ns w i t h the Fire Serv ic e O f f i c e r it was agreed
      that the fire service w o u l d attend by the q ui ck e s t possible
      routes direct to the immediate scene of a n y fire and as such
      no r e n d e zvous p o in ts or pre-arranged r o ut es c ou ld be determined.

     The main point s raised, in relation to the fire service          were
     that it was imperative that the Police C o n t r o l give the'exact
     location of a n y fire or incident and as m u c h d e t a i l as possible
     given.  No senior fire officer is on d u t y at the match.

     To assist the fire and         ambulance services in any ma jo r disaster
     two Police Tango units         wi l l be spe ci fi ca l ly detailed to assist
     one w it h the ambu la nc e    service and the o t h e r w it h the fire service
     The exact d e t a i ls will    be written into the serial order for the

                FORCE DEPLOYMENT - 15 APRIL 1989



At a meeting held at Force Headquarters on Friday 12 May

1989, W Woodward Esq, Queens Counsel representing the Chief

Constable, raised the question of total police deployment in.

the South Yorkshire Police area on Saturday 15 April 1989 and

asked for certain details to be supplied.



Since this time various statistics have been collated and it

is-now possible to summarise total deployment throughout the

Force area.   In addition,   it is also possible to compare the

proportion of police personnel on duty at Hillsborough with

those committed elsewhere.



Before presenting the relevant figures, however,       it should be

pointed out that whilst every effort has been made to ensure

accuracy, variations in shift working and manpower deployment

between divisions and departments makes precise comparisons

difficult. Within these limitations,     however,   the figures are

considered to represent a reasonable assessment of the

manpower deployment on the 15 April 1989.



FORCE ESTABLISHMENT AND STRENGTH

F A SEMI FINAL, HILLSBOROUGH

In addition to the above, a total of 1,122 officers performed
duty in respect of the F A Semi Final at Hillsborough.  This
figure includes Traffic personnel and officers engaged in the
policing arrangements for Sheffield city centre in respect of
those returning to and from the match.  It should be noted
that much of this manpower was raised by the cancellation of
leave d a y s . .

The decision to implement Operation Support at 3.10 pm
resulted in a further 261 officers attending from all parts of
the county.
 SICKNESS AND COURSES

On the 15 April 1989, a total of 127 officers were off duty
through sickness and a. further 20 were committed to attendance
at courses, thus reducing the effective strength of the Force
by 147.

OTHER FORCE COMMITMENTS

On the date of the F A Cup Semi Final the Word Snooker
Championship was also being held at the Crucible Theatre,
Sheffield.  However, this only required the permanent
attendance of one officer.

One greater significance (in respect of manpower) was a
football match played at Barnsley between Barnsley and
Birmingham City.  This game necessitated the attendance of
98 officers from 'B' Division in the following five ranks:

Supt       Ch Insp       Insp      Sergeants      Constables

  1           1           4          12              80

In addition a further 6 Constables attended from Headquarters,
Operations and Traffic Division.

SUMMARY

(a)    The effective number of personnel available must be
        reduced by 147 Officers, ie those either sick or on
        courses to leave a residual figure of 2782.

(b)    In respect of deployment of manpower to provide   24 hours
        operational cover (ie excluding sporting or 'special'
        events) the figure of 984 must be reduced by a further
       105 in respect of officers required to police the
       Snooker Championship and the football match at Barnsley
       leaving a residual figure of 879.

(c)    The proportion of police personnel available for
       operational cover in South Yorkshire when compared to
       the total effective strength of the Force (ie 'B'
       expressed as a percentage of 'A'.) was 31.5%.

(d)    The proportion of police personnel engaged in duties in
       connection with the F A Cup Semi Final at Hillsborough
       (1,122 personnel) compared to the total effective
       strength of the Force was 40.3%.
 (e)   The proportion of police psxsonnel engaged in duties at
       all three sporting events in South Yorkshire on this
       date (1227) compared to the total available strength of
       the Force was 44.1%.

 (f)   The proportion of police personnel engaged in connection
       with the F A Cup Semi Final at Hillsborough (1,122)
       together with those who attended in response to
       'Operation Support' (261) when compared to the total
       effective strength of the Force was 49.7%.

Overall therefore, the commitment of the South Yorkshire Police
to the policing of sporting events (and in particular the F A
Cup Semi Final at Hillsborough) substantially exceeded
remaining operational cover during this 24 hour period
throughout South Yorkshire.  Indeed, if the abstractions for
the two other events are also taken into account, the
proportion of officers at Hillsborough (see 'F' above)
represented more than 51% of the effective strength of the
Force on this date.

 I WAS AT THE GAME LAST YEAR.    IN PEN 2, IT WAS UNCOMFORTABLE LAST YEAR.   I WAS

 VERY DISAPPOINTED TO HAVE TO STAND IN THE SAME END THIS YEAR.   ALSO I FEEL

 THERE WAS A LACK OF EMERGENCY GATES.   ALSO WHEN THE FENCE BROKE,   IT BROKE INTO

 THE CROWD DUE TO IT'S DESIGN.   I FEEL THAT IT SHOULD HAVE BEEN DESIGNED TO

 BREAK OUTWARDS, ALSO THE KICK OFF COULD HAVE BEEN DELAYED.   THE DECISION TO

 DELAY THE KICK OFF SHOULD HAVE BEEN ANNOUNCED TO THE CROWD TO CALM THE CROWD,

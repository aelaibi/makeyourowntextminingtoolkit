There        were        Police          on    duty along                   the    road        to    the     ground          but    there

The     Police           were        searching               s om e     of     the      queues        but      they      d i d n ’t s e a r c h         my

queue        at       t ha t     time.

I d i d n ’t see               any     stewards              o ut si/6e at            that      time       there        see me d more

When        I was        in the          ground          I y&ent            with      them      up to        the     entrance           of     the

t u r m e 1 a n d we             stopped           the/e          and       decided        to       get    up the        corner         of

th e    terraces               and     avoid        t/ne crush.

There        was       no      police         or    s t e w ards            on d u t y     there          or a n y      signs       directing

I moved           down         the     tunne 1 and                it wa^i p a c k e d           at    the      bottom where              you

could        see       the       pitch        but       up    to X h ere           it w a s         fairly        cl e a r    of    p e op l e.         I

didnt        see       any       police        or       stewards             o n duty          in the        tu n n e l .

We     had       to    squeeze           through             the       first       line        of >two       of    people          at   the       back

of     the       terraces            and moved               to    the       left       antjg s t o p p e d       at a b a r r i e r         about

halfway           down, in P e n 4.

There        was       a small           gap       infront             of    t hi ^     barrier           a n d we w e r e         behind         it

     because         of       the      pea pie      filing          up we w e r e            pushed        every       no w a n d        then       into

     the     barrier           and      it w a s        painful.                                                        •

     I am        moved        infront         of    the       barrier          at     first        and     then       I joined           him after

     a short        while                               was    at      the     en d     of    the       barrier        so    if       there

     was     a    push        he w o u l d n ’t go            into       it.

     Just        before        3pm      (1500)          there       was      a surge          of    the / r o w d       from          behind        and

     I was        twisted           around         so    I was         facing         the     othe^r w a y a n d            it w a s         then    I

     was     solit        up     from my           friends.

     I. w a s     then        gradually            pushed          forward          towards         the       fencing        at       tfie f r o n t

     and     ended        up a b o u t        the       length         of    two      people        away       from     thjr f e n c e .

     I was        unable         to     t u r n -around a n d               see     the      match       my    feet/were              off     the

     ground        and        I wa s     taken with                the      crowd.

     I managed            to     turn around                 and    face       the      p i t c h las      I/ w a s    pushed          forward

     towards         the       fencing         and       I remember               seeing          the    gate     at    the       bottom        open.

     There        was     a     row     of    people          with       the      hands       against          the     side       of     the    gate

     trying        to     push         back    to       gain       their       balance.

     Th e    gate        was     to m y       right          and    there         was     a P o l i c e w o m a n and a Saint                   Johns

     Ambulanceman                pulling           the       people         out.

     There        wa s    people         being          pushed         over       the     t op     of    me    and     I was          level     with

     the     Policewomans,                   knee       at    t hi s     time.          I remember             trying        to       bite     her       on

     the     knee        to    let      her    know          I wa s      there.

     When        I was        n ea r    the    wire          meshing         I saw a          lir^e of         two     or    three           people

     dead        against         the     wire       when       I was         being        pusjfied d o w n        I was       stepping              on

     dead        bodies        underneath               me.

     I remember               one      lad wa s         bent       facing         backwards             u n d e r n e a t h me        on the

     s tep.        He     was       in his         early       H Q ’s a n d w a s            wearing          a white        tee-shirt              and

     I think         he       had      jgans       his       hair      was     dark       brown and            short        cut.         1

     rememeber            his       face      was       purple         and may          have       been       alive     for       a    short

01   time .       I think           I may      have          stepped         on h i m        to    get     out    but       I don't           know.

     If     I saw a           picture         of    him       I would          probably            reco^ise            him agaim.

There                were          others              dead and        dying          around         me     but      I don't          think      I would

be a b l e             to            identify             them again.

I d o n ’t r e m e m b e r                         the        gate    where        I was,        being           c 1osed ^an d          then     shut

again,                but           eventually                 I was       pulled         from       the       crupn       by a St.           Johns

Ambulance                     man and                  onto     the    pitch.            My     t k a i n i r^g s h o e         had     come     off m y

The             ambulanceman                       p u l l e d me      away and              threw        me     into      the       netting         at   the

back             of    the                g oa l s ,     he    then    started           banging            my      c h e st     w i t h his         fists

because                my           eyes          were        closed       at    this        time.          J. o p e n e d        them and told             him

I stopped where                                   I was        for a b o u t      2 - 3 mi n u t e s           and my          rig ht      arm was

hurting                me,                another         fan       helped       me     up     to m y       feet,

what       it w a s          like       and       started       crying         a n d we      had       to    comfort        him,What

happened           during           this          day    seemed         rediculous           I c o u l d n ’t u n d e r s t a n d

why     the       f an s      were          not    stopped         far     enough       away       and       had    their        tickets

checked.              If      this          had    happened          perhaps         tj-iis i n c i d e n t        would       h av e       been

avoided.

I know          personally                  of a     local       lad w h o / w e n t        to    the       match without               a

t i ck e t and           came       back          with    a    t i ck e y f     I d o n ’t k n o w           how    he     came       by     this

bu t    checks           outside             the     g round       csmld       have     a vo i d e d        this.

If     you      are      looking             for     a direct           reason why           this       incident           happened              you

could        put      it d o w n            to    better       Police         Control        for       stopping          people         getting

near       to     the        grounds             without       tickets         and    preventing              drinking,           because

there        were        d e f i n a t e l y ,fans            there      that     were       drunk.

When       I ’ve      been         to       this     g ro un d w h i c h was          JSmiary           "14th we         asked a

P oliceman where                    we       could       get    a drink         and     he       said,"I       s h o u l d n ’t b o t h e r

because           even        if y o u           smelt    of    drink        you wouldn't               get    in".

There        could           have       also       been       some      djtr e c t i.o ns    f o r the        c.r o w ds    to    go        to

either          side         of    t he      ground       o nc e     i nside.

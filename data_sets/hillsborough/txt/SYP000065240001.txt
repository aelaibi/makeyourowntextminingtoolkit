                        On S a t u r d a y    15th April         1 9 8 ^ 150489)                 I was working              from 8 am       (0800

                        hrs)    until        8 pm    (HQQO hrs)          or whenever                we were        stood down from the

                        football       match.          I was     posted to             cover        the   semi      final         football       match

                        between Liverpool               and N o t t i n g h a m Forest which was                        to be held at

                        H i 11s fao r o u g h Fo o t b a l 1 Gro u n d , Sheffield.

                        X was     in a serial           of one Sergeant and eight Police                                    C a n t a b l e s , on that

                        clay we were          known a?t Serial                         At about           10,30 am          (1030 hrs)       I

                        a t t e n d e d a police        briefing         in the North stand of the ground.

                        Following         this      I went with my serial                        to jSlaywheels                 n wh i c h joins

                        P e n i s t o n e Rd.       This was       in order            to control           the pa r k i ng o f L.:iv e r p o a js
coaches Clayw h e e l s Lane was                  being used to           park     coaches and          it was       our

duty to        board the       coaches and search for alcohol.                            We also

informed        the    fans    that       no    large    banner     or    inflatable mascots were

allowed        into    the    ground.           At this     time the -fans were             very well

behaved-         I continued           checking         coaches     until       about 2.3 0       pm when we

made     our way down to Pen 1 stone Road N o r t h At this                                point       our    duty was

to stop supporters                 taking any alcohol              into       the ground area.               At about

2 .40    pm    (1440 hrs)          a y outh a p p r o a c h e d    us to say there was a large

fight     in The Gate Public House                      on Pen i s t o n e                               of us w ent

to the        premises and event u a l l y gained access.                         There was        obviously

.damage       in the    bar area          but    no one wanted           to    complain.         The    s i tuation

was     calmed down and we                left to       resume     on P e n i s t o n e Rd North.            We

c ontinued       taking alcohol                from the supporters an d then a l l owing                       them to

pass.         We continued          this until          about 3 minu t e s         to 3 pm       (1500 h r s ) \ y ^

The Sergeant           then    led us          back up Clayw h e e l s Ln          in order       to get some

fish and        chips.At       this       time    only the S e r geant           had a personal              radio

with him.         As we wa l k e d along the                lane    I heard a message              over       the

radio which as           I remember             said    “All ava i l a b l e     officers        to the

H i l l s b o r o u g h ground      immediately."             We   i mmediately turned and began

walking        towards       the    ground.        As we did        I was aware           that    there were a

number        of other       serials       around us.          As we were making             our way towards

the ground my thoughts                    were    that there had been a pitch                     invasion and

there would           be a fight.          By      the time we        reached the         Lappi n g s Ln

entrance we           had speeded          up     our   pace.      I entered the           ground th ro u g h a

sliding        gate    next to the turnstiles w hich was                         open.      As we entered the

yard area at the              rear     of the West          stand jV'becante aware               of the

Liverpool        supporters           shouting abuse            towards me and my            colleagues,              i

can     remember       people       saying       '‘Get a move       on there's        people       dead       in there.

Others were           saying       "Its    all     your     fault."           There was    a large        number of

fans     in the yard area,                 they were       very upset and distressed and

our way a 3.ong the tunnen w n i ch led down into the standing pens 3 + 4.

L iverpool       fans were          coming out       through    the    tunnel     and these were also

snouting abuse           towards       us.     As    I came out of         the tunnel         I had to       push

my way down the              pen to see what was           happening.           I remember       seeing a

few     people who       looked as       though they had been                injured.I        got near       the

f ront    of the       pen and       I could see a pile o f bodies                 lying      on the    floor.

There were        police       officers       carrying     them out        of a small         gate    onto

the     pitch.     I began helpi^tf carrying                  people    through        the gate.        They

were     badly    injured.           1 then helped some           of my      colleagues        pull    on a

fence along        the       front    of the    pen.     There     had been supporters                being

crushed against              the    fence who       could not get       out and we were              trying    to

get     them out.        I could sense          that    the    other    supporters         in the      pen

ware     beginning       to get       very hostile       towards       us.      I went     to take      hold of

a body which was              on the    top of the       others       in the     pen.      I saw that         his

eyes     were    flickering          slightly and his          lips a p p e a r e d    to be quivering.

I had seen other              casualties       being    taken out       through        the tunnel       so I

deci d e d    to take        this man out the same way.                 I pu.3.1 ed h \ m t h e          pen

towards      the entrance            of the tunnel.           Another      Police      Officer       h elped me

w ith    the man but          I do not       know who    he was.        I got      the man to the yard

at the back        of the          stand and    carried him until             I could find somewhere

to    lie him down.            It was    near       to the L e p pings Ln entrance              in a si*

road,        1 laid the man down and began the                     procedure          for g iv i ri     ou th to

m out h .     I cleared h i s t h r oat and            1 o o s ened h is     clot h i n g »    I f e i.t for a

pulse and thought              I felt a slight          response.          I then gave         him a few

breaths       by m outh to m o u t h and then tried his                    pulse again.          i. could not

feel     a n y thing    so    I began    chest isassaq^/and m outh               to m outh      combined.           1

was about        to stop this when an off                duty staff          nurse     came    over    to rne,

She     had a re s u s i —aid        tube with her and she             put this        down his throat.

She     then did the          chest massage and          I squeezed the            bag a t t a c h e d to the

floor and e x a mined the man-                      After a short                 time      he said the man was

dead a nd there was                   nothing      else we            could do.          The      time at this          point

was 4.10       pm       (1610 hrs).,            I then stayed with                    the    body and        put all        of

his    property          into a plastic              bag.         I found a bank               slip      in his      pocket

and    on the       back       it said .T HOWARD.                     I have      been told since              the    incident

This       we    did,      and we           seized          literally              hundreds              of    cans      of     b eer    and       half

Liverpool             supporters             making             their       way      to      the     stadium,            obviously            the

worse       for       drink.

At    about        3.00      pm    ( 1 5 00       hrs),          there        were          j ust    a few         tail        enders,        making

As    we    got       clo se      to    t he G r o u n d              I became              aware        t ha t    the     familiar           faces

following             a uniform             in f r o n t         of me        th r o u g h a gate                 and    through a            crowd

of    supporters             who       were       making             comments           like,        " T h e r e ’s p e o p l e         dying       in

there",          and,      "It 's       all       your          fault".            I carried              on t h r o u g h a t u n n e l

into       the     stand,         into       what          I no w       know       to       be P e n s        3 a n d 4.

As    we     pushed          through          the       crowd,         one     could sense             the       p a ni c    and     fear       and

hate       from       the       fans.

As    I got       through             the     bulk^of          the       crowd,       there          was    a gap,          p o s s i b l y S to

3 feet        wide ,         from where             the       fans       were     standing            to w h e r e      there       was     a

l ong      pile       of     dead ^ m d         dying         bo d i e s .       There         was    a sma ll         gate     open       on

the     perimeter               f e n c i n g , and          I could          see P o l i c e        Officers          carrying

injured          and       obviously            dead         bodies       through          this       gate.           I assis,ted w i t h

the     removal            of    dead,        o r in m y           opinion,          dead,       people          t hro^gj’^ t h i s        gate.

At    this       t ime       there        seemed         to    be      too m a n y        people       trying          to    get     too    many

casualties             through            too      s m a ll    a gap.

I and       several             other        Officers          attempted             to    rip       the    fencing          down,     near

to    the     gate,         but       wa s    unsuccessful.                    I returned             to    the       pile    of    bodies.

At    this       t ime       I could          see       a man's          head;       his       body was          buried       under        quite

a few       other          bo d i e s ,      but    I could            see     his    e ye s     were       open and          his    mouth

I got       other          Officers           to    free       this       m a n ’s b o d y       for       me,    then with           the

help       of a n o t h e r        Officer,             I began          to    carry       t hi s    man        back    up    through           the

crowd.           At    this        sta ge,         as    I was         eatery i ng^- the         body,          a supporter           had       two

kicks       at me,          on m y        b ack     a n d arm? p e             was    blaming          me       for    everything           that

had     happened.                I had        decided          to/carry           t hi s       man    up t h r o u g h       the     crowd

see P o l i c e        Officers              e v e r y w h e r e , trying            to    give       First       Aid       (mouth     to

I placed          this          man    on     the/ground               and     the    Officer          who       h e l p e d me w e n t

back       in side.

I then        loosened             his       clothing          and       felt     for      a    pulse.           I began        giving

mouth       to m o u t h         recVg'citation                but       this     didn't         seem       to    be    doing       any

good.         I again            fel t       for    a    pulse.           I couldn't             feel       a    pulse,        so    I began

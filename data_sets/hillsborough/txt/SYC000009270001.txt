1 Modify this as necessary according to whether the

    applies, it is suggested that one of the following
    forms be adopted:
     C.D. died from natural causes.
                                                                           Re

     C.D. died from want of attention at birth.

     (In any of the above cases, but in no other, it is
     suggested that the following words may, where
     appropriate, be added:
     "and the cause of death was aggravated by lack of                     Cause of death

   b In any other case except murder, manslaughter,
     infanticide or stillbirth, it is suggested that one
     of the following forms be adopted:

      C.D. killed himself/herself (whilst the balance of
      his/her mind was disturbed).

      C.D. died as the result of an attempted/self­
      induced abortion.                                                    Verdict

      C.D. died as the result of an accident/misadventure.
      C.D. was killed lawfully.

     Open verdict, namely, the evidence did not fully or
     further disclose the means whereby the cause of death
     arose.
   c In the case of murder, manslaughter or infanticide
     it is suggested that the following form be adopted.

     C.D. was killed unlawfully.
   d In the case of a stillbirth insert 'stillbirth' and do not
     complete the remainder of the form.

Dear Sirs,

Re: RESUMED INQUESTS' 19th NOVEMBER 1990.


If you are not already aware, I intend to resume the Inquests into the deaths
of the 95 people who died at Hillsborough, one or more of whom you represent,
on the 19th of November 1990 at 10.a.m. Details of venue will be notified in
due course.

I do not have to remind you of the fact that a considerable amount of
evidence has already been taken, nor of the nature and limitations of a
coronal investigation which you will recollect is not adversarial but
inquisitorial in nature, and which of course has only limited objectives.

Subject to the Coroners’ Act 1988 and the Coroners' Rules, the Inquest is
under my control, and in particular, it is my responsibility to select the
witnesses who wish to give evidence.  I am at present engaged in considering
this and in determining who I wish to invite to attend.

Without prejudice in any way to my rights in the matter, I am writing to you
to give you an opportunity to draw to my attention the names and other
appropriate details of any witness or witnesses whom you would like me to
consider calling to give evidence at the resumed Inquests.

May I please ask you in considering whether you wish to draw any names to my
attention, to bear in mind the scope and limitations of an Inquest.

 I also want to make it absolutely clear that the submission of a name or
 names for consideration is nothing more than that, and that the decision as
 to who to call to give evidence is and remains a matter for me.

 I would be grateful if you could respond as soon as possible. If I have not
 heard from you by the end of September I will assume you have no names to
 oiihmi h .

             Sirs,

   Re:       SXGEDSAS          m rm          (deceased) H e .55 .
   As you are aware, the Inquest(s) arising out of the Hillsborough
   Disaster stand adjourned to a date to be fixed. Yon may also
   be aware that it had been in my mind to resume these Inquests
   on the 15th of January 1990.

   I have now been informed that the Director of Public Prosecutions
   has decided to have a criminal investigation undertaken on his
   behalf. In these circumstances, I have decided not: to resume the
   Inquest(s) on the date mentioned.

   I will review the matter further after the Director of Public
   Prosecutions has announced his decision as to what action (if any)
   he may wish to undertake.

   I am not in a position to say how long the Police Inquiry
   or the Director of Public Prosecutions consideration of the
   matter will take. I anticipate however that there will be
   a substantial period of time before I sun in a position to communicate
   on this matter further.
K

     would be grateful if you could please ensure that this information

 I' refer to your recent conversation with Superintendent
 Sleath concerning the release of the deceased persons from
 the Hillsborough incident to their respective next of kin,
 following the adjournment of the inquest.

 After consultation with Professor Usher, I have no objection
 to this course of action.

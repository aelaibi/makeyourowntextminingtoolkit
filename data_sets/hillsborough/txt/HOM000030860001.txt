   1. I would be grateful for copies of all statements and
   ‘recollections’ in the Hillsborough archive by PC 1618
   Sherwood.

   2. It would also be helpful if you could let us have copies
   of the original and amended (recollections’ o f the following
   officers, which Mr Ward and I examined when we visited
   you the other week. These are listed in (approximately)
   reverse order of their ‘R ’ numbers - which I regret we did
   not keep.

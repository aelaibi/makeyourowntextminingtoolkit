             CARDIFF ARMS PARK
             NATIONAL STADIUM




This Evacuation Plan for the above Ground has
been prepared to enable staff of the Union involved
in stewarding events taking place at the Ground to
respond in a professional,' effective and rapid manner
                                             *


This Evacuation Plan will form part of the.Emergency
Services overall evacuation plan for the Ground.


It would be impracticable to attempt to prepare for
every eventuality that would require emergency
action to be taken.

The more likely type of incident is:

      FIRE
      STRUCTURAL COLLAPSE
    . EXPLOSION ■
      SERIOUS PUBLIC DISORDER


This Plan will provide a basis of action, as
circumstances at the time of an incident will
dictate the overall action.


An incident may require complete or partial
evacuation of the Ground. The decision as to the
course of action to be taken will be made by the
senior Police Officer in command at the event
taking place.


When any incident occurs it will be necessary for
nominated stewards to take up key positions in
the Ground. [Separate instructions for each
position will be issued].
Other stewards will act in accordance with their
instructions for normal exit from the Ground.


The alerting of stewards of an incident will be by
public address system and personal radio.

It will be by way of a coded message and will
state:

      "MR. RUGBY IS IN T H E .....

It will advise all stewards that there.is a possible
incident and its location, and it advises the stewards
to take up, position.

                                            *

It may well be that the incident is resolved without
any further action, e.g. Hoax Bomb Call. Stewarding
staff will be stood down by the coded message:

   ■ ’’MR. RUGBY HAS LEFT THE STADIUM".


If PARTIAL evacuation is required, the message
given out will be:

      "THE WELSH RUGBY UNION REGRET THAT IN
      THE INTEREST OF PUBLIC SAFETY THE
      NORTH STAND AND NORTH ENCLOSURE HAS TO '
      BE CLEARED. WILL ALL SPECTATORS IN THIS
      AREA EVACUATE AS DIRECTED BY' STEWARDS
    - AND POLICE.


If COMPLETE evacuation is required, the message
given out will be:

      'THE WELSH RUGBY UNION REGRET THAT THIS
       EVENT CANNOT CONTINUE. PLEASE LEAVE
       THE STADIUM IN THE DIRECTION INDICATED
       BY STEWARDS AND POLICE".


In either PARTIAL or COMPLETE evacuation, the
event taking place will be stopped by the senior
Police Officer in command at the event.

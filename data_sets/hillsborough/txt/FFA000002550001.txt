     coaches were making and any hold-ups that may be occurring.

     There will be a charity collection outside the Stadium for

6.   Box Office

     Everton will be at the West end and Liverpool at the East end.

     Tickets for the Cup Final have a much higher security level than
     in previous years and will be far more difficult to forge.

     On Sunday, 14th May, Wembley will be doing a double check
     on the seat numbering to ensure that all seats are correctly
     numbered.

7.   Technical

     The Police indicated that they would be happy if the fence was
     down, assuming that Wembley were able to steward the area
     satis factorily.

                    stated that he was in favour of the fence being
     down whilst                     believed it should remain up.

     __________ asked for clarification with regard to the Policing
     of the perimeter area.     In subsequent discussions with the
     Police she was advised that they would be prepared to assist
     the Stewards in the perimeter area if there was a need.
                [advised that it was unlikely that The Football
     Association would agree to the fences being down unless there
     was a good police presence in the perimeter area with the
     Stewards the whole time not just to react to any problems
     that may occur.               Ihas had subsequent discussions
     with Wembley Stadium and there is to be a meeting between
     senior Wembley Officials and Senior Police Officials on
     Thursday, 11th May in order to clarify this point, before a
     final decision is made.

     Brent advised that they were awaiting a commissioning date
     regarding the Olympic Gallery.

8.   Media

     The B. B. C. will be covering the match with 17 camera positions.

     ___________ preferred to the need for two photographers to be
     by the Royal Box when the presentation of the Cup and Medals
     takes place in order to obtain good photographs.      This was
     noted by Wembley.

9.   Security

     There will be 1200 Personnel on duty in connection with
     security.

    All 100 turnstiles will be opened and would be manned
    efficiently.  There will be several people vetting those
    who are allowed to enter and there will be checks for forged
    tickets.

    There will be 100 Stewards on the Olympic Gallery.  There will
    be 80 Stewards on the perimeter pitch area to start with and
    as other Stewards are relieved from other duties they will also
    be placed in the perimeter area.

    Whilst the turnstiles will open at 1. 00 p. m. Wembley hope to
    be ready "to go" at 12. 15 p.m.

    Wembley have requested 300 police to be on duty.

    The Football Association confirmed that they wished to have
    radio communication for four F. A. Personnel. Wembley confirmed
    that this would be on Channel Four and that |      |      would
    be the link.

    Any other business

    There was a general discussion as to who had final
    responsibility for delaying kick-off.    It was agreed that
    whilst it was essential for the views of the Police, Wembley
    Stadium and The Football Association to be taken into account
    and for those Organisations to be kept fully informed at all
    times, the final announcement would have to come through the
    control room, in this instance through |          | |of the
    Wembley Staff.

of us walked to a dual                  carriageway        j.n Stoke and waited on the                    corner

next    to a roundabout               for    the supporters        club coach.            The   coach a r r i v e d

at about       11.20am and when we boarded                      it I sat       near to the back            of the

seat    next to                 All     of the seats were              taken but       no-one had         to

stand.        From here we went               to Hanley and        picked up the m a j o r i t y           of the

suppo rte r s .

E v e r y o n e a p p eared    to be happy at           this     time.        From Hanley we t r avelled

along    the Leek New Road and then headed for Bakewell.                                    We stopped on

the    road    in Bakewell            town    centre at about           1 .00pm.       Eve r y b o d y got      off

and the       four     of us    popped        into a local        pub.        By now the sun had               come

out and       it was      promising          to be a really nice              day.     I had one       pint      of

Th e k e s t o n e s Old Peculiar            beer.    My friend                      lad one    pint      of

lager.               had three         pints    of T h e k e s t o n e Old Peculiar         and                 had

nothing at all            to drink.           I think    he had an upset             stomach.       Use

returned to the             coach at         1 .30pm and      returned to our           original       seats.

We    left    the    town     centre almost           immediately and           then headed on to

Sheffield.           I do not         know the exact          route we took.            As we a p p r o a c h e d

Leek;    the    coach sounded as               if the    clutch was going,,              The    driver         was

taking       it quite       slowly and because ws thought we'd be late for                                 the

match,       we discussed        getting        off and going           by other means          to the match,

We decided to stay on the                     coach and as we a p p r o a c h e d S h e f f i e l d        the

traffic       situation was            becoming       quite     congested.           I would    think      that

this    was    due to the amount               of supporters           travelling       by road.

The driver          event u a l l y    parked the       coach near        to the m o r t u a r y    some two

and a half miles              from the ground.             We    got    off    the    coach and     ran

towards       the ^piouna,!           I w o uld think      it was about 2 . 3 0 pm by now.                     As we

were    running        towards        the ground                 noticed a sign directing                  people

to the       ground.        It w ould have           been difficult           for    us to have     got        lost

as e v erybody was walking                   in the    same direction.               As we were     jogging           up

betw e e n us and the N o t t i n g h a m supporters,

c u d n ’t see anybody           drinking      outside       the       pubs we       ran past.                Ihe rorest

The     tunnel         was angled downwards and                    I could see the                   pitch a head and as

I got       into       the stand        the       players were a c t u a l l y         playing./I                 looked at

the      next second            I realised          that more       people       stood behind me and                       the

because at that                    point         I was         still       heading     for the gate                 The    pressure

seeing an ambulance                          coming        onto       the    pitch and           people      carrying        boarding

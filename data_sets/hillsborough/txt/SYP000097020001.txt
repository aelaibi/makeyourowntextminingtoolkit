           Officers      was        introduced.               The    object     was    to       gather     and    develop

           information         to   assist        with    the       operational        p lanning        leading        up    to

INTRO D UC T I ON




  1.    On Friday 25 August            1989 I attended a meeting at Force Headquarters

        with    Chief    Superintendent            Broomhead.          Mr     B r oo mhead   outlined       to    me

        details     of   the   work    of    the    South       Yorkshire       Police    Team   established

        to   work    towards     the    i m pl ementation         of    the    r ecommendations        in    Lord

        Justice      Taylor's        Interim       Report       following        the     enquiry      into       the

        H il ls b o r o u g h Stad iu m disaster.




  2.    At   this    meet in g   I     was   i nstructed         to    revi ew      existing     arrangements

        within      South   Yorkshire        to    gather,       collate      and    disseminate      football

        related      intelligence.           The    review       was   to     take   account     of   national

        developments with a view to m aking recommendations.

        5.   This    netw or k        formed       the        basis   of    the     Football      Intelligence          system.
I
             The      m ac h inery           p r o v id e d     information           regarding           the        numbers     of

I            travelling              supporters         and     the   mode     of    transport       that       they    could    be

             e xpected          to    use.        The     system       was    consistent          wi th     the      strategy    of

I
             'containment              policing'         and       facilitated        arrangements           in      advance    for

             control by segregation and escort.

I       6.   Whilst       the    system p ro v ed             of    immense       value,     it   lacked pr e ci si o n         and

             uniformity.              R ec ognition of this fact led to a revie w during 1985.

I


        7.   The result was             a standardisation                  of the means           of communicating             such

             information.               At    this      stage       the    natienal        post m a t c h    s u m m a r y format

         summary      whilst        forwarding          a    copy        to    his    counterpart          in     the   force

         from where          the    away    team       has       travelled.           Over a pe riod of time                 the

         intention being that each Football                              Liaison Officer would b uild up a

         comprehensive             picture       of    events          during    pr ec ed i ng      seasons       including

         the be h aviour of fans both at home and away.




  10.    There      began     to    emerge,       however,             a pattern       of    travelling supporters

         m a king     private         arrangements                obviously           intended        to     escape          the

         national information network.                           The contingent of supporters involved

         in   such arrangements                 has   always        included those            individuals          or gangs

         likely to cause p r o b l e m s .




 11.     As   expertise        in    this       area    of       'intelligence'             gathering      increased          it

         became      clear         that     the       blanket          term     'Football        Intelligence'               was

         misleading.                 Experience              no w           dictated         that        two       distinct

         classifications had emerged,                            (1) M AT C H INFORMATION and (2) FOOTBALL

         INTELLIGENCE.




M a t c h Info rm a ti o n

 12.     M a tc h   information           had    formed          the    basis    of    the    net wo rk      of    Football^J^

         L iaison     Officers.             Whilst          it    remains        essential,         it     is     concerned

         almost      exclusively           with       numbers          of     travelling       fans,       routes       to    be

         followed,         coach     firms       to    be    used        etc.        This     information          n ormally

         comes      from     official        sources         such       as    football       clubs     and      supporters

         clubs.       Generally           speaking,          therefore,          such       information           refers      to

         genuine football fans.

 13•   It    was   r ec o gn is ed         that        in real       terms        intelligence            should      relate     to

       the    identification,                   associations,            habits          and      actual    plans       of    those

       involved in footb al l- re l at ed hooliganism.                                      Patterns were emerging of

       arrangements             to    ambush          rival       fans      in    transit         away     from    the       ground

       and    specific          plans           to    avoid     police           operations         to     deal    with       these

       problems.           It    was       apparent           that     many        h ooligan        gangs      were     becoming

       well or ga n is ed and operating plann e d strategies,                                       not always directly

       r elated to football f i x t u r e s .




 14.   Whilst the Football Liaison Officer n e tw or k is effective,                                                  the system

       has    limitations             and        is     not     capable           of    dealing      with        this    type    of

       intelligence.                 In    the       event     of    any      such       intelligence           coming       to the

       attention         of     a Football              Liaison Officer,                    the   limited netwo r k           which

       existed      r es tr i ct ed         the        manner       in      which        the      intelligence          could    be

       used.




 15.   This has led to recent r ec om mendations by ACPO intended to fill this

       vacuum.           Central           to    this        area     was     a re co mm e nd at i on          that     for    each

       Football          League           .Club        there        should          be       established          a     Footbal^^

       Intelligence             Officer              who     should       seek         to    develop       a     portfolio       of

       intelligence             in        the        terms    m e n t i on ed      at       pa ra graph     13    above.         Of

       necessity          this        concept              calls      for     a        different         strategy        to    that

      United          supporters           and      in     pa r ti cu l ar       members           of     the       'Barmy       Army'.

      This       officer         is      now        well        known       to      the        regul a r         supporters            of

      He    is    assisted         in his         intelligence              gathering              role    by       two    community

      constables and together they have built up a comprehensive knowledge

      of     the        h ooligan          element            attaching           itself           to     S he ffield            Unit ed

      Football Club.               Throu gh           the      efforts       of these           officers            an impressive

      index       of     photographs             and       intelligence             regarding             the       hard        core   of

      troublesome supporters at Bramall Lane has been established.




63.   From my enquiries                  at    'D ’ Division            it is obvious                   that    the commitment

      and    enthusi a sm          of      the      officers          involved           in     intelligence               gathering

      produces specific intelligence which is invaluable to those directly

      concerned          with      the     advance            planning       and        deployment             of    resources         on

      m a t ch days.           It is also obvious                    from the feed back from other forces

      that       the    involvement            of these             officers       is invaluable when Sheffield

      United          supporters           travel           away.           On     such        occasions            the        officers

      ensure          that   their presence                 is known         to     the        travelling            fans       as soon

      as     they       arrive        at      their         destination             and        I    under st a nd          that        t^^

      deterrent          iffeet         that      this         knowledge          has     is       well    worth          the    effort

      and    expense         involved            in      the      exercise.          They          are    regularly             able   to

      has also existed long term in                        1F ’ Division the practice of using the

      operate     at       Headquarters                    within        Operations            Division.            The     current

      required        to       pursue           the    strategies              now     advocated        by    ACPO.         This       is

      then     I have          great        difficulty             in formulating               an    argument        to    support

      commitment           of    this           force       towards        the       strategy        advocated        by ACPO          by

             patently       obvious             that    there          is     room       for     improvement            in     the    content

             ill ustrated by reference                           to the post match                   summary        following          the FA

             Cup Semi Final during 1987 between Leeds U n it ed and Coventry City at

             Hillsborough.                 At    that        fixture          it     was       ne c essary         to   delay        the   kick

             off    by     15     minutes          because              thousands           of       fans     had       failed       to    gain

             access       to    the        ground       by       the    time       of      the       scheduled          kick    off.        The

             fact    that       the     kick      off was              delayed       and        the reasons             leading       to thg^fc

Debriefing

112.   Conside r at io n           of     the       mechanics           of       debri ef i ng        following             football-

       related          operations            are    closely        allied          to    the    subsequent             content       of

       the    post m at c h          summary         d is c ussed        above.           If    future       fixtures          are to

       be    policed          successfully            it     is    absolutely             crucial          that        no    shred    of

       information              or       intelligence               which          m ay        influence           p lanning          is

       overlooked.              There         is,     therefore,             a     requirement             for    a     formal       and

       u n i f o rm system of debriefing fully u nd er s t o o d by all personnel.                                                   The

       police       different            football          grounds       dictates              that    the       same       system    of

       d ebriefing should be employed at all g r o u n d s .




113•   C u r r e n t l y , as      with other          arrangements                discussed within                this r e p o r t ,

       each     Divisional              has    slightly           different          arrangements.                 'C ' Division

       is    the    only      Division          where       all      staff         involved       in       the operation             are

       formally          para de d       after         the        game and         personally              d e briefed         by the

       M atch Commander.                 There are good reasons why such a formal system of

124,      In     Part        I        of     this       report        recent           national       developments            are

          summarised.                 R e co g n i t i o n    of     the    requirement         to    concentrate         upon

          intelligence in real terms led to the ACPO r e c ommendation that an

          Intelligence                Offi ce r        be    appointed        for       each    league     club.         In    an

          effort        to        give        some      coherence            to    intelligence          gathering            and

          because by its very nature intelligence of this kind needs a wide^

          p u r v i e w , ACPO have               successfully presented the case for a National

          Unit.




125.      Superi n te n d en t              Stuart,          in    his      previous        posting      in     O perations

          D i v i s i o n , was            well    a cquainted           with      national       developments.               His

          report     at Appendix                  'K'       illustrates         his enthus ia s m        to ensure        that

          South Y o rkshire Police kept pace with national strategies to deal

       w it h        f ootba ll - re l a te d                     intelligence.                 U n f or t un a te l y        the

          recommendations                   made       by Mr Stuart          to standardise            procedures         were

       not f o rmally adopted and imposed despite                                         the fact that D i v i s i o n s ^

          Commanders             had        viewed      the        report     favourably.             Co n se quently         the

          idea     that          Divisional             Intelligence              Sergeants       should       fulfil         the

          role     of        Divisional                 Football           Intelligence           Off icers        did        not

       materialise.                           There           is       no         doubt        that      the       existing

          r es ponsibilities                     and        commitments           of      Divisional        Intelligence

          Sergeants limit the scope for concent r at i on upon football- re l a te d

          intelligence.                    The same argument applies to the post of detective

        requirements are satisfied.




131 -   As far as terms of reference are concerned due note wo u ld ne e d to

        be taken of the experience of those officers within the Force who

        already       have       experience            of     football       intelligence                 gathering            to

        ensure    that       best       practice           was    adopted.         This          could     perhaps           best

        be    achieved       through         the      establishment          of        a small          working        party.

        There    would also be a requirement                             to train officers                 appointed           to_

        Su pe rintendent Stuart I would suggest that this training could be

        conducted        in-Force             by       repeating           the      arrangements                that          are

        outl i n ed    in    his       report         at    A p pendix      'K' .        That         training          course

        expresses        the       view       that      in       his    experience           the        availability           of

        f oo t ball-related             intelligence               is     critical            to        the     successful

        planning        for           the    policing             of     football.                 He     outlines            the

I #   134.   Mr    Purdy         also       expresses          the       view     that        the       importance          of    this

             subject        is such that             it is his                belief       that football             intelligence


I            should form part of the present Modular T raining package                                                     and that

             by      such    means          we    should       encourage              p r ob a t io n er      constables,          from

             intelligence.                  I endorse          that v i ew wh o le h ea r t ed l y              and also agree

             that e xp erienced officers in the football intelligence field such

             as DS C h a rl e sw o r th            and        DC Ship h am        should be              included within the

I
      135-   Mr    Purdy         is    right       when       he    states        that       in        the    immediate      future

       result        of     that       experiment,             however,       was         questionable           as   t^Jj

       images were of limited quality and because                                    there are considerable

Fol lowing a m e e t i n g w i t h A/ACC(Op erati ons) re. the above, set out belo w
under separate headings, are the residual m a t t e r s for action as necessary:-



1.   THE CLUBS

a.   Alt era t i o n s to W r i t t e n Agreements

There have been a number of these to date and c l e arly there wil l be more.

W e need to ensure that the master copies (originals) of the w r i t t e n agreements
(filed in the DCC's office) together w i t h an a dditi onal copy filed in R e g ist ry
are kept current at all times.

Additionally, A / ACC (Opera tions ) w i l l p r e p are a c hronological list of the
changes w h i c h have occurred to date, a co py of w h i c h w i l l be pa ssed to
Mrs L e a h to be placed w i t h the DCC's w o r k i n g papers.

To ensure this occurs over the years to come this will - once the
Imp lemen tation T e a m is stood down - become the responsibi lity of Chief
Superi ntend ent (Operations & Traffic) and he w i l l m a i nt ain the o r i g inal papers
and the list referred to above.       Whilst the Impl ementa tion T e a m continues the
nec essary action will be taken by A / A C C ( O p e r a t i o n s ) .



b.   Sheffield W e d n e s d a y FC - N o r t h W e s t T e r r a c e

Evi dence has been obt ained (via police video footage) w h i c h indicates that
w h e n the agreed capacity (local authority figure) was reached at a ma tch
played recently at H i l l s b o r o u g h the above area w a s clearly overcrowded.

Enq uiries reveal that the calculations r e g a r ding capacity based on plans
supplied to the local au thority by the e n g i neers - Eastwoods & Partne rs - were
of the w r o n g scale.

Urgent action is needed to determine if similar mista kes have been made in
r e l at ion to other standing areas of the g r ound and for the capaci ty of the
N o r t h West terrace to be reduced as part of the Ground Safety Certif i c a t e
agreement wit hout delay.

A/ACC(Op erati ons) is to attend a meeting this date (27.11.89) w i t h Sheffield
C i t y C o u n c i l after w h i c h he will prepare a 'Note for File' describ ing
the full extent of the p r oble m and what m e a s u r e s are intended - co py to be
passed to Mrs L e a h for filing w i t h the DCC's w o r k i n g papers.



c.    W r i t t e n Ag reeme nts - Plans of N u m b e r s in Standing Areas

If these have not been obtained from all the C l u b s by the end of N o v e m b e r we
w i l l w r i t e and ask for same. A / A C C ( O p e r a t i o n s ) to action.
d.    C l a w Back

Experience has shown that strict a p p l i c a t i o n of the H i l l s b o r o u g h
recomm endati ons has created an u n n e c e s s a r i l y high police p rese n c e at some
grounds and as a result A / A C C ( O pera tions) is re viewing all the grounds w i t h a
v i e w to making reductions as ne ces s a r y so that the police input is adequate,
sensible and justifiable.

So that these changes can be plotted h i s t o r i c a l l y A/ACC ( O p e r a t i o n s ) will
prepare a list in the form of an index of wha t he has achieved so far
attaching the relevant reports b e t w e e n D i v i s i o n and himself as appendices and
provide a copy of this to Mrs Leah for i n c l usion in the DCC's w o rkin g papers.



e.    Stewards - Briefing and D ebri efing

This is done d i ffere ntly across the F orce but it has been agreed by the
Implem entati on Tea m that there is not a nywhere we do not achieve a reasonable
m i n i m u m standard.  However as this m a y be referred to in Lord Justi ce Taylor's
Final Report no changes w i l l be made until that time w h e n the matter wil l be
re-considered.        Supt B e t ti son to raise as agenda ite m at m e e t i n g following
p ublication of Lord Justice Taylor's Final Report.



f.    Meetings w i t h D i r e c t o r s/Secr etarie s

For the time being these will be m a i n t a i n e d at the rate of two meetings
annually.

A /AC C(Operations) is to consider w h e n the next m e eti ng is to be held and make
arrangements accordingly - DCC w i l l attend on this occasion.



g.    Bar nsley - Coun ting of Spectator A d m i s s i o n to Standing Areas

W e have made direct r eference to this in a recent letter to Barnsley MBC and
the Club.   The lack of counting and the attitude of officials at Barnsley
is a significant problem.    W e must keep pressure on those con cerned to
improve arrangements as necessary.

F ollowing our official report to B a r n s l e y re. the above, considerable press
interest was shown.   A/ACC( Operat ions) to obtain a copy of the press cuttings
and pass these to Mrs L e a h for i n c l us ion in the DCC's w o r k i n g papers.



2.    THE LOCAL AUTHORITIES

a.    Reports re. O utsta nding Matters

The purpose of submitting reports to the local authorities concerning what
we perceive to be outstanding m a t ters apropos Lord Justic e Taylor's
rec ommendations is so that the relev ant committees can hold urgent and
ext raordinary meetings to address the p roblems identified.

The DCC wou ld like to know preci sely w h a t the reaction has been and
A/ACC(Opera tions ) is to call for repor ts on this specific issue.
b.    Sheffield Intransigence

Sheffield C i t y C o u n c i l are requiring i n forma tion to a greater extent than the
other local authorities.           A /ACC(Operations) is d e a l i n g w i t h this and rec ently
attended a m e eti ng at the Tow n Hall to discuss these issues.                 He is to prepare
a po sition statement in the form of a 'Note for File' a copy of w h i c h is to be
passed to Mrs L e a h for in clusio n in the DCC's w o r k i n g papers.

Sergeant M ilne r    (Assistant Staff Officer)         is p r e p a r i n g a separate report
regarding this.



3.    GENERAL

a.    Major Incident Pla n

Following a r e v i e w the P l a n needs to be c a r e f u l l y consi d e r e d w i t h regard to
any changes needed.       A/ACC( Operat ions) to arr ange please.



b.    Charges

Following our last sub mis s i o n to the Police A u t h o r i t y on police action post
Hillsborough, it w as r e s olved that the Chief C o n s t a b l e together w i t h the local
authority w ill r e v i e w the charging arrangements.

It is appr opriat e that the Secretariat do this w i t h our assistance.                    This
subject has been discu s s e d at recent meetings of the ACPO Sub-Com mittee on
H o o l i g a n i s m at Sporti ng Events and A/A CC( O p e r a t i o n s ) will prepare relevant
abstracts of the minutes of those meetings to be used as a discus sion paper as
appropriate.

The C h a i r m a n of that C o m m i t t e e (Mr And erton - G r e a t e r Manches ter Police) has
recently spoken to Lo rd Justice Taylor on this v e r y topic and
A /AC C(Operations) w i l l make efforts to d e t e r mine the outcome of that
discussion.

As part of ACPO's r evie w of police charges, A/ ACC( O p e r a t i o n s ) has collated the
position reg ion a l l y and a copy of these findings w i l l be passed to Mrs Le ah
for in clusion in the DCC's work ing papers.

For the time being Supt Hale and Chief Insp D o n n e l l y w i l l continue to consider
a new m e c h a n i s m for c h a rg ing based on a standing charge and sliding scale as
has p re vious ly been discussed.           A/ACC(Operat ions) to progress please.



c.    Mo del Order

Before finalising, the DCC would like to meet w i t h A/ ACC(Operations) and Supt
Simpson to talk throug h in some detail a s p e cime n o rder for an actual match.
A/ACC(Opera tions )     to arran ge please.



d.     T raining

The procedures we are dev el o p i n g to assist w i t h the training of police
officers and stewards needs to be reviewed and c o m p le ted without further
delay.  The T r a i n i n g Departmen t will prepare a p o s i t i o n paper regarding
                                                          -   k   -




progress to date and o u t s t a n d i n g m a tter s for further consideration.
A/ACC(Ope ration s)        to actio n please.



e.    Contrac ts

There is a p r oblem emerging w i t h the p otential fusion of the co ntract
concer ning charging arra ngeme nts and our w r i t t e n agreement. Th is concerns
insurance cover and is being pursued by Miss Oades.



f.    Standing Instructions

The se are being reviewed and u p - da ted by Superintendent G r e e n w o o d on an o n ­

In r esponse to a request by Sheffield C i t y C o u ncil (Legal & A d m i n Department),
the Chief Fire Officer, Mr H E Wright, gave the views of the Fire Service to
the r evie w of the C o u n cil 's admin istrat i v e / i n s p e c t i o n system in relatio n to
the S afety of Sports Grounds Act 1975.

In his response dated 3.8.89 Mr Wr ight e mphasised similar areas of conc ern has
had been expressed by the police in their deliberatio ns on the same subject.

He stressed that as a m atte r of u r g ency the H i l l s b o r o u g h safety certificate
should be replaced and one for the Bramall Lane should be issued.                  This in
fact occurred eight days after Mr W r i g h t ' s letter but he did stress the same
opinion as South Y o r k s hire Police had.

Mr W right further stressed the need to continue the multi - d i s c i p l i n e d w o r king
party and a r equirement for Sh effield C i t y C o unci l to become mo re involved in
the safety certi ficate procedure.   This also was stressed by the police during
the initial stages following the transfer of respons ibili ties to Sheffield
Ci t y Council.

Mr W right also reached the similar conclus ion as the police did that Sheffield
C i t y C o uncil w e r e reluctant to accept the full respo n s i b i l i t y of being the
licensing au thori ty and organi sing and dir ecting the safety certificate
negotia ting procedure.         He informed the C o uncil as did the police in their
letter dated 12.8.87 that they should accept the full r e s p o nsi bility bestowed
on the licensing authority and not seek to delegate this resp on s i b i l i t y to the
member s of the work ing party.        It was also stated that full and accurate
minute s of all m e e ti ngs held should be recorded and mainta i n e d by the Council.

SAFETY OF SPORTS GROUNDS ACT 1975
REVIEW OF THE ADMINISTRATIVE/INSPECTION SYSTEM

Thank you for your letter of 25th July, 1989, inviting my comments upon                    the
above mentioned review which you are undertaking as a result of                            the
Hillsborough Inquiry.

Since you invite comment on matters other than those you have listed,              I     take
this opportunity of giving my thoughts on other aspects.

The comments are in three parts as follows

      My thoughts on how the City Council might proceed.
(ii)  The legal position regarding consultation, acceptance of advice and
      enforcement.
(iii) Comments on the headings contained in the letter.

1.     How the Council Might Proceed

1.1     I consider that urgent priority needs to be given to the replacement of
       the Sheffield Wednesday certificate and the issue of General Safety
       Certificates in respect of Bramall Lane and Owlerton Sports Grounds.

1.2     To achieve the above objective I recommend that the multi-disciplined
       safety team approach which has always been used should be retained.    I
       am of the opinion however that the City Council will have to become more
       actively involved in the process than it has in the past.

1.3    Manpower resources will be needed to enable the city Council to co­
       ordinate the inspections and advice of the Advisory Group, evidence at
       the Inquiry suggested that the officer concerned was overburdened.     In
       ”»y view your officers must arrange and Chair meetings and produce prompt
       and accurate minutes for circulation; correspond directly with the clubs
                                 _ 1 _
to obtain plans and information pursuant to the issue of certificates;
generally act as the catalyst to ensure that General Safety Certificates
are issued as soon as possible and that clubs get on with any
outstanding work is required to inform the Council when      it has been
completed so that arrangements can be made for the safety team to
inspect.

I would emphasise that the City Council is not entitled to take the view
that it is for the Fire Service rather than the Council to pursue the
clubs to ensure that work is completed. As you may know      it has been
necessary in the past for the Fire Service to ask the Council to remind
clubs of the need for action. The Fire Service has limited manpower
resources at its disposal and, in addition to its main statutory
responsibility, for issuing fire certificates under the Fire Precautions
Act 1971, it also gives advice to the council on means       ofescape and
fire precautions in literally hundreds of premises for which the City
Council is the responsible licensing Authority.

I am of the opinion that all three designated grounds and in particular
Sheffield Wednesday should be comprehensively surveyed by the individual
members of the Advisory Group. This is emphasised by the views on the
apparent low level of maintenance of grounds noted by the Building
Surveyor and Health & Consumer Services. Each department should act in
unison in this respect rather than separately. The Green Guide and the
interim recommendations of Lord Justice Taylor should form the basis of
the standard to be achieved and in this connection the City Council will
need to consider and make known its policy as regaxds the use of
professional judgement in cases where provisions within sports grounds
fall below that of the Green Guide. I say this in the light of the
attitude which was apparent from some quarters during the Hillsborough
Inquiry that the Green Guide should be applied without flexibility. I
would emphasise that I will always require my officers to apply their
professional judgement in applying any code of guidance.

At the same time the many recommendations stemming from the extremely
comprehensive safety audits carried out by the Council's Health and
Consumer Services Department, many of which cut across the expertise of
other disciplines will need to be actively considered except for those
aspects which are required to be implemented before the commencement of
the football season. I note one recommendation for the restriction of
use of two sections of the Spion Kop at Hillsborough which you will need
to decide upon before the new season. Has a similar report been done on
Owlerton?

A copy of the report of each discipline should be sent by the City
Council to each other discipline after which the City Council should
Chair a meeting to enable problems to be discussed so that an accepted
approach might be determined by the City Council and consolidated into a
single report of requirements which should be forwarded to the clubs or
included as requirement conditions in the General Safety Certificates
when they are issued. In my opinion this method of working is necessary
in the case of all new applications and where alterations and extensions
are made to certificated grounds. The City Council must arrange the
meetings not put the onus on individual disciplines to ask for a meeting
as it has previously done.

It is my view that the necessary comprehensive surveys could not be
undertaken satisfactorily without accurate and detailed drawings of all
parts of the grounds. Duplicate sets of drawings should be obtained for
all disciplines so that one set can be marked up and sent to the City
Council and one be retained on file for record purposes. As a minimum
the following drawings are needed:-
                         -   2   -
(i)   A site plan showing the ground and its surroundings at a    scale   of
      1:500

(ii) A plan view of the ground showing entrances, exits, gates, stands,
     terraces etc at a scale of 1:200

(iii)Drawings of each stand, terrace, building within the ground and the
     use of rooms - including areas beneath stands at a scale of 1:100.

(iv) Drawings of emergency lighting and      fire   alarm   and   detection
     equipment and public address system.

I also take the view that the plans which have been supplied on behalf
of Sheffield Wednesday and Sheffield United by Eastwood and Partners
have often contained insufficient detail.      Often for example    such
details as entrances and exits or their widths, perimeter fences and
gates or their widths, the area and rake of terraces, the location of
emergency lighting, and fire warning and fire equipment cure not shown.
I am of the opinion that much more detail needs to beshown on        the
drawings forming part of General Safety Certificates as is the case with
fire certificates issued under the Fire Precautions Act 1971. This will
facilitate   the   re-inspection   of   the   sports   grounds and the
identification of any unauthorised alterations which might have been
made.

Following receipt of drawings I suggest that the City Council calls a
meeting of the Advisory Group to agree on common identification
procedures.   In order that each discipline is able to identify parts of
grounds in a uniform manner, I suggest that stands and terraces      are
clearly identified, exit routes, passages, gateways, doors etc. numbered
in a consecutive manner and stairways lettered.   At the same time a
suitable deadline for submission of survey reports by each discipline to
the City Council should be agreed after which the procedure outlined in
1.7 above would operate preparatory to the issue/replacement of a
General Safety Certificate to each ground.

The Legal Position

I have included this part in order to outline my understanding of the
legal position and to indicate a number of aspects about which I think a
clear understanding is necessary.

As I see it the powers, duties and functions of the City Council     are
clearly set out     in the 1975 Act.    The Advisory Group (safety team)
approach is not     covered in the Act although      it   is   obviously
advant ageou s.

The Council is required to send a copy of any application for a safety
Certificate or a transfer of a safety certificate to the Fire Authority.
In the case of an application for a Safety Certificate, the council is
required to consult the Fire Authority about the terms and conditions to
be included in the certificate.       This requirement to consult also
applies to    any proposal to amend,     replace or transfer a safety
certificate.

To consult means to seek information or advice from; to take into
consideration. It imposes no requirement on the City Council to accept
the advice    of the Fire Authority.For example, the Council may
sometimes have to balance the merits of conflicting advice and make a
judgement which it considers will provide for the reasonable safety of
spectators. This is the reason why I regard my recommendations at 1.2
                         - 3 -
       and 1.7 to be extremely important. Ultimately the City Council sets the
       standards having first considered professional advice it has received.

       The Council is also required to give notice in writing to the Fire
       Authority as an interested party of its decision to issue, replace or
       amend a Safety Certificate or to refuse to amend or replace a Safety
       Certificate.   As an interested party the Fire Authority has a right of
       appeal which could be used for example where the Fire Authority did not
       agree with the standard set by the City Council perhaps as a result of
       its judgment of the merits of conflicting advice as mentioned in 2.4
       above.

2.6    Once the Council determines that, in its opinion, an applicant is a
       qualified person, it is then under a duty to issue a General Safety
       Certificate.   It has no power to withhold the issue of a Safety
       Certificate pending the carrying out of alterations or additions to the
       sports ground.    However, the terms and conditions within the Safety
       Certificate may be such as to involve alterations or additions being
       made at a sports ground. Pending the satisfactory completion of such
       works, the crowd capacity of the ground or parts can for example be
       limited or the use of a stand or a terrace entirely prohibited etc. By
       this means the General Safety Certificate becomes an instrument of
       continuing control.

2.7    In issuing a Safety Certificate the City Council has power to require an
       applicant to provide them within such time as they specify with such
       information and such plans as they consider necessary to enable them to
       determine the terms and conditions which ought to be included in any
       certificate issued in response to his application.         It would seem
       therefore that although once having determined an applicant to be a
       qualified person a Safety Certificate must be issued, the Act recognises
       that this is not possible if the necessary plans and information are not
       furnished within a reasonable time. The Council has power to extend the
       time allowed after which the application is deemed to have been
       withdrawn and an offence is committed if the sports ground is then used.

2.8    If while a General Safety Certificate is in force it is proposed to
       alter or extend the sports ground or any of its installations in a way
       which is likely to affect the safety of persons, the holder is required
       to give notice to the City Council.   Notice is particularly required
       when it is proposed to alter the entrances to or exits from the sports
       ground or any part of it (including any means of escape in case of fire
       or other emergency) or the means of access to any such entrances or
       exits.   Since such changes would necessitate the replacement        or
       amendment of the General Safety Certificate the City Council would be
       required to consult the Fire Authority as set out in 2.3 above.

2.9    The Fire Authority have powers of entry and inspection of sports grounds
       under Section 11 of the 1975 Act and has authorised its officers
       accordingly.

2.10   I feel that the Council should inform the disciplines in the Advisory
       Group what its policy is as regards enforcement of the Act particularly
       as regards the use of prohibition/restriction powers under section 10 of
       the 1975 Act and as regards contravention of Safety Certificate
       conditions. Is there a procedure and standard form in being for
       implementing   Section   10?   In what form would the Council wish
       information to be passed to it where contraventions          of   Safety
       Certificate   conditions are found by fire officers at a "during
       performance" inspection? Do you have your officers on call and would
       you want them to be called to the grounds? If so, details need to be
       supplied of names and telephone numbers.
                                - 4 -
2.11   My view is that any legal proceedings for contravention of Safety
       Certificate conditions is the responsibility of the City Council. It
       has in the past been suggested that the Fire Service could institute
       legal proceedings regarding matters within its expertise regarding
       contravention of Safety Certificate conditions in view of its powers of
       entry and inspection under Section 11 or the 1975 Act. As indicated
       above, this is not a view to which I subscribe but I would be grateful
       for your view on the matter for the purposes of clarification.

2.12   As you know, Section 10 of the Fire Precautions Act 1971 is broadly
       similar to Section 10 of the 1975 Act. As such it can be applied by the
       Fire Authority to structures within sports grounds as regards fire risk.
       I do not envisage a situation arising where it would be appropriate to
       use the power since I regard the power under the 1975 Act to be the
       primary controlling legislation. Should a fire risk which merits the use
       of Section 10 powers come to the notice of the Fire Authority it will be
       my policy to consult the City Council with a view to it using        its
       Section 10 powers.       Only in the case of a dispute where the Fire
       Authority considereda Section 10 notice should be served and the City
       Council did not, would the Fire Authority use its powers under Section
       10 of the 1971 Act.

       I stress that this is very unlikely to occur since any use would be a
       last resort, after consultations with the ground operator had failed to
       secure a reasonable standard of safety. I would be grateful for your
       comments regarding agreement or otherwise with this position so that any
       differences might be sorted out.

2.13   Under Section 10B, the City Council is required to enforce the 1975 Act
       and arrange for annual inspections of designated grounds in accordance
       with guidance issued by the Secretary of State under cover of Home
       Office Circular 72/1987.

3.     Commenta on Content of Letter

3.1    In addition to giving advice to the City Council the Fire Authority
       advises Rotherham, Barnsley and Doncaster Councils.   Under the former
       South Yorkshire County Council there was a common Safety Certificate.
       This was convenient because a fire officer (or a police officer) being
       county based knew that certificate conditions were identical. Under the
       District Councils there are now four different sets of conditions which
       is in my view confusing and unnecessary. I recommend that liaison takes
       place between the District Councils to produce a common standard.

       Communications

       I think my comments in part one indicate          my   views   regarding
       communication between the City Council and the members of the Advisory
       Group. It will obviously be necessary for there to be extensive
       consultation with clubs when dealing with applications for safety
       certificates, extensions or alterations to grounds and statutory and
       other inspections.    In this respect I refer to paragraph 4 of Annexe C
       to Home Office Circular 7/1986. A firm but friendly and helpful approach
       should be adopted when dealing with the clubs. You mention that Council
       members may wish to have a more prominent role in relation to the system
       although you do not state what that involvement might be. So far as the
       carrying out of inspections is concerned I feel that the Council should
       receive its advice from the professional members of the Advisory Group.
       Clearly, however, it is for the Council members to determine any
       involvement they consider appropriate. My only note of caution would be

                                - 5 -
to avoid any lengthening of the process leading to the issue   of   Safety
Certificates.

Role of each Member of the Advisory Group

I think that the group needs to meet to discuss this aspect in detail
taking into account any recommendations in Lord Justice Taylor's interim
report.   The comments of each discipline would have to be restricted to
those aspects for which they have expertise. The objective has to be to
ensure that no aspects are missed. Simply put, I perceive the role of
the Fire Service as giving advice on means of escape and fire
precautions in their broadest sense and ground capacity based on the
capacity of exits only. There are many areas of overlap particularly
between the Fire Officer and the Building Control Officer.           The
objective of designating a primary authority for certain aspects adopted
by the South Yorkshire County Council and in amended form by the City
Council is sound and both should be used as a basis for any review.

Review of Council's Approach to the Clubs

I am in general agreement with your comments although I will want to
discuss with you the exact method you propose and I would draw your
attention to my comments in Part 1 regarding surveys and the provisions
of plans etc.     It should be emphasised to all members of the Advisory
Group that they must not deal direct with clubs on matters covered by
the Safety of Sports Grounds Act 1975 because of the danger that the
clubs will make alterations which may affect the safety of spectators
without the knowledge of the City Council or the other members of the
Advisory Group. All correspondence with the clubs on Safety of Sports
Grounds matters must be via the City Council.

Another problem which I feel needs addressing with the clubs is the
tendency for a sudden rush of proposals usually in July when time is
short and they want the work done before the start of the new season.
Because of the timing, key officers are often on holiday.     Often the
alterations could have been submitted for approval long before the end
of the playing season so that work could commence immediately after the
end of the playing season.

Inspections and Enforcement of Certificate Conditions

So far as inspection prior to the issue of a general Safety Certificate
or in the case of extension or alteration of a certificated sports
ground is concerned. I refer to my comments in Part 1. As to a rolling
programme of inspections I refer to my comment at 1.5.

I feel that inspections carried out under Section 10B of the 1975 Act
should be in accordance with the statutory guidance and also the
supplementary but non statutory guidance given in Home Office Circular
72/1987.   Where there is no outstanding work to be done an annual
inspection should suffice but where work is outstanding or general
housekeeping and maintenance give cause for concern inspections should
be carried out more frequently. During performance inspection should be
carried out on an ad hoc basis, the frequency being determined according
to the standard of compliance found. Normally a DP inspection should be
carried out in the early part of a season. There may be advantage in
having the odd joint DP inspection, although I don't consider that
should be more than once per season, perhaps the first early season
inspection. The police should normally be notified in advance when a DP
inspection is to be made and any comments forwarded to the City Council.
So far as enforcement is concerned, I would refer you to my comments in
Paragraphs 2.10, 2.11 and 2.12. A standard inspection form similar to
                         -   6   -
      that attached to HOC 72/1987     would   be   invaluable   for   carrying   out
      section 10B inspections.

      Role of Advisory Group and Its Administration

      I believe that the role of the Advisory Group has to be limited to
      giving professional advice within its area of expertise to the City
      Council to assist it to carry out its enforcement function. The City
      Council is ultimately responsibility for setting the required standard
      hopefully on the basis of agreed common advice from the Advisory Group.
      I do not believe that the notes (minutes) of meetings have been adequate
      in the past (often non were done). To maintain the impetus of such a
      diverse group needs active central administration and co-ordination.
      Hence my comments in Paragraphs 1.2 and 1.3. Properly devised forms
      could be of very great benefit. Obviously their objective and content
      would need careful consideration.      The notes or minutes of meetings
      whatever they are called should seek to record what was agreed or
      decided so that the progress made is identified. The whole objective
      being to ensure any differences are ironed out and a consolidated view
      reached.

^     Safety Certificate Conditions

      There are a number of the conditions which I would like to discuss with
      Mr Bownes. Although I have not had time to give detailed consideration
      to them as yet. What I have mainly in mind is what detail should be
      recorded on the Safety Certificate plans. See Paragraph 1.9

I hope you find the contents of this letter both helpful and constructive and
I look forward to your response.        I look forward also to receiving the
comments of the other members of the Advisory Group which you stated in your
letter you would circulate.

ACO Seaman is on annual leave between 4th and 21st August and recognising that
the interim report will shortly be issued, I would ask that you contact my
Senior Fire Prevention Officer, Divisional Officer Hildreth or in his absence
either Divisional Officer Binnington or Temporary Divisional Officer Ryder.

    Perhaps during performance" inspections could be arranged so that each
    Authority carries out such inspections independently with a degree of central
    co-ordination to prevent two inspections taking place simultaneously. As the
    first step towards the development of a programme of inspections it might be
    appropriate for me to arrange a joint inspection involving representatives from
    all the authorities in order to provide an insight into problems which may be
    encountered.

    Moving on to the "working party” structure I think it is clear from the meeting
    of 10th March that some clarification of its status is required. It is
    reasonably clear from the County Council's records that the working party as
    such was actually a decision making body presumably acting under delegated
    powers. However, the normal City Council practice is that the principal powers
    remain with a Committee or Sub-Committee (in this case the General Purposes
    Panel) with routine matters being delegated to a Chief Officer (in this case


•
    myself). I would therefore propose to ask the Panel to accept the working party
    as a forum for discussion.


    I take a view that the Lead Authority will be able to use the Working Party as
    a useful forum for discussion prior to drawing up that Authorities formal view
    to be submitted to the Certificating Authority. I propose that when an
    Authority feels that a meeting would be appropriate contact should be made with
    my Chief Licensing Officer, Mr. Bownes, who will then make arrangements for the
    meeting to take place. An agenda will be prepared and circulated prior to the
    meeting and at the conclusion of the meeting Mr. Bownes will prepare a list
    showing the subjects discussed and the action to be taken by each Lead
    Authority. This list will be circulated as well.

    Would you please consider the points I have raised and let me have your comments
    on them in due course; it will be necessary for me to formulate a report to the
    General Purposes Panel on the administration of the Certification system.

    Yours faithfully,

 Dear Sir

the Council*8 Certificating Function

ilank you for your letter dated 14 May 1987 which I have now
had the opportunity of discussing with Superintendent T
Stuart.

As you rightly point out, there is an overlap of interest in
the matters you outline in the draft, and therefore I feel
it would be helpful to have a meeting as soon as possible so
that comments may be made by all parties concerned before
making a final decision regarding this matter.

If I can be of any further assistance prior to the meeting,
please do not hesitate to contact ae.

Yours faithfully

   Dear Sir,

   Safety of Sports Grounds Act 1975 - Future Administration of the Council's
   Certificating Function

   Please note that I have arranged a meeting for all Interested parties on
   Thursday 16th July, 1987 at 9.30 a.m. in the Town Hall to discuss the above
   matter further. I hope that the meeting will produce a consensus view on future
   administrative procedures which will form the basis of a report to the General
   Purposes Panel of the City Council. I should emphasise that no decisions have
   yet been made on this subject and any comments or suggestions which you have
   will be most welcome. I intend that my report to the Panel will be near
   completion by the end of July and it is, therefore, important that the maximum
   advantage is taken of the meeting on 16th July.

   This meeting may also provide a useful opportunity to discuss dates for
^^inspections of the stadia prior to the beginning of the 1987/88 football season.

  Should the need arise please do not hesitate to contact my Chief Licensing
  Officer, Mr. Bownes on the number given below.

 SAFETY OF SPORTS GROUN DS ACT 1975 - THE CURRENT SITUATION A N D P R O P O SA LS FOR THF
 FUTURE A D M I NI STR AT ION O F THE COUNCIL'S CERTIFICATION FUNCTION

 Introduction



                roCa11 th3t °n 1St Apr11 1Q86 the Clty Council M e r i t e d from the
 South Yorkshire County Council the role of certificating Authority under the
   f .     , f Act ltself ls basically aimed at ensuring adequate standards of
 S 3 Q W f f i f J 5n 3 t !d S t adlf 5 there are three of these ln S hef field at the moment'
 - Sheffield W e d n es da y Football Club, Sheffield United Football Club, and the
 Owlerton Sports Stadium. A detailed report on the Act and its application in
 Sheffield was submitted to the Panel on 6th May 1986.

 The Current Situation


 The Panel at its meeting     in May 1986 identified several main areas         for further
 investigation.


 Firstly it was   accepted   at the time that the broad outlines     of   the
 administrative system organised by the County Council should be con ti nue d          for
 the time being.  This svstem has now been reviewed and the proposed
 reorganisation is detailed later in this report.


The Panel also asked that the H e alt h and Safety Executive be kept informed of
all matters relating to sports gr ound safety and that the A s s o c i a t i o n of
Metr op ol ita n Authorities also t a s k e d about the HSE's involvement.      As far as
keeping the HSE informed of safety developments at the stadia the Exe cutive made
it fairly plain that they would not make any comments.         The practice was
therefore discontinued.      The involvement of the AMA in the HSE                has been
somewhat forestalled by action at central Government level to review the HSE's
relationship with local authorities; this review was announced in the
Government's replv to the Popplewell Report but no results of that r e vi ew have
yet been received.   Fortunately, however, the Council's Director of H e a l t h and
Co nsumer Services has permitted his O f f i c e r ’s to provide professional healt h and
safety input into the decision making process in relation to safetv 0 f
sports grounds.   The problem is, therefore, at least temporarilv resolved.

The Panel also made reference to consultation on the safetv of sports grounds
policv with the other District Councils in South Yorkshire.   I’nfortunatelv,
attempts at arranging consultation meetings have been unsuccessful to date. It
 s proposed to try again to organise some consultations in the fairly near
future, perhaps when the Certification system has settled down in each area.

The drafting of new safetv certificate conditions in consultation wi th the
Council s advisers has been progressing steadily and new draft conditions are
currently under consideration by those advisers.  It is hoped that the n ew
conditions will be submitted to the Panel at its meeting in Oct obe r for final
approval.


As to the question of charging fees under the 1975 legislation, it should be
be made clear that such fees are only payable on the grant of a Certificate.
It is anticipated that if the Panel approves the new Certificate c onditions a
Certificate will then be issued to Sheffield United and at that time it is
proposed to deal with the question of fees.
                                                               -    2   -




      F o ll owing a thorough review of the legislation it w
      detailed administrative               j   siation it has become                               clear that a

          of Sheffield Metropolitan District Council regarding the above,
 and in particular the meeting held at the Town Hail at 9.30 am on

  You will note that Mr Bownes is calling for oorments regarding the
  draft report and the only part that I would take issue with is
  at paragraph 3 of page 2. Unless 1 have misunderstood this, i t
  seems to me that Mr Bcwnes has again missed the point tliat we were
  trying to make. The A drrunistratiorLand Legal. Department are the
  licensing authority and we, the Police, are there to offer advice
 regarding our areas of responsibility which they eitlisr accent or
 repecT . So far as I see it, meetings-, of the now nronosed 'Safety
 of Snorts Grounds Advisory Group', referred to in the above mentioned
 paragraph, should result in the publication of minutes following
   ne meeting, taten and prepared by the licensing authority, and any
 subsequent action should then be taken by the licensing authority.
     ai to see the need for detailed'! written advice to the council
 fron the Police or any other member of the advisory group following
 a meeting, providing the meeting is properly minuted. It still
 appears to me that the Administration and Legal Department are still
 seeking to delegate their responsibilities to mentors of the ’advisory
 group*.                                                              J

in order that I can reply by 14 August 1987, as requested.

    For the attention of Mr Bownes




    Dear Sir

    SAFETY OF SPORTS GROUNDS ACT 1975 -
    FUTURE ADMINISTRATION OF THE COUNCIL'S CERTIFICATING FUNCTION

    I refer to your letter of 3 August 1987 and acconpanying draft report.

    The Administration and Legal Department are the 'licensing authority'
    and the Police, as members of the Safety of Sports Grounds Act 1975 Advisory
           offer advice which the council can of course either accept or reject.
    Meetings of the Advisory Group are necessary as the 'overlap of interest'
    in some areas is recognised and acknowledged by thegroup.


•
    I would still recommend, as was pointed out at the meeting on3August 1987,
    that the meetings be properly minuted and then form the basisof the
    group's advice on which the council can act ifthey see fit. I do not
    *ee the necessity for further written ccrrment following a meeting.

    I hope these Garments will be of seme assistance.

    Yours faithfully

        Dear Sirs,

        Re: Safety of Sports Grounds - Hillsborough

        I enclose, for your attention, Notice of Amendment of the Safety
        Certificate. The amendments are as enumerated in Appendix 1 and additional
        conditions are as enumerated in Appendix 2. The amendments and additions
        reflect the recommendations of Lord Justice Taylor which he required to be
        implemented before the commencement of the new Football Season.

        You will, therefore, appreciate that the issue of this Notice should be
        regarded merely as an interim temporary measure. It is likely that further
        amendments will be required shortly. In any event, the Council is in the
        process of drafting a completely new set of Conditions. It is hoped that
        these will be in force in the near future.

        Please acknowledge receipt of this Notice.

        Yours faithfully,

       Dear Sirs,

       Re:       Safety of Sports Grounds - Hillsborough Inquiry

       The City Council has decided that in view of the reco mm end at ion s. of Lord
       Justice Taylor pursuant to the Inquiry into the Hillsborough Disaster, it is
       appropriate for an interim Safety Certificate to be issued to Sheffield
       United Football Club.

       I, therefore, enclose for your attention, a copy of the Safety Certificate
       which has been issued.  You will note that it contains basic safety
       provisions and also incorporates the recommendations of Lord Justice Taylor
       which he considered should be implemented immediately.

       The Council is in the process of reviewing the conditions which should be
       attached to the Safety Certificate and it is likely that this will be
       concluded in the near future and you will be issued with a new final Safety
       Certificate.

       I should also say that in the intervening period, it is likely that
       amendments will be made to the Certificate you have been issued with        today
       and you should, therefore, regard the Certificate as temporary.

       Please acknowledge receipt of the Certificate.

       Yours      faithfully,




       Chief Executive

As indicated above, there are two areas in the Green Guide (1986) which South Yorkshire
Police need to pursue viz:

             Paragraph 46        Club's contingency plans (eg what provision have they made
                                 for spare capacity turnstiles and vtfiat manpower have they
                                 arranged to operate them?).

         ♦ 3_! 6J, _T h ° se.'yhlch are asterisked should be carried o u t before the 1989/90 season starts. T he rest should be
        started forthw ith a n d com pleted as soon as possible.                                               hC FeSt Sh° U

        Maximum Capacities for Terraces
        *     k1’ ij VhCr^ V[ewing ferrace >s divided into pens or areas which are self-contained, the Safety C e r ti f i c a t e
             should specify the maximum number of spectators to be admitted to each such pen or area.

             A pen or area is to be deemed “self-contained” notwithstanding that it has a gate or gates affording access to
             another pen or area and whether such gate or gates be open or shut.

        *   n 2-‘ E «Ch figure for Maximum capacity should be assessed in accordance with Chapter 16 of the Green
            Guide (“the Green Guide figure”) subject to the following qualifications:-



•
            (a) in arriving at the Green Guide figure”, proper and realistic allowance must be made for all factors
                which should reduce the permissible density in accordance with the range of maximum figures snprifipd
                in paragraphs 221 and 222 of the Green Guide;                                                P

            (b) after assessing “the Green Guide figure”, a deduction of 15% should be made to improve the safetv
                margin.                                                                                         3

        ★      3. Arrangements should be made:-

            (a) to limit the number of spectators entering each self-contained pen or area to the maximum capacity
                figure assessed in accordance with Recommendation 2 above either electronically, mechanically, by a
                ticketing arrangement, by counting or otherwise, and

            (b) to close off further access to such pen or area when its maximum capacity is about to be reached.


    Filling and Monitoring Terraces
    ★         4. There should be a written agreement between the club and the police setting out their respective
            responsibilities for crowd safety and control and in particular for the filling of each self-contained pen or
            other terraced area and the monitoring of spectators in each such pen or area to avoid overcrowding. Any
            variation of the agreement in respect of an individual match should be agreed in writing in advance.

    ★         5. At each match, there should be on the perimeter track, for each self-contained pen or other terraced
            area, a steward (if the club is monitoring that area) or a police officer (if the police are monitoring it) whose
            sole duty is to check crowd conditions in that area for possible overcrowding or distress throughout the
            period the area is occupied by spectators. Whoever is so appointed should be in addition to any other steward
            or police presence. He should have ready access to the police officer authorised under Recommendation 9
            below, and by radio to the control room.


    Fences and Gates
               6. All police officers and stewards with duties in relation to the terraced areas and especially those with
            duties under Recommendation 5 above, should be fully briefed and trained with regard to the recognition of
            crowd densities, to the recognition of signs of distress and to crowd dynamics. Training should include
            demonstrations at the ground and photographs, designed to enable stewards and officers to recognise
            different crowd densities.

    ★         7. All gates in radial or perimeter fences of pens or other self-contained areas should be painted in a
            different colour from the rest of the fence and marked “Emergency Exit”.



                                                                   57
★    8. Where there are perimeter fences, all gates to the pitch should be kept fully open during the period
    when spectators are on the terrace.

★     9. There should be in respect of each gate in a perimeter fence (or group of gates if they are close together)
    a police officer authorised to decide whether or not to allow spectators through a gate to relieve overcrowding.
    The officer so authorised in respect of each gate should be identified for each match and known to be so by all
    stewards and police officers in that vicinity. He should be able to make radio contact with the control room
    either himself or via an officer close at hand.

★    10. Suitable and sufficient cutting equipment should be provided by the club at each ground where there
    are perimeter fences to permit the immediate removal of enough fencing to release numbers of spectators if
    necessary. Agreement should be reached as to whether the equipment should be used by police, the fire
    brigade or stewards. Whoever is to use it should be trained to do so. Whether to use it should be a decision of a
    nominated senior police officer at the ground.


Crush Barriers
★      11. All crush barriers should be visually inspected immediately for signs of corrosion. Any barrier found
    to be affected by a significant degree of corrosion should be repaired or replaced.

★     12. The layout of barriers in each pen or terraced area should be reviewed immediately to ensure that it
    complies with the criteria contained in Chapter 9 of the Green Guide. If it does not, the assessment of the
    maximum capacity figure for that pen or terraced area, in accordance with Recommendation 2 above, should
    reflect the fact.


Safety Certificates
      13. There should be an immediate review of each Safety Certificate by the responsible local authority,
    which should consult the club in respect of which the Certificate is issued, the police, the fire service, the
    ambulance service and the building authority. Such a review should include an inspection of the stadium. Its
    object should be to ensure that the operative conditions of the Certificate are complied with and to add or
    substitute any condition shown to be necessary as a matter of urgency following the findings and
    recommendations in this report.

      14. Any local authority within whose area there exists a sports stadium designated under the 1975 Act for
    which no Safety Certificate has yet been issued should proceed forthwith to remedy the situation.

      15. Every Safety Certificate should be reviewed by the local authority at least once annually and each
    Certificate should require to be renewed annually.


       16. Each local authority should review its arrangements for issuing, monitoring, enforcing, reviewing,
    amending and renewing Safety Certificates. Such review should require that there exists or is provided an
    accountable administrative structure whereby the functions of the local authority are regularly and
    effectively supervised by senior officers and elected members and decisions are properly taken in accordance
    with the local authority’s rules.

       17. To assist the local authority in exercising its functions, it should set up an Advisory Group consisting
    of appropriate members of its own staff, representatives of the police, of the fire and ambulance services, of
    the building authority, of the club and of a recognised supporters' club. The Advisory Group’s terms of
    reference should encompass all matters concerned with crowd safety and should require regular visits to the
    ground and attendance at matches. The Advisory Group should have a chairman from the local authority,
    and an effective procedure. Its resolutions should be recorded and it should be required to produce regular
    written reports for consideration by the local authority.


Duties of each Football Club
★     18. Each turnstile should be inspected and its potential rate of flow measured. Thereafter, regular
    inspections should be made to ensure that each turnstile remains capable of admitting spectators at the rate
    anticipated.
      32. To complement radio communications, there should be a completely separate system of land lines
    with telephone links between the control room and key points at the ground.

      33. Within the control room, there should be a public address system to communicate with individual
    areas outside and inside the ground, with groups of areas or with the whole ground. Important
    announcements should be preceded by a loud signal to catch the attention of the crowd despite a high level of
    noise in the ground. This arrangement should be prominently advertised on every programme sold for every
    match.

      34. Use should be made where possible of illuminated advertising boards to address the crowd.
    Consideration should also be given to the use by police officers of a simple code of hand signals to indicate to
    the control room the existence of certain emergencies or requirements.


Co-ordination of Emergency Services
★      35. The police, fire and ambulance services should maintain through senior nominated officers regular
    liaison concerning crowd safety at each stadium.

★     36. Before each match at a designated stadium, the police should ensure that the fire service and
    ambulance service are given full details about the event, including its venue, its timing, the number of
    spectators expected, their likely routes of entry and exit, and any anticipated or potential difficulties
    concerning the control or movement of the crowd. Such details should be readily available in the control
    rooms of each of the emergency services.

★     37. Contingency plans for the arrival at each designated stadium of emergency vehicles from all three
    services should be reviewed. They should include routes of access, rendezvous points, and accessibility
    within the ground itself.

★     38. Police officers posted at the entrances to the ground should be briefed as to the contingency plans for
    the arrival of emergency services and should be informed when such services are called as to where and why
    they are required.


First Aid, Medical Facilities and Ambulances
★     39. There should be at each stadium at each match at least one trained first aider per 1,000 spectators. The
    club should have the responsibility for securing such attendance.

      40. There should be at each stadium one or more first aid rooms. The number of such rooms and the
    equipment to be maintained within them should be specified by the local authority after taking professional
    medical advice and should be made a requirement of any Safety Certificate.

★     41. The club should employ a medical practitioner to be present at each match and available to deal with
    any medical exigency at the ground. He should be trained and competent in advanced first aid. He should be
    present at the ground at least an hour before kick-off and should remain until half an hour after the end of the
    match. His whereabouts should be known to those in the police control room and he should be immediately
    contactable.

★     42. At least one fully equipped ambulance from the appropriate ambulance authority should be in
    attendance at all matches with an expected crowd of 5,000 or more.

      43. The number of ambulances to be in attendance for matches where larger crowds are expected should
    be specified by the local authority after consultation with the ambulance service and should be made a
    requirement of the Safety Certificate.

We were welcomed by the Chairman and the paper which is attached
was produced, following which, with permission of the Chair I made
opening remarks generalised rather than specific with permission
passed to Superintendent Marshall who outlined the policing operation
at Hillsborough.          Immediately Superintendent Marshall finished,
Caupci 1 lor.White made a general, demand for m o r e d e t a i l e d , information
from the police -in relation to policing of footbll matches, as
did Councillor Butler who wanted a clear definition of 'operational
policing matters'.          Councillor White compiaifted of                M § k :of
e#iiii,UBicati,ftn,.and,,said,, that, if ..matters- did. not iiapr,exe:..s,,t.he^...police's
n,%cj5s .w p u I d b e on the chopping, .block. Through the Chair I made
it perfectly clear that I had asked for the meeting to be called
so that some of the confusion could be allayed and that as the
meeting was a police initiative that reflected the good w i 11 extended
by the police to matters of consultation in this area. I went
on the say that defining 'operational policing' was not a simple
matter and whilst I had seen the use of turnstiles at the Leppings
.4fce end of the Hillsborough ground as an operational matter, since
     involved segregation of opposing fans, clearly the Council say
the problem is one of safety. I highlighted the matter had been
discussed at the Advisory Group meeting as had the use of the North
West Terrace for Sheffield United and Liverpool fans, and that
there had been no dissenters to those proposals. A long debate
followed discussing 2 factors, i e : operational policing viz a viz
the Local Authority interest.
Councillor Betts asked for the police operational orders to be
supplied and that was agreed.

It is clear that the Councillors feel, in fact they said so, they
were not being kept updated by their officers relative to discussions
at the Advisory Group.   (The minutes of the meeting held on 9 Novembe:
have not been prepared).   The Councillors had not seen the 'packages'
provided by the police nor were they aware of their contents.
More discussion took place and it was obvious that guidelines needed
to be drawn up so that the police could see what information the
Councillors felt they needed, and to see within those guidelines
what the police were prepared to properly release.   Legal and Admin
will draw up such guidelines.

I made the point that such guidelines were necessary since firstly
I did not understand the inner workings of the Town Hall and secondly
that after many years of going it alone, without any real involvement
in the Council, the police needed to respond to the demands now
being made on them to consider and properly present those matters
which needed to be referred.

JOHN DERRICOTT has now been appointed as the Councils Safety in
Sports Grounds officer, and he is the single point of reference
in relation to any emergency which may occur which needs a decision
from the General Purposes Commitee.  His home telephone number
is 372774 - business 734004.

Councillors and Officers of the Local Authority were invited, indeed
urged, to attend at Bramall Lane and Hillsborough on match days
when they could see the police and safety arrangements first hand.

Dear Hr Jones

n e v e r t h e l e s s , th e Local A u t h o r i t y in l i n e with the recommendations o f Lord
J u s t i c e T a y lo r , r e a s s e s s e d tn e c a p a c i t y as 2,3uu. As the season p ro g r e s s e d
i t became n e c e s s a r y t o use tne Upper Norm west Terrace as an emergency c on tin ge ncy
a re a to accommodate v i s i t i n g f a n s , and t h i s was e n c a p s u l a t e d in the S a f e t y
C e r t i f i c a t e is s u e d uy t n e Local A u t h o r i t y .

Before th e evening of Zx November iyt>9 only a few hundred s p e c t a t o r s had
been accommodated in th e a re a r e f e r r e d t o but on th e evening mentioned i e :
21 November i9d*j S h e f f i e l d Wednesday playe d S h e f f i e l d United a t the H il ls b o ro u g h
stadium in t h e Zenith Data Systems Cup. As w i l l be a p p r e c i a t e d , t h e r e was
much l o c a l i n t e r e s t in t n i s matcn and with t h e c o n se n t o f the l o c a l A u t h o r i t y
Advisory Group, th e Upper North West T e rr a c e was used t o accommodate S h e f f i e l d
United f a n s . I r e p e a t t h a t a t t h i s time the a u t h o r i s e d c a p a c i t y had been
a s s e s s e d as 2,3Uu and t h a t amount o f t i c k e t s , o r t h e r e a b o u t s , were so ld f o r
tin s area.

fiv,; minutes b e fo re kick o f f the a r e a was f u l l and no more s p e c t a t o r s could
be s a f e l y accommodated, i t was seen t h a t t h e r e was between 2uu and 3uu people
s t a n d i n g in t h e gangways t o t h e t e r r a c e and a t t h e bottom o f t h e s t a i r w e l l s
waiting to g a i n a c c e s s , but due to th e d e n s i t y o f the crowd they were unab le
to do so. The Chief Superintendent in charge, Hr N esb it, concluded t h a t
no more s p e c t a t o r s could be s a f e l y accommodated witnin t h i s t e r r a c e a r e a
and t h o s e who were w a i t i n g t o ga in a c c e s s were taken to a n o t h e r p a r t o f t h e
ground. Whilst t h i s e x e r c i s e was being c a r r i e d o u t i t was seen t h a t a f u r t h e r
100/150 s p e c t a t o r s were s t i l l o u t s i d e t h e t u r n s t i l e s in Lepplngs Lane, w a i t i n g
to be admitted.
During the game 1t was necessary f o r s p e c t a t o r s comfort to remove a f u r t h e r
350 from t h i s t e r r a c e . Estimations a re t h a t once s p e c t a t o r s had been removed
about 1,700 people remained but they were s t i l l c l o s e l y packed.

As s t a t e d prev io u sly t h i s was the f i r s t time since the Semi Final on 15 April
1989 when the area had been a t c a p a c i t y , and i t was abundantly c l e a r t h a t
the number o f s p e c t a t o r s shown on th e c e r t i f i c a t e , i e : 2,300 could not be
accommodated, but a t the t i m e o f t h e Semi Final the fixed c a p a c it y f o r t h i s
area was 2,800. Immediate d isc u ssio n s took place between Chief Superintendent
Nesbit and th e S h e f f i e l d Wednesday Football Club S e c r e t a r y , Mr Graham Mackrell,
and they agreed an emergency f i g u r e of 1,500 maximum. On 23 November 1989
I wrote to Hr H M Webster - copy l e t t e r enclosed - the Head o f S h e f fi e ld
Administration and Legal Department advising him o f our concern and a special
meeting of the General Purposes Panel was c a l l e d f o r 2.00 pm on Monday 27
November 1989.

Between ti m es, i t was discovered from an o f f i c e r of the Council, Mr John
D e r r i c o t t , th e Safety in Sports Ground O f f i c e r , t h a t the plans which the
Local A utho rity used to determine the c a p a c i t y f o r the North West Upper Terrace
had been drawn to a s c a l e which showed the t e r r a c e to be l a r g e r than i t a c t u a l l y
was.

At the meeting on 27 November 1989 an emergency item was introduced which
encapsulated the information contained in t h i s l e t t e r to t h i s p o i n t . A copy
o f the notes f o r t h i s meeting ar e included.

There was prolonged d i sc ussion as to the revised c a p a c ity f o r t h i s area of
the ground and Mr John Stra nge, who was r e p re s e n tin g Eastwood and P a r tn e rs
a t the meeting, suggested t h a t the c a p a c i ty to be fix ed a t 1,400 w ill allow
time f o r ex act c a l c u l a t i o n s to be made, but he was sure t h a t the f i g u re of
1,400, w h i l s t e r r i n g on the s i d e of s a f e t y , would not be too f a r from the
exact f i g u r e . So, on 15 April 1989 we had a c a p a c ity o f 2,800 which has
now been reduced to 1,400, a reduction of 100%i

At t h e meeting, the question was never asked, or indeed, considered r e l a t i v e
to th e accuracy of the plans f o r the Leppings Lane Terrace on which the c a p a c ity
had been c a l c u l a t e d , a question which I have now addressed t o the Local A uthority
in my l e t t e r , a copy of which i s attached .

I need not s p e ll out the im plicatio n s which surround th e f a c t s now brought
to l i g h t , but i f I can be o f f u r t h e r help to you in t h i s m a tt e r , 1 would
be pleased i f you could c o n tact me.

On t h e evening o f 21 November 1989 S h e f f i e l d Wednesday f o o t b a l l club played

S h e f f i e l d United f o o t b a l l cl ub a t t h e H ill sb or ou gh stadium.         In th e planning

s t a g e s f o r t h i s match i t was obvious t h a t f a r more S h e f f i e l d United s u p p o r t e r s

would wish t o a t t e n d than could be accommodated in th e West Stand - th e st an d

used e x c l u s i v e l y f o r v i s i t i n g s u p p o r t e r s - and as a c o nt in ge ncy th e upper North

West Te rr a c e was take n i n t o use to accommodate th e a u t h o r i s e d c a p a c i t y o f 2,300.

The e ven t was an ' a l l t i c k e t 1 match which meant t h e r e was l i t t l e l i k e l i h o o d

of the c a p a c i t y , i e : 2,300 being exceeded on t h i s t e r r a c e .            In the e v e n t , 5

minutes b e fo re k i c k - o f f t h e r e were between 200 and 300 people s ta n d i n g in the

gangways t o t h e t e r r a c e and a t th e bottom of th e s t a i r w e l l s being unable to

gain a c c e ss i n t o t h e t e r r a c e due to th e d e n s i t y o f t h e crowd a l r e a d y p r e s e n t .

When examining t h i s s i t u a t i o n , C hie f S u p e r in t e n d e n t N e sb it concluded t h a t no

more people could be s a f e l y accommodated w i t h i n th e t e r r a c e a re a and th o s e who

were w a i t i n g t o gain a c c e ss to th e t e r r a c e were taken t o a n o t h e r p a r t o f the

ground.      W hilst t h i s e x e r c i s e was being c a r r i e d o u t , i t was seen t h a t a f u r t h e r

100/150 s p e c t a t o r s were s t i l l o u t s i d e in Leppings Lane w a i t i n g t o be a d m itt e d.

I t i s a s s e s s e d t h a t around 450 people could not be accommodated.                       During the

game, i t was n e c e s s a r y f o r s p e c t a t o r comfort to ta ke about 350 people out of

this terrace.         E s ti m a ti o n s a re t h a t once s p e c t a t o r s had been removed from the

t e r r a c e , about 1,700 people remained but t h e y were s t i l l c l o s e l y packed.                   It

i s obvious t h a t th e 2,300 c a p a c i t y could not be s a f e l y accommodated and one

has to bear in mind t h a t t h e c a p a c i t y when th e s e m i - f i n a l took pl ac e f o r t h i s

upper t e r r a c e was 2,800



Immediate d i s c u s s i o n s took pla ce between C hief S u p e r i n t e n d e n t N e sb it and the

S h e f f i e l d Wednesday F oo tb a ll Club s e c r e t a r y , Mr Graham M ac k re ll , and th e y agreed

a more r e a l i s t i c f i g u r e o f 1,500 maximum.
On 23 November 1989 I wrote to Mr H M Webster, the Head o f S h e f f i e l d A d m i n i s t r a t i o n

and Legal Department, a d v i s i n g him o f our concern and a s p e c i a l meeting o f the

General Purposes Panel was c a l l e d f o r 2 pm on Monday 27 November 1989.



Inbetween t i m e s , in th e l a t e a f t e r n o o n o f Fr ida y 24 November t o be p r e c i s e ,

S u p e r in t e n d e n t S l e a t h , FI Sub D i v i s i o n , d is c o v e re d from John D e r r i c o t t , the

S a fe ty in Spor t Ground O f f i c e r employed by th e C oun cil, t h a t th e pla ns which

th e Local A u t h o r i t y had used t o determine t h e c a p a c i t y f o r t h i s p a r t o f the

ground had been drawn to a s c a l e which showed th e t e r r a c e to be l a r g e r than

i t a c t u a l l y was.



The note s f o r th e meeting o f t h e General Purposes Panel on 27 November a t 2.1

say 's u g g e s t e d t h a t th e plan on which c a p a c i t i e s had been c a l c u l a t e d f o r the

North West Upper Te rr ac e o f th e West Te rr ac e was i n c o r r e c t ' .                  At th e meeting

q u e s t i o n s were asked in r e l a t i o n t o th e pla ns f o r t h e Spion Kop - th e only o t h e r

s ta n d i n g a re a in th e ground now t h a t Leppings Lane t e r r a c e i s no lon ge r used

- and ass ess me nts were given t h a t t h e Spion Kop c a p a c i t y had been c o r r e c t l y

c a l c u l a t e d from a c c u r a t e p l a n s .   The q u e s t i o n was never ask ed , or inde ed , co n si d e re d

r e l a t i v e t o t h e acc u ra c y o f th e plans f o r th e Leppings Lane t e r r a c e on which

the c a p a c i t y had been c a l c u l a t e d and t h a t i s something t h a t needs to be pursued

with urgency.



O f f i c e r s o f th e Local Council a re n a t u r a l l y being somewhat d i s c r e e t on t h i s

p o i n t but we need t o p re s s forward t o achiev e th e maximum gain p o s s i b l e .



1       Say, f o r example, i f a t th e Semi Final only 1,800 - 1,900 got i n t o the

        North West t e r r a c e then where did th e                 remainer go?
Were t h e Leppings Lane c a p a c i t i e s f i x e d on a c c u r a t e pla ns?

Should a d i r e c t r e q u e s t be made t o t h e Local Council t o e s t a b l i s h th e p o i n t

made a t (2)?

Is t h i s an i n v e s t i g a t i o n which should be pr o g r es se d by th e West Midlands

                     *■                   Estimated Terrace C ap aci ty

               I refer to the telephone call between Mr. Bow nes and my Pr i nc ip a l D i s t r i c t
               Surveyor, Mr. Butler, earlier this afternoon.

               The approximate ho l d in g capacities pro d uc e d for the sta nd ing te rrace
               areas do not take accou nt of any turnstile ingress limitations, or
               those of egress or emergency egress limi tati ons since it is my u n d e r s t a n d i n g
               that the Fire A u th or it y will consider all these matters b e i n g tha t they
               have the primary function of es timation of terrace capacity.

               These figures therefore need to be c ar efully ch ec ked with thos e p r o d u c e d
               by the Fire Au t hori ty to ensure that ac c o un t is taken of the ne ed for
               any further lim itati ons for the purposes of the p r op ose d c er t if i c a t e
               amendment.


               My calculations ba sed on the "green guide" m o d i f i e d by the T a y l o r I n q u ir y
               r ecommendations give the following

               1.   Spion    Kop                          18,2 00
               2.   North   West Te rrace (Upper)          2,300

               In accordance with our consultations,          fi gures have not bee n p r o d u c e d for
               Pens one to six of the West Terrace.

               I would appre ci ate the sight of the Fire Au th o ri t y figures b e f or e the
               Certificate is amended.

  Incorrect • In view of the fact that fresh calculations have %een nade in
  respect of the north west comer, this appears to resolve the jaroblea in that
  respect* However, I an concerned about the plans and calculations for the
  renainder of the ground* With reference to the Hop area, I understand that you
  are confident that these plans are correct* I would be jratefal if you would
  confirm this*

  I am pleased to note that you will be attending the General ftagsoses Panel
  Meeting at 2*30 p.m. on Monday, the 27th November, since I am wore members will
  require clarification of a large nuober of matters at that neecinfi..

  Yours sincerely,

night - Chief Superi nt end ent N e s b i t 'F' D i v i s io n - that n um b er cannot be s a f el y

Clearly, urgent attention needs to be given to this natter since the fixture next
week on 29 November - Sheffield Wednesday -v- Liverpool - is expected to draw a
good crowd and it would seem that lessons had not been learnt if on that night
gates had to be closed before the official maximum capacity had been reached.

I await your early reply.

             Capacity of Dpper North West terrace

            Subsequent to a meeting at Hanmerton Road Police Station on 22nd November
            to discuss various natters arising fran the match between Sheffield
            Wednesday and Sheffield United on 21st November, I have had cause to
            revise the reoomnended holding capacity for this area of the ground.

            You will recall that the present capacity figures were produced within
            hours, cn list August, 1989, and therefore only a paper exercise was
            carried out in that restrictive time.

            A site visit earlier today revealed the extent of the area of terrace
            partially blinded by the screen between the North West Terrace and the
            North Stand.

            Accordingly that area has been emitted from the gross available area of
            terrace.

            The holding capacity of the remaining areas has been re-calculated and
            modified in accordance with the Taylor reoonmendations, giving a resultant
            figure of 1,700.

            Eastwood and Partners drawing number 1610/64E has been used for the layout
            Q -, 5.area- In a telephone conversation between Mr Strange of Eastwood
            and Partners and my Principal Structural Engineer, late this afternoon, it
            was intxBBted that this drawing may not be accurate, and that the gross
            available space may be slightly smaller than is shown on the drawing.

            Until the area has been resurveyed and revised drawings received, I would
            recommend that the holding capacity for the Upper North West Terrace be a
            maxuiua of 1,500.

 Dear Sir,

Re: Safety Certificates - Sheffield United Football Club
and Sheffield Wednesday Football Club___________________

As you arc aware, an Inte-rits Certificate- hoe been issued to Sheffield United
Football Club with revised figures for capacity end stew<.rdJ.ng and the
existing Certificate for Sheffield Wednesday Footbell Club has been
sitsildrly sounded. As you art aware, this is with & vi<-v to ioplecentlng
wh.;t is probably the Dost ioportant interio recouaaenda tion oade by Lord
Justice Taylor in his report upon the Hillsborough Disaster.

however, I understand fror. conversations that ny staff have had with our own
Buxlcang Surveyor that there has not been sufficient tiiae to eonplete the
necessary calculations using the formula laid down by Lord Justice Taylor
for this purpose i n his interim retomn* nd«.tions. It is clearly essential
that the relevant calculations ere* made us soon as possible with t view to
the Certificates being aaended to reflect this fact. I consider th«t it is
Bost important that the Certificates are amended before big matches take
place at the respective Sports Grounds, Please would you therefore liaise
with the Building Surveyor to ensure that the necessary calculations are
Bfade and the relevant figures available as a Batter of urgency. I confirm
that I have written to the Building Surveyor in similar terms. If there is
any difficulty, please contact Mr. Bownes, my Chief Licensing Officer.

Yours faithfully.

T h e Force a d opt ed a p ol ic y of c omplete o p e n e s s a nd helpfulness towards

In qu iry itself - to dis cov er exac tly w h a t h a p p e n e d and to make sure
that nothing like it ever happened a g a i n in S out h Yorkshire.                  To this
end, I set up a liaison team w h i c h f u r n i s h e d the Inquiry wit h over
900 statements a nd w h a t e v e r additi ona l i n f o r m a t i o n it required.  Whilst
the Inquiry was sitting, the Treasury S oli ci t o r s ma de constant requests
to this team and, to my knowledge, e v e r y one of the requests was met.
Unsolicited, we p r o d u c e d numerous p h o t o g r a p h s and plans for use by
the Inquiry.      Eac h of the witnesses that we re c a l l e d gave their testimony
voluntarily.


Despite that d e c l a r e d polic y of openess a d o p t e d by the South Yorkshire
Police,          some in di vi d u a l officers m a y have felt u nd er severe attack
w h e n they came to give their evidence to the Inquiry.                             Some of the
ten barristers, e a c h of w h o m were d i r e c t i n g que st io ns at the witnesses,
were pe rceived to be more i nterested in f o c u s i n g bl am e than of unravelling
the complex of causes.                 A n y s uggestion of de fen s i v e n e s s by individual
w i t n e s s e s must be seen against the g e n era l b a c k d r o p of sincere and
op e n testimony w h i c h evoked the d e e p e s t emotions amongst my senior
offi ce rs when they we re a sked to r ecall the events o f the day.

The planning procedures involved in the policing          of football events have
been revie we d and supplemented as follows:

1. The S ou th York sh ire Police have entered into a w r i t t e n agreement with
each of the Football League Clubs in the county.              The writ te n agreement
covers such m a t t e r s as c lub /p oli ce liaison before any event; the
p r eparation of contingency plans; de ma rc a t i o n of respon si bil it ie s in the
filling and m on ito r i n g of the terraces; p r o v is io n and use of cutting
equipment; plans for relieving o v erc ro wdi ng etc.

2. The opera tio na l planning for each football m a t c h in South Yo rkshire
is intended to enable the police to cope wit h fores ee abl e patterns in
the arrival at, and de pa rture from, the event by spectators.       The
following scenarios are each catered for by way of contin gen cy plans:

   a) Al l ticket, or o th erwise restricted, matches
   b) Early arrival of spectators
   c) U n e x p e c t e d and joint arrival of large numbers of spectators
   d) Individual section of ground approaching c a p a cit y
   e) W h o l e gr ound approaching capacity
   f) Late arrival of spectators
   g) E m e r g e n c y opening of external gates, (or forcing of external
      gates), thereby allowing an influx of specta tor s
   h) Early d epa rture of s pectators from ground
   i) E m e r ge ncy evacuation

A reserve of officers is m ai nt a i n e d at each g r ou nd to enable their rapid
deployment to any d if fic ul ty w h i c h m a y arise inside or outside the
ground.

3. The South Yor ks hir e Police now liaise w i t h the fire and ambulance
services at the time of planning for a football event.

4. A 'model' South Yorkshire Police operational order for football
events is nearing completion.   O pe rational orders have been obtained
from most F orces in England and Wales - best prac tis e has been adopted
and the lessons learned from the Hi ll sb o r o u g h Dis ast er (highlighted at
paras 273 and 274 of the Taylor Report) have bee n incorporated.

5. The South Yo rkshire Police have prepared a vid eo tape film w hi ch
highlights the problems of crowd density, crowd d i s tr ess and crowd
dynamics.           The film will be used as a training aid for both police and
stewards who monit or football crowds.          (Can this be shown to Police
A u t h o r i t y ’- it represents one graphic example of the great efforts
undertak en by the Force to ensure the future safety of football crowds).

6 . Furthermore, the Police I mpl ementation T e a m has produced a
comp re he nsi ve package det ailing the measures w h i c h have already been
taken or are recommended for the future at each football ground in South
Yo rkshire to ensure crowd safety.         These packages have been provided to
the Local Auth or iti es who each have a r e s p on si bil it y for the safety
cert if i c a t i o n at football grounds.  Extracts from these packages were
appended to m y last report to the Police A u t h o r i t y on 17 November 1989.



These steps are together intended to enhance the pl anning and
operational procedures involved in the policing of football events in
South Yorkshire.

of t he comments and c r i t i c i s m s of the Taylor Inquiry.

Chapter 18 of h i s Interim r e p o r t s t a t e s t h a t :
" . . . over many years the South Yorkshire Police have given e x c e l l e n t
s e r v i c e t o the p u b l i c . They have handled crowd problems s e n s i t i v e l y
and s u c c e s s f u l l y a t a l a rge number of fo o t b al l games including major
matches, during s t r i k e s in the coal industry and the st e e l

The p o l i c i n g of f o o t b a l l matches has t r a d i t i o n a l l y , been regarded by

has been tasked with           implementing the recommendations contained in
the Taylor Interim Report.

In f u l f i l l i n g t h i s task the o f f i c e r s have addressed the t e x t of the

Ther e is little by the w a y of p rogress to report in add it ion to that
alre ad y re ported to the Au th o r i t y on 17 N o v e m b e r 1989.

As outlined at p a r a gra ph 3.3 of that report the P ol ice 'Implementation
Team' provided each Local A u t h o r i t y w i t h a c o m p r e h e n s i v e report of what
the police have so far achieved.          T he A u t h o r i t i e s w e r e each asked to
convene a m e eti ng to discuss the report.            To date (27.11.89) no response
has been received from any of the A uth orities.

Item 4 dealt w i t h the increased costs for policing football matches.           I
can now report that the Ass oc i a t i o n of Chief Police O fficers s u b ­
co mm itt ee on 'Hooliganism at Sporting Events' has und er t a k e n to review,
nationally, the posi ti on of police costs arising from football.            They
w i l l report in due course.

The officer r eferred to at pa rag ra ph 9.3 will now retire from the Force,
on the grounds of ill health, on 10 December 1989.
Chief Constable,




Draft re sponses to the qu es tio ns posed at the m e e t i n g of the Police Authority
on 17 N o v em ber are attached.  The responses cover tho se points arising in
resol uti on s 4, 5 a-d, and 6 .

A n e ce ss ari ly g u a rd ed r e s p o n s e is offered to r e s o l u t i o n 5a. However, an
extract from the original s ub mi ss ion to the Inquiry, on behalf of the South
Y o r k s h i r e Police, is a ttached to this response.             Th is extract gives some idea
of the s pectrum of comment that may be preferred but t he re is a danger that by
'opening the d o o r 1 the P o lic e A u t h o r i t y will p rob e further.
The suggestion, that all relevant i n f o r m a t i o n on the policing of football
m a tch es sh ould be p rovided to both the local a ut hor i t i e s and the football
clubs in the interest of increasing the e f f e ct ive ne ss of liai son w i t h
other than just the eme rg enc y services has bee n considered.            The Chief
C o n s t a b l e has directed that a full po lice o p era ti on al order for every
foot ba ll m a t c h shall be av ai lable to each local a u t h o ri ty and each
fo otball club.
The Chief C ons t a b l e has noted w i t h regret and conce rn the nature and
the tenor of the c o m m e n t s and c riticisms about the actions of certain
South Yorkshire P o l i c e o f f ice rs on the day of the d is as t e r contained in
Lo rd Justice T a y lor 's report.

As stated in his report of 17 N o v e m b e r 1989, the Ch ie f C o n s t a b l e has
asked the Di rector of P u b l i c Pros ecu ti ons to advise u p o n the criminal
consequences of such actions.                 The Director, in turn, has called for a
full criminal i n v e s t i g a t i o n w h i c h is on-going and is being conducted,
independently, by the Wes t M i d l a n d s Police, who w i l l also purs ue any
complaints or d i s c i p l i n e m a t t e r s that arise.   U n t i l that report is
available and the D i r e c t o r of Public Prosecutions, the P ol ic e Aut ho rit y
and the Chief C o n s t a b l e have m a d e their decisions rega rd in g future action
on the criminal and c o m p l a i n t s aspect, comment on the actio ns of
individual officers is inappropriate.

A l l comment or c r i t i c i s m s con ta in ed in the Report were, w h e r e
appropriate, tr an sp o s e d as recomm end at io ns and all aff ecting the police
have been impleme nt ed as p r e v i o u s l y reported to the Committee.

A number of of ficers in vo l v e d in the event have bee n p osted to other
duties.  This has b e e n do ne in the interests of the Force and of the
officers concerned and is not an implied crit ic is m of their actions on
the day.
5     Of the 172 witnesses, who gave oral evid enc e to Lor d Justice Taylor's
(b)   Inquiry, 59 of them (over 33%) w e r e S ou th Y o r k s h i r e Police officers.              The
      Force adop ted a p olicy of comp le te op enness and helpfulness towards the
       Inquiry.           F ol lowing the disaster, the C hi ef C o n st abl e' s concerns wer e
      those of the Inquiry itself - to d i s co ver exact ly what happened and to
      make sure that nothing like it could h ap pen ag ai n in South Yor ks h i r e or
      elsewhere.             To this end, the C hie f C o n s t a b l e set up a liaison team w h i c h
      fu rn ished the Inquiry w i t h over 900 s tatements and what eve r addit io nal
      i n f o r m a t i o n it required.    Whilst the Inq uir y was sitting, the T re as u r y
      Solicito rs ma de constant requests to this team, all of w h i c h w e r e met.
      Unso licited, the S ou th Yor kshire P o li ce produced numerous ph otographs and
      plans for use by the Inquiry.              E a c h of the, w i t n e s s e s that wer e called
      gave their te st imony fully and voluntarily.                              ,,,
                                                                        £~i ;/L

      De sp ite the policy of openness ado pt ed by the So ut h Y or kshire Police,
      some in di vi d u a l officers may have felt under severe attack from the 10
      r e p r e s e n t a t i v e C o un se l w ho had the opp or u n i t y an9 the benefit of
      hindsight to qu estion them about their actions and decisions.

      As Lor d J u s t i c e Taylor co mp limented c e r t a i n of ficers for the w a y they
      gave their evidence but has not indi ca ted w h i c h officers he has
      criticised, the Chief Co ns table is of the vi ew that it would serve no
      purp os e to speculate.
Chapter 18 of Lord Justice Taylor's Interim Report states that:

". ..over m a n y years the Sou th Yorkshire Police have g i v e n e xc ellent
servic e to the public.            T h e y have handled crowd pro bl ems se ns it i v e l y and
s u c c e s s f u l l y at a large n umber of football games incl ud ing m a jor matches,
during strikes in the coal ind ust ry and the steel industry, and in other
c o n t e x t s . ..".

The m a n a g e m e n t training, ap pr ais al and selection p r o c e sse s that exist
w i t h i n the Force are all ta rge tt ed to achieve a c o n t i n u a t i o n of that
"excellent service to the public" of South Yorkshire.                   Su ch m a t t e r s are
under co nstant review and any changes considered a p p r o p r i a t e w i l l be
introduced.

The poli ci ng of football m a t c h e s has traditionally, be en r e g ar de d by the
po lice service as a w h o l e as a particular public order problem.                    Training
has r e f l e ct ed this v i e w - pol ic ing of football has be en subsumed in
ge ne ral public order training.            In the light of the H i l l s b o r o u g h disaster
there are cle ar ly p ol ic i n g m a tt ers specific to football events that
w a r r a n t a training input, eg, Safe ty Cert ifi ca tio n matters, football
crowd dynamics, communications, intelligence gathering, c o n t i n g e n c y
planning, C C T V utilisation, me mbe r s h i p schemes, etc.         The A s s o c i a t i o n of
C h ie f P o l i c e Officers has a l r ead y recommended that these m a t t e r s be
subject of a carousel c o u r s e at the Police Staff College, Bramshill.
W h e n this course is a r r a n g e d the Chief C ons ta ble w i l l en sure that South
Yo r k s h i r e officers attend.

W i t h i n Force, the s u p e r i n t e n d e n t s who have a r e s p o n s i b i l i t y for policing
ar ra ng e m e n t s at the five foo tb all league grounds in South Y o r k s h i r e have
been co- op te d <lnto the I m p l e m e n t a t i o n Team w h i c h has bee n ta sked w i t h
im pl eme nt ing the r e c o m m e n d a t i o n s contained in the T a y lo r I n t e r i m Report.

In fulfill in g this task the officers have addressed the text of the
Taylo r R ep or t as wel l as its recommendations and are thus w e l l briefed to
unde rt ake policing at the football league grounds in the future.

    118.   HILLSBOROUGH STADIUM DISASTER - IMPLEMENTATION OF THE TAYLOR INQUIRY
           Rim i RECOMMENDATIONS'                                          —
^          In view of t he d i f f i c u l t i e s encountered in se l e c t i n g an acceptable date on
W          which t o hold a Special Meeting of the Authority, and a f t e r consulting
            r e p r e s e n t a t i v e s of the Co n s tituent Councils and of the Magistrate Members,
            i t had been agreed t h a t t he requested d e t a i l e d r e p o r t on the
            Recommendations of the Interim Report of the Inquiry by the Rt. Hon. Lord
            J u s t i c e Taylor i nto t he Hillsborough Stadium Disa ste r should be considered
            a t to d a y ' s meeting of t he Authority.

           Members of t he publ ic and press were pre se nt a t the meeting but, when a
           member of t he public attempted to make a stateme nt, th e Chairman had to
           p oint out t h a t w h i l s t t he public were e n t i t l e d to be pr e s en t a t the
           meeting, i t was a formal meeting of the Police Authority and not a public
           meeting. Consequently, t he public did not have a r i g h t to comment a t the
           meeting.
            Accordingly t he Chief Constable submitted a re po rt d e t a i l i n g the action
            taken by t he South Yorkshire Police (both prio r to and subsequent to the
            p u b li c a t i o n of t he Taylor Report), the co n s u l ta ti o n s with and the
            r e s p o n s i b i l i t i e s of t he Local A u t h o r i ti e s for Safety of Sports Grounds,
            th e consequent increased c o s ts f o r the pol ic ing of f o o t b a l l matches, the
            criminal i n v e s t i g a t i o n of South Yorkshire Police O f f i c e r s , matters of
            Complaint and D i s c i p l i n e , t h e Coroner's Inquest re ga rding the 95 deaths

            h e a l th and wel f ar e of t he Force.
A d d itio n a l l y , t he r e p o r t included copies of the w r i t t e n agreements with
the f ive South Yorkshire F o otball League Clubs in accordance with
Recommendation 4 of t he Taylor Report.

The Authority considered t he r e p o r t on a paragraph by paragraph b a s i s .

The Clerk and F in anc ia l O f f i c e r pointed out t h a t the date r e f e r r e d to in
paragraph 8.3 should a c t u a l l y be 19th June, 1990 and t h i s amendment was
accepted.
The Authority welcomed t he improved l ia i s o n which now e x i s t e d , and
discussed whether t h i s could be improved yet f u r t h e r .

The Authority a l s o queried o t h er aspe cts of the Taylor Report ( e s p e c i a l l y
those r e f e r r e d t o in Chapter 18) not covered in t he r e p o r t to t h i s meeting
of the A ut h or i t y, and suggested t h a t the Chief Constable might r e p o r t on
such mat ters t o t he next meeting of the Authority.

    The Chief Constable pointed out t h a t (as re fe re d to in hi s re po rt)
    Criminal I n v e s t i g a t i o n s , Matters of Complaint and D i s c i p li n e , the
    Coroner's I n q ue st , as well as Civil Actions, were a l l s t i l l on-going, in
    consequence of which he was precluded from re p o rt in g on such matters for
    the time being and c e r t a i n l y would not be able to do so a t the next
    meeting of t he A ut h o ri t y . He was, however, anxious to give the Authority
    as much i nformat ion as p o s s ib le a t the e a r l i e s t po ss ib le date.

    RESOLVED:-
    1.    That t he P o l i c e Au thority note the e f f o r t s made to implement the
          recommendations of t he Interim Report of Lord J u s t i c e Taylor in sofar

(a)    I have noted with regret the nature and the tenor of the comments and
       criticisms, contained in Lord Justice Taylor's Interim Report, about
       the actions of certain South Yorkshire Police officers on the day of
       the disaster.

       As stated in my report of the 17th November 1989, I have asked the
       Director of Public Prosecutions to advise upon the criminal consequences
       of such actions. The Director, in turn, has called for a full criminal
       investigation which is ongoing and is being conducted, independently,
       by the West Midlands Police.    I am, therefore, unable to provide that
       information which is sought.

5.18           Observations

5, j 8.1       It is not felt appropriate   in this submission to draw

               any definitive conclusions or to attempt to identify      the

               cause of the tragedy from the (necessarily) limited

               amount of information available to the Force.       Rather,

                the Chief Constable is content to make a number of

                observations which he feels may be pertinent to the

               Committee of Enquiry:-



                (a)    Every conceivable care and effort was taken
^    18.2
                       at the pre-planning stage to provide a

                       sufficiency of police resources to deal

                       with the normal (or anticipated) oper­

                       ational problems associated with a major

                       sporting event.



                (b)    Such arrangements have been implemented
    5-18.3
                       on many previous occasions and have been

                       found to be entirely satisfactory.   Indeed,

                       the 1988 semi-final involved the same

                       teams and the event passed without inci­

                       dent, as evidenced by the statement of

                       Inspector R. Walker, who was present at                 STAT EMENT
                                                                               68
                        that location.




    5 . 18 .     (c)   The manner in which sections of the stadium

                        were segregated between visiting suppor­

                        ters was based not only on historical
                      precedence, but primarily in order to pro­

                      tect law abiding spectators and local

                      residents (in accordance with the recoomen-

                      dations of the Popplewell Enquiry) in this

                      highly urbanised and environmentally con­

                      gested area by minimising the opportunity

                      for conflict and violence between the

                      minority of opposing spectators who regard

                      such actions as being normal and acceptable.




5 .1 8 . 5     (d)    Saturday 15 April 1989 was a warn and

                      sunny Spring day, which should have pro­

                       vided the perfect atmosphere for a major

                       sporting attraction.   Instead, however,

                       it would appear that many visiting spec­

                       tators used this as an opportunity to

                       find local public houses and off licences

                       where they could purchase and consume

£                      alcohol, to the extent that in so doing

                       their arrival at the stadium was seriously

                       delayed.



                (e)    The situation was exacerbated by the
    5 . 18.6
                       obvious influx of a large number of Liver­

                        pool supporters who did not have a ticket

                        to gain admission, and whose presence

                        seriously aggravated the worsening situa­

                        tion at the Leppings Lane turnstiles as
                                              ,4


                       the time approached for the game to

                       commence.




   5.18.7              Despite substantial police resources which

                       had been allocated for the event, senior

                       officers found themselves suddenly and

                       unexpectedly overwhelmed by several

                       thousand spectators who had converged on

                       the Leppings Lane entrance within a few

                       minutes of the designated time for kick-

                       off, many of whom being the worse for

                       drink embarked upon a determined course

                       of action, the aim of which was to enter

                       Hillsborough Football Stadium at all cost;

                        irrespective of any danger to property or,

                       more importantly, the lives and safety of

                        others.



• ^ 5 .1 8 . 8   (g)    Faced with the immediate danger which had

                        arisen, senior police commanders had to

                        make an instant operational decision to

                        protect those involved from death or

                        serious injury.
The senior officers in command did not

shed their responsibility; but rather

embarked on a.course of action which

they knew presented certain risks.       Chief

Superintendent Duckenfield took account

of all the information which was then

available and decided that -

      (i)    if the gates were not opened

             then casualties WOULD occur;

      (ii)    if the gates were opened

              casualties MAY occur.

 Based on this reasoning, the decision was

 taken to open the gates, and in so doing,

 the immediate danger to the life and

 safety of those at risk was relieved.

 Many police officers have indicated in

 their statements their total support for

 the initial decision by senior police

 commanders to open the gates.    Typically,

 PS 1757 Burns, a serial supervisor, states

 in his concluding paragraph that "being

  on duty in the inside of Leppings Lane,

  seeing and hearing the mass of the croi»d

  outside, I agree in full with the actions

  taken by Superintendent Marshall.      I saw

  the state and pleading of spectators

  entering the ground.    I an certain if

  these gates had not been opened, many
would have died outside the turnstiles.

I myself became very apprehensive for my

safety shortly after 2.45pm.    Despite the

fact that additional resources were

deployed to try to contain that situation,

the best efforts of those officers were

not successful.



Police officers were later suddenly faced

with a situation, the true nature of

which did not become fully apparent until

tragically the bodies of the deceased

were recovered from the West Stand

terrace.   Accounts provided by officers

nearest to the scene indicate that the

 crush may have occurred as a consequence

 of lines of spectators swaying backwards

 and forwards.    It is a fact that by 3.05po

 the spectator ’pens’ on the West Stand

 terraces were apparently filled to capacity

 However, a number of officers at the scene

 refer to the fact that on their arrival,

 despite the crushing at the front of the

 ’pens’, spectators only a few yards away

 towards the rear were totally unaware of

 what was taking place, and were engrossed

 in the spectacle on the field, whilst the

 tragedy unfolded within a few yards from
                  where they were stood.   One officer (PC

                  Pearson) considers that the first body       STATEMENT
                                                               38
                  which was recovered had been dead for

                  some considerable time, whilst another

                  officer (PC Smith), who was nearer the       STATEMENT
                                                               **9
                  scene of the tragedy than any other

                  officer, can draw no association between

                  the crush at the front and any "great

                  influx" of spectators into the 'pens’.




5 - 18.11   (J)   Once it became evident that serious

                  injuries had occurred, police officers

                  acted totally selflessly in their efforts

                  to help and rescusitate victims, in

                  conditions of congestion, threats, abuse,

                  and in some cases, physical violence.




5.18.12     (k)   The help and assistance provided by many

                  spectators is worthy of the highest praise

                  and should be a matter of public record.

                  Once the full extent of the tragedy be­

                  came clear, a sense of grief descended

                  upon the stadium and spectators rapidly

                  provided improvised stretchers for those

                  who were dead and injured.




5.18.13           Regretably, however, it must also be a

                  matter of public record that within the
                                            ,4


                  crowd during that fateful afternoon was

                  an unruly element of individuals, whose

                  actions were clearly influenced by alco­

                  hol.    Such was the degree of intimidation

                  that there was evidence that certain

                  stewards discarded their identification

                  at the crucial time, thus negating their

                  presence in any official role, and any

                  capacity to steward or direct the large

                  number of spectators.




5 .I8 . H   (m)   The decision not to inform the crowd of

                  the true nature of the occurrence was

                  taken by the Commander in charge of the

                  stadium, in order to ensure that the

                  immediate area outside the stadium re­

                  mained relatively free from congestion

                  to allow those who were injured to be

                  transported as quickly as possible to

                  hospital.



            (n)    Despite the scale of the tragedy, resources
 5.18.15
                   were quickly organised, temporary mortuary

                   facilities and a Casualty Bureau were set

                   up    and. in a little over an hour all the

                   casualties had been transported from the

                   scene.
The South Yorkshire Police has been deeply involved with

the tragic events which occurred on Saturday 15 April

1989.   Police officers and civilian personnel involved

in the operation have been deeply grieved by the death

and suffering which they witnessed on an occasion which

should have been an enjoyable sporting event.   Many have

had to seek professional counselling.




This has been further exacerbated by many reports in the

media which have wrongly communicated the role played by

the South Yorkshire Police.   It is hoped, therefore,

that this submission may rectify this imbalance.




For those most directly involved, memories and a deep

sense of sorrow will remain with them for the rest of

their lives, particularly those officers who tried so

desperately to save the lives of men, women and

 children.



The Force extends it sincere condolences to the rela­

 tives and loved ones of those who died.

      ground.


      3. The S o u t h Y o r k sh ire P olice now liaise w i t h the fire and ambulance
      services at the time of planning for a football event.

      4. A ' m o d e l ’ South Yorkshire Police ope rational order for football
      events is n e a ring completion.     Operation al o rde rs have been obtained
      from most F o r c e s in England and W ale s - best p r a c t i s e has been adopted
      and the les sons learned from the H i l l s b o r o u g h Disas ter (highlighted at
      paras 273 and 274 of the T aylor Report) have b e e n incorporated.

     5. The S o u t h Yorksh ire P olice have prepared a v i d e o tape film w h i c h
     highlights the problems of crowd density, crowd d i s t ress and crowd
     dynamics.      T h e film will be used as a training aid for both police and
     stewards w h o m o n i t o r football crowds. (Can this be shown to Police
     Au th ority? - it represents one graphic example of the great efforts
     undertaken by the Force to ensure the future safety of football crowds).

     6 . Furthermore, the Police Implementation T e a m has produced a
     co mprehe nsive package d etaili ng the m e a s ures w h i c h have already been
     taken or are recommended for the future at e a c h football ground in South
     Yorkshire to ensure crowd safety.             T hese p a c k ages have been provid ed to
     the Local A u t h o r i t i e s who ea ch have a r e s p o n s i b i l i t y for the safety
     cer tific ation at football grounds.            Extracts from these packages were
     appended to m y last report to the Police A u t h o r i t y on 17 November 1989.



     These steps are together intended to enhance the planning and
     operational procedures involved in the policing of football events in
     South Yorkshire.

 Res ol u t i o n 5b.


 The     comments and c r i ticisms of the Taylor Inquiry w i t h regard to the evidence
g lve -— ~ the Inq m r y by police officers of the South York shire Force and
-                                                                                the
manner in w h i c h such evidence w as given.                            -----------


Of the 172 witnesses, who gave oral evidence to Lord Justic e Taylor's Inquiry,
    of th em (over 33%) w e r e South Y orkshire Police officers.      The Force adopted
a p o licy of complete openness and helpfulness towards the Inquiry.               Following
t e disaster,     the Chief C ons table' s concerns were those of the Inquiry itself
  to    discover exact ly what happened and to make sure that nothing               like    it
could happen a ga in in S outh Y o r k s hire or elsewhere.     To this end,      the    Chief
 onstable    set up     a liai son team w h i c h furnished the Inquiry w i t h   over     900
statements    and    whatever   additional infor matio n it     required.       Whilst     the
Inquiry    was sitting,    the T r e asu ry Solicitors made constant requests to          this
team, all of w h i c h were met.    Unsolicited, the South Yo rkshir e Police produced
numerous    photogr aphs and plans for use by the Inquiry.          Each of      the   police
wit nesses that w e r e called gave their testimony fully and voluntarily.

Despite   the p o l icy of openness adopted by the S outh Yorks hire    Police,  some
individual     officers     may  have  felt  under   severe    attack  from  the   10
representat ive    Counsel who had the opportuni ty w i t h the benefit of  hindsight
to qu estio n them about their actions and decisions.

As  Lord   Justice Taylor complimented certain officers for the w a y    they  gave
their   evidence but has not indicated w h i c h officers he  has  criticised,   the
Chief C onstable is of the v i e w that it woul d serve no purpose to speculate.



Re s o l u t i o n 5c.


tfkat   steps    he has taken to r eview and change the        planning,  procedures and
ope ratio n   of   the  Force  since the Hi llsb o r o u g h disas ter in  light  of the
comments and criticisms of the Taylor Inquiry, par ti c u l a rly those contained in
Ch ap ter 187                                                                        —


The  planning procedures involved in the policing of football events have been
reviewed and supplemented as follows:-
   (i)   The S outh Y o r k shire Police have entered into a w r i t t e n agreement             with
         eac h   of  the      football   league clubs       in    the   County.       The  w r i tten
         agreement covers such m a t t e r s as cl ub/police liaison before any event;
         the prepa r a t i o n of cont in g e n c y plans; d e marcat ion of responsibil ities
         in    the filling and m o n i t o r i n g of the terraces;     p r o v ision and use      of
         cutting equipment; plans for relieving overcrowding, etc.

  (ii)   The o perat ional pl anning for each football m a t c h in South Yorks hire is
         intended to enable the po lice to cope w i t h foreseeable p atterns in the
         arrival   at,   and   depar ture from,  the   event     by  spectators.     The
         fol lowing scenarios are each catered for by w a y of c ontin g e n c y plans

         a)   all ticket, or otherwise restricted, m a tch es
         b)   e a r l y arrival of spectators
         c)   unexp e c t e d and joint arrival of large numbers of spectators
         d)   individ ual secti on of ground approaching capacity
         e)   w h o l e ground ap proaching capacity
         f)    late arrival of spectators
         g)    eme rg e n c y opening of external gates, (or forcing of external
                  gates), there by allowing an influx of spectators
         h)   e a r l y departu re of spectators from ground
         i)   e m e r g e n c y e vacua tion


         A  reserve  of officers is m a i n t a i n e d at ea ch ground to   enable   their
         rapid  deployment to any diffi c u l t y w h i c h m a y arise inside or   outside
         the ground.


 (Hi)    The  S out h Yo rks h i r e Police now liaise w i t h the fire            and    ambulance
         services at the time of planning for a football event.

  (iv)   A 'model' S out h Y o r k shi re Police operat ional order for football events
         is   nearing   completion.        Op erat i o n a l orders have bee n obtained  from
         most Forces in Englan d and W a l e s - best practise has been adopted           and
         the   lessons   learned from the H i l l s b o r o u g h disas ter (highlighted   at
         par agrap hs 273 and 274 of the Taylor Report) have been incorporated.

   (v)   The  South  Y o r k shi re   Police have prepared a video  tape     film w h i c h
         highlights  the      problem s of crowd density,   crowd distr e s s and crowd
         dynamics.  The film wil l be used as a training aid for both police and
         stewards who m o n i t o r football crowds.

  (vi)   Furthermore,           the    police         Impl ementa tion ■ T e a m  has   produced     a
         comprehensi ve         package detailing the m e a su res w h i c h have a l rea dy      been
         taken   or      are r ecomme nded for the future at each football                g round   in
         South   Y o r k shire      to ensure crowd safety.           These packages      have    been
         pr ovided     to the local authoriti es w h o each have a r e s p o n s i b i l i t y     for
         the   safety certi f i c a t i o n at football grounds.               Extracts  from    these
         packages      were      app ended to the Chief C o n stable 's last report           to   the
         Police A u t h o r i t y on 17 N o v e m b e r 1989.

These  steps  are  to gether intended to enhance the planning and o perational
procedures involved in the policing of football events in South Yorkshire.

Resolution 5d.

ZIl®— steps he has taken to r e vie w the change of m anagement training      appraisal
     quality of officers of the Force since the H i ll sborou gh disaster in      light
— —     — comments   and criticisms of the Taylor     Inquiry,  p a r ti cularl y those
contained in C h apter 18.


Chapter 18 of L o r d Justice Taylor's Interim Report states that    "...over m a n y
years   the South York shire Police have given excellent service to the      public.
Th ey  have  handled    crowd problems sensitively and succe ssfully   at  a   large
number   of football games including major matches,    during strikes in the coal
industry and the steel industry, and in other contexts...".

The  managem ent training,  appraisal and selection pr ocesses that exist w i t hin
the  Force   are  all targetted to achieve a contin uation     of  that   "excellent
service  to the public" of South Yorkshire.    Such m a t te rs are under   constant
review and any changes considered appropriate will be introduced.

The policing of football matc hes has traditi onally be en r egarded by the police
service       as    a whole as a parti cular                 public  order   problem.    Training   has
ref lected this v i e w - po licing of football has been subsumed in general public
order       training.        In the light of the H illsb o r o u g h disaster there are clearly
policing       m a tt ers specific to football events that warrant a                  training  input,
eg,     S a fety C e r t i f i c a t i o n matters,        football crowd dynamics,    communications,
intelligence gathering,                  cont in g e n c y planning,  CCTV   utilisation,   member ship
schemes,         etc.        The      Association          of C hief  Police   Off icers  has  already
recommended         that these matters be subject of a carousel course at the                   Police
Staff      College,      Bramshill.            W h e n this course is arranged the Chie f Co nstable
w i l l ensure that S outh York shire officers attend.

Wi t h i n Force,   the  sup erintendents who have a respo n s i b i l i t y  for  policing
arrangements      at the five football league grounds in South Yorksh ire have been
co-opted onto the Im plemen tation T e a m w h i c h has bee n tasked w i t h  implementing
the r e comme ndatio ns contained in the Taylor Interim Report.




Resolution 6


That,   as p revio usly requ ested by minute 81.2 of 29 September 1989,       progress
reports be submitted to each scheduled meeting of the A u t h o r i t y until  further
notice.


There  is little by the w a y of further progress to report in ad dition to                      that
already reported to the A u t h o r i t y on 17 Nov ember 1989.

As  outlined  at p a r a g raph 3.3 of that report the Police Imple mentat ion      Team
provided  each local aut hority w i t h a comprehensive report of what the        police
have so far achieved.       The A utho rities were each asked to convene a m e e ting to
discuss  the  report relative to their area and what still remains to be done

REPORT OF THE CHIE F CO NSTAB LE



H I LLS BOROU GH S T ADIU M DI SASTE R - IMPLEMENTATION OF
THE T AYLOR INQUIRY REPORT RECOMM ENDATIONS



Mat ter for C o n s i d e r a t i o n

To  report on the action taken in relatio n to the Po lice A u t h o r i t y resolutions
numbered  four,  five a.         to d.  and six (minute 118 of the Police      A utho r i t y
meeting held on 17 N o v e m b e r 1989 refers).



Bac kgrou nd Information

The Chief Co nstable submitted a report at the Police A u t h o r i t y m e et ing held on
17 N o v e m b e r 1989 detailing the actio n taken by the South Y o r k sh ire Police both
prior      to     and subsequent to the publicati on of Lo rd Justice Taylor's      Interim
Report, including co nsultations w i t h and responsibili ties of local authorities
for    safety at sports grounds,        the criminal inves tigati on of S outh    Yorkshire
Police officers,         matter s of complaint and discipline,    the Coroner 's Inquest,
the    civil actions and,        the effects of the disaster on the health and welfa re
of the Force.

Following  this  report  the  Authority  resolved that  a  further               report   be
prepared, inter alia, on four aspects of the resolution as follows

                                        3

R eso lu t i o n 4

That the Chief Constable be requested to consider and report on the s uggestion
that  all relevant i nfor mation on the policing of fo otball m a tche s should  be
provided  to b o t h the relevant local authorities and the football clubs in the
interest  of increasing the e ffectiveness of liaison w i t h other than -just  the
other e mergency services.

The   suggestion,  that  all relevant i n format ion on the policing  of    football
matches   should  be  provided to both the local a uthorities and    the    football
clubs   in the interest of increasing the eff ectiveness of liaison w i t h    other
than just the emer gency services has been considered.     The Chief Con stable has
directed   that a full police o perational order for every football m a t c h  shall
be available to each local auth ority and each football club.



R e s o l u t i o n 5a.

The comments and criti cisms of the T aylor Inquiry w i t h regard to the          policing
of the South York shire Force on the day of the disaster.

The Chief C onstable has noted w i t h regret and concer n the nature and the tenor
of  the  comments and criticisms about the actions of cert ain South Yorksh ire
Police officers on the day of the disaste r contained in Lord Justice      Taylor's
report.
As stated in his report of 17 N o v e m b e r 1989, the Chief Constable has asked the
Director    of Public P r o s ecutio ns to advise upon the criminal            con sequences   of
such   actions.       The    Director,        in   turn,  has  called for    a   full   criminal
inv estig ation w h i c h is on-going and is being conducted,            independently, by the
West   Midland s    Police,        who  w i l l also pursue any   complaints     or   discipline
matters that arise.        U n t i l that report is available and the Director of Public
Prosecutions,     the     Police A u t h o r i t y and the Chief Con stable have     made   their
decisions    regarding       future     action on the criminal       and   complaints     aspect,
comment on the actions of individual officers is inappropriate.

All   comment    or criticisms con tained in the Report were,            w h ere appropriate,
t ransposed   as   reco mmendations  and  all  affecting  the            police   have   been
imp lemented as p reviou sly reported to the Committee.

A  number of officers involved in the event have been posted to other  duties.
This has been done in the interests of the Force and of the officers concerned
and is not an implied c r i t icism of their actions on the day.



Res ol u t i o n 5b.

The    comments and criticisms of the Taylor Inquiry w i t h regard to the evidence
g iven   to the Inquiry by police officers of the South Y o r k shi re Force and the
manner in w h i c h such ev idence w a s given.

Of the 172 witnesses, w h o gave oral evidence to Lo rd Justice Taylor's Inquiry,
59 of them (over 33%) were South Yor kshire Police officers.               The Force adopted
a poli cy of complete openness and he lpfulness towards the Inquiry.                   Following
the disaster,       the Chief C o nsta ble's concerns w e r e those of the Inquiry itself
- to      disc over   exact ly what happe ned and to make sure that nothing             like   it
could happen again in South Yor kshir e or elsewhere.              To this end,       the   Chief
Con stable      set   up    a liaiso n team w h i c h furnished the Inquiry w i t h    over   900
statements       and w h a t e v e r additi onal inform ation   it  required.       W hilst   the
Inquiry was sitting,             the Treas u r y Solicitors made constant requests to        this
team, all of w h i c h were met.        Unsolicited, the South Yorksh ire Police produced
numerous       photogra phs and plans for use by the Inquiry.          Ea ch of     the   police
w i t n ess es that w e r e called gave their testimony fully and voluntarily.

Despite   the poli cy of openness adopted by the South       Yorks hire  Police,  some
individual    officers    may   have  felt  under   severe     a ttack  from  the   10
representative   Counsel w h o had the opportunit y w i t h the benefit of   hindsight
to ques tion them about their actions and decisions.

As  Lor d  Justice Tayl or com plimen ted certain officers for the w a y they  gave
their   evidence but has not indicated w h i c h officers he  has  criticised,   the
Chief C onstable is of the view that it w o u l d serve no purpose to speculate.



Res ol u t i o n 5c.

What   steps    he has taken to r e view and change the           planning,  procedures and
ope ratio n  of   the  Force  since the H i l l s b o r o u g h disaster  in  light  of the
comments and criticisms of the Taylor Inquiry, part icular ly those co ntained in
Chapter 18.

The  planning procedures involved in the policing of football events have been
reviewed and sup plemented as follows:-
                                              - 3 -

   (i)   The South Y o r k sh ire Police have entered into a w r i t t e n agreement    with
         each    of  the     football   league clubs in   the   County.         The  writt en
         agreement covers such matter s as club/police liaison before any event;
         the p r eparat ion of c onti ngency plans;  d emarca tion of responsibilities
         in the filling and monito r i n g of the terraces;      p r o v i sion and use    of
         cutting equipment; plans for relieving overcrowding, etc.

  (ii)   The operational planning for each football m a t c h in South Yorks hire is
         intended to enable the police to cope w i t h foreseeable patterns in the
         arrival  at,   and departure  from,  the     event   by  spectators.    The
         following scenarios are each catered for by w a y of continge ncy plans

         a)   all ticket, or otherwise restricted, matches
         b)   early arrival of spectators
         c)   unexp ected and joint arrival of large numbers of spectators
         d)   individual section of ground approaching c apacity
         e)   w h o l e ground approaching capacity
         f)   late arrival of spectators
         g)   eme rgency opening of external gates, (or forcing of external
                  gates), thereby allowing an influx of spectators
         h)   early departure of spectators from ground
         i)   emerg ency evacuati on

         A  reserve  of officers is mai nta i n e d at each ground to    enable   their
         rapid  deployment to any diffic ulty w h i c h m a y arise inside or   outside
         the ground.

 (iii)   The  South  York s h i r e Police now liaise w i t h the fire            and    ambulance
         services at the time of planning for a football event.

  (iv)   A 'model' South Yorks hire Police operational order fo r football events
         is  nearing  completion.    O pera tional orders have be;en ob tained        from
         most Forces in England and Wales - best practise has bee n adopte d           and
         the  lessons  learned from the H i l l s b o r o u g h disaster (highlighted   at
         paragraphs 273 and 274 of the Taylor Report) have be4 n incorporated.

   (v)   The  S outh York shire         Police have prepared a video   tape  film w h i c h
         highlights    the      problems of crowd density,    crowd di stress and crowd
         dynamics.    The film w i l l be used as a training aid fo r bo th police and
         stewards w h o m o n i t o r football crowds.

  (vi)   Furthermore,           the    police         Impl ementa tion   Team   has    produc ed    a
         com prehe nsive        package detailing the m e a sures w hich l|iave already          been
         taken    or    are r ecommended for the future at each foi tball                ground    in
         S outh   Yorkshire         to ensure crowd safety.            These pao kages   have    been
         p rovided    to the local authorities w h o each have a re sponsibi lity                 for
         the    safety cer tif i c a t i o n at football grounds.           Ext tacts   from    these
         packages     were       appended to the Chief Consta ble's la^ t report             to   the
         Police A u t h o r i t y on 17 N o v e m b e r 1989.

These  steps  are  together intended to enhance the planning    and  operational
procedures involved in the policing of football events in So iith Yorkshire.
                                                  - 4 -



    Resolution 5d.

    The   steps he has taken to r e view the change of m anagem ent training              appraisal
    and q u ality of officers of the Force since the H i l l s b o r o u g h disaster in      light
    of  the    comments  and criticisms of the Taylor    Inquiry,           p a r tic ularl y those
    contained In Chapter 18.

    Chapter 18 of Lord Justice Taylor's Interim Report states that        "...over   many
    years   the South Yorkshire P olice have given excellent service to the       public.
    They   have   handled  crowd problems sensiti vely and suc cessfu lly   at  a   large
    number   of f ootball games including major matches,   during strikes in the coal
    i ndustry and the steel industry, and in other contexts...".

    The  ma nageme nt training,   app raisal and selection processes that exist w i thin
    the  Force   are   all ta rgetted to achieve a c o nt inuati on of  that   "excellent
    service   to the public" of South Yorkshire.       Such matt ers are under   constant
    review and any changes consider ed appropriate wi ll be introduced.

    The    policing     of football m a t ches has t r a d i t i o n a l l \     been  regard ed  by  the
    police service as a whole as a particular public order problem.                          Training has
    r efl ected this v i e w - policing of football has be en subsumed in gene ral public
    order    training.          In the light of the H i l l s b o r o u g h disaster there are clearly
    policing    matte rs specific to football events that w a r r ant a                 training   input,
    eg,    Safety   C e r t i f i c a t i o n matters,        football crowd dynamics,   communications,
    int elligence gathering,                conti n g e n c y planning,  CCTV   utilisation,   membership
    schemes,      etc.          The       Association         of  Chief  Police   Officers   has  already
    recomme nded    that these m a t ters be subject of a c arousel course at the                  Police
    Staff    College,       Bramshill.           W h e n this course is arranged the Chief C onstable
    wil l ensure that South Yo rkshi re officers attend.

    Within   Force,   the  s uperintendents who have a r espon s i b i l i t y  for  policing
    arrangements    at the five football league grounds in South Yor kshire have been
    co- opted onto the Im pleme ntatio n Team w h i c h has been tasked w i t h  implementing
    the recomme ndatio ns cont ained in the Taylor Interim Report.

    In  fulfilling  this task the officers have ad dressed the text of       the  Taylor
    Report  as well as its recommen datio ns and are thus well b r i efed to   undertake
    policing at the football league grounds in the future.



    Resolution 6

    That,   as pr evio u s l y reques ted by m inute 81.2 of 29 September 1989,   progress
    reports be submitted to each scheduled meeting of the A u t h o r i t y until  further
    notice.

    There  is little by the w a y of progress to report in addi tion to that                    already
    reported to the A u t h o r i t y on 17 N o v em ber 1989.

    As  outlined  at p a r a gra ph 3.3 of that report the police       I m p l ementa tion   Team
    provided  each local autho r i t y w i t h a comprehensi ve report of wha t the         police
j   have so far achieved.      The Autho r i t i e s were each asked to convene a m e eting to
    discuss  the report.       To date no response has be en r eceived from any           of   the
    Authorities.                    ~

    Item four dealt w i t h the incr eased costs for policing football matches.               I can
    now  report  that     the A s s o c i a t i o n of Chief P olice O fficers  Sub-C ommit tee  on
    Hooliganism  at   Sporting Events has u nd ertake n            to   review,  nationally,    the
position    of   police costs arising from football.             They w i l l        report   in   due
course.

The  officer referre d to at para graph 9.3 has now been retired from the Force,
on the grounds of ill-health.

On    30 N o v e mber 1989       it was a nnounced that the C hief C o n s tabl e and the South
Y ork shire      Polic e A u t h o r i t y were offering an out-of-court settlement to    those
bereaved       and injured at H i l l s b o r o u g h on 15 Apri l 1989.   The purpose of  this
was    to ensure that those entitled to c o mpens ation r eceived it witho ut further
delay and spared the trauma of re-living the event through court proceedings.

The b e l o w press statement was released at 2.30 pm:-

"It   has been decided by the Chief Const able of South Yor kshire and the     South
Yor kshire  Poli ce Authority,  in c onju nction w i t h their insurers,  Muni cipal
Mutual   Insurance,   that  those bereave d and injured in the tragic    events   at
Hillsborough   stadium   on 15 April should not have to await the outcome      of  a
further lengthy hearing in 1990 before receiving compensation.

In the circumstances,     the Chief Constable,   in c o njunct ion w i t h his insurers,
intends  to  open ne gotiations w i t h the aim of resolving all bona fide            claims
against him for c o m pensat ion arising out of the H i l l s b o r o u g h disaster.

The   other   parties  p r e s e n t l y named as Defendants in   the  civil         proceedings
arising out of the H i l l s b o r o u g h tragedy, namely, Sh effield W e d n e s d a y Football
Club,   Eastwood & Partners,           and Sheffield City Council, have be en offered the
opportun ity   of  joining in the course of action n o w taken on            behalf       of  the
South Yorksh ire Police, but have refused to do so.            It is the i n t e n tion of the
Chief   Co nstable and his insurers to pursue legal action against those parties
to recover m oney s paid out to the claimants pursuant to today's offer."

INTENTION

The first duty of the Police is always
the protection of life. It is the intention
to ensure that the match takes place without
danger or injury to any person, to maintain
the peace and to minimise disruption to
those not attending the game.    Crowd safety
will be paramount, all officers must be
vigilant  at all    times with a view to
preventing overcrowding and crowd distress.
Positive action will be taken to deal with
outbreaks    of  public    disorder    thereby
enabling   early  resolution.      Damage   to
property and unlawful obstruction of the
highway will be prevented.

We will endeavour at all times to ensure
that the intention is achieved with a high
standard   of    discipline,   smartness   and
professionalism, so as to reflect the best
possible   image   of   the  South   Yorkshire
Police.


METHOD


COMMAND

BRAVO ONE XRAY ONE will be in overall
command.   Unless there is something which
warrants his personal attendance, he will
remain at Oakwell Control.

BRAVO   ONE   VICTOR   ONE  will   be   Ground
Commander.       He    will   have    specific
responsibility for the operation outside
the ground, including the Railway and Bus
Stations.   During Phase II he will be inside
the Ground.

The   Stadium   is   divided   into   sectors   for
command purposes as      shown     at   1.3   of    this
Operational Order.

CONTROL

The Police will maintain control               at   all
times by the following means:

The accurate    assessment  of intelligence
relating to the patterns of arrival at
or departure from the Stadium by supporters.

By positioning an adequate number of police
resources at strategic points to:-

(i)     Provide information and intelligence
to   Oakwell   Control   relative to   crowd
movement, numbers and behaviour.

(ii) Function as filter cordons to regulate
the    movement of supporters to and from
the stadium.

The segregation of supporters travelling
to and from the stadium by means of separate
and distinct routes of arrival and departure
for both vehicular and pedestrian traffic.
Such     routes will  be   controlled    and
supervised at all times by police.

The segregation of home and away supporters
within the stadium itself.

Sufficient police reserves will be available
to respond to, and deal initially with
any    developing    situation.      In   such
circumstances,     whilst   adhering   to  the
overall plan,     there will always be the
need for   individual    officers      to  use
initiative and be flexible in their response
to any developing situation.

At   the   conclusion   of   the   game,      visiting
supporters may be held back at the stadium
for a short period, in order to enable
home supporters to clear the area.        The
decision   as  to   whether    or   not these
supporters are to be held back will be
made by the Officer in Command, who will
give due consideration      to,   the numbers
involved, crowd safety and crowd behaviour.
The "hold back" policy for the day will
be communicated to all officers prior to
the termination of play.

Police resources deployed throughout the
operation   will   be directly relevant   to
the   number    of   supporters anticipated,
intelligence, the previous history of both
heme and away supporters and the potential
for disorder.

OPERATIONAL PHASES

The operation will be divided into 3 phases,
which may on occasions overlap:-

P hase I


- B e f o r e t h e K i c k - o f f - which will include
the arrangements for public order patrols
and     the      escorting          and  segregation  of
supporters until they enter the stadium.

P hase I I


   D u r in g th e H a tc h - from kick-off          to
10 minutes before the end of the game.

P hase I I I


- A f t e r t h e M a tc h - from 10 minutes before
the end of the game until all the crowd

and makes Oakwell Control aware of the
numbers entering the Stadium.      The Club
will monitor the filling of terraces     to
prevent overcrowding.

In the event of a particular section of
the   stadium approaching     capacity it is
the Club's responsibility to close that
section   of  the   ground   to   supporters.
Police Officers will      assist with    this
function, if requested to do so by the
Club or see that it is       necessary to do
so to prevent     overcrowding or prevent
injury.

on the perimeter track will make themselves
known to the safety stewards.         Each Police
Officer on    the perimeter track serial
will be in possession of a personal radio.
Any steward seeing any sign of overcrowding
or distress will inform the nearest Police
Officer, who will take appropriate action
and inform Oakwell Control.

4.    Inc reased C o s t s for P o l ic ing F o o tb all M a t c h e s

4.1   Several           of     the     rec om m e n d a t i o n s in the Inter im Report of      Lord   Justice
      T ay lor impose addition al d uties u p o n the police at football matches.                             For
      example,            (i)     the    deployment             of p olice officers,   t o 4each   gate    in   a
      pe rime ter fence,               auth ori sed to d e cid e w h e t h e r or not to a llo w spectators
      through           a     gate     to relieve o v e r cr owdi ng;         (ii)   the    deployment     of   a
      reserve           of     police officers to each m a t c h who are not committed                  to    any
      specific            duty      and    are      t h e r e fore able    to  deal   with    any   unforese en
      d i f f i c u l t i e s w h i c h arise inside or o u t side the ground;               and,   (iii)     the
      d ep loy m e n t        of    a sufficient n um ber of skilled operators                in   the    police
      contr ol r o o m to enable all radio tra ns m i s s i o n s to be received,                     eva luated
      and       a n s w e r e d and to enable all the resul ts of CCTV recording outside and
      inside the ground to be m o n i t o r e d and interpreted.

4.2   It   is  obvious  from the i m p l e m e n t a t i o n of these   three   recom men dati ons
      al one  that  the cost of p o l i cin g f oot b a l l m a t c hes will be   greater    than
      ever before.
 Memb ers      w i l l be aware that a p r o p o r t i o n of p o l ici ng costs is met by             the
 football   c lub s   themselves.     At presen t the financial            contribution    is
 determined     by   refe rence to a sli ding scale of charges             a greed  annually
 betwe en the Police A uthority,      the C hie f C o n s t a b l e and each of the clubs,
 ba sed upon a p rior e s t ima te of crowd size for a particular game.                In the
 two   seasons     1987/88   and 1988/89 the total cost of             po lici ng  the   five
 football clu bs in South Yorkshire,        both inside and outside the             grounds,
 amounted to some £1.83 m i l l i o n and, of this figure, the clubs con tributed
 £398,000 w h i c h amoun ts to 22% of the overall cost.

In   the       light   of    Lord J u s tice         Taylor's      r e c o m me nda tion s many Police
Au tho r i t i e s are n o w r e a s s e s s i n g the c h a rge s levied on football clubs        for
special police services.

T he  fa cili ty   to charge for poli ce offi cer s in              these   cir cum s t a n c e s  is
pr ovided   b y Sectio n 15 of the P o lic e Act 1964,              which enabl es the          Chief
Constable,     at his discretion,       to provide,        on       request,    special police
services    at   any p r e mise s or in any lo cal ity in the             police    area.         The
section    furth er  empo w e r s  the  P o li ce A u t h o r i t y   to   charge     for       these
services.


There is no p r e cise d e f i n i t i o n of the te rm 'special police services'   but
the   case of H a r r i s -v- Shef fie ld U n it ed Football Club 1986 held that the
Chief   C ons t a b l e is not,    as part of his normal policing      responsibility,
obliged    to p r ovid e o f f icer s to react to pot ent ial breaches of the     peace
where the o wner of priv ate p r o p e r t y creat es such a risk on his property.

It would seem,      therefore, that o f f i c e r s p rov i d e d to meet such a risk, as
in the case of a football match, are w i t h i n the meaning of special police
services   and      can be cha rge d for.     Indeed, Police A u t h o r i t i e s have a
fi duciary d u t y to the rate pay ers of their area to make such charges.

The    Harris case,            however,        d oes not f ully resolve w h i c h off ic e r s can be
regarded        as p e r f o r m i n g special police services.                     It held that the    fact
that    o f f i cer s    were        depl oye d on p r iv ate        p r o p e r t y was   significant    in
tending to show their p r o v i s i o n am oun ted to special police services,                           but
did    not      deal w i t h the q u e s t i o n of offi cers depl oyed to                 perform   duties
outside       the g round - duties that arise d i r e c t l y from the event w h i c h                    is
oc cur ring i n sid e the ground.                 L e g a l o p ini on has,         therefore, been sought
for    clarification             as to w h i c h duties p e r f o rme d by            police  offic ers   at
football       matches         can p r o p e r l y be r egarded as 'special               police   services'.

Notwithstanding           the    q u e s t i o n of payment for police      deploy men t outside
football g r o u n d s it is sub mitted that the level of c o nt rib uti on from             the
clubs   p r e s e n t l y falls s i g n i f i c a n t l y short of the actuajL cost of officers
inside the ground, and that the shortfall is set to w i d e n in the light of
the Taylor r e c o m m e n d a t i o n s w h i c h n ece ssi tat e an increase in the number of
poli ce o f f ic ers d e p l o y e d at football matches.



Crimi nal I n v e s t i g a t i o n of South Y o r k s h i r e Po lice Officers

Duri ng        the      c ourse of    the     Hillsborough   Inquiry     the       question      of
ma nsl a u g h t e r   by   the crimi nal      negli gen ce of  South Y o r k s h i r e   Police
offic ers        was    r aised b y c o u ns el for the bereaved,    Mr Benet           Hytn er QC.

Because this m a t t e r w a s not dealt w i t h in the Report of the      H i lls boro ugh
Inqui ry the Chief Constable,         on the m o r n i n g of the Report's publication,
referred   it     to     the Dire cto r of Public        Prosecutions,  asking    for his
    d e c i s i o n on the q u e sti on of c r i m inal l iab ili ty of any memb er of the South
    Yorkshire         Police.      It   w a s c o n s i d e r e d appropriate,     at  that  time,  to
    suspend         from duty the p ol ice c o m m and er of the H ills b o r o u g h event,     Chief
    Su perintendent David Duckenfield,                    p e n d i n g the outcome of the  Director's
    deliberations.          Mr Duc ken f i e l d remains suspended.

3   On 15 August 1989,       the D i r e c t o r w r o t e to the Chief Co nsta ble setting out
    his     view  that   the   matter        should       be     subject    of    a  full     c riminal
    investigation.       The   West M i d l a n d s P oli ce had alrea dy done           consid erab le
    w o r k in gathering evidence for Lord Just ice Taylor's Inquiry.                        It seemed
    sensible,     therefore,    to     invite        Mr    G e o ffre y Dear Q P M   DL   LLB,    Chief
    Co nst able   of   the   West   Midlands           P oli ce    Force,      to   un dert ake    this
    investigation.       His   report,         in    due course,        wi ll be submitted to       the
    Direc tor of Public P rosecutions.



    Ma t t e r s of Complaint and Dis cip l i n e

1   Add iti onal ly, the Chief C o n s t a b l e has asked that if, d u r ing the course of
    th eir       investigation,     the  West       M i d l a n d s Police of ficers   d i s c over any
    ma t t e r s   w h i c h might suggest that off en c e s were          c omm itted   against    the
    P ol ice (Discipline) Regu lat ion s, of a non- criminal nature, those offences
    should        be brought to his a t t e n t i o n and,         where appropriate,     be enquired
    into by the West M i d lan ds P o l i c e on behalf of the South Yo rksh ire Police.
    Th is is agreed.

    There  are cur rently seven m a t t e r s of public complaint about the    actions
    of  South  Yo rkshire  P oli ce   officers,     arising  from  the  H ills b o r o u g h
    incident.

    Three         of these matte rs have b e e n raised by a             single   complainant.     Two
    relat e         to the actions of the senior officers in command of the                  policing
    operation             at   H ill sb o r o u g h on the day and these are being supervised       by
    Captain           E Noel       T a y lor      of  the  Polic e  C omplaints     Authority.     The
    i n v e s t i g a t i o n of these co mpla i n t s is b eing conducted by Mr G e o f f r e y Dear,
    Chief         C ons table      of the West M i d l a n d s Police,    along w i t h the  criminal
    matters.            The third complaint is of i n civi lit y and is b ein g investigated,
    u n s u p e r v i s e d b y the Police C o m p l a i n t s Authority, by Superintendent A s h ton
    of the South Yorkshire Police.

    A  f ourt h complaint is that an offi cer at the perimeter fence contributed
    to   the d eat h of the c o m p l a i n a n t ' s son b y his failure to open the fence
    gate in good time.

    A  fif th complaint is that the failure by South York shire P olice officers
    to o p e n per imeter fence g ate s caused the complainant to sustain injury.

    A s ixt h complaint is ma de by a m a n w h o alleges that he was ass aul ted by a
    p o l i c e officer whilst atte n d i n g the football match.

    These         latter three cases are a ga in to be investigated by Mr Dear's   team
    and are likewise being s u perv ise d b y C a pta in E Noel Taylor of the    Police
    C o m p l a i n t s Authority.

    There   is  a seventh c omplaint of corruption,     namely of police    officers
    offering   to all ow fans into the ground on payment.      Thi s  complaint     is
    b ei ng investigated by Supe rin tend ent Ca rlisle of the Gre ater  M an ches ter
    Police.

9.2   A     total    of 58 o fficers s u b s e q u e n t l y took sick leave w h i c h w a s   dir ectl y

 ma nner in w h i c h such evidence w a s given.          —                       ---------


 Of the 172 witnesses, w h o gave oral evidence to Lo rd Justice T a y lor 's Inquiry,
       of them (over 33%) we re South Y o r k s hire P olic e officers.             The Force adopted
 a policy of com plet e openness and h e lpfu lne ss towards the Inquiry.                   Following
    e disaster,           the Chief C o n s t a b l e ' s concerns wer e those of the Inqu iry itself
    to      discover       exac tly what h a p p ene d and to make sure that n o thi ng       like   it
could happen a g a i n in South Yo rks h i r e or elsewhere.                To this end,   the   Chief
  onst able         set    up   a liaison team w h i c h furnished the Inquiry w i t h      over    900
stateme nts           and   whatever    a ddit ion al inf ormation       it  required.    Whilst    the
  nq u i r y w a s sitting,        the T r e a s u r y Solicitors made constant reque sts to       this
team, all of w h i c h we re met.            Unsolicited, the South Yo rkshire Police produced
n u m erou s      p h oto gra phs and plans for use by the Inquiry.             Ea ch of  the   police
w i t n e s s e s that w e r e called gave their testimony fully and voluntarily.

De s pit e  the p olic y of openness adopt ed by the South        York shire  Police,  some
in divi dua l    offi cers     may  have  felt  under    severe     attack   from  the   10
re pre sent ati ve  C o un sel who had the opport uni ty w i t h the benefit of   hindsight
to quest ion them about their actions and decisions.


As   Lord   Justic e Taylor complimented certain officers for the w a y they  gave
their   evidence but has not indi cated w h i c h officers he has criticised,   the
Ch ief Co nstable is of the v iew that it wou ld serve no purpose to speculate.



R e s o l u t i o n 5c.


Fhat— steps— he has taken to r e vie w and change the                 planning,   proced ure s   and
op e r a t i o n  of  the   Force   since the H ill s b o r o u g h disaster   in   light   of   the
c o m m e n t s and criti cism s of the T a ylo r Inquiry, particularly t h o se contained in
C h a p t e r 18.                                                             ---------------------


The     planning proc edu res involved in the policing of football even ts have been
r e v iewe d and supp leme nte d as follows.’-
    (i)   The South Y o r k shi re P ol ice have entered into a w r i t t e n agreement         with
           each   of    the      football    league clubs     in   the      County.      The  writte n
           agreement covers such m a t t e r s as club/police liaison be fore any event;
           the pr epa r a t i o n of cont in g e n c y plans; dem arc a t i o n of r esp onsibilities
           in   the filling and mon it o r i n g of the terraces;             pr ovis ion and use  of
           cutt ing equipment; plans for relieving overcrowding, etc.

   (ii)   The o pera tio nal planning for each football m a t c h in S o u t h Yor kshire is
          i ntended to enable the po lice to cope w i t h foreseeable patterns in the
          arrival    at,    and de part ure from, the    event    by   spectators.         The
          fo llowing scen arios are each catered for by w a y of c o n t i n g e n c y plans:-

           a)   all ticket, or o the rwis e restricted, m a t c h e s
           b)   ear ly a r riv al of spectators
           c)   u nex pe c t e d and joint arrival of large n u m be rs of spectators
           d)   i ndiv idu al section of ground ap proaching c apacity
           e)   w h o l e ground approa chin g capacity
           f)   late a r riv al of spectators
           g)   e m e r g e n c y opening of external gates, (or forcing of external
                    gates), there by a l l o wing an influx of spectators
          h)    ear ly depar tur e of spect ato rs from ground
          i)    e m e r g e n c y evacuation


          A  reserve    of officers is m ain ta i n e d at each ground to            enable   their
          rapid  d ep loy ment to any d i f f i c u l t y w h i c h m a y arise inside or   outside
          the ground.


 (iii)    The   South  Yor ksh ire P o lic e now liaise w i t h the fire               and    ambulance
           services at the time of plann ing for a football event.

  (iv)    A   m ode l  South Yo rks hire Po lice opera tio nal order for football events
           is   nearin g  completion.     O p e r a t i o n a l orders have been obtained  from
          most Force s in Engla nd and W a l e s - best practise has been adopted           and
          the     lessons   learned from the H i l l s b o r o u g h disaster (highlighted   at
          pa ragr aph s 273 and 274 of the Taylor Report) have been incorporated.

   (v)    The    South    Y o r k shi re P o l i c e have prepared a v ide o tape    film w hi ch
          h ig hli ght s   the     problems of crowd density,        crowd dist res s and crowd
          dynamics.      The film will be used as a training aid for bo th police and
          stewards w h o monit or football crowds.

  (vi)    Furthermore,             the     police        Implem ent ati on T e a m    l^as    produced     a
          c o m preh ens ive       package deta ili ng the m e a s ure s w h i c h have alre ady        been
          taken      or    are recommended for the future at each football                      ground    in
          S outh     Y ork s h i r e    to ensure crowd safety.           T h e s e packages    have    been
          pr ovi ded     to the local a u thor iti es w h o each have a r e s p ons ibil ity             for
          the     safety cer tif ica tion at football grounds.                     Extr act s  from    these
          packages       were        ap pended to the Chief Con st a b l e ' s last report          to   the
          P ol ice A u t h o r i t y on 17 N o v e m b e r 1989.

These      steps    are  tog eth er intended to enhance the planning and operational
pr oce d u r e s involved in the policing of football events in S outh Yorkshire.

     Resolution 5d.


        — steps he has taken to r e v i e w the change of m anagement training      appr aisa l
     and qual ity of officers of the Force since the H i l l s b o r ough disa ster in   light
     — — till c omments       and criticisms of the T ay lor             Inquiry,      p a r tic ula rly   those
     contained in C h a p t e r 18.                                                                     --------


     C h a pte r 18 of L o r d Justice Taylor's Interim Report states that     " ...over   ma ny
     years      the S outh Yo rks hire Police have g iven excellent service to the      public.
     They      have   h a n dled crowd problems sensi tiv ely and successfully    at  a   large
     number      of football games including major matches,       during strikes in the coal
     industry and the steel industry, and in other contexts...".

    The   manageme nt training,  appr aisal and s election processes that exist w i t h i n
    the   Force  are   all targetted to achieve a con ti n u a t i o n of that "excellent
    service   to the public" of South Yorkshire.      Such matters are under     constant
    re view and any changes consi dere d appropriate w i l l be introduced.

    The policing of football match es has t r a d it iona lly been regarded by the police
    service    as     a whole as a particular                     public  order    problem.    T r a i nin g  has
    reflected this v i e w - poli cing of football has been subsumed in general public
    order    training.           In the light of the H i l l s b o r o u g h disaster there are clearl y
    po lic ing  m a t ters specific to football events that warrant a                       training       input,
    eg,    Safety    C e r t i f i c a t i o n matters,        football crowd dynamics,      communications,
    in telligence gathering,                 cont in g e n c y planning,   CCTV    utilisation,      membership
    schemes,      etc.           The       Association         of   Chief  Polic e   Officers    has     alrea dy
    recommended       that these matter s be subject of a carousel course at the                           Police
    Staff    College,        Bramshill.            W h e n this course is arranged the Chi ef C o n s t abl e
    wi ll ensure that South York shir e officers attend.

    W i t hin Force,     the  su perintendents who have a    responsi bili ty for   pol icin g
    ar rangements     at the five football league grounds in South Y o r k s hir e have been
    co-opted onto the Impl emen tat ion Team wh i c h has been tasked w i t h  imp lementing
    the r e com men dati ons cont ained in the Taylo r Inte rim Report.




    Resolution 6


    That,   as p r e v i o u s l y requested by minute 81.2 of 29 September 1989, progre ss
    reports be s ubmitted to each scheduled meeti ng of the Auth ority until       further
    notice.


    There   is little by the w a y of further progress to report in addition to                           that
    alrea dy reported to the A u t h o r i t y on 17 N o v e m b e r 1989.

    As  outl ined   at p aragraph 3.3 of that report the Police I mplementation                 Team
    provided   each local aut hor ity w i t h a comp rehe nsi ve report of what the         police
    have so far achieved.          The A uth orit ies wer e each asked to convene a m e e t i n g to
    discuss   the   report relative to their area and what still remains to be done
    through the L o c a l A u t h or ity L i c e n sing Committees.

    Item four dealt w i t h the increased costs for pol icin g football                  matches.      The
    Chief    C o n s t a b l e can no w report that the A s s o c i a t i o n of Chief Police    Offi cer s
    Su b-Co mmittee          on  Hoo lig a n i s m at Sporting Events has        undertaken   to   re view

football.  T h e y w i l l report in due course.

The  officer refe rred to at p a r a g r a p h 9.3 has now be en retired from the Force,
on the grounds of ill-health.

On   30 N o v e m b e r 1989     it was a n n o u nce d that the Chi ef C onstable and the           South

A.3     M e m b ers   wi ll be aware that a p r o p o r t i o n of p o l i c i n g costs is met by           the
        footb all      clubs    themselves.    At present the fi nan cial              cont r i b u t i o n   is
        determined        by   r eference to a slid ing scale of c h a rges            agreed       annually
        be t w e e n the Police Authority,     the Chief C o n s t a b l e and each of the clubs,
        based up on a prio r est imat e of crowd size for a p a r t i c u l a r game.                   In the
        two      seasons     1987/88   and 1988/89 the total cost of                polic ing     the       five
        football clubs in South Yorkshi re,             both inside and outside the                 grounds,
        amoun ted to some £1.83 m i l l i o n and, of this figure, the clubs contri bute d
        £3 9 8 , 0 0 0 w h i c h amount s to 2 2 % of the over all cost.

4.4     In     the       light    of   Lord Justice            Tay lor 's recommendations  many  Police
        A u t h o r i t i e s are n o w r e a s s e s s i n g the charges levied on football clubs   for
        special police services.

4.5     The     f a c ilit y   to charge for police offi cer s in          these       circumstances   is
         pr o vid ed     by S e ct ion 15 of the Police Act 1964,           w h i c h enables the   Chief
         Constable,         at   his discretion,   to provide,        on request,          special police
         se rvices       at    any premises or in any l o c ali ty in the            police   area.   The
         sect ion       further     empowers  the  Police A u t h o r i t y     to    charge   for  these
         services.

4.6     There is no precise d e f i n i t i o n of the term 'special police services         but
         the   case of H arris -v- Sh eff ield United F o o t b a l l C l u b 1986 held that the
         Chief    Con sta ble is not,    as part of his norma l po lic i n g     responsibility,
         obli ged   to provid e offic ers to react to p o t e n t i a l breaches of the    peace
         where the owner of private p r o p e r t y cre ate s such a ris k on his property.

4.7         It wo uld seem,         therefore, that off ice rs p r o v i d e d to meet such a risk, as
            in the case of a football match, are w i t h i n the m e a n i n g of special police
            services          and  can be charged for.     Indeed,        Polic e Authorities   have  a
            f i d u c i a r y duty to the rat epa yers of their area to make such charges.

 4.8        The      H arr is case,       however,        doe s not fully resolv e w h i c h officers c a n be
            regar ded         as p erf or m i n g special police services.               It held that the    fact
            that       officers      were        dep loy ed on private           property   was  significant in
            tend ing to show their p r o v i s i o n a mounted to special police services,                    but
            did       not     deal wi th the q u e s t i o n of offi cers de plo y e d to        perform   duties
            outside          the ground - du ties that arise d i r e c t l y from the event w h i c h          is
            o c c u r r i n g inside the ground.              Lega l o p i n i o n has,   therefore, been sought
            for       clarification         as to w h i c h duties p e r f o r m e d by     police  officers   at^
             football         mat ches     can p r o p e r l y be rega rded as 'special         police   serv ces

 4.9        Notwithstanding      the   q u e s t i o n of payment for police    deployment  o u t s id ®
            football grounds it is su bmitted that the level of cont ribution from                  the
            clubs    pres ent ly falls sig nif i c a n t l y short of the actual cost of ° f f^ e r s
            inside the ground, and that the shortfall is set to w i d e n in the light of
            the T a ylo r recomm end ati ons w h i c h n e ce ssi tate an increase in the number ot
             po lice officers deployed at football matches.

  5     1    During       the     course     of    the    Hi llsb o r o u g h   Inquiry       the   question    of
             ma n s l a u g h t e r  by   the  crimi nal    negligence  of  South Y o r J sh^ *
             of ficers           was   raised by c o un sel for the bereaved,  Mr Benet     Hytner             QC.


  5.2        Because this m a t ter was not dealt with in the Report of the
             Inqu iry the Chief Constable,      on the m o r n i n g of the Report ^ Publicat                      ,
             referred   it  to    the Dire cto r of Public       Pr osecutions,  asking  for




                                    y                                                     Q    A    *   HqqTv^j-
    de cis i o n on the q u e s t i o n of criminal liability of any member of the South
    Yo rks hire    Police.        It    was c onsidered appropriate,     at  that  time,  to
    suspend      from duty the p ol ice commander of the H i l l sbo roug h event,     Chief
    Superintendent David Duckenfield,                pend ing the outcome of the  Director's
    deliberations.       Mr D u c k e n f i e l d remains suspended.

3   On 15 August 1989,       the D i r ec tor wr ote to the Chief Constable setting out
    his     vi ew that   the     matter         should   be   subject  of    a  full    criminal
    investigation.       The     West Midlan ds Police had alrea dy done           considerable
    w o r k in gathering e v i d e n c e for Lord Justice Taylor's Inquiry.            It seemed
    sensible,     therefore,       to     invite      Mr  Geoffrey Dear Q PM    DL   LLB,  Chief
    Co nstable    of   the   West       M i d l and s  Police   Force,    to   undertake    this
    investigation.       His     report,         in   due course,   will be submitted to     the
    Director of Public Prosecut ion s.

1   Additionally, the C h i e f C o n s tab le has asked that if, during the course of
    their   investigation,       the    West   Midl and s Police officers   d iscover  any
    matters   which might suggest that offences were             committed    against  the
    Police (Discipline) R egul ations, of a non-criminal nature, those offences
    should   be brought to his att ent ion and,          where appropriate,    be enquired
    into by the West M i d l a n d s Po lice on behalf of the South York shi re Police.
    This is agreed.


2   T here  are currently se ven matters of public complaint about the  actions
    of   South  Yorkshire  Police   officers,  arising  from  the  Hillsborough
    incident.

3   T hree       of these m a t t e r s have be en raised by a       single  complainant.   Two
    relate        to the actions of the senior officers in command of the              policing
    op era tion      at  H i l l s b o r o u g h o n the day and these are being supervised  by
    Ca p t a i n   E Noel      Taylor          of   the  Police  Complaints   Authority.    The
    investigation of these complaint s is being conducted by Mr Geoffrey Dear,
    Chief        Constable     of the West Midlands Police,           along wit h the  criminal
    matters.        The third co mpl a i n t is of incivility and is being investigated,
    unsupervised by the P ol ice C ompl ain ts Authority, by Superintendent As hton
    of the South Y o r k shi re Police.

4   A  fourth complaint is that an officer at the perimeter fence contributed
    to  the death of the c o m p l a i n a n t ' s son by his failure to open the fence
    gate in good time.

5   A  fifth complaint is that the failure by South Yor kshire Police officers
    to open perimeter fence gates caused the complainant to sustain injury.

6   A sixth complaint is made by a man w ho alleges that he was assaulted by a
    police officer whilst a t t e ndi ng the football match.

7   These  latter three cases are again to be investigated by Mr Dear's   team
    and are likewise be ing superv ised by Captain E Noel Taylor of the Police
    Complaints Authority.

8   There   is  a seventh comp laint of corruption,  namely of police   officers
    of fering  to a llow fans into the ground on payment.   This  complaint   is
    being   investigated by Superintendent Carlisle of the Greater    Manchester
    Police.

As stated in his report of 17 N o v e m b e r 1989, the Chief C o n s t a b l e has asked the
Director            of Public Pr ose cutions to ad vise upon the criminal                     co nse q u e n c e s  of
such        actions.            The    Director,       in    turn,   has   called for       a    full      criminal
i n v e s t i g a t i o n w h i c h is o n-going and is b ein g conducted,            independently, by the
West       Midlands           Police,     wh o   w i l l a l s o pursue any   c omplaints        or    dis cip l i n e
matte rs that arise.                 U ntil that report is available and the Dir ect or of Public
Prosecutions,               the     Police A u t h o r i t y and the C hie f Con st a b l e have    made         their

All   comment    or criticisms c o n t a i n e d in the Report were,                     wh ere appropriate,
transpos ed   as   r ecommendations      and     all  affecting  the                     police  ha ve  been
impl emen ted as previo usl y r e p or ted to the Committee.




R e s o l u t i o n 5b.

The   c o m m ents and criticisms of the T a y l o r Inquiry w i t h regard to the evi den ce
given     to the Inquiry by police o f f i c e r s of the South Yor ksh ire Force and    the
ma nner in w h i c h such evidence was given.

Of the 172 witnesses, who gave oral evidence to Lord Justice T a y l or's Inquiry,
59 of the m (over 33%) wer e Sou th Y o r k s h i r e Police officers.          The Force adopted
a policy of complete openness and h elpf uln ess towards the Inquiry.                      F o l l ow ing
the disaster,        the Chief C o n s t a b l e ' s concerns w e r e those of the I n qu iry itself
- to    discover      exactly what h a p p e n e d and to make sure that not hing            like      it
could h a p p e n a gain in South Y o r k s h i r e or elsewhere.        To this end,     the      Chief
C on stable     set   up  a liaison tea m w h i c h furnished the Inquiry w i t h          over       900
statements       and   whatever    a d d i t i o n a l information    it  required.     Whilst        the
Inquiry     w as sitting,    the T r e a s u r y Solicitors made constant requests to               this
team, all of w h i c h were met.         Unso lici ted , the South Yor kshi re Polic e p roduced
numerous      photo gra phs and plans for use by the Inquiry.                Each of    the      police
w it nesses that w e r e called gave t h e i r testimony fully and voluntarily.

Despite        the polic y of openness a d o p t e d by the South   Yor kshi re  Police,  some
individual          officers   may  have     felt     under  severe   atta ck   from  the   10
r e p r e sen tat ive  Counsel who had the oppor tun ity wit h the benefit of        hindsight
to q u e stio n them about their a c t i o n s and decisions.

As  Lo rd     J u s tic e Taylor c o m p l i m e n t e d certain officers for the w a y th ey gave
their   ev ide nce but has not i n d i c a t e d w h i c h officers he      has  criticised,   the
Chief C o n s t a b l e is of the v i e w that it wou ld serve no purpose to speculate.

                 p ar agr aph s 273 and 274 of the T a y l o r Report) have been incorporated.

           (v)   The   Sout h   Y o r k sh ire Police have prepared a video   tape   film w h i c h

                 S ou th     Yorkshire           to ensure crowd safety.                T hes e packages    have     been

                 the       sa fety certif ica tio n at foot bal l grounds.                       Extracts  from    these
                 pa ckages         were       appen ded to the C h i e f Co nstable's last report               to    the
                 P o l i c e A u t h o r i t y on 17 N o v e m b e r 1989.

        These      steps    are  together intended to enhance the planning   and o perational
        pr oce d u r e s involved in the policing of football events in South Yorkshire.
Resolution 5d.

The       steps he has taken to r e v i e w the change of management tra ini ng            a ppraisal
and q u a l i t y of officers of the For ce since the Hil ls b o r o u g h d i s a s t e r in   light
of      the      comments      and c r itic ism s of the T a y l o r Inquiry, particularly      those
c o n t a i n e d in C h a pte r 18.

C h a p t e r 18 of L o r d Justice T a y l o r ' s Int eri m Report states that    " . . .ov er   ma ny
years        the South Yo rks hir e P o lic e have given excellent service to the               public.
They        have  handled     crowd pr obl e m s s e nsit ive ly and su cce ssfully    at     a   large
number        of football games i n c l udi ng m a j o r matches,     during strikes in the coal
i n d ustr y and the steel industry, and in other contexts...".

Th e      m a n a g e m e n t training,   a p p r a isa l and s ele ction processes that exist within
the       Force         are    all targ etted to achie ve a con tinu ati on      of  that   "excellent
serv ice          to the public" of S outh Yorkshire.                Such matters are under   constant
r e v i e w and any changes c o n s i d e r e d a pp rop riat e wil l be introduced.

The p o l i c i n g of football m a tche s has t r a d it ion ally been regarded by the police
service        as     a whol e as a p a r t i c u l a r               public   order   problem.    Training    has
re fle cted this vi ew - poli cing of football has been subsumed in g e ner al public
order      training.              In the light of the H i l l s b o r o u g h disaster there are clearly
policing         m a tte rs specific to footb all events that warrant a                         trai nin g  input,
eg,    Safety         C e r t i f i c a t i o n matters,            football crowd dynamics,     communications,
i nt ell i g e n c e gathering,               c o n t i n g e n c y planning,   CCTV   utilisation,    membership
schemes,           etc.           The       Association             of C hie f  Police   Officers    has   alrea dy
recommended           that these matter s be subject of a carousel course at the                            Police
Staff      College,           Bramshill.               W h e n this course is arranged the C h i e f Con st a b l e
wi ll ensu re that South Y o r k s hir e of fice rs attend.

Within       Force,     the    s uper int ende nts who have a       responsibility     for     policing
a rr ang e m e n t s at the five fo otb all league grounds in South Y o r k s h i r e have been
co -op t e d onto the I m p l e m enta tio n T e a m w h i c h has been tasked w i t h  i m p le men ting

have so far achieved.          The A u t h o r i t i e s were each asked to convene a m e e t i n g to
discuss      the  report relative to their area and what still remains to be                          done
t h r oug h the Local A u t h ori ty L i c e n s i n g Committees.

Item four dealt w i t h the i ncr ease d costs for policing football            matches.    The

       HILLSBOROUGH - ALL SEATED ACCOMMODATION

       MEETING WITH FOOTBALL AUTHORITIES


       Last week I sent Mr Walters a copy of a DOE submission of
       26 April to their Ministers.   You will know from that paper that
       DOE envisage Mr Ridley meeting the football authorities to
       discuss the Government's ideas about all-seated accommodation at
       major football clubs in the week beginning either 8 or 15 May.

       2.   DOE officials have told us that they envisage that Home
       Office Ministers will not wish to take part in Mr Ridley's
       meeting with the football authorities, and that they will
       therefore invite a senior Home Office official only to attend.

       3.   I discussed this with Mr Turney before his departure for
       North America, and we both think that what DOE suggest is the
       right course.   We should however be glad to know whether the
       Home Secretary is content that no Home Office Minister should
       attend.   If so, I propose to attend (or possibly Mr Turney if
       the meeting takes place after his return).

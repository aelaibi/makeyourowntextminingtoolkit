HILLSBOROUGH

1.    The letter of 15 September       from Councillor H Chase,
Chairman of Liverpool City Council's Hillsborough Working Party
encloses a copy of the Working Party's Interim Report.

2.     The Report is very largely a selective critique of Lord
Justice Taylor's own Interim Report. The City Council's report
is broadly supportive of Taylor and asks for legislation to back
up his recommendations.

3.    It finishes (page 18) with anumber of recommendations
relating to ground safety, police operations and specifically
that the proposals for the national membership scheme and the
Football Licensing Authority are withdrawn.   The report does not
include   a   reasoned   case   supporting   the  NMS   and   FLA
recommendations, beyond a referr^ce to Lord Justice Taylor's
recommendation that all spectators should be able to pass through
the turnstiles in one hour.   There is of course no conflict here
with the proposed scheme since potential suppliers of the
technology say that some systems would mean no extra time would
be necessary to check the card at the turnstile. The report also
recommends a Royal Commission of Inquiry into football including
financing, administration, safety and supporter representation.

4.    It would clearly be inappropriate for the Minister to
comment on the report at this stage.   The attached draft reply
therefore simply acknowledges receipt.

  RE   CLOEZ A N TIPANIC BARRIERS




       Furt her to y o u r telephoned request of 08 January, we havfi
       pleasure in confirming that photo negatives of the C a r r i e r s
       be sent to yo u very shortly, together w i t h more information
       about the m o d i f i c a t i o n of terrace levels.

       Thank you for you r c o n tinued interest in the system.

       As you may know, the barriers are to be the subject of
       a B.B.C. T.V. d o c u m entary programme in the n ear future. The
       following information release is also going to be distri b u t e d
       to the press (popular and specialist) as well as all other
       organisations Interested In the problems of s p e ctator safety.
       We thought it might be of use to you, in p a r t i c u l a r in
       relation to the pressure resistance;       it appears that this
       aspect has not yet been clarified fully.

       We remain at y our disposal for any further information w hich
       you feel w o u l d help you.

       Regards,
b b t                                              ijti            s ir
 1C L O E Z ' ANTIPANIC BARRIERS - THE CO N T I N E N T A L SOLUTION
 TO CROWD CONTROL




 Spectator safety and pitch security.     These fundamental problems
 are today threatening the image of B r i t i s h football.

 The solution is the CLOEZ ANTIPANIC BARRIER system,               designed by
 French engineer Gerard Cloez.

 About to be installed in the third French stadium, Lyons
 (after Nlmes and Toulon) and u nder serious c o n s ideration by
 several European clubs, it has been recognised as the ideal
 c ombination of security (in p r o t e c t i n g the pitch from spectators)
 and safety (in p e r m i t t i n g evacuation in emergencies).

 A u t h o r i s e d by the French Football Federation, the system has
 also b een approved by the U.E.F.A. and the French Home Office.

 IN NORMAL USE, it prevents pitch invasion, conforming to U.E.F.A.
 and French national height and pressure regulations and .resisting
 even ^he most enthusiastic and 'vigorous' supporters.          At a
 recent pre s e n t a t i o n to,the Belgian Government Inspector of
 Security., this was put to the test in a d e m o nstration by all the
 hooligans in Nlmes!

 Under more intense l aboratory conditions (approved ’w i t h o u t
 r e s e r v e 1 by S O C O T E C , the international technical control company)
 it resists pressure of over 500 kgs per linear m e t e r at 1.10
 meters height from the ground.                This resistance can easily b,e
 upgraded by using larger support posts, but it is c o nsidered
 unnecessary;           after all, 500 Kgs is already a critical pressure
 for the human body.

 IN THE CASE OF UNCONTROLLED CROWD M O V EMENT AND PANIC, w h a t e v e r
 the cause, with its po t e n t i a l l y dangerous results, it can be
 opened to permit rapid, organised e vacuation of part or all of
 the stands and terraces to the most logical 'safe' area - the
 pitch.

 The functioning principals are, nevertheless, simple.            Throu gh
 strategically-placed control posts (operated either by remote
 control or manually) the adjoining gate is released and opens.
 T h e 1pivoting of the gate manoeuvres a special ' c a t c h 1 w h i c h
 releases the adjacent gate, w hich in turn liberates the next
 one;     thus, the open ing continues in a steady 'playing card'
 acti on and at an angle w h i c h diverts a crowd from a ' s t a m p e d e 1 .

        The CLOEZ ANTIPANIC BARRIER    system (patented in 34 countries)
        is currently under review by leading Brit i s h stadium designers
        and spec tator secu rity specialists, as well as the possibilities
        of modifying terraces to align the inferior steps wit h the
        pitch, thus e liminating the dangerous spectator traps next
        to the p itch (the case in many British stadia).

        An addi tional advantage is that, during matches, heavy general
        police presence Is not requ ired to m o n i t o r crowd activity and,
        In the first instance, to open the b a r r i e r s in case of incident.
        This is contrary to the situation required by alternative forms
        of crowd control b eing proposed.

        In France, strate g i c a l l y - p o s i t i o n e d club stewards assume the
       ^ ^ p o n s i b i l i t i e s while In permanent w a l k i e - t a l k i e contact with
       ^ffe club secu rity officer.             Police remain on hand, but out of
        sight, and only intervene if a prob l e m arises.

        The syst em Is now available in the U.K. and discussions are
        already u n d erway wit h several football clubs who are conscious
        of and concerned by the safety, as well as the security, of
        their spectators.

        After all, without them,          our nati onal     sport could no longer
        continue.

        The cost of installation depends on the ground p r e p a r a t i o n
        required, but it certainly comp ares very favourably w i t h
        alternative methods of crowd control b eing proposed.           With a
        view to assi sting the less weal t h y clubs to install the system,
        the possib i l i t y of sponsorship, Is b e i n g discussed with several ••
        companies.

        Use of the CLOEZ ANTIPANIC BARRIER system is not limited to
        football stadia, no r only to prote c t i n g a central area;
        organisers of outdoor entertainment events (concerts etc.)
        envisage installing the system to facilitate entry, and exit
        of their audiences.

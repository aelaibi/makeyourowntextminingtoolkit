               after        getting        into        the ground via a gate opened\I\ went into the tunnel

                do anything              about    it.      It was     just about         kick off    time when      I got   into

          near the       pen gate   had a helmet         on.

          As    I was being      crushed and      pushed forward a man                collapsed      to the

          ground,     I was     near a crash barrier,            his mates were working                on him,        by

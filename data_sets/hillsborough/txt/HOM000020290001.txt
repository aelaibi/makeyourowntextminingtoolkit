ENGLAND -v- SWEDEN


You may recall that one of the points which attracted Lord
Justice Taylor's interest about the recent disturbances in
Stockholm was whether or not any of the English fans who were
arrested and subsequently released by the Swedish police had any
convictions here. Lord Justice Taylor has asked me once or twice
whether we have any information, and I have said that if we hear
anything I will pass it on to him. Perhaps I could just remind
you of our interest.  If you do get anything specific (and it may
be increasingly difficult with the passage of time) I should be
grateful.  But presumably somebody is following up the list of
names which the Swedish police are alleged to have passed on to
the British "authorities".

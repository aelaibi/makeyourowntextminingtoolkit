 Dear Mrs McBrien,

 I refer to your letter of 25th September 1990 in which you request times and
 copies of photographs of your son, John.

At present I have been asked not to release any material from the investigation
whilst legal advice is sought as to the legality of doing so.

As you know, the Inquests into the disaster commence in Sheffield on Monday
19th November 1990. You may think it appropriate to raise your request at that
time through the Coroner.


Yours faithfully,




Detective Superintendent

 Q U oA Si/ei*
                                                                                                              I attended      the

                    se#ffx-final football l ^ t c h                between Li^eTrpool and N o t t i n g h a m Forest

                    being       played at H i l l s b o r o u g h Football              Ground.

                    The      tickets       for    the m a t ch were         purchas e d by my broth^"' irrlaw

                              from N ot ti n g h a m Fore s t s         G r o u n d at the      price    of six     pounds

                    ea ch          I, myself am          not    either a L i verpool            or N o t t i n g h a m Forest     fan

                    but      I was a tt en d i n g       the m at c h because           I w a n t e d to see a semi-final

                    match      played.

                    M y 4 friends an d              I t r av el le d up to H i l l s b o r o u g h ground          in

                                        private      car.       We did not stop en route                 to the     ground and

                    were      not s u b j ec te d to a n y travel              delays.

                    We a r r i v e d      in S h e f f i e l d at a p p r o x i m a t e l y   1.45pm on that day.            We
                                                                                                          PAGE
                                                                                                          S 2 103

parked the vehicle              outside a school                 about    half a mile away from the

a ctual      gro u n d    I believe      on P en i s t o n e Road-         We    then    proceeded to walk

towards          the F o o tball     G r o u n d togejrfier with          the Liverpool        Supporters.

As we w a lk ed wit h          crowd     I rioViced numerous S u p p o r t e r s             carrying and

dr i nking        b e e r , a lot of t j / e      fans were sitting              on litter f o o tpaths        or

verges       drinking       I was     a no c k e d at      the    numbers       of fans doing       this,     there

seemed       no u rg e n c y f ojr them to make                 their way towards          the ground at

all,    they all          seeded to be         ’mill i n g a b o u t ’ eating           chips and drinking.

In contrast           to the s u p p o rt er s       we    passed,       my friends and        I were     rushing

towards          the Football         G r ou nd    thinking        that their w o u l d be      crowds

wait i n g       to enter     the     ground.

Most     of the drinking              fans     seemed to be well            awa y from the ground,

there     did      not see to         be man y       close to the actual            entrances.       It      was    a

warm     day and         I believe      this      led to a lot of the drinking,                    but most        of

the fans          seemed to have a number                  of    cans    each.     I did not see any

d i s o r d e r l y behaviour        at all       and the a t m o s p h e r e     seemed to be good.

I a rr i v e d at the         ground wit h my friends at a r o u n d 2 p m .                     There were         no

queues at S pi o n Kop end of the                     ground and we w a l k e d straight              to the

t,Mr nst i I as and handed over                our    tickets.

There     were a number             of both S t e w a r d s and P o l i c e m e n by the           turnstiles

but    neither        at the time        I ente r e d were          required to direct             volumes     of

Suppor t e r s .         I d i d n ’t see any other              gates    open    rear    to the    turnstiles

I did not witness a n y o ne               gaining         unauthorised          entry to the       ground.

Once     I was       inside    the    gro u n d    I made my way           towards       the S p i o n Kop

stand.           I. d i d n ’t notice    any signs          d i r ecting me       to the stand but, I

d i d n ’t have any trouble              finding          where    I was    to stand together w ith my

f r ie n d s .

I did not witness              any    c on su m p t i o n of any alcohol            in the ground at all

during       the time       I was     inside.

I was aware           just after        the m at ch a c t u a l l y       started       that there were

problems at           the o p p o s i t e       end of the           ground™       I could see thro u g h my

binoc u l a r s     that      people were             climbing        over    the top of the        pens and onto

the    pitch.         After       a few minutes               I realised s o m ething        serious      had

occurred.

I could see Li v e r p o o l             s up p o r t e r s    ripping       down boarding        from   round the

pitch to use as               stretchers,             and     I saw bodies         carried towards        the stand

w h e re    I stood.          I could see a m b u l a n c e s           in great      numbers      entering     onto

t h e pitch.

M y friends and             I d ec i d e d to         leave     the ground at a r o u n d 3 . 4 5 pm after

seeing       the    d is t u r b i n g   sights we had seen,                 the    dead bodies were         being

carried towards               our     stand and         left     in a line         beneath us.

I did not w it n e s s            a n y t hi n g    that      I would    consider      to be a criminal

offence        but there were                 numbers       of L i verpool      suppo r t e r s   urinating     in

the    street        prior      to the mat ch start i n g .

I believe          that     the     d i s aster was           handled a ^ / w e 11 as       it could have       bean

under       the    c ir c u m s t a n c e s    on that        day.       think      that the      excessive

drink i n g       by the      fans and          the    t o tal/lack      of urge n c y of the supporters

entering          the gr o u n d      in suff i c i a / t       time    prior      to the   start     of the m atch

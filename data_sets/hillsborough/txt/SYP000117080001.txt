                At 0830 on Saturday,                IS April 8 9 , I commenced duty at Doncaster HQ

                and was attached to Serial 27 under the control                   of PS Mozley?    I was

                to work     in company with PC 2752 Jowitt and our duty was to man one

                barrier at Penistone Road junction with Fielding Road.

                After a briefing at the football                ground H 75S and I went to the

                barrier neither of us were                in possession of a radio and were to meal

                after the match started one at a time.

                We manned the barrier                from 10.45 and were visited by PS Mosley and a

                Sheffield Division Inspector a number of times,                   both of those were in

                possession of radios.                From 11,30 there was a constant stream of
                                 O h l tS
                people     corning down the hill from Wads ley Bridge.

                They were all good humoured.

                At 12.30 there was a constant stream of people coming down the hill

                and. we commented to the Inspector that                  it looked like the train had

                a r r ived e a r l y .

                Most of the people              I saw were drinking from cans,      bottles and 2 litre
                                                                   'w

                A large proportion were very drunk and some were being helped along

                by friends.         By their        clothes and chanting it was apparent     that they

                were Liverpool              fans.
By 2 .00     pm the      pav e m e n t s and    roads were       c o ngested w i t h fans 90*^ were

c a r ry i n g ale o h o 1.

Fans    were asking           for    spare    tickets     and   complaining       that    unlike    last

year    there were        no ticket          touts and that       loads     of them had      come

expecting       to buy tickets.

The    crowds were        heavier and heavier                and the hill was a total             mass of

bodies and as            it a p p r o a c h e d 3 .0 0 pm people were      running    towards      the

L a p p i n gs Lane Stand.           I heard    it     said that      the Vers R oad Off          Licence

had shut down due              to no stock       left.

A few fans had been as k i n g where                   the Beeh i v e and another          pub was as

they knew the          landlord and were m e e t i n g           there,,

3.00    pm as the       game        started    fans were still         pouring down the           hill and

r unn :i.ng a 1 o ng t he      r oads .

P e o p l e were a s k in g     to pass our barrier and so 2 dosen old and young

people were a l l o w e d down the              centre       of the   road.    People were         still

running a r o u nd      trying        to get ar o u n d      to the West Stand.

PC Btub bins       then joined          us and said to fans            that   there was      no    point

running as the          game had started and £ , 0 0 0 were                 queuing      to get    in.

P eople were       coming       out    of the gr o u n d stating        it was    chaos     and that

people were        sitting          in their    seats     (appar e n t l y with   tickets).

The    crowd    in the gr o u n d were          ’roaring''      c o nstantly and still        there

were    people     running          down the Wads ley Bridge Hill.,

I was aware        of a large Pol i ce ga t h e r i n g         at    the end of F i e l d i n g Road./

L e p p i n g s Lane   but     I was    unaware what was          happening.       P e o p l e were

coming     out saying         its terrible           in there    ’people are d y i n g " .        Heard

fans    saying     som e t h i n g    had    collapsed and we a sked          passing     senior

officers       what    we sho u l d     do about       the   barrier and      they just      told us to

hang   on there,,

A   rumour     began that           the m atch was      off and the        pitch had been         invaded

by fans.        1 h eard this from passing spectators.

         seen on T.V.           that the wall      inside had collapsed and that many were

         seriously injured.               Other traffic mobiles then began to arrive and it

         was decided that 2 75 S would stay with the barrier and I would go into

         the ground to assist.

         I entered the ground at about 3.15 pm from the entrance between the

         North Stand and the Spi on H o p .

         1 was directed to join a line of officers across the centre of the

         pitch.       In front of me fans and police officers were i nte rmi rig 1 ed „

         the majority of fans seemed to be dased but there was the occasion

         when I saw fans shouting at officers and pointing at them,                            but other

         farts tried to calm them down and lead them away.

         The fans in the West Stand were pointing and chanting and people were

         climbing from the stand into the terrace.

         The fans behi nd us were f ai r 1y q u i e t and seemed to sense                    that

         s om e t h i n g wa s am i s s ..

         A scuffle began in the area below the Police                     control box and as we

         moved forwar d i t a ppear ed so di d t he c rowd and a cry r ose , so we we re

         Sita riding on the line,             the ground appeared to be absolutely packed and

         1 felt that <2N3g_ cheer from the Spi on Kop would, have brought                       the fans

         out of the Liverpool                terraces and onto the pitch.

         We were then directed to leave the ground and deal with crowds

         lea v i n g t h e g ro u n d .

         There was no trouble with crowds after the match at the junction of

         Fielding Road and Perri stone Road,              although I received a number of

         questions along the line of where was the nearest                       pub/off      licence.

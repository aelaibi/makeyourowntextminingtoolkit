    The rules for private
    prosecution need
    to be thoroughly
    reassessed, argues
    Stephen Silber, QC
                    ' ho should be allowed to
                      prosecute a crime? Many
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                             When a serious assault ease is dropped, the accused
                      offences cannot be prose­
                      cuted without the consent                                                                                                                                                                                                              are not always acquitted, says Bob Woffinden
    of a law officer or the Director of Public
    Prosecutions. These requirements can                                                                                                                                                                                                                            even Jehovah’s Witnesses will go to                                                Throughout the investigation, say the
    delay and burden the administration                                                                                                                                                                                                                             court in an unprecedented move to try                                           men, there was prejudice against them be­
    of the criminal justice system, so how                                                                                                                                                                                                                          to get charges against them that have                                           cause of their religious beliefs.

The tapes are identified by the prefixes TB1 and TB2. TB are the initials of
the police officer (Police Constable Trevor Bichard) who was responsible for
operating the CCTV cameras and recording equipment on that day.

                     Q. They did not know, and could not know, the state of the
                        Leppings Lane terraces?   They were on the wrong side of
                        it. - A. Mr. King I have nothing to add.

             B                 MR. KING:         Thank you.

                              THE    CORONER:       Mr. Catchpole?

                               MR.   CATCHPOLE:       Ihave no questions.

                             THE CORONER:   Mrs. McBrien, you will be a little
                        bit longer than that, I take it?

             C                 MRS. MCBRIEN:         Yes.

                               THE CORONER:         Miss Addleman?

                               MISS ADDLEMAN;         No questions, sir.

                              THE CORONER:          Mr. Russell?

                               MR. RUSSELL:         I have no questions.
             D               THE CORONER:   I do not think it is worth starting
                        before lunch but there is just one thing which the jury
                        have mentioned to me.   In fact they have mentioned it
                        twice, and that is what about the video evidence of the
                        terraces.   I h3ve had the videos looked at and there is
                        actually next to nothing on the videos because, of
                        course, not everything was recorded.   That does not mean
                        to say they weren’t possibly scenes, but there is, I
             E          understand, a little tiny bit which is actually on the
                        compilation which you have seen.   There is another
                        little bit which starts at 15.03 and goes on for a few
                        minutes.

                             What we have done is that we have clipped it, if
                        that is the right word, and we will show it to you, but
                        it is very poor quality and I do not think it is going to
                        help us very much.   As far as I can tell there isn t
             F          much recorded.   Does that help?

                             Right, two o'clock. Mr. Duckenfield you will
                        remember you are still on oath.

                     Cross-Examined by MR, PAYNE:

BJ   Q.   SergHant Goddard, just one general question, please,
          prefa&ed with this.   Can you tell the Jury how long
          you ha^e been a serving Police Officer? - A. I was a
          Cadet fofc Sheffield City in 1959 and appointed Police
          Officer ik 1962.

     Q.   For how long\have you been a Sergeant? - A. October
          1976.

CJ   Q.   Without going into detail, as part of your duty you
          have to attend at\all manner of events and
          emergencies? - A. Ifes sir.

          I want you to put thex^vent when you were in the
          Control Box and you started to receive the calls from
          Mr. Marshall outside to open the gates because
          otherwise someone would be killed, just put that in
          the circumstances in which it happened, put that in
          the context of your experience as a Police Officer.
          How does this rank in terms of emergencies that you
          have been involved in? - A. The most dire emergency
          certainly.   I had never known anything before like
          this at all.

               THE CORONER:Sergeant Goddard^ I    am most
          grateful   to you for being here. Thank you very much
          for helping us.

               What we are now going to do is we are going to
          hear Mr. Bichard in a moment.    We are going to press
          on today, but what I want to do is you will remember
          you were   asking about the video, and I think we will
          show this video now of the scene as far as we have got
          it at Leppings Lane.   In fact, it was, of course,
          taken by Mr. Bichard so it is a convenient time to
          actually look at it, but I am going to get Mr. Killoch
          who has actually selected the piece out that we need
          to describe it.

                        JOHN KILLOCH Recalled

                            By THE CORONER:

          Give your name so we know who you are. - A. Sergeant
          John Killoch, sir, West Midlands Police.  I have just
          taken a short sequence from one of the South Yorkshire
          Police videos, which shows pictures taken from one of
          the CCTV cameras situated at the ground on 15th April.
          These show scenes inside Leppings Lane of the Leppings
          Lane pens, the West Stand.  I should mention, sir, I
          think the Jury are already aware but some of the
                                                   62

                                            J. KILLOCH


pictures are in what they call time lapse, so that it
will jump.

     THE CORONER:  Yes.  It is not very long, about 10
or 15 minutes.
Before we start, can you remember what time the
sequence begins? - A. It starts, sir, at approximately
15.02 and the first few frames are actually shown on
the concourse area, and then the camera moves into the
West Stand.

              (The video was shown)
        MR. BEECHEY:   That is C.539.

     THE CORONER:   Have got an identification number or
something on the tape so that we know?

     MR. KILLOCH:   Yes, sir.   The original
identification is TB.l.   That is the West Midlands
Police reference.

        THE CORONER:   Mr. Maxwell?

     MR. MAXWELL:   Sir, I am here today as you might
have guessed in order to present to you written
submissions on law of the Sheffield City Council.    I
would normally do that, of course, at the end of the
evidence.   That may yet be possible, but perhaps not
today, but we obviously want to comply with your
timetable.   At the moment it is a bit like Blue Peter,
"Here is one I made earlier"!   Sir, in due course, it
will be presented.

     Sir, there are certain matters I would wish to raise
with you now and which might be better dealt with in the
absence of the Jury, with our leave, sir.

                   (The Jury left Court)
    \

     MR^. MAXWELL:    Sir, I have kept up with the evidence
in theseXlnquests with my daily dose of transcript and
the coramer*ts I make to you now concern the ending of
these Inquests and the ending of the evidence.     They are
intended to bfcshelpful.    I hope they are not taken as
some forensic cri de coe u r, but there may be an element
of that in it.

     Sir, you may remember that case where the evidence
that went before an Inquest was likened to the tip of an
iceberg.   Normally, of bourse, icebergs get smaller but
there is at least a risk, sir, of the evidence here
getting larger in quantum and may be getting unbalanced.
Alternatively it may be that the Jury is about to be
asked to look unnecessarily beld*? the water line.

     I know you have considered this already but there
are reasons why in ray respectful submission you could
reconsider the point.    Messrs. Goddardy Bichard and Ryan
have run as a trio, or Goddard and Bichar<| as a duo, for
a long time in these proceedings.    I knowxyou have
considered already just how far one should go. with their
evidence.

     Sir, I comfort myself in asking you to reconsider
the position with two thoughts.   The first is that you
have always shown that as your own man, and as very

1       BA C K G R O U N D

         1.1     In early December 1996, Granada TV screened a drama-documentary
                 programme concerning the Hillsborough Stadium disaster. It has since been
                 said by the Hillsborough Family Support Group (HFSG) in a letter of the 4th
                 M arch 1997 that the pre-production research for the programme and its
                 subsequent airing has brought to light fresh evidence and/or new witnesses
                 proving that suppression of evidence, perjury and conspiracy to pervert the
                 course of justice featured in the legal process that followed the disaster. In
                 addition letters have been received from the families o f some of the deceased
                 requesting re-examination of the circumstances of the tragic events. As a
                 result o f the above, internal correspondence has been generated between the
                 South Yorkshire Police, the Home Office, the Legal Secretariat to the Law
                 Officers (LSLO) and the CPS. A letter of 23/1/97 from Stephen W ooler of
                 the LSLO to Peter Pearson at Central Casework, York stated that at present
                 there was nothing in the television programme that materially affects the
                 applications (for consent to apply to a High Court Judge for an order directing
                 the hold of a fresh inquest) which the Attorney General had already
                 considered. In each of those cases it was concluded that there was not a
                 realistic prospect of the high Court granting such an order. In addition the
                 television programme itself was not evidence.

        1.2      On the 4th March 1997, Ms Anne Adlington, a solicitor representing the
                 HFSG wrote to the Director enclosing a bundle o f documents and counsel’s
                 opinion. A fax was then received from Trevor Hicks, the chairman of the
                 HFSG, with his copy letter making allegations of the suppression of evidence
                 etc. as noted above. It was supported by a draft statement. Both this
                 statement and counsel’s opinion contained representations as to what should
                 happen now on the basis of the ‘new evidence’. A request was made for a
                 meeting with a senior CPS lawyer. The correspondence was acknowledged
                 by the Director’s office stating that a substantive reply would be provided
                 when the contents of the reports had been considered.

         1.3     The LSLO had considered it to be important that while each of the various
                 Government Departments must form their own judgem ent in relation to the
                 discharge of their own duties, it was equally important that there was a co­
                 herent and co-ordinated response to the representations made. Accordingly
                 on the 10th March 1997 a meeting was held at the Home Office with
                 representatives of their Police Policy Directorate (PPD ), of the LSLO and of
                 CPS Central Casework. It was decided that each o f the three groups should
                 report back to the PPD having conducted separate reviews of the allegations
                 made by Mr. Trevor Hicks and Alun Jones QC.

         1.4     On the 13th March 1997 the reviewing lawyer had a full day’s conference

MMS/246.97.V02                                  3
                 with Chief Superintendent Lowe and D .C. Greenaway of South Yorkshire
                 Police at their offices in Sheffield. Original video tapes exhibited to the
                 Taylor enquiry and to the Coroner’s Hearing were viewed and access was
                 made to the transcripts of those hearings and to original witness statements.

         1.5     On the 1st April 1997 the Daily M irror printed a report on Hillsborough. It
                 included an erroneous comment that the CPS had said "the nature and
                 volume" of the new evidence had forced it to re-open the enquiry into the
                 crush that killed the 95 Liverpool fans. The nature o f this report was indeed
                 much o f the earlier correspondence from the H FSG being made public.

         1.6     On the same day South Yorkshire Police issued a statement in response to the
                 press report to the effect that there was no new evidence.

         1.7     On the 7th April, a letter from Miss Adlington drew CPS Central Casework
                 attention to points made in the police statement and the HFSG rebuttal of
                 them. A reply was made to the effect that a full response could not be given
                 within 14 days of the previous acknowledgement from the CPS, but the matter
                 was receiving immediate consideration.

         2.1     The new evidence is said to be

                 2.1.1   A video tape of footage from the scoreboard camera, known as camera
                         5, of the Leppings Lane Terraces area where the deaths occurred.

                 2.1.2   An affidavit (dated 25th November 1996) and statement (dated 11th
                         May 1989) of a Roger Houldsworth, the engineer responsible for the
                         design and maintenance of the Club and Police CCTV systems in
                         operation at Hillsborough Stadium. Exhibited to the affidavit are
                         comments on 13 points concerning the police evidence to the Taylor
                         enquiry and to the Coroner’s Inquest.

                 2.1.3   The statement of a Doctor Walker who volunteered his services at the
                         Northern General Hospital where many o f the crush victims were
                         taken. He was involved in the resuscitation o f the injured.

        2.2      This ‘new evidence’ will be considered in detail in parts 6 to 8 of this report.

         These are divided into two parts, those concerning the video evidence and those of
         the medical evidence. They have been made by Trevor Hicks, Alun Jones QC and
         Roger Houldsworth and will be considered in that order.


         Video Evidence -

         Trevor H icks says that:

         3.1     P .C .’s Ryan and Bichard perjured themselves in giving evidence o f the
                  footage from camera 5 and the extent to which that camera could be used to
                  view the Leppings Lane terraces.

         3.2     The person who edited the inquest exhibit C278, known as the ‘compilation
                  video’, must have been aware of the extensive footage from camera 5 but this
                  footage was not produced despite several requests from the Inquest Jury.

        3.3      Had the footage been produced and shown to the Jury it would have totally
                 changed their view of what the police could see.

        A lun Jones QC says that:-

        3.4      Video Tapes were deliberately suppressed and a number of officers committed
                 perjury.

        3.5      The evidence of Mr. Houldsworth was also deliberately suppressed.

        3.6      The HFSG have acquired from Yorkshire Television tapes which appear to be
                 those, or copies of those, taken away or stolen immediately after the disaster.

        3.7      A tape (containing footage from camera 5) indicates that police officers were
                 lying and that pictures of all relevant areas of the ground were clear, detailed
                 and uninterrupted, contrary to the police evidence referred to by Mr.
                 Houldsworth in his affidavit of November 1996. Events in the relevant area
                 (Leppings Lane Terraces) may not, for various reasons, have been recorded
                 on tape between 14.30 and 15.00 hours, but they were clearly visible on the
                 monitors to those on duty at the time.

        3.8      The Coroner had said that the assessment of the Terraces "may be the single
                 most important factor" or a "very important factor" which the Jury have to
                  weigh. The above evidence was not available in 1993 and yet it touched the
                  core issue before 15.15 hours, the cut off time. It would have been of crucial
                  significance to the High Court in 1993 as well as the Jury in 1991.

         R oger Houldsworth says that:

         3.9     At 0800 hrs. on the day of the disaster he had given all the cameras a final
                 check. There had been a problem with the score-board camera involving
                 flaring (picture white-out) due to an electrical fault when the score-board came
                 into use. There was no problem with the quality o f the picture. By the time
                 he had finished his check, everything was working OK. P.C . Ryan came in
                 during this check and he would have shown both him and P.S. Goddard that
                 the cameras were working when he had finished. His 13 comments on the
                 police evidence are as follows:-

                 3.9.1   P.C . Ryan (who was in charge of telephones and public address system
                         in the police control box) says in his evidence to the Taylor Enquiry
                         re camera 5 that there was an apparent fault with it, the picture was
                         very distorted and was never satisfactory as far as he could recall, it
                         was not as clear as you would hope the picture to be and it was the
                         quality of that picture which was the problem.

                 RH:     The quality of the picture was never a problem, the flaring was fixed
                         by disconnecting the earth during the morning.


                 3.9.2   PS Goddard (who was in charge of the radios in the police control
                         box) says in his evidence to the Taylor Enquiry that it was not possible
                         to tell from the control box that the pens three and four (the central
                         pens where the injuries occurred) were full and that at no stage before
                         he saw people climbing over the pens did he notice any over-crowding.

                 RH:     He was able to see what the police could see on their monitors and he
                         specifically remembers that when the order was given to open the gates
                         he could see pens three and four were full to the point o f over­
                         crowding.


                 3.9.3   P.S. Goddard gave evidence of a blind spot down at the front o f the
                         fencing whereby the first two rows of the Terrace were obstructed and
                         although you could see figures you would not be able to pick them out
                         individually.

                 RH:     Based on his knowledge of the control box the evidence did not make
                         any sense to him.


                 3.9.4   P.C . Bichard in his evidence to the Taylor Enquiry claimed, just like
                         P.C . Ryan, that there was a problem with the score-board camera
                         over-looking the Terraces (camera 5). He said that there had been
                         difficulty with that camera over a number of weeks; when the system
                         was switched on the picture would go white. It was thought to be a

MMS/246.97.V02                                   7
                         problem with the electrical supply to the camera. On the day it was
                         not up to the mark but was a lot better than it had been. "We were
                         getting pictures, that is the best way of describing it." At the inquest
                         P.C. Bichard said that camera 5 had been faulty and you were getting
                         what was called flare, that is, a reflection of light and coloured objects
                         whereby the picture was lost. He went on to say that the camera was
                         not being used as much as it normally would be because of the sub­
                         standard picture. It was inadequate.

                 RH:     While P.C . Bichard gave an accurate description of what the problem
                         had been the engineer disagreed that the camera was not up to the
                         mark. As far as he was concerned the camera was working perfectly
                         after he had fixed it during the morning.


                 3.9.5   At the Inquest, P.C . Bichard gave his opinion that it was not possible
                         to get what he would call a "view" of the centre pens from any of the
                         cameras and agreed with a comment that it was not possible to zoom
                         in so that one could clearly identify a given individual and clearly see
                         facial features.

                 RH:     He considers that it is possible to pick out facial features with the
                         camera and says that this is borne out by the evidence o f the families
                         and lawyers who went to the ground. He does agree that it would be
                         more difficult to pick out facial features while events are happening
                         but considers that this was not the specific question that PC Bichard
                         was asked and responded to.

                 3.9.6   P.C . Bichard in evidence to the Taylor enquiry said that because o f the
                         position and angle of camera 5 it gave a false impression about the
                         crowd that was there. The picture created was a bit o f an illusion
                         about the crowd that was in there. The position was that it was
                         difficult to assess that the pens would be getting over-crowded.

                 RH:     He did not consider that the above explanation made any sense at all.
                         He considers that there was a perceptive depth which would give an
                         indication of density and disagreed that it was difficult to assess that
                         the pens were getting over-crowded from the view of camera 5.


                 3.9.7   Again in his evidence to the Taylor enquiry P.C . Bichard said that
                         whilst the colour camera (camera 2) provided a better angled view of
                         the terraces it did not provide a close up picture as camera 5. The
                         zoom facility of the colour camera was not good enough to see
                         whether or not people were being crushed against the perimeter
                         fencing in pens 3 and 4. While the view enabled you to see the fence
                         you could not get a close up of the people there, that is, at best 30 or
                         40 heads and shoulders. At the inquest the officer said that the zoom

MMS/246.97.V02                                   8
                        magnification of the colour camera was insufficient to create
                        identification.

                 RH:    He considers that the magnification of the colour camera, which was
                        designed for identification purposes was reasonable. He says that the
                        evidence of P.C . Bichard was contradictory and not altogether truthful.
                        You could certainly identify individuals with it as well as
                        distinguishing their clothing. A shot could give you six or seven heads
                        and shoulders depending on the crowd density.


                 3.9.8 During the Taylor enquiry P.C . Bichard describes the camera looking
                       down on Leppings Lane (camera 1) by saying "when you are using
                       your zoom facility the picture you are getting at the extreme is a rather
                       large and general one".

                 RH:    The camera had been replaced 6 months earlier and was so good that
                        a car number plate could be picked out at the end of Leppings Lane.


                 3.9.9 At the Taylor enquiry P.C . Bichard admitted that there was a video of
                       the situation on the west terraces, (Leppings Lane Terraces) from
                       about 14.30. The officer also claimed that of the two video recordings
                       that were made, one expired at just after 15.00. The mode of
                       operation of the other tape was altered inadvertently between 14.30
                       and 15.00 when the officer believed that his knee caught an operating
                       button changing the recording from continuous to time lapse (that is
                       two frames per second rather than the normal continuously moving
                       picture). At the inquest he said that he could offer no explanation of
                       why there was no video material available from camera 5 before
                        15.02. He admitted that it would have been recording before then.

                 RH:   He says that no pictures from camera 5 were ever made available to
                       the enquiry or to the Inquest. He considers that the buttons on the
                       video machines are so tiny that it is unlikely that the officer could have
                       knocked one with his knee and more importantly says that it is actually
                       impossible to flick a switch and go into time lapse mode as P.C .
                       Bichard claims, when the machine is already recording.


                 3.9.10 Later during the Inquest P.C . Bichard says that the video pictures of
                        the Leppings Lane Terraces that were shown to the Jury were greatly
                        enhanced. He agreed with the Coroner that the image seen by the Jury
                        was infinitely clearer. He also said that the pictures which the court
                        had seen running on a time lapse system were not running at the same
                        speed as they would have been seen on the monitor.

                 RH:    He disagrees with P.C . Bichard’s evidence in that the information
                        obtained from watching the 14" monitors in the Police Control Room
                        was exactly the same as that seen on a larger screen in Court. He also
                        says that the pictures shown to the Court were taken from Camera 5,
                        the allegedly faulty camera, and showed the Leppings Lane Terraces.
                        He states that you will only get a time and date imprinting on the
                        recording if things are recorded at normal speed.


                 3.9.11 Also at the Inquest, P.C . Bichard says that camera 3 (a camera with
                        the maximum zoom facility) was not trained onto the Leppings Lane
                        Terraces because of an incident at the other end. The camera would
                        not have been good enough to enable identification of individuals at the
                        front of the Terraces as it would give an overall picture only.

                 RH:    The camera was extremely powerful and it would have been able to
                        give a very clear picture of the Leppings Lane Terraces. The Officer
                        contradicts himself about which location this camera was focused
                        upon.


                 3.9.12 P.C . Bichard told the Jury that the reason the pictures from camera 3
                        when it was re-trained onto the Leppings Lane Terraces did not
                        become part of the recording was as follows: "the system operated
                        where by 2.30 I should have replaced both tapes. Because of what
                        was happening on Leppings Lane I didn’t replace those tapes and
                        eventually it ran out after 3.00. The camera was used but it was not
                        taping".

                 RH:    He considers it very unusual for the police to have needed to have
                        replaced both tapes at 2.30. It would suggest that they had been
                        recording everything in real time since 11.30.


                 3.9.13 The evidence of Chief Inspector McRobbie (who was an observer in
                        the police control box) is that he was impressed by the zoom facilities
                        of camera 5. It was used to pick out someone directly beneath the
                        control box who had dropped his trousers. He says that the definition
                        was quite reasonable.

                 RH:    He says that this appears to be the same camera that P.C. Ryan
                        described as "never satisfactory". The C hief Inspector is directly
                        contradicting the evidence of his colleagues and goes on to say to the
                        Taylor enquiry that you could see quite clearly that Pen 3 was full but
                        that Pen 2 (one of the side pens) had got space.

         M edical Evidence

         3.10    Alun Jones QC says that in February 1997 the evidence o f a Dr. Ed Walker
                 came to light (the doctor had been put in touch with the HFSG as a result of
                 the Granada broadcast and met M r. and Mrs. P. Hammond). This new
                 material discloses that Philip Hammond Junior had sinus rhythm and cardiac
                 output after his arrival at the hospital. The D octor’s evidence shows serious
                 criticism of the reaction to the disaster and that other victims were alive. It
                 conflicts with the evidence of Dr. Slater. Dr. W alker was not called at the
                 Inquest.

         3.11    In his opinion, Alun Jones goes on to say "it is difficult to exaggerate the
                 significance of the concealment of Dr. W alker’s evidence. At page 10 of the
                 Divisional Court’s Judgement, November 1993, the Court pointed to the
                 Coroner’s reason for the 3.15 cut off. In all cases, it was said, the evidence
                 disclosed the same pattern, of a rapid unconsciousness leading to rapid death.
                 Dr. Walker expressly disagrees, especially with D r. Slater. He states that a
                 revealing remark was made by a senior hospital physician who said that
                 almost immediately his department was flooded with large numbers of acutely
                 ill patients requiring urgent resuscitation. However the whole inquest,
                 spanning over 90 days, was structured by the Coroner on an utterly different
                 factual assumption".

        3.12     The reviewing lawyer considers that the above opinion is intimating, as with
                 the video evidence, the suppression of material facts, namely that at least one
                 of the deceased (Philip Hammond) died after 15.15 and that this would have
                 affected the decisions made at the Taylor Enquiry, Coroner’s Hearings and
                 Judicial Review.

        3.13     In general Alun Jones considers that "one of the most striking aspects of this
                 history is the way in which the evidence presented to the Inquest was evidence
                 which tended to exculpate the South Yorkshire Authorities and the police from
                 blame. Very serious questions arise as to the process by which evidence was
                 selected by the West Midlands Police who assisted the C oroner".

         4.1     The material provided to the CPS by the HFSG in support of their allegation
                 is composed of 8 volumes of papers and three video tapes. The index is
                 attached at Appendix 1. It has been fully considered during this review and
                 a copy can be made for the Director if required.

         4.2     The Crown Prosecution Service has been formally requested by Trevor
                 Hicks, Chairman o f the HFSG, to examine the evidence and to initiate a full
                 and urgent criminal investigation into these matters. He states that all that has
                 ever been sought is a proper and even handed investigation into the events that
                 cost the lives of their loved ones. It is his belief that the footage from camera
                 5 between 12.00 and 15.23 hrs. has never been included in any police
                 compilation and/or other tapes that he had seen. In addition the footage
                 totally supported the position of Mr. Houldsworth.

        4.3      Alun Jones’ conclusions are that these new pieces o f evidence called for a full
                 police enquiry or public enquiry, that exhibits such as the tapes must be
                 secured and subjected to Forensic Analysis by some independent body with
                 powers to investigate and compel the production of evidence, and that
                 witnesses must be identified.

        4.4      Following the South Yorkshire Police Statement of the 1st April 1997 in
                 response to the Daily M irror report on Hillsborough, the HFSG issued their
                 own response on the 8th April. Full details o f these rebuttals and counter­
                 rebuttals are contained within the relevant review section of this report.

5       JU D IC IA L REVIEW

         5.1     The skeleton argument presented to the Divisional Court in the application for
                 Judicial Review to quash the Inquest Verdicts of Accidental Death was
                 concerned with the following main points

                 5.1.1   In deciding the statutory question ‘how ’ the Coroner breached the
                         Coroner’s rules re the procedure to be followed in taking evidence.

                 5.1.2   Because the Coroner imposed a cut-off time of 15.15, evidence in the
                         possession of the Coroner and the police that four of the deceased were
                         alive for a considerable time after sustaining injuries in the crush, was
                         not adduced to the main inquest. There was a systematic failure by the
                         Coroner to address the statutory questions of ‘w ho’, ‘when’, ‘w here’
                         and ‘how’. The Coroner had an apparent desire to establish rapid
                         death. The imposition of this cut-off point was to prevent any further
                         enquiry into the individual circumstances o f the 95 deaths. Relevant
                         witnesses were not called to give their controversial evidence.

                 5.1.3   The Coroner was wrong to leave only the conclusions of unlawful
                         killing, accidental death or an open verdict to the jury. He mis­
                         directed the jury upon the elements of the offence of manslaughter.

        5.2      The Divisional Court’s judgement was given on the 5th November 1993. The
                 applicant’s abandonment of the point concerning the breach o f the Coroner’s
                 rules was accepted by the Court. They found that the Coroner had cut o ff the
                 evidence at a reasonable and sustainable point bearing in mind the exhaustive
                 public enquiry which had already been conducted by Taylor L.J. It was also
                 a compassionate point from the aspect of the victim ’s relatives. There was a
                 sensible cut off point based on the plain and virtually unchallenged evidence
                 of the pathologists as to when the deceased would have died. There was
                 overwhelming medical evidence that death occurred by 15.15. The court were
                 far from concluding that the Coroner wrongly exercised his discretion as to
                 whom he should call to give evidence.

        5.3      The C ourt’s conclusions were that the inquisition was correctly completed, the
                 C oroner’s direction to the Jury was impeccable, and there was no good reason
                 for ordering a new inquest. In fact the court queried the purpose of a fresh
                 inquest. Criticism of the police had been firmly levelled by the Taylor Report
                 and the police had admitted fault and paid compensation. It was doubted that
                 more would be learned from the farther examination of the last minutes of the
                 lives o f the deceased. It was accepted that the families were pursuing the
                 matter because of their deep instinct to know the circumstances in which their
                 relatives died but the objective view and considering the interest of all
                 involved was that this was not a case for ordering fresh inquests.

        5.4      The Court stated that the essential complaint made against the Coroner was
                 that having introduced evidence from the various pathologists into the causes

MMS/246.97.V02                                  13
                 and probable time-scale of the deaths, he proceeded to limit or exclude
                 evidence from the main inquest which might have led the Jury to form a
                 different conclusion. In fact the Coroner led further evidence that might have
                 persuaded pathologists to form different conclusions than those previously
                 expressed, as well as exploring in the presence o f the Jury     an alternative
                 factual basis for the pathologists’ conclusions.

        5.5      It was said that there was clear evidence that bodily functions may continue
                 and give a semblance of life when the prior occurrence o f brain death renders
                 the existence of life unlikely, if not impossible. The overwhelming burden of
                 evidence was that there was no prolongation of life beyond the period o f about
                 10 minutes from the occurrence of the injury which lead to asphyxia.

6        R EV IEW O F ALLEGATIONS: VIDEO EV ID EN C E

         6.1     The allegations and comments made by Trevor Hicks, Alun Jones QC and
                 Roger Houldsworth are overlapping, but the only ‘new ’ evidence comes from
                 the last named. The others take inferences from and make representations
                 about that particular evidence as well as evidence already heard at either the
                 Taylor Enquiry or the Coroner’s Hearing. In essence they are saying that
                 because the Jury or the Divisional Court did not have the benefit o f Mr.
                 Houldsworth’s evidence nor of hearing argument on the proper inferences to
                 be made based on that evidence, there should be a full investigation leading
                 to a re-opening of the inquests or enquiry. They are also saying that the ‘new
                 evidence’ supports the allegation of the suppression o f video evidence by the
                 police.

        6.2      On the 13th M arch 1997 I held a full d ay ’s conference with Chief
                 Superintendent Lowe of South Yorkshire Police at his Sheffield office. I was
                 able to view original video tapes exhibited to the Taylor Enquiry and also
                 those shown at the Coroner’s Hearing. I had access to the transcripts o f those
                 hearings and original witness statements which had not been exhibited but
                 were unused material. This report is concerned with 4 video tapes; TB/1 and
                 TB/2 which were exhibited to the Taylor Enquiry, the Coroner’s Exhibit C539
                 and the video recording that was generally known as the ‘compilation tape’.
                 TB/1 and TB/2 were the original tapes taken from the two police video
                 recorders in their control room above the Leppings Lane Terraces. There
                 were 5 television screens showing views from the 5 roving cameras fixed at
                 high points on the stands and directed both inside and outside the ground.
                 There was also a master screen which flicked in rotation from one camera
                 view to another and which made one of the two video recordings. A further
                 screen was connected to the second video recorder which could be switched
                 between the five main cameras as required by the operator. P.C . Bichard was
                 tasked with the operation of the video recorders as directed by his superior
                 officers. The tapes could record in two ways, that o f continuous movement
                 or normal play, and of time-lapse where a different still frame was shown
                 every half second. This latter procedure gave a rather jerky sequence of
                 pictures but allowed for the longer use of any particular tape.

        6.3      At the end of the day the video tapes from the two recorders were secured and
                 eventually featured as evidence obtained during the police investigation o f the
                 disaster.

        6.4      The Exhibit List produced for the Taylor Enquiry has document number 109
                 described as containing recordings from 5 separate locations at regular
                 intervals and that the material is of relevance. A copy of 109 shows it to be
                 a VHS video tape reference TB/1. TB being the initials of P.C . Bichard, the
                 video operator. Document 110 is described as a two part film o f various
                 locations also containing relevant material. A copy of 110 shows it to be two
                 VHS video tapes reference TB/2 parts 1 and 2. See Appendices 2 and 3.

         6.5     TB/1 and 2 are described in detail in the video schedule prepared for the
                 Taylor Enquiry. (Appendix 4). TB/1 switches between the various police
                 cameras at intervals of 1 minute between the times 13.02 and 14.02.
                 However there are no views from camera 5 overlooking Leppings Lane
                 Terraces. The video recording TB/1 then appears to be under manual
                 operation and only shows the camera 5 viewpoint for a total of approximately
                 5 minutes between the times 14.59 to 15.04.

         6.6     TB/2 is switching between four of the police cameras, including camera 5, at
                 approximately 20 second intervals. It starts at 11.59 and ends just before
                 15.35. A new schedule prepared for me by the West Yorkshire Police
                 showed that the views from camera 5 feature on 41 occasions up until 15.00.
                 (Appendix 5). The final part of this tape from 15.03 until the end is the
                 camera 5 view of the fence behind the goal area where fans can be seen
                 climbing over onto the pitch, followed by some footage from a camera across
                 the pitch.

         6.7     I am informed by Dr. Stefan Popper, the Coroner for the Hillsborough
                 Inquests, that all the exhibits prepared for the Taylor Enquiry were made
                 available to the legal representatives at the Inquest. The police say that
                 material required for each day was placed in a side room to the hearings. The
                 rest o f the Unused Material, including Taylor Enquiry documents were kept
                 at a local police station (Nechells Green), where access was given to any
                 legal representatives that required it. Much o f this material was unused at the
                 Inquest including Exhibits TB/1 and 2. A ‘com pilation’ (Taylor Enquiry
                 Document 142) was edited from the footage made available by the police, club
                 and media. That particular video included little o f TB/1 and 2 as much more
                 striking coverage o f events was obtained from the other sources. None o f the
                 TB/2 footage from camera 5 after 15.04 was shown on it. This compilation
                 was also seen by the Jury (Inquest Reference C278). See Appendix 6.

        6.8      During the hearing on the 13th March 1991, the Coroner said that the Jury
                 had twice asked about the video evidence of the Terraces. He stated that the
                 videos had been looked at and there was actually next to nothing on them
                 because not everything was recorded; there was a tiny bit on the compilation
                 tape, with another little bit which started at 15.03 and went on for a few
                 minutes. He said that it had been clipped and will be shown to the Jury but
                 was of poor quality and he did not think it would help very much.

        6.9      On the 15th March, Exhibit C539 was shown to the Jury. It was produced by
                 a P.S. Killoch who said that he had taken a short sequence from one of the
                 South Yorkshire Police videos showing scenes o f the Leppings Lane pens, that
                 is, the West Stand. The sequence, most of which was in time-lapse, began
                 at 15.02. After the video was shown to the hearing, it was identified as being
                 C539 and P.S. Killoch stated that the original identification was TB/1, being
                 the West Midlands Police reference. No comment was made by any person
                 as to the quality o f this specific footage.

         Reviewing Law yers Com m ents

         6.10    The original police video tapes exhibited to the Taylor Enquiry as TB/1 and
                 TB/2 are still in existence and are in the hands o f the West Yorkshire Police.
                 Two original master copies of C539, that were taken from the master copy of
                 TB/2, are also with the West Yorkshire Police. One o f these was produced
                 by P.S. Killoch to the Coroner’s Hearing and was shown to the Jury. My
                 assessment of this particular footage is that whilst it is reasonably clear, the
                 position and angle of the view from the camera makes any assessment of
                 overcrowding in the centre pens to be difficult if not impossible. If the
                 camera had been panned or its angle of view increased then more might have
                 been seen in those crucial minutes after 15.03.

         6.11    As TB/1 and 2 were available to the Taylor Enquiry, it cannot be said that
                 they were suppressed. All o f the enquiry exhibits were known to legal teams
                 involved at the Inquest. I have seen copies of correspondence between the
                 police and other organisations (Hillsborough Steering Committee and Borough
                 of Sefton) concerning video footage. This shows that access was granted at
                 Nechells Green Police station during May to August 1989 to the interested
                 parties (including Mr. Trevor Hicks) to view video evidence in police hands.
                 A police incident room message (see Appendix 7) dated 24/5/89 is a note of
                 a telephone conversation between an Inspector Layton and a D .C .I. Tope to
                 the effect that solicitors acting for Sheffield Wednesday Football Club had
                 been given permission to view video footage referred to as TB2/A /Part 4.
                 This is the footage of the Leppings Lane Terraces between 15.03 and 15.25
                 and the evidence alleged to have been suppressed. I am also satisfied that this
                 particular recording was therefore available for the purpose o f the Inquest.I
                 am satisfied that while TB/1 and 2 were not themselves shown to the Jury, the
                 ‘compilation ’ and C539 videos were.

        6.12     C539 covers most of the camera 5 footage between 15.03 and 15.25 and was
                 shown to the Jury during the evidence of P.S. Killoch. However it can be
                 seen that the officer makes a mistake when he describes the exhibit as having
                 the original identification o f TB/1. My viewing confirms that the material
                 contained within C539 comes from Exhibit TB/2 and agrees with the relevant
                 schedule (Appendix 4).

        6.13     The HFSG have provided a copy tape to the CPS which is said to be the one
                 shown to the Inquest Jury. It is in fact what appears to be a re-recording of
                 C539 that is of poor quality as accepted by Alun Jones QC in his opinion. I
                 am satisfied that the Jury saw the best copy available, that is, one o f the two
                 original tapes taken from the master TB/2. This particular tape was referred
                 to by the Coroner as follows (transcript of 13th M arch 1990):-

                 "I do not think it is worth starting before lunch, but there is just one thing
                 which the Jury have mentioned to me. In fact they have mentioned it twice,
                 and that is what about the video evidence at the terraces. I have the videos
                 looked at and there is actually next to nothing on the videos because of

MMS/246.97.V02                                  17
                  course, not everything was recorded. That does not mean to say they were
                  not possibly scenes but there is, I understand, a little tiny bit which is actually
                  in the compilation which you have seen. There is another little bit which
                  starts at 15.03 and goes on for a few minutes. W hat we have done is that we
                  have clipped it, if that is the right word, and we will show it to you, but it is
                  a very poor quality and I do not think it is going to help us very much. As
                  far as I can tell there isn’t much recorded. Does that help?"

         6.14     On the 15th March, prior to the C539 footage being shown to the Jury, the
                  Coroner said:-

                 "We are going to press on today, but what I want to do is you will remember
                 you were asking about the video, and I think we will show this video now of
                 the scene as far as we have got it at Leppings Lane. In fact, it was, of
                 course, taken by Mr. Bichard so it is a convenient time to actually look at it,
                 but I am going to get M r. Killoch who has actually selected the piece out that
                 we need to describe it."

        6.15     The relevant parts of the transcript are exhibited at Appendix 8, with the
                 Exhibit list at Appendix 9.

         6.16 I have ascertained that the Coroner had authorised the recording by video tape
               of all the main inquest proceedings. There are 186 tapes in all. The cameras
               view point (from a higher level gallery) shows the Coroner, Jury, witness
               stand and lawyers benches as well as the bottom part o f the large video
               screen. From the relevant tape I can confirm that C539 was shown in its
               entirety and at one stage early in the viewing the Coroner remarks "I think we
               can recognise him", presumably with reference to some un-named person on
               the terraces. This remark is not noted in the transcript.

        6.17     The points I note   from the above are that:

                 •       C539 was a 13 minute excerpt of camera 5 ’s view o f the Leppings
                         Lane pens and was shown to the Inquest Jury. C539 was taken from
                         police video TB/2 (not TB/1 as stated by P.S . Killoch).

                 •       P.C. Bichard and other officers gave evidence o f their perception that
                         monitor pictures from camera 5 were not of good quality, and that
                         they therefore disregarded them, especially as their attention prior to
                         15.03 was focused on the obvious danger area at the entrance gates.

                 •       The Coroner told the Jury that having had the videos (presumably
                         TB/1 and TB/2) looked at, a little bit starting at 15.03 and going on
                         for a few minutes (to 15.25) had been clipped and it would be shown
                         to them. He said that this tape was of very poor quality and would not
                         help very much.

                  •      The ‘new evidence’ from Mr. Houldsworth is that from his perception

MMS/246.97.V02
                                                  18
                         the tape was o f good quality and overcrowding in the pens could be
                         clearly seen. He therefore strongly disagrees with the police evidence
                         concerning the use o f camera 5.

         6.18 On the 1st April 1997, South Yorkshire Police released a press statement
               following a report in that mornings Daily M irror paper. They stated that the
               tape from a CCTV camera showing the terraces had never been missing and
               was made available to both the Taylor Enquiry and the Inquest. The
              confusion over missing tapes seemed to arise from the fact that two tapes
               recorded at the ground on the Club’s own CCTV system had gone missing
              from a locked room. Neither tape was relevant to the enquiry.

         6.19    The HFSG response o f the 7th April to us was that footage from camera 5 did
                 go missing and therefore could not be shown to the Inquest Jury. They said
                 that P.C . Bichard in his evidence confirmed that shots from camera 5 had
                 been recorded prior to 15.02 and he could not explain why relevant footage
                 could not be found. The HFSG also showed concern as to their understanding
                 that South Yorkshire Police were in a position to ‘select’ evidence for
                 admission to either the Taylor Enquiry or the Inquest, rather than the West
                 Midlands police who were the investigators. They make the point that the
                 South Yorkshire Police have changed tack in accepting that camera 5 was
                 indeed in working order, but that this is contrary to the evidence of P.C .s
                 Bichard and Ryan and P.S. Goddard who all disparaged the capability o f that
                 camera. The camera could pan, tilt and zoom and produce pictures of
                 sufficient quality and detail to identify facial features. They considered the
                 police are now alleging that it was the quality o f the transmission via the
                 monitors rather than the camera which was the problem. As regards the
                 stolen tapes, while the HFSG accept that they showed nothing o f probative
                 value, the fact is that they were taken from a locked cupboard in an alarmed
                 and locked room with a massive police presence at the ground over-night.
                 The security could not have been breached by a stranger. The South
                 Yorkshire Police cannot dismiss the matter so lightly as clearly the thief
                 thought he/she was stealing something of value. We are then asked to take
                 these comments into account before coming to a decision.

7        R E PO R T : VIDEO EV IDEN CE

         A llegations m ade by T revor Hicks:-

         7.1      (Refer to 3.1) It cannot be proved to the required standard that P.C .s Bichard
                  and Ryan gave false evidence. Their perception o f the camera 5 footage was
                 based on the monitor picture within the police control room not on a viewing
                 of any video recording. They consider that as the pictures were of poor
                 quality they would therefore disregard them. P.C . Bichard stated in his
                 evidence to the Inquest that the pictures on the large screen there were clearer
                 than on the control room monitor. This would support the proposition that
                 regardless of any previous fault on the camera there was a lack o f picture
                 quality due to a monitor problem. Even so the Coroner considered that C539
                 was not of good quality (as opposed to M r. Houldsworth’s different perception
                 of the quality). The tape was shown to the Jury and they, having also heard
                 the evidence of the police officers were able to make up their own minds as
                 to what the police in the control room could see o f the events unfolding both
                 at the turnstile and gates, and on the terraces. M r. Houldsworth’s evidence
                 in 1996 is that he could clearly see on the Club CCTV monitor that the pens
                 were full to over-crowding when the gate was opened leading to the fatal
                 crushing. His evidence from 1989 is not so precise, only that a dangerous
                 situation was developing. Here he says that it was not for two to three
                 minutes after going down onto the pitch and viewing the pens that he realised
                 the true situation and that there was not a pitch invasion. His later evidence
                 is therefore at variance with his early perceptions and may well have been
                 contaminated by subsequent events.

                 Findings: Any accusations o f perjury or perverting the course o f justice
                 based on a witness perception differing from that o f the police officers, and
                 already considered by the Jury will not pass the evidential test.

        7.2      (Refer to 3.2). I accept that the editor o f the ‘compilation video’ had access
                 to TB/1 and 2 as well as to all the many other tapes available. The Coroner
                 also accepts that C539 was a clipped part of another tape (TB/2). He said that
                 the Jury had twice mentioned video evidence of the terraces. Because of that
                 he had had the videos looked at and C539 was then prepared. It was of poor
                 quality and he did not think it would help very much.

                 Findings: The Jury’s request for footage of the terraces was actioned by the
                 Coroner in what he obviously considered to be a satisfactory way. The
                 appropriate inference must be that TB/1 and 2 were looked at and that the
                 footage from Camera 5 prior to 14.30 was not considered to be of sufficient
                 relevance. There was no footage from that camera between 14.24 and 14.58,
                 the crucial time period where over-crowding began to occur. C 539 tape was
                 an edited version of TB/2 showing the pens between 15.03 and 15.16.

        7.3      (Refer to 3.3) The Jury viewed some of the relevant Camera 5 footage
                 between 15.03 and 15.16 and they came to their verdicts having considered

MMS/246.97.V02
                                               20
                 all the evidence put before them.


                 Findings: That the Jury did not see the last 91h. minutes o f the camera 5
                 footage on TB/2 would not, in my opinion, have affected their overall
                 judgement and the decisions that they came to.

                 Allegations m ade by Alun Jones Q C :-

         7.4     (Refer to 3.4) I have obtained copies of the Exhibit List to the Taylor
                 Enquiry showing that TB/1 and 2 were properly exhibited together with a
                 schedule breaking down the footage into details of camera locations, timings,
                 and a description of the scene shown. These tapes were available to the legal
                 representatives of the HFSG. Part of them was contained within the
                 ‘compilation video’. South Yorkshire Police have reported to me that all the
                 Taylor Enquiry material was available for the Inquest Hearings. A room in
                 the Inquest Building was set aside for original documents and all those exhibits
                 needed on a day to day basis. The remainder o f the Exhibit material was kept
                 at the local police station and made available to the Coroner, lawyers and
                 certain o f the families for viewing. I am awaiting a statement from a senior
                 officer concerned with those arrangements to confirm the police report.
                 However the previously mentioned correspondence (para 6.10) corroborates
                 that report. The Coroner, Dr. Popper, has also confirmed to me that all
                 Taylor Enquiry material was available.

                 Findings: I consider that there is no evidence to show that video tapes were
                 ever suppressed by the police or others. Counsel for the HFSG is obviously
                 confused as to which tapes went missing or were stolen. The two tapes that
                 were taken from the Club CCTV room were never recovered, but the police
                 video tapes have never been missing. I see no m erit in the HFSG intimation
                 that the police are in some way responsible for the theft o f the two club tapes.
                 There is no evidence that this theft is of any relevance to the present review.

        7.5      (Refer to 3.5). Mr. Houldsworth has provided a copy o f his statement made
                 on the 16th May 1989. He says how he re-designed and improved the
                 ground’s CCTV system, both for Club and Police use. He describes the 20
                 Club and 7 police monitors, 2 of the last being connected to video recorders.
                 He rectified a fault on one of the police cameras by re-adjusting the iris
                 controls. By 14.45 on the day he was able to see the build up of supporters
                 outside the turnstiles but while some stands were full the West Stand
                 (Leppings Lane Terraces) was only two thirds full. He commented to others
                 in the Club CCTV box that the kick off should be delayed to enable people
                 to get into the ground. Some time later he heard a radio request from a senior
                 police officer that a gate be opened in order to prevent deaths. A gate was
                 opened and a huge number of fans flooded the area. From the numbers
                 displayed on a monitor he realised that a dangerous situation was being
                 created. He went down to the pitch as the referee stopped the match. He saw
                 fans climbing over the West Stand fence and thought that there was a pitch

MMS/246.97.V02                                  21
                 invasion. It was only after he watched for 2 to 3 minutes that he realised
                 what was really occurring. Later that afternoon he ejected the VCR tapes in
                 the club CCTV room (leaving them in the machines in the eject position) and
                 later locked the VCR cupboard and set the room’s alarm system. However
                 he did not specifically recall if all the tapes were still with each machine at
                 that time. He then asked a security guard (not police) to ensure that no one
                 entered the CCTV room. The next morning the room was still locked with
                 the alarm operative. He discovered that two tapes were missing, one from a
                 camera overlooking gates 9 to 16 and the other from an inactive VCR.

                 Findings: Mr. Houldsworth’s evidence concerns background material of the
                 CCTV workings and of a brief view of his perceptions. Other witnesses gave
                 similar evidence. The West Midlands Police Hillsborough Enquiry Master
                 Index shows that his statement was included within the investigation and was
                 therefore presented to the Taylor Enquiry. That he was not called to give live
                 evidence does not surprise me. I find no evidence of the deliberate
                 suppression of his statement nor of any police involvement with the two
                 missing tapes.

        7.6      (Refer to 3.6) The HFSG tapes are copies of those provided by the police to
                 Yorkshire Television at their request.

                 Findings: There is no evidence that the tapes TB/1 and 2 were ever involved
                 in a theft or had been improperly taken away.

        7.7      (Refer to 3.7) It would be well nigh impossible to prosecute a case involving
                 allegations of police lying (and therefore the perverting of the course of
                 justice) based on the different perception of one witness (Mr Houldsworth)
                 who did not view the actual police monitor showing the Leppings Lane
                 Terraces at the relevant times.

                 Findings: There is insufficient evidence to support the allegation.

         7.8     (Refer to 3.8) The TB/2 tapes were available in 1991 and 1993.

                 Findings: The tapes do not have the significance attributed to them by Alun
                 Jones.

         Allegations made by Roger Houldsworth:-

         7.9     (Refer to 3.9.1 to 13) Most of his comments have been addressed in the
                 previous paragraphs where Trevor Hicks and Alun Jones QC tender their
                 version of the inferences to be taken from his ‘new evidence’. Roger
                 Houldsworth considers that Camera 5 was working properly and the evidence
                 of police officers, is, as he has put it, "not altogether truthful". He identifies
                 contradictions in the evidence of P.C. Bichard and generally denigrates the
                 perceptions of the police officers as to the capabilities of the camera. The
                 thrust of these comments as picked out by Mr. Hicks and Alun Jones QC must

MMS/246.97.V02
                                                 22
                 Jones QC must be that these perceptions (and also the alleged loss of tapes)
                 are told as deliberate lies in order to cover up the gross negligence of the
                 police in the control room in not noticing the crush in the pens at an earlier
                 stage,

         7.10    Particular comment is made by him (at paragraph 3,9.9) that P.C. Bichard
                 was asked why there was no video material for Camera 5 before 15,02, and
                 that the officer could offer no explanation although he said that there would
                 have been a recording. As P.C. Bichard was not involved in exhibit
                 production I accept that he could not have had any explanation as to
                 unsupported allegations, re matters not under his control or within his
                 knowledge.

         7.11    Mr Houldsworth goes on (paragraph 3.9,10) that there is only a time and date
                 imprinting on a recording if it is made at the normal speed. He is thus stating
                 that with a time-lapse mode there is no such imprint. This expert opinion of
                 his is patently false as the time-lapse recording between 15.03 and 15.25
                 clearly shows the time and date imprint,

        7.12     He says (at paragraph 3.9,13) that a Chief Inspector’s evidence contradicts
                 that of P.C. Ryan as to how satisfactory Camera 5 was. However the Chief
                 Inspector’s view from the Camera was a close up from a very short distance
                 while Camera 5 was focused at the far end of the pens between 15,03 and
                 15,25, As Mr. Houldsworth admits (see para 3.9.5) it would be difficult to
                 pick out facial features while events are happening.

                 Findings: Mr. Houldsworth’s evidence and comments are generally a matter
                 of his perception versus that of the police officers. I do not consider that it
                 any way comes close to the sufficiency required for obtaining a realistic
                 prospect of conviction on the criminal allegations. The police have fully
                 admitted civil liability and an extension of their negligence into the realms of
                 criminal misconduct by way of an alleged cover up operation is not tenable
                 on the evidence available.

8       REVIEW OF MEDICAL EVIDENCE

        8.1      While any application by the HFSG for a re-opening of the Inquest based on
                 new medical evidence is within the province of the Home Office, Alun Jones
                 QC does allege at paragraph 11 of his opinion that Dr, Walker’s evidence was
                 concealed. In which case there must be consideration of that evidence going
                 towards the offence of Perverting the Course of Justice. The HFSG
                 intimation must be of a Conspiracy to Pervert the Court of Justice by the two
                 police forces involved, the West Midlands and South Yorkshire Police, and
                 also by the Coroner if it can be shown that he knew of the evidence of Dr.
                 Walker.

        8.2      Dr, Walker’s evidence:     The HFSG have produced in their Annex F the
                 following documents :-

                 8.2.1   Dr. Walker’s undated statements (which are not in the Criminal Justice
                         Act format) re the events at Hillsborough,

                 8.2.2 A letter of the 3rd May 1989 from a Hospital Consultant (Mr,
                       Wardrope) describing how Dr. Walker (a Senior House Officer in
                       Anaesthetics) was instrumental in bringing speedy treatment and
                       resuscitation to patients on the 15th April 1989,

                 8.2.3 A standard form letter of the 15th June 1989 from the same consultant
                       to (presumably) Dr, Walker warning him that he may be asked to give
                       a statement to the police for the benefit of the Coroner,

                 8.2.4 A letter of the 3rd May 1989 thanking Dr. Walker for his report and
                       the work he did.

                 8.2.5 A letter of the 8th February 1997 from Dr. Walker to that consultant
                       stating that Mr, Philip Hammond (junior) was the first victim that he
                       attempted to resuscitate. He asks why he was not contacted by the
                       police to provide an official statement or to appear at the inquest. He
                       confirms his statement made to the consultant in that Philip Hammond
                       had sinus rhythm and cardiac output which was obviously at odds with
                       Dr, Slater’s evidence,

                 8.2.6 Dr, Walker’s letter of the 13th February 1997 to the British Medical
                       Journal asking for contact to be made with other Doctors who were
                       involved on the day but not asked to provide statements,

         8.3     The question for consideration is whether or not the alleged omission in not
                 taking his statement was done with criminal intent so as to suppress his
                 evidence because, for example, it would have embarrassed the police or led
                 to a different verdict from the Jury.

         8.4     The Judicial Review of the Medical Evidence found that the pathologists who

MMS/246.97.V02
                                                24
                 were Drs. Gumpert, Dr. Slater and Professor Usher, were as one in that once
                 a victim’s chest was fixed (when crushing occurs) then irrecoverable brain
                 damage will ensue in 4 to 6 minutes. The court’s conclusions have been
                 noted above.

         8.5     Dr. Walker’s statement begins with his description of how he came to
                 volunteer his services to the Northern General Hospital when he hears of
                 problems at Hillsborough Stadium. On arrival at the Hospital he went to the
                 Casualty Department to be told that a paediatric cardiac arrest was coming in.
                 The first child received was in cardio-respiratory standstill and he with others
                 instigated routine cardio-pulmonary resuscitation. There was evidence of gross
                 inhalation of stomach contents and as far as he could recall sinus rhythm and
                 cardiac output was established, although the boy’s pupils were fixed and
                 dilated. He believed that the boy had since died. A second child arrived in
                 cardio-pulmonary arrest during resuscitation of the first patient. Similar
                 measures were carried out and this child was also brought back into sinus
                 rhythm with a good output though he again had fixed dilated pupils throughout
                 and has since died. Dr. Walker then continues in the statement with details
                 of other victims that he dealt with and which are not relevant for the purposes
                 of this review. The statement does not give patient names.

                 Findings:

         8.6     I do not consider that Dr. Walker’s observations as made in his personal
                 statement of 1989 and the letters of 1987 comprise such vital new evidence as
                 to show that the life of Philip Hammond continued after the cut off period of
                 15.15.

         8.7     Dr. Walker contends that he was not asked to make a statement by the police
                 (whether it be the West Midlands or West Yorkshire (sic) police as he states
                 in two different letters). However the police file which I have seen contains
                 Dr. Walker’s original manuscript statement of the 20th July 1989 as obtained
                 by the West Midlands Police Force. Each page is signed by him and
                 witnessed by two other persons. It is somewhat different to his undated
                 personal statement which is said to have been made in 1989. In the police
                 statement he says that he attended to the first casualty to arrive, a boy he
                 knows only as ‘Lee’ and who he believed was declared brain dead in the
                 Intensive Care Unit two days later. This patient was in cardio-pulmonary
                 arrest with fixed dilated pupils. The heart had stopped beating but the medical
                 team managed to re-establish normal rhythm. While the boy was being
                 treated the second victim arrived also in cardio-pulmonary arrest. This boy
                 was also established in a normal sinus heart rhythm but again the pupils were
                 fixed and dilated throughout and it is believed that the boy has since died.
                 The description given by Dr. Walker of the second boy fits that of the victim
                 Philip Hammond.

         8.8     The Doctor’s evidence concerning these first two victims shows that both
                 arrived without apparent signs of life. Although a normal heart rhythm was

MMS/246.97.V02
                                                25
                 established it could not be sustained and the two boys eventually died. I
                 understand that Lee’s bodily functions were maintained for two days as he was
                 to be an organ donor.

         8.9     However, the doctor’s letter of 8th February 1997 to Mr. Wardrope says that
                 Philip Hammond was the first victim that he attempted to resuscitate. That
                 recollection is presumably based on the undated 1989 personal statement.
                 Here he describes the establishment of sinus rhythm and cardiac output in the
                 first two victims he treated (no names are given) and that both had fixed and
                 dilated pupils throughout and subsequently were believed to have died.

         8.10    A police action message dated 2nd April 1990 shows that an officer was
                 directed to contact Dr. Walker and warn him that he may be required to
                 attend the Inquest. The Doctor’s contact telephone number was to be
                 obtained. There is a manuscript note of a telephone number on this message.
                 The result of the above action is noted that the doctor was not required.

         8.11    The statement of Mr. James Wardrope (a consultant in Accident and
                 Emergency Medicine at the Northern General Hospital) dated 6th June 1989
                 gives details of various Hillsborough patients as contained within the medical
                 records in his possession and the post mortem evidence provided by the
                 Coroner. The paragraph concerning Philip Hammond is as follows:-

                 "There is no definite documentary evidence in the medical notes that Mr.
                 Hammond received resuscitation, but the post mortem states that there were
                 three ECG electrodes attached to his chest. I would interpret this as being
                 probable he did enter the resuscitation room of the Northern General Hospital,
                 but a cardiac tracing showed no cardiac activity and in view of the large
                 number of patients present at the time, resuscitation attempts were not taken
                 any further".

         8.12    His comments concerning a Lee Nichol are as follows:-

                 "This young boy was brought in as a cardiac-arrest. Resuscitation resulted in
                 return of normal cardiac output, but he did not breathe on his own. He was
                 therefore transferred to the General Intensive Care Unit and I believe he died
                 on the Intensive Care Unit three days later".

         8.13    Later in the statement Mr. Wardrope says that no patient admitted in the state
                 of cardiac arrest had survived.

         8.14    In his evidence to the Coroner’s Hearing, this consultant confirmed that there
                 was no documentary evidence as to what had happened with Philip Hammond
                 apart from the post-mortem report concerning the electrode marks. He was
                 asked to give his best guess as to how that may have happened and replied:-

                 "In the initial part of the incident I was sending people who came in with a
                 cardiac arrest, patients undergoing mouth to mouth resuscitation and external

MMS/246.97.V02
                                               26
                 cardiac massage, I sent to the resuscitation room initially to see whether they
                 could have a chance of being brought round to start the heart going. The fact
                 that the only post-mortem evidence were three ECG electrodes, I think
                 possibly he was sent to the resuscitation room but the ECG showed no cardiac
                 activity, and because of the great pressure on the resuscitation beds at that
                 time he would be sent to the mortuary."

        8.15     A P.C. Taylor who was at the football ground gave evidence that he
                 approached a youth who was identified as Philip Hammond and who was lying
                 on the ground and appeared to be unconscious. He took the boy to an
                 ambulance and attempted to revive him with the assistance of others. Heart
                 massage was performed and they were able to re-start the heart and feel a
                 pulse. However it is said by the officer that later at the hospital, the doctor
                 could not detect signs of life after 20 minutes of resuscitation.

        8.16     The West Midlands Police report for the coroner concerning the death of
                 Philip Hammond contains further evidence. A statement from a Dr. Doore
                 refers to a body number 93 which is the deceased reference number for Philip
                 Hammond. She says that this body was one of 11 casualties that she
                 examined on being brought into the hospital. In total she examined 11
                 casualties that day, found no signs of life in any, and in her opinion all were
                 dead on arrival at the hospital. In a later statement she confirms that one of
                 the persons she examined was Philip Hammond. Dr. David Slater conducted
                 the autopsy of Philip Hammond and his conclusions were that the injuries
                 were consistent with a severe intensive blunt compression of the chest
                 especially on the right side.

        8.17     Based on the above findings I consider that there has been no suppression of
                 medical evidence by either the police or other persons as alleged by Alun
                 Jones. I agree that Dr. Walker’s evidence conflicts with that of Dr. Slater,
                 however it also conflicts with that of every other witness who has made a
                 statement concerning Philip Hammond. Alun Jones states that it is difficult
                 to exaggerate the significance of the concealment of Dr. Walker’s evidence,
                 a remark that I find to be completely misguided when the overall evidence is
                 considered. That this evidence tended to exculpate the South Yorkshire
                 authorities and the police from blame may well be because there was no
                 evidence to inculpate those organisations. I cannot accept the intimation that
                 there was misconduct in the selections by the West Midlands Police of the
                 evidence to put before the Coroner.

         8.18    Consideration should be given to allowing either Dr. Slater or Professor Usher
                 to comment on what Dr. Walker has now said.

9        RECOMMENDATIONS

         9.1     There are no grounds for the Crown Prosecution Service to recommend to the
                 Home Office that there should be further investigation of criminal allegations
                 against the police or other persons.

         9.2     Alun Jones QC has requested the meeting with a senior lawyer of the CPS to
                 allow him to expand upon his advice. I note the Chief Crown Prosecutor’s
                 initial reaction is to refuse based on the fact that there are only powers to
                 invite the police to investigate the matter further. I appreciate the difficulties
                 which the HFSG has where the allegations of criminal conduct are made
                 against the police forces involved in the Hillsborough Investigation. My
                 overall view is that no new material has been put before us. It would be
                 politic to explain any reasons for our decision to the HFSG or at least to their
                 legal representatives. However, perhaps this should be done by the officers
                 of the Police Policy Directorate at the Home Office following consultation as
                 to the handling of the reporting of any decisions made in this matter.

           neglect of duty as opposed to conduct involving malfeasance or at la jiaim ent relating to i«e©me. tax with similar intent, amounts to a common law

                      INSTRUCTIONS TO COUNSEL TO ADVISE



Counsel will receive herewith

(1)   Interim Reports of Lord Justice Taylor.

(2)   Copy Judgment     R -v- Dytham.

      Counsel will of course be aware of the publicity surrounding the
      publication of the report of Lord Justice Taylor.  The report was
      considered by the Director who on 15 August wrote to Mr Peter Wright,
      Chief Constable of South Yorkshire stating that the matter should be the
      subject of a full criminal investigation.

      Counsel will also be aware that Lord Justice Taylor's inquiry was
      assisted by Mr Geoffrey Dear Chief Constable of West Midlands Police
      whose officers conducted initial enquiries and took statements from
      hundreds of witnesses many of whom gave evidence before the enquiry.

      Because of the close involvement of the West Midlands Police with the
      investigation Mr Wright appointed Mr Dear to conduct the criminal
      investigation and he is assisted by Assistant Chief Constable Mervyn
      Jones and a team of officers.  Whilst the criminal investigation is, in
      part, an enquiry into officers of the South Yorkshire Police and this is
      how the enquiry has been projected by the media, it will in fact
      encompass the possibility of offences by persons and bodies in addition
      to South Yorkshire police officers, namely, South Yorkshire Police
      Authority, Sheffield Wednesday Football Club, Sheffield City Council, Dr
      Eastwood and football fans.

      Whilst the investigation will focus upon the possible offence of
      manslaughter, police officers may well have committed the Common Law
      offence of malfeasance or culpable non-feasance, this offence is not
      dealt with very fully in Archbold and Counsel may be assisted by the
      judgment in Regina -v- Dytham.

      Counsel will in due course be asked to advise as to possible criminal
      charges, but that is someway ahead, but now Counsel is asked, having
      regard to the unusual circumstances of this investigation, to advise the
      Police on an ongoing basis as to the scope and direction of their
      enquiry.

      An early conference has been arranged to discuss the case in general
      terms when the Police will explain the extent of their enquiries to date
      and the number and form of witness statements that have been obtained.

i
         Introduction

i         1.            On 15th April 1989 the worst disaster in British football

         history occurred inside the Hillsborough Stadium at Sheffield
t        where Liverpool were playing Nottingham Forest in the FA Cup

^        semi-final. 95 people died and over 400 were injured as a

         result of gross overcrowding and crushing in the two pens

i        immediately behind the goal at the western (Leppings La ne ) end

         of the ground.
i
                We are instructed to advise whether there exists

^        sufficient evidence to justify bringing criminal proceedings

         against any of the organisations or individuals concerned.

i
         2.    We have been provided with the Interim Report of the
i        Inquiry headed by Lord Justice Taylor published in August 1989

         ("the Taylor Report") and the report to the Director of Public
i
         Prosecutions of the criminal investigation carried out by the

    t    West Midlands Police ("the West Midlands Report").


    i    3.    Our views were sought at an early stage on the scope of

         the investigation and the format of the report, and the
    [
         material which has been placed before us is very extensive.     In

    (    addition to the reports mentioned, we have been provided with

    |*   the bulk of the documentation placed before Lord Justice

    ^    Taylor's Inquiry, the full transcript of the evidence given     at

         the Inquiry, and a large quantity of visual evidence in the
    'j
     ^   form of photographs and video film.




                                                                              r r * r * - '% ■rT ' f
          We have also visited Hillsborough stadium and have had

   the opportunity of seeing for ourselves the physical

  characteristics of the ground which played such an important
  part in the disaster.



  4.     Throughout our consideration of this case we have kept

  constantly in mind the appalling scale of the tragedy for the

  bereaved and those injured, some of whom suffered devastating

  psychological injuries from which they are unlikely to

  recover. „e have borne in mind, too, the strong feelings of

 anger and bitterness which the disaster has provoked within

 the Liverpool community and elsewhere, and the important role

           Pursuit of justice which criminal proceedings are
 perceived to have by those aggrieved.



 5.    In the light of the prominent part played by the South

       shire Police in the disaster, we have reminded ourselves

 in particular that police officers are in no different

category to others in a criminal     investigation. We should say

that we are fully satisfied that     that has been the approach of

the West Midlands Police, who have conducted a meticulous

investigation in which no stone has been left unturned.



       Given the serious nature of the criminal liability under

consideration, however,    it is essential that the available

 aterial should be examined in an entirely dispassionate
manner. This we have tried to do.
*^ T h e   facts

   7.      A notable feature of the disaster is the absence of

   conflict of fact as to what happened at Hillsborough. This

   consistency of evidence was remarked on by the Taylor Inquiry

   (see the Taylor Report para 113). Further, the criminal

   investigation,     for all its thoroughness, has not significantly

   added to or contradicted Lord Justice Taylor's findings.      In

   our judgment, therefore, the Taylor analysis of the facts is

   as firm a base as any from which to approach the question of

   criminal liability and where necessary we shall make reference

   in this Opinion to the Report and its Appendices.



   Summary

   8.      At 2.52 pm on 15th April 1989 one of the exit gates at the

   Leppings Lane end of the Hillsborough Stadium was opened on

   the instruction of Chief Superintendent Duckenfield, the

   Commander responsible for policing the match. The purpose was

   to relieve unprecedented overcrowding and crushing at the

   turnstiles caused by a build up of supporters arriving after

   2.30 pm for the semi-final due to kick off at 3 pm. In the

   ensuing 5 minutes,     some 2,000 supporters passed through the

   gate and entered the tunnel under the West stand giving access

   to the central pens of the terrace. Those pens were already

   overfull because of the physical layout of the terrace and the

   uncontrolled way in which supporters were allowed to enter

   them. Gross overcrowding and crushing occurred. Moreover,     the

   intense pressure exerted by the additional influx caused the

   collapse of a crush barrier situated near the front of pen 3.


                                     3




                                         V i* , r- > v -   r-,
Supporters were hurled down into the front of the pen and

crushed up against the low wall and the perimeter wire fence

above it. Many died from suffocation and crushing injuries;

some were trampled on. The crushing was not immediately

recognised, partly because those trampled upon were not

visible behind the wall, partly because police operational

orders prohibited officers on the perimeter track from opening

the perimeter gates without permission from a senior officer,

and partly because the crushing and distress was not expected.

The response of the police was therefore slow. Even when the

nature and extent of the emergency was appreciated and the

perimeter gates were opened, the small number of gates and the

height of the fence itself made rescue and evacuation a

hopelessly difficult task.

     The build up outside the ground which led to the opening

of the exit gate was due to the layout, numbers, designation

and marking of the turnstile entrances at the Leppings Lane

end, and to a loss of police control of the crowd as

supporters became desperate to get in before the kick-off.



9.   It will be clear from the above summary that the disaster

had three separate causative elements which need to be

examined: the layout of the ground; the opening of the exit

gate; and the build up outside the ground.




                               4
The layout of the ground

10.   Sheffield Wednesday Football Club ("the Club") was formed

in 1867 and moved to the Hillsborough ground in 1899. In the

90 years that elapsed before the disaster it was successfully

used for numerous sporting events, including FA Cup semi­

finals, international matches and 3 World Cup matches. Very

large crowds were accommodated, the record being over 72,000

in 1934. Significant changes were made to the layout of the

ground over the years and these need to be understood.



11.   The present South stand was built in 1913, the Spion Kop

(at the Eastern end) was added in 1914, and the West stand was

built in 1965. Before then the Leppings Lane end was entirely

terraced. Until fairly recently, not only were there no

perimeter fences between the terraces and the pitch, there

were relatively few crush barriers on the terraces themselves.

The plan at Appendix 4 to the Taylor Report shows the

arrangement of the barriers at the Leppings Lane end.



12.   Before 1979 there were continuous barriers along the

front, with two intermittent rows of barriers behind (coloured

black on the plan). There were no "radial" barriers, that is

fences running at right angles to the crush barriers from back

to front of the terrace so as to form pens. The perimeter

fences were installed in 1977 as a response to the hooliganism

and pitch invasions of the 1970s.




                                5
: •
r.      13•    In 1978 Dr Eastwood, a highly experienced civil and

       structural engineer and a principal of the firm of Eastwood

       and Partners who had been advising the Club on minor matters

       since the 1950s, was formally retained to act on the Club's

       behalf in its dealings with the local authority,    then the

       South Yorkshire County Council, but which later became the

       Sheffield City Council ("the Council"). The Safety of Sports

       Ground Act 1975 had recently been passed and it was necessary

       for the Club to take expert advice if it was to receive a

       Safety Certificate under the Act from the Council. Dr Eastwood

       advised that further barriers should be installed in order to

       comply with the Home Office "Green Guide" then in force and

       the additional barriers shown and marked blue on the plan at

      Appendix 4 were installed in 1979.



      14.     The Council set up an Officer Working Party consisting of

      representatives of the police, the fire services, and the

      Council's building surveyors' division and legal and

      administration department and, as a result of inspections and

      consultations with the Club and Dr Eastwood,    a Safety

      Certificate was issued for the ground in 1979.



      15.     In 1981, on the occasion of the semi-final between

      Tottenham Hotspur and Wolverhampton Wanderers, a serious

      crushing incident at the Leppings Lane end led to further

      changes to the layout of the terrace. Late arrivals who surged

      forward when a goal was scored at the Kop end caused the

      crushing of several supporters at the front of the terrace.


                                       6
#   There were injuries but no deaths. This incident,   the further

    significance of which will be returned to, prompted the police

    to suggest that it had been caused by the sideways movement,

    of supporters to positions behind the goal, and that the

    installation of radial fences would prevent such movement as

    well as providing segregation of supporters of opposing teams

    who could thus be accommodated on the same terrace.



    16.   The police view was accepted by the Club and the Officer

    Working Party, and the two radial fences shown pale green in

    Appendix 4 were installed in 1981. The terrace was thereby

    divided into three pens, with neither forward nor sideways

    movement by supporters being possible once a pen became full.

    The fences had gates at the top end to be locked once the pens

    had filled up.



    17.   Further changes to the layout in 1985 and 1986 resulted

    in the addition of two more radial fences, the consequential

    removal of some posts and rails, and the removal of a barrier

    at the top of the terrace near the entrance tunnel, Barrier

    144. The result of the addition of the central radial fence

    was to divide the pen immediately behind the goal into the two

    pens 3 and 4. These were to be the scene of the disaster in

    April 1989.



    18.   All these changes were discussed between the police, the

    Club and Dr Eastwood, and the Officer Working Party approved

    the removal of Barrier 144 in August 1986, by which time Mr


                                    7
Bownes had become the Licensing Officer responsible for the

Safety Certificate on behalf of the Council.



19.   Alterations to the turnstiles and concourse of the

Leppings Lane entrance were also made at this time in the

interests of segregation. To this end Dr Eastwood had

suggested a plan for separate access to the North stand, to

each end of the West stand, and to each of the three central

pens by means of separate banks of turnstiles. This plan was

not adopted for financial reasons, but it seems that separate

entrances would have enabled the numbers of supporters

entering each of the pens to be monitored by mechanical or

computerised counting at the turnstiles. As it was, there was

no numerical monitoring or other means of limiting the numbers

of supporters entering the penned areas, including the popular

pens 3 and 4 immediately behind the goal .



20.   The effect was that these areas were likely to attract

more than their proper share of the 10,100 supporters allowed

into the Leppings Lane end under the Safety Certificate and

there was no physical way of preventing this. All had to be

left to visual monitoring by the police and the Club stewards

as the supporters took their places inside the ground.



21.   The police had requested the removal of Barrier 144 in

pen 3 for two reasons: first, to assist the flow of supporters

into the pens and, secondly, to assist evacuation through the

tunnel in an emergency. Unhappily, as later events showed, the


                                8
first purpose was all too successfully achieved. A further

consequence, however, unappreciated at the time, was to

increase the capacity of pen 3.



22.   The Safety Certificate should have been amended to take

account of these changes, which the Club notified to the

Council in accordance with its statutory obligations. Equally

importantly,   it should have contained maximum figures for

individual pens.



23.   The Certificate was not amended and maximum figures were

not inserted partly because Mr Bownes, as Chief Licensing

Officer responsible for 32 other licensing systems, was

overworked, and partly because Dr Eastwood thought that the

maximum stated capacity for the Leppings Lane end need not be

altered providing the police could ensure even distribution of

the supporters throughout the terrace by leaving the radial

gates open. The Taylor Report found that the insertion of

proper maximum figures into the Safety Certificate might have

prompted the Club and the police to find some way of limiting

the numbers entering pens 3 and 4. One way would have been the

adoption of Dr Eastwood's plan for separate turnstile

entrances mentioned above.



24.   The Taylor Report concluded that the fact that the Safety

Certificate was not amended and individual pen capacities not

reviewed could not be laid solely at Dr Eastwood s door. The

Council was ultimately responsible for the Certificate.


                                  9
#   25.    Entry to pens 3 and 4 was via the tunnel running from

    the concourse area behind turnstiles A-G, underneath the West

    stand and out into the terrace (see Appendices 1 and'3 to the

    Taylor Report). The effect of the changes to the layout of the

    Leppings Lane terrace, all of which were purportedly licensed

    under the Safety Certificate, was that the only means of

    controlling the numbers entering those pens was by cordoning

    off the tunnel access.



    26.   Moreover,   it was the policy of the police at semi-finals

    (but not at League matches) to allow free movement of

    supporters between pens prior to the kick off, when the radial

    gates would be closed and locked. Unless steps were taken to

    control the numbers entering the tunnel access, therefore,

    pens 3 and 4 were liable to become grossly overcrowded at all

    times. The police had accepted de facto responsibility for

    monitoring the pens and their policy of "letting the fans find

    their own level", was severely criticised in the Taylor Report

    (see paras 172 to 183).



    The opening of the exit gate

    27.   As already stated, the exit gate (Gate C) was opened at

    2.52 pm on the day of the disaster following an instruction

    from Mr Duckenfield. Gate C is situated almost immediately

    opposite the tunnel (see Appendix 1 to the Taylor Report) and

    no steps had been taken to cordon off the tunnel or to divert

    the influx away to the sides of the West stand. The result was


                                     10
that the supporters effectively had nowhere to go but the

already overcrowded pens 3 and 4.



28.   As the supporters entered the tunnel some were-swept off

their feet, accelerated by a 1 in 6 downward gradient in the

tunnel itself. A huge crush built up in pens 3 and 4 and some

supporters tried to escape on to the pitch. Others climbed

over the radial fences to the side pens where, ironically,

there was still plenty of room. Later some began to be hauled

up out of the pens to safety in the West stand.



29.    The match kicked off just before 3 pm. The evidence

before the Taylor Inquiry satisfied that tribunal that it was

the near goal for Liverpool at 3.04 pm that caused a powerful

surge forward in pen 3, the force of which caused a crush

barrier at the front of the pen, barrier 124A, to collapse.

This in turn hurled supporters down against the wall and to

their deaths, putting yet more pressure on those already

suffocating at the perimeter wire at the front. The collapse

of this barrier appears to have been a major factor in the

deaths,    since there were far fewer deaths in pen 4 where no

barrier collapsed.



30.   The Taylor Report found that a further contributory cause

of the collapse of barrier 124A was the removal of barrier 144

in 1986 already referred to. The absence of the latter

barrier,   in the exceptional conditions prevailing, meant that

the supporters met no retarding structure as they emerged from


                                 11
m
    the tunnel into pen 3, and that there was unbroken diagonal

    pressure from the mouth of the tunnel down to barrier 124A.

    Further, as the plan at Appendix 4 to the Taylor Report shows,

    barrier 124A was vulnerable to downward pressure as a result

    of the removal of the barrier immediately above it - one of

    the alterations consequential to the installation of the two

    additional radial fences. The Taylor Report's conclusions are

    supported on this point by the evidence of Inspector Bullas

    (see para 234) and by a concession made by Dr Eastwood.



    31.   The Taylor Report's findings on the timing of the

    collapse of barrier 124A and its probable cause and effects

    are supported by the BBC video tape and the evidence of the

    supporters near to the barrier itself. They are reinforced by

    the probability that, had the barrier collapsed earlier, the

    police on the track would have appreciated that this

    catastrophe had occurred and would have taken rescue action

    much earlier.



    32.   We have viewed the evidence and we are impressed by it.

    With respect, we share the opinion of the Taylor Report that

    this is what occurred. The collapse of barrier 124A was, of

    course, a major factor in the causation of the deaths.



    33.   The Taylor Report also found, on the basis of expert

    evidence which is before us, that barrier 124A, although

    corroded, had been tested by Dr Eastwood in July 1988 and had

    passed the loading tests specified in the Green Guide.


                                   12
Although the corrosion played a part in the collapse,    the

effective cause, the Report found, was the excessive and

unanticipated pressure to which it was exposed at the time of

the forward surge mentioned above. The Green Guide made no

specific reference to testing for corrosion as a cause of

deterioration.



34.   The crushing in pens 3 and 4 was not recognised either by

the police officers in the control box in the South West

corner of the ground (see Appendix 1), or by the officers

detailed to the perimeter track, for several minutes after the

first signs of distress appeared, resulting in time being lost

before rescue efforts began. It is plain also,    from our

reading of the statements, that the crushing and distress was

not recognised by nearby civilians, by many (but not all) of

the broadcasters and press, nor by stewards of the C l u b .

Having seen the video evidence, we can readily understand how

this situation arose. The truth is that no-one was expecting

to happen what in fact happened.



35.   There was no effective leadership until the arrival of

Chief Superintendent Nesbit just after 3pm and it was not

until 3.06pm that Mr Duckenfield appreciated that there had

been a major disaster rather than the pitch invasion that he

had assumed. The ambulance service was called at 3.06pm but no

request for cutting gear or the fire brigade was made until

3.13pm. The Taylor Report concluded, however, that it is




                                13
 unlikely (although possible) that these services could have

 saved lives had they been called promptly. We agree.



 36.   The evacuation of the supporters and those injured was

achieved mainly through the perimeter gates. These were not

designed as exits and those to pens 3 and 4 were narrower than

provided by the Green guide. The Taylor report concluded,

however, that even if their width had complied with the Green

Guide, the gates would have been wholly inadequate to relieve
                                                         I
the pressure and release spectators swiftly. The Guide was

silent as to any recommended number of such gates and it is

clear that their use for large scale evacuation was not

intended or anticipated.



37.    The opening of gate C, which precipitated the disaster,

was made necessary by the massive build up of supporters at

the Leppings Lane turnstiles between 2.30 and 2.50 pm. The

perimeter gates to the ground (see Appendix 1) were open from

the outset,   and severe congestion and crushing developed at

the turnstiles, the number and capacity of which were

inadequate to cope in time with the large numbers. The

crushing worsened as kick-off time approached and supporters

realised they would be late into the ground. The police lost

control of the crowd and the crush became unmanageable and

dangerous, with many fearing for their lives. The kick-off was

not postponed because it had been agreed with the Club that

this course would only be taken if there was a major cause of

delay such as an accident on the motorway or fog. Mr


                                14
^ ^ u c k e n f ield gave inconsistent evidence to the Inquiry about

^ n i s decision on this point and the Report concluded that the

 kick-off could and should have been postponed.



  38.    The request to open gate C was made by Superintendent

  Marshall, the Commander in Leppings Lane, who told Mr

  Duckenfield by radio that someone would be killed if the gate

  was not opened. There is a very considerable body of evidence

  to show that Mr Marshall's view was correct and that Mr

  Duckenfield had no alternative but to agree to the opening of

  the gate.



  39.    However, neither Mr Duckenfield nor any other police

  officer took any steps to deal with the consequences of the

  opening of the gate. In particular, the tunnel was not closed

  off. This action, which had been taken in 1988 by serial

  police officers apparently on their own initiative, could and

  should have been carried out by a small number of police

  forming a cordon and directing supporters to the unfilled wing

  pens. Mr Duckenfield did order police serials to go to the

  concourse to monitor an influx when another gate, gate A, was

  opened a little earlier, because he feared a pitch invasion

  from the North stand where there was no perimeter fence.



   40.   The Taylor Report concluded that Mr Duckenfield's failure

   to give a similar order on the opening of gate C was        a

   blunder of the first magnitude". Plainly, this error was the

   immediate, or proximate, cause of the crushing in pens 3 and 4
and the pressure which led to the collapse of the barrier in

pen 3.



41.   But it was not of course the sole cause. In addition to

the layout characteristics of the terrace described earlier,

the other main cause was the build up outside the ground which

led to the need to open the gate. This itself was due to a

combination of factors to which reference must now be made.



The build up outside the ground

42.   The first factor contributing to the build up outside the

ground was the layout of the Leppings Lane turnstiles and the

narrowness of the neck or forecourt at the bend in the Lane

itself where, coming from the North, it turns to the South-

West and crosses the river (see Appendix 1). Not only were the

turnstiles not in a straight line, affording adequate space

for the formation of orderly queues, therefore, but the

waiting area itself was extremely confined. Next, there was

the designation and marking of the turnstiles, with the 10,100

ticket-holders for the West terrace all being required to

enter through turnstiles A-G at entrance "B", although the

three blocks of turnstiles serving the Leppings Lane entrance

were confusingly lettered "A,C,B". In addition, the colour

coding on the turnstile walls was too low to be seen through a

crowd. The Taylor Report found these to be factors

contributing to the delay in the turnstile operation.
^^43.   However, the turnstile operation itself was slow because

  there were only seven turnstiles to admit the 10,100 ticket-

  holders, an average of 1450 through each. This is to be

  compared with the 60 turnstiles at the Penistone Road end

  which served 29,800, a little under 500 per stile. The Green

  Guide provided that in general no more than 750 could be

  admitted in one hour. The Club, taking into account that it

  was an all-ticket match with no cash passing, reckoned this

  could be increased to 1000 per hour. However, as Lord Justice

  Taylor observed, even at this higher rate it would have taken

  almost 1% hours to admit all those with terrace tickets; at

  750 per hour it would have taken 2 hours. The Taylor Report

  concluded that the police and the Club should have foreseen

  that the turnstiles and the waiting area would be under strain

  to admit all the Liverpool supporters in time.



  44.   Many supporters arrived after 2.30 pm, the request on the

  ticket being simply "to take up position 15 minutes before

  kick off". Some arrived without tickets and tried to get in by

  paying cash, others by trying to go over or under the paddle

  of the turnstile or by sliding through with a ticket-holder.

  All these activities slowed the admission rate and contributed

  to the frustration of the crowd as kick-off approached.



  45.    There is no question on the evidence that many of the

  supporters had been drinking and some were abusive as a

  result. Probably few offered violence and the Taylor Report

  acquitted the majority of being affected by drink, finding


                                 17
that some police had overestimated this factor in their

evidence. Having read the relevant statements,    it seems to us

that drink and unruliness of the supporters certainly

contributed to the pushing from the back and was a factor in

making supporters less amenable to police requests to move

back. In some cases, too, drunk supporters tried to force

themselves in at the turnstiles, causing fighting with other

supporters and scuffles with the police trying to prevent

their entry. This minority contributed to the loss of control

of the crowd by police in our view.



46.   Nevertheless,   the main factor in this loss of control was

a failure of police strategy in not planning properly for the

crush likely to be caused by a large concentration of arrivals

from 2.30 pm onwards, and in failing to stem the flow of

supporters or filter them towards the turnstiles from some

position outside the perimeter gates. Such action had been

successfully carried out in 1988, as numerous witnesses have

confirmed. The Taylor Report concluded that a combination of

controlled filtering and a postponed kick-off would probably

haver obviated the need to open the gate.



Apportionment of responsibility

47.   The layout of the ground as it stood on the day of the

disaster was the responsibility of four organisations,    and

some of the individuals acting on their behalf, namely the

Club, Eastwood and Partners, the Council and the police.

However, none of them foresaw that the progressive alterations


                                 18
made to the ground from about 1977 onwards in the interests of

safety and good order would come to constitute,   in effect,   a

death trap for supporters entering pens 3 and 4. This was

principally because no-one foresaw that up to 2000 supporters

would be allowed to enter these pens at a time when they were

already overcrowded, and when spreading out to the side to

absorb the extra numbers would be impossible. Plainly, no-one

foresaw any circumstances akin to the opening of gate C, nor

the unprecedented crushing outside the ground which made that

action necessary on the day of the disaster. That said, all

four organisations share some responsibility for the lack of

safe maximum capacities, the lack of controlled entry to the

pens and the absence of any proper system of monitoring, as

they must for the departures from the Green Guide and the

inadequacy of the Safety Certificate. The police must take the

main responsibility for the policy of letting the fans find

their own level although, as the lengthy exploration of the

borders of their duties at the Inquiry demonstrates,   the Club

must share some responsibility for the way in which supporters

were allowed to fill the pens at semi-final matches.



48.   It may be argued that the 1981 crushing incident already

mentioned ought to have alerted the police and the Club to the

dangers of admitting large numbers of supporters via the

tunnel access to the West terrace, where they were capable of

being crushed against the perimeter fence, and that knowledge

of this incident increased the responsibility on the police

and the Club for affording safe access to the West terrace. We


                               19
•
    consider that this is not so, because the response of the

    police in 1981, accepted by the other parties involved, was to

    instal the radial fences with the aim of preventing the

    inwards movement of supporters to the area behind the goal,

    and until the disaster it was assumed that this was a correct

    response. Whether it was correct or not, the incident in our

    view has no direct bearing on the disaster eight years later

    and does not add to the potential criminal responsibility of

    the police and the Club.



    49.   The opening of gate C was the responsibility of Mr

    Duckenfield and, as already noted, his decision was correct in

    the circumstances. However, the failure to give any order to

    accommodate the influx was a serious error which must in our

    view be Mr Duckenfield's responsibility and his alone. Mr

    Duckenfield had been promoted to Chief Superintendent of F

    Division only three weeks before the match, and it is

    reasonable to ask whether he was competent to take charge of a

    match of this importance. However, there is no evidence to

    suggest that those responsible for his promotion so erred in

    appointing him as to share responsibility for errors made by

    him on the day.



    50.   The fact that the tunnel was cordoned off in 1988 by a

    handful of junior police officers apparently on their own

    initiative - an action that almost certainly would have

    averted the disaster a year later - is one of the most

    unfortunate aspects of the case, and at first sight the


                                   20
operational organisation of the police might seem responsible

for failing to incorporate this tactic in its match planning.

However, Mr Duckenfield's dispatch of a serial to deal with

the opening of gate A demonstrates to our mind that it was

within his power to accommodate the opening of gate C, and the

blame for his not doing so cannot in our view be laid

elsewhere.



51. The build up outside the ground was again the

responsibility of the four organisations identified above.

Given the restrictions of space attendant on the geography of

Leppings Lane itself, the layout of the turnstiles and their

numbers, designation and marking was primarily a matter for

the police and the Club. But the Council was also partly

responsible for ensuring that there was safe ingress to the

ground (see Chapter 5 of the Green Guide).



52.   Allowing for the policing difficulties to which the

layout and slow admission rate of the turnstiles gave rise,

the loss of police control, and in particular the failure to

follow the filtering tactics employed in 1988, was solely a

police responsibility. The responsibility was, however, a

collective one and cannot be attributed to any individual

officer.



Criminal Offences




                               21
53.   We turn to consider whether any criminal offence is

disclosed against any of the organisations or individuals

identified or referred to above.



(1) Manslaughter

54. The police authority, the Club and the Council are in law

all corporations of one kind or another (see Halsbury's Laws

of England,   4th ed, Vol 9 at paras 1201-3) so an important

first question is whether a corporation can be indicted for

manslaughter.



55.   This question was considered at length by Professor J.C.

Smith in relation to the shipping company's liability for the

sinking of the Herald of Free Enterprise in an Opinion dated

25th November 1987. We have had the advantage of seeing that

Opinion, which concluded that the company in that case could

be properly indicted for manslaughter by gross negligence or

recklessness, assuming it could be proved that one or more of

the directing minds of the company caused the deaths, and did

so with the fault required by the definition of manslaughter.

In due course proceedings were begun against the company and

others and on 5th June 1990 Turner J, sitting at the Central

Criminal Court, dismissed a motion to quash the indictment

against the company, holding that both on the authorities and

on principle a corporation is capable of committing

manslaughter. We have seen a note of the Reserved Judgment,

which includes a full consideration of the authorities,     and in

our respectful view it represents a correct view of the law.


                                22
56.    We accordingly advise that each of the corporations

mentioned above could properly be indicted for manslaughter if

it could be proved that one or more of the directing minds of

the corporation concerned committed manslaughter as that

offence is currently defined.



( 2) D e f i n i t i o n o f m a n sla u g h te r
57.     Involuntary manslaughter is committed when a person

causes the death of another either (1 ) intending to do an act

which, whether he knows it or not, is unlawful and dangerous

in that it is likely to cause direct personal injury ( an

unlawful and dangerous act"), or (2 ) intending to do an act

which creates an obvious and serious risk of causing personal

injury (a) not giving thought to the possibility of such risk,

or (b) having recognised that there was some risk involved,

nonetheless going on to take it ("recklessness'          as defined by

Lord Diplock In R v Lawrence [1982] AC 510).



58.     To amount to manslaughter a person's conduct need not be

the only cause of the death, but it must be a substantial

cause in that it contributed significantly to the result.

Whether it did so contribute is generally a question of fact

for the jury: Paqett (1983) 76 Cr App Rep 279, 287-91.



59.      It may also be that manslaughter is committed if the

person causing the death intends to do an act, or omits to do

an act where there is a duty to do so, being grossly negligent


                                                    23
whether death or serious personal injury results ("gross

negligence"): see eg Smith and Hogan, Criminal Law, 6th ed

(1988) at p 345. The law is at present uncertain whether gross

negligence still exists as a separate head of liability,        two

recent authorities having held that the earlier cases where

manslaughter is defined in terms of negligence should not be

followed and that Lord Diplock's test should be applied

universally.



60.    In Seymour (1983) 76 Cr App Rep 211, Watkins LJ, giving

the judgment of the Court of Appeal in a reckless driving
case, said:

       ...we are of the view that it is no longer necessary or

      helpful to make reference to compensation and negligence.

      The Lawrence direction on recklessness is comprehensive

      and of general application to all offences,   including

      manslaughter involving the driving of motor vehicles

      recklessly and should be given to juries without in any

      way being diluted. Whether a driver at the material time

      was conscious of the risk he was running or gave no

      thought to its existence, is a matter which affects

      punishment for which purposes the judge will have to

      decide,   if he can, giving the benefit of doubt to the

      convicted person,   in which state of mind that person had

      driven at the material time."




                                 24
     in         r h a u k Kwan v R ( 1 9 8 5 )   8 2 Cr App Rep 18 Lord

Roskill, giving the opinion of the Privy council, said at p

25
     •'Their Lordships are of the view that the present.state

     of the relevant law in England and Wales... is clear. The

     model direction suggested in Lawrence and held in Seymour

     equally applicable to cases of motor manslaughter

     requires,      first, that the vehicle was in fact being

     driven in such a manner as to create an obvious and

     serious risk of causing physical injury to another and

      secondly that the defendant so drove either without

      having given any thought to the possibility of there

      being such a risk or having recognised that there was

      such a risk nevertheless took it.
              in principle their Lordships see no reason why a

      comparable direction should not have been given in the

      present case as regards that part of the case which

      concerned the alleged navigation of the F l y in i O o l d f i n c h

      by Kong and indeed as regards the alleged navigation of

      the Flying Flamingo by the other two defendants,

          their respective acts of navigation create an obvious and

          serious risk of causing physical damage to some other

          ship and thus to other persons who might have been

          travelling in the area of the collision at the material

          time? If so did any of the defendants... so navigate

          either without having given any thought to the

          possibility of that risk or, while recognising that the

          risk existed, take that risk?
At p 26, Lord Roskill said:

      "Their Lordships... respectively agree with the comment

      made by Watkins L J... in Seymour."



62.   However, as pointed out by Smith and Hogan (6th ed (1988)

at p 353), while the clear implication from Kong Cheuk Kwan is

that there is no longer any separate test of gross negligence

in manslaughter,   it may be that the courts would not be

prepared to exclude it altogether in an appropriate case. Some

support for this view is found in Goodfellow (1986) 83 Cr App

Rep 23, where Lord Lane LCJ said that the question in Kong

Cheuk Kwan was whether the defendant was "guilty of

recklessness (or gross negligence)".



63.   We consider it right in the circumstances of Hillsborough

to approach the evidence on the basis that the gross

negligence test is sufficient to establish the offence of

manslaughter and we propose to advise accordingly.



(3) Neglect by police

64.   When gross negligence or manslaughter by neglect is

alleged against the police, however, authority indicates a

more detailed test of liability. In R v West London ..Coroner *.£>

Court. ex p Gray [1988] QB 467, allegations were made against

police following the death of a man while in police custody

concerning the use of force against him and failure to summon

an ambulance promptly when he became unconscious. The

coroner's directions to the jury as to unlawful killing were


                                26
gashed     by the Divisional Court, which held that a coroner

directing a jury on manslaughter comprising unlawful falling

 alleged to have occurred because of neglect by pol

 required to direct them as follows.
         (1) that they had to be satisfied of four ingredients,

      namely (a) that the police were under a duty to have

         regard to the health and welfare of the deceased,                (b)

         that in the circumstances there was a failure to do what

         should have been done for the health and welfare of the

                .      / n     i-h*t the failure amounted to a substantial
         deceased,     (c)     that tne laixu
                                   ^   r * \   i-hat the failure amounted to
         c a u s e o f d e a t h , and (d)

         recklessness;
                      *. 4- r,-F
         (2) that the test  of "recklessness"
                                 reciciessne^ was whether a police
         officer, having regard to his duty, was indifferent to an

          obvious and serious risk to the health and welfare of the

          deceased or, recognising that risk to be present,

          deliberately         chose to run it by doing          nothing about it;

          (3) that a failure to                appreciate that   there was such a

                     4-   itself sufficient to amount to
          risk was not by itseir

          recklessness; and
                                   oriiv return a verdict of unlawful
           (4) that the jury could only retur
                                attribute the unlawful conduct to a
          killing if they could attribute

           single police officer.



   65.     Plainly those directions are those to be given in any

   criminal prosecution of a police officer where omission

   is alleged to have! caused death. In our view they ha
direct bearing on our consideration of the evidence in this

case.



(4 ) Culpable misfeasance
66 .    We turn next to consider the common law offence of

culpable misfeasance or misconduct in public office. We are

satisfied that this offence exists, and that it is committed

where a public officer, such as a police officer, wilfully

neglects to perform a duty which he is bound to perform by

common law or statute. But the neglect has to be wilful, not

merely inadvertent, and must be culpable in the sense that        't

is without reasonable excuse or justification. The element of

culpability is not restricted to corruption or dishonesty,

however, but must be of such a degree that t h e misconduct is

calculated to injure the public interest: R^L_BYtham [1979] 2

QB 722.



 67.    Even if the words "likely to" are substituted for

 "calculated" in this definition, as we think they might be, it

 is clear that this little known offence is a difficult one to

 prove to the satisfaction of a jury.



 Evidence to support manslaughter

 68 .    We consider in turn the possible liability of (i ) the

 Club,    (ii) Eastwood and Partners,   (iii) the Council and (iv)

 the police.    It will be convenient to consider the evidence

 first against the four organisations, and secondly in relation




                                   28
to the individuals who acted on behalf of the organisations

concerned.



(i ) The Club

69.   The C l u b 's responsibility for the crushing and deaths

lies in its responsibility for (1 ) the layout of the inside of

the ground as a result of the alterations to the West terrace

and (2 ) the layout, number, designation and marking of the

turnstiles in Leppings Lane. Whilst, on our factual analysis

of the disaster, these two factors might be regarded as

substantial causes of the deaths in that they contributed

significantly to the result, it is clear not only that they

were not the sole causes, or even the major causes, but that

the Club's actions and omissions only partly contributed to

them. As already observed (see para 47 above), the layout of

the ground was the responsibility of the four organisations

and in varying degrees. The Club not only relied on its own

consultant engineer Dr Eastwood, but it responded to the

suggestions and advice of the police in important respects.

The Council played its part.



70.   For the purposes of the criminal law, where it is

axiomatic that a case against each defendant must be given

totally separate consideration, we consider that there is no

sufficient evidence to support a prima facie case that the

Club caused the deaths.




                                 29
 71.   In case we are wrong in that conclusion, we have

 considered whether the requisite intention for manslaughter

 could be proved against the Club. It seems to us, however,

 that the evidence does    not begin to show either recklessness

 or gross negligence on    its part.



 72.   It follows that there is in our view no sufficient

 evidence to support a charge of manslaughter against either

 the Club or any of its officials.



 (i i ) Eastwood and Partners

73.    Since Dr Eastwood   was the principal    ofthe firm,it is

his actions and omissions alone that fall to be considered. As

consultant to the Club he too was responsible for the layout

of the inside of the ground and the layout and operation of

the turnstiles. However, his advice formed part only of the

sequence of events that led to the structural condition of the

ground as it was immediately before the disaster and by no

rational yardstick could his advice be said to have caused the

deaths. There are two further factors in his case, moreover.

First, his advice in relation to the forming of separate

turnstile entrances to the North stand, each end of the West

stand and each of the central plans, not acted on for

financial reasons, would if adopted have led to numerical

monitoring of the central pens, and might well have led to the

insertion of maximum figures for those pens in compliance with

the Safety Certificate. Second, so far as the Safety
Certificate is concerned, this was the ultimate responsibility

of the Council.



74.   There is no evidence that Dr Eastwood caused the deaths.

Nor is there any evidence that he was either reckless or

grossly negligent. We have no hesitation, therefore, in

concluding that there is no evidence to support a charge of

manslaughter against Dr Eastwood or indeed against Eastwood

and Partners.



(i i i ) The Council

75.   The Council bears responsibility for the Safety

Certificate, which should have been amended to provide for the

alterations and for the insertion of maximum figures for the

pens. The Council was also responsible for ensuring compliance

with the Green Guide in the respects detailed above, as well

as in some other respects. There were departures from the

Green Guide, some more important then others. Of course,    it

does not follow that the disaster would not have happened even

if the Safety Certificate had been amended, since compliance

depended on the Club and Dr Eastwood. In common with the Club

and Dr Eastwood, however, the Council's errors only partly

contributed to the ground conditions identified above as

causes of the deaths and on any view were too remote to amount

to a prima facie case of manslaughter. There is no evidence of

recklessness or- gross negligence on their part.




                               31
      ■- -    —      = «     accordingly no evidence to support a charge of
      manslaughter against Mr Bownes.



               It is unnecessary to consider the liability of the

               Club, should have foreseen the difficulties of

 admission of such large numbers. There was a serious failure

Dr Eastwood, with the Council and the Officer Working Party
superintending the alterations to the West terrace. Likewise,

the contents of the Safety Certificate were not the main

responsibility of the police. The difficulties inherent in the

policing of Leppings Lane, which were partly geographical, and

the arrival of supporters in very large numbers after 2.30 pm

were not and could not be under police control. Finally, the

unruly behaviour of a minority of them, although no doubt

foreseeable, created added difficulties.



80.     Once responsibility for the failure to postpone the kick-

off and to cordon off the access tunnel is confined to M         ^

Duckenfield, as we consider it should be (see para 48 above),

the conclusion becomes inescapable in our view that the police

       an organisation cannot be said to have caused the deaths by

their strategy and operational errors.



 81.     We have examined the structure of the police comma

 both on the day of the disaster itself and in previous years.

 We have considered the operational orders for 1988 and 1989

 and police practice at Hillsborough, inside and outside

 ground, as detailed in the Taylor Report. We have also

 considered the interviews of Mr Marshall and Mr Murray.

 However, there seems to us to be no evidence that in making

 what were undoubtedly errors of Judgment and practice, the

 police organisation, or any individual within it, acted

 recklessly or in a.grossly negligent manner either on the day

 of the disaster or beforehand.

                                                    34
 operational orders or police intelligence was inadequate, as

 seems likely, it was not the fault of Mr Duckenfield who

 inherited a ready made match plan compiled by others and tried

 to follow it. The slowness of his response to the disaster,

while much to be regretted, was doubtless due in part to his

lack of experience of this particular match.



85.    Mr Duckenfield, who declined to be interviewed for the

purposes of the criminal investigation, would no doubt argue

that none of these errors caused the deaths because of the

interposition of the many other factors already rehearsed.       It

seems to us that that argument would be likely to succeed in

relation to many of the criticisms. However, there is a case

to be made in our view that his failure both to postpone the

kick-off and to take no action to close the tunnel after the

opening of gate C was a substantial cause of the deaths,    in

that it significantly contributed to the crowd pressure which

led to the crushing and the collapse of barrier 124A.



86 .   If that is so, it is necessary to consider whether there

is evidence that Mr Duckenfield, when failing so to act, had

the requisite intention to support a charge of manslaughter.



87.    Clearly there was no unlawful and dangerous act on his

part or intended by him which would found the first head of

liability in involuntary manslaughter. But in failing to

postpone the kick-off, or to order the closure of the tunnel

after the opening of gate C, or both, did he intend an act


                                35
which created an obvious and serious risk of causing personal

injury, either not giving thought to the possibility of such

risk, or having recognised that there was some risk involved,

nonetheless go on to take it?



88.     We consider that there are difficulties in proving that

he intended to do an act which created an obvious and serious

risk of causing personal injury. In the first place there was

no "act" as such, but an omission or omissions to act which

contributed to a rapidly developing state of affairs ending in

serious risk of injury. But was it an obvious risk at the

time? We think n o t . The complexity of the disaster as now

known to those who have analysed it in hindsight demonstrates

that there must be grave doubt as to whether the omissions

created a risk which was obvious to anyone at the time. The

considerations here are, of course, wholly different from the

driving cases or the collision at sea in the Kong Cheuk Kwan

case.



89.     We conclude, therefore, that there is insufficient

evidence on which to found a charge of recklessness against Mr

Duckenfield. Nor is there evidence that he was grossly

negligent in failing to act as mentioned above. We bear in

mind particularly the judgment of the Divisional Court in the

West London Coroner's Court case^the requirements of which are

not in our view satisfied.




                                 36
90.    It follows, and we have come to the clear conclusion,

that there is no evidence that Mr Duckenfield was wilfully

neglectful of his duty or was culpable so as to have committed

the offence of culpable misfeasance.



91.    We conclude that there is no sufficient evidence of any

criminal offence having been committed by Mr Duckenfield.



Police Constables Sm ith and Illingworth

92.    We note the complaints made against these two officers

who were stationed on the perimeter track at gates 3 a

respectively and we have considered the interviews of both.

There is conflicting evidence in the case of each as to how he

reacted and when each gate was opened (see the West Midlands

Report Part VII at pp 252 to 259) and in the case of Smith

 there is substantial doubt as to whether he pushed spectators,

 including the complainant Hendry and an unidentified boy, back

 into the crowd and if so when, ie whether before or after he

 had appreciated the true nature of the disaster.



 93.    There is no evidence before us that either of these

 officers was guilty of manslaughter or culpable misfeasance,

 and we advise that the allegations made against them be

 investigated further and if appropriate pursued in

 disciplinary proceedings.




                                  37
94.   The balance of allegations against the other officers

mentioned in the West Midlands Report must likewise be a

matter for disciplinary proceedings.



95.   We therefore find no sufficent evidence to support

criminal proceedings of any kind against those persons

mentioned in the West Midlands Report whom we have not found

it necessary to identify in this Opinion.

clear conclusion that a failure of police control was the                       M adam Speaker. I have given you prior notice o f this
principal cause of the disaster. By implication, it is clear                    point of order, which concerns the accuracy o f statements

                                             WEDNESDAY, 18 FEBRUARY 1998



          With permission Madam Speaker, I would like to make a statement about the
          Hillsborough Stadium disaster.


          2        Few events in recent years have touched the lives of so many people. The
          and friends of the 96 Liverpool fans who died oaHL5                                     have suffered
          immeasurably. The whole nation was profoundly disturbed by what occurred that day.
.      .Although km                  r almost nine years since that feteful day,' msuay of the families and others
    . .*.V                      evidence was available which would cast new light on these events.' As Home

          Secretary, I was determined to do all I could to establish if that was indeed the case.

                                                            /■£>? i"
      }       .   On coming into office in Maj^I gave this question intense consideration, and on
       30 June 1997,1 announced to the House that the Attorney General and I had decided to
       appoint Lord Justice Sruan-Smkh, a senior Lord Justice of the Court of Appeal to conduct
       an independent scrutiny of this matter. His terms of reference were:


                  To ascertain whether any evidence exists relating to the disaster at the Hillsborough
                  Stadium on 15 April 1989 which was not available:


                  (a)           to the inquiry conducted by the late Lord Taylor; or


                  (b)           to the Di r e c t o f Public Prosecutions or Attorney General for the purpose
                                of discharging their respective statutory responsibilities; or

                    disciplinary matters;


                    and in relation to (a) to advise whether any evidence not previously available
                    is of such significance as to justify establishment by the Secretary of State for
                    the Home Department of a further public inquiry; and in relation to (b)
                    and (c) to draw to their attention any evidence not previously considered by
                   them which may be relevant to their respective duties;            and to advise
                   whether there is any other action which should be taken in the public
                   interest.

 today.      A iX W o ^         ¥ f'*^      r \ / t l"



 5        His scrutiny is the latest in a series of lengthy and detailed examinations of the
                 l^ s case*      public inquiry led by the late Lord Justice Taylor considered
fullythe causes of the disaster and made wide-ranging            recorimiendatif\n<aK^iy crowd

at football grounds and on the policing of football matches.

by the Coroner for the Western District of South Yorkshire in        twoparts in AjM'H ifuTMjy
     frfldJiePKesa-Novembw4990nriMtfch 1991. They involved over 80 days of public
hearing. A further investigation was conducted by the West Midlands police, supervised
by the Police Complain* A u t W ^ e ^ h j ^ e r there were my grounds for
criminal or disciplinary proceedings. That investigation involved the taking of more than
5000 statements. At a later stage in November 1993, there was a judicial review of thp
coroner’s proceedings, which upheld the inquest verdict of accidental death andtche
conduct of those proceedings,            have now had this further detailed scrutiny by a senior
Lord Justice of Appeal.

                              Lord Taylor in his interim report in August 1989. He did not attribute all the blame to a
                              single cause or person, but in paragraph 278 he made it clear that “the main reason for the        .. ' 7 v

                              which he was asked to consider added anything significant to the evidence which was
                              available to Lord Taylor’s inquiry or to the inquests.


                              10        I, the Attorney General and the DPP have considered Lord Justice Stuarc-Smith’s
                              report very carefully. We have no reason to believe that his conditions are wrong. ;This
                              will, I know, be deeply disappointing for the families of those who died at Hillsborough
                          and many who have campaigned on their behalf!.



                                                                                                                                         ■7 ;

                 ground on that day. I hope and believe that the changes which resulted from the Taylor
                 Inquiry should mean that such a disaster will never be repeated.


                 12   But t W is “ other “ nM in           the system las Med the Hillsborough fanulies.
                As Lord Justice Stuart-Smith says in chapter 7 of his report,


                          “I understand the dismay that they have that no individual has personally been held
                         to account either in a criminal court, disciplinary proceedings, or even to the extent
                         of losing their job*.


                13       There are serious shortcomings in the police disciplinary system.        The Home
               Affcrs Committee produced a report earlier this year which maices recommendations for
               change.       I will be responding hilly to that report soon.       But what happened after
               Hillsborough is a prime example of why we have to improve the current arrangements.


               14        L° rd 1'islice Snun’Smith also comments on the coroner’s proceedings after a major
               disaster, which has been subject to a public inquiry. He endorses the recommendation of a
              Home Office Working Group on Disasters and Inquests, published in March 1997, that the
              role of the coroner after such a public inquiry should be limited.


               15       Lord Justice Stuan-Smith highlights in his report the exceptionally difficult task
              which the coroner had in conducting the main inquest. It placed an unreasonable and, I
              think, unnecessary burden on him when the Taylor Report had covered substantially the
              same ground. Certainly I am clear that Hillsborough proved that the system in its present
              form is unsuitable as a means of dealing with disasters of this kind. If no inquest had been
              necessary, the Taylor inquiry, which all have accepted as an excellent report, would then
              have remained unchallenged as the last word on the causes of the disaster.

     16            I therefore agree in principle with Lord Justice Scuart-Smith’s recommendations
     that there should rarely be the need for an inquest following a judicial inquiry into a major
     disaster.


     17           When I established the scrutiny I said that I would do my best to ensure that the
     evidence considered by Lord Justice Stuait*Smiih was published.               Most of the main
     material which he has considered is contained in the Appendices to his report. Much of
     the other evidence which he considered is already in the public domain, consisting of
     transcripts of public hearings or material considered by the Taylor Inquiry. I am arranging
     for other material considered by Lord justice Stuart-Smith to be placed in the Library of
     the House.


     18           All Honourable Members will have the most profound sympathy with the families
     and friends of those who died at Hillsborough. We can scarcely begin to comprehend
     what they have suffered. Lord Justice Stuart-Smith says in his report:

’•        _>■ ,
■                 * I realise that my report and advice will come as a disappointment to them,
                  especially since they have had their hopes raised that something more could be
                  done. But I cannot allow compassion to cloud my judgement. I have had to look
                  dispassionately and objectively at what is said to be fresh evidence, in the light of
                  the evidence which had previously been considered*.


     19           I, the Attorney General and the Director of Publie Prosecutions must consider
    Lord Justice Stuart-Smich’s report in the same light. I recognise that it will be difficult and
    painful for the families of those who died to accept the conclusions of this report. But
    having established this rigorous judicial scrutiny I must accept its conclusions.

      statement was concerned, there was no way in which someone with the
      severe injury to his voice box which Kevin had could have said “Mom”.

15.   The Coroner caused further enquiries to be made. Inspector Sawers of the
      West Midlands Police took a farther statement from PC Bruder on the 3rd
      May 1990. In it he said that since Hillsborough he had had further training
      in first aid. In relation to his earlier statement when he described Kevin
      Williams as having convulsions, he said:

              “I have thought about this carefully today and with the added benefit
             of my training I can say that this was not a process that lasted fo r
             any time. It certainly wasn’t anything similar to an epileptic fit, fo r
             example. It was an impression that I had which I originally
             associated with the lad vomiting. I will say that I did not see the
             casualty vomit nor did I see any sick on the body or grassed area
             around him. I will correct further references to vomit as they occur
             in my original statement.

             I refer to feeling fo r a carotid pulse in the neck and said originally
             that I thought I could detect a slight pulse, however, I nowfeel that I
             am able to correct this. I felt fo r the pulse with my first two fingers
             of my left hand, I believe, to the carotid artery. I cannot say
             absolutely that I felt fo r the pulse before I started mouth-to-mouth or
             after; nor indeed whether I did both simultaneously. Whilst I would
             now have much more skill, on the day I cannot say with absolute
             certainly that I went accurately straight to the carotid artery.

             For all those reasons, I can say that I felt fo r a pulse in the region of
             the carotid artery, but I may have also touched the area of the
              ‘Adams Apple ’ or felt something in the neck region which I originally
             thought was a pulse but may have been mistaken. ”

16.   Inspector Sawers also asked Mr Bruder about the reference in his previous
      statement to trying to stop an ambulance. Mr Bruder maintained that the
      ambulance in question was on its way into the ground and going to the
      Leppings Lane end.

17.   WPC Martin had been seen on 17th March 1990 by WPS Appleton of the
      West Midlands Police, who took a further statement from her. In this
      further statement Miss Martin described how upset she had been on the day
      and that her recollection of events was vague and confused. By the time she
      came to deal with Kevin Williams’ body, which she was told to stay with in
      the gymnasium, she was in a state of shock and felt like a ‘zombie’. She
      said:

              “I didn’t know what to do. I didn’t want to believe the boy was dead.
             I didn’t know if he was dead or not but I decided that I had got to
             attempt to revive him. I started to give him mouth-to-mouth but
7.     As well as the 19 screens linked to their own CCTV system, Sheffield
       Wednesday's Control Room also contained a further screen, linked to the
       police CCTV system. This allowed people in the club Control Room to see
       what was being shown by any of the five police CCTV cameras. But they
       could not record these police pictures.

8.     The club also had a mechanism which automatically monitored the number of
       spectators passing through the turnstiles.

9.     There were three people in the Sheffield Wednesday Control Room as the
       disaster took place. One was Mr Lock, the club’s security officer. Mr Lock, a
       former policeman, gave evidence both at Lord Taylor’s Inquiry and at the
       inquests. He left the Control Room at about 2.45 p.m., at about the time when
       Gate C at Leppings Lane was opened briefly so that police could eject
       somebody. He returned just after the kick-off.

10.    The second person in the Control Room was PC Guest, who has since died.
       He was police liaison officer with the club, and gave evidence at Lord Taylor’s
        Inquiry. The third was Mr Houldsworth, the club’s video technician.


The Police CCTV System

11.    The police had five fixed CCTV cameras situated around the ground. The
       police Control Box contained one screen for each of these five cameras.
       The screens are shown in photograph 48 in Appendix 2 (48 was the number
       this photograph was allocated when it was used as an exhibit at Lord
       Taylor’s Inquiry). I need only be concerned with cameras 1, 2, 3 and 5.
       Police camera 4 was situated outside the ground, on Penistone Road, at the
       far end of the ground from Leppings Lane where the tragedy occurred.

12.    Police camera 1 was mounted on the rear of the West Stand. It looked out
        from the ground towards the Leppings Lane turnstiles, in particular
        turnstiles A-G through which the standing spectators would come. It could
        also show Leppings Lane itself, part of the area outside the turnstiles, and
        part of the concourse between the turnstiles and the West Stand. Its
        pictures were in black and white.

13.    Police camera 2 was mounted on the South Stand and it commanded views
        all round the ground. It was in colour. Police camera 3 was also mounted
        on the South Stand, but was nearer the Penistone Road (Kop) end, where the
        Nottingham Forest supporters were standing. It was in black and white.

 14.   Police camera 5 is the important one from the point of view of my scrutiny.
        It was mounted near the scoreboard at the south east corner of the West
        Stand and was the closest one to the police control box. It provided views
        of the West Stand and the West Terraces. It was in black and white.
               us so, and who are here and who seem perfectly alright because the
               cells in their case fortunately had not been so severely damaged as to
               the irretrievably harmed. That, if you like, is the beauty of the body,
               that you can assault it like that and retrieve it before it is too late and
               the people themselvesjust recover. ”

66.     The fact that Dr Walker had treated Lee Nicol was referred to at the mini-
        inquest on him (1 May 1990, p9). It is clear that the rest of the evidence
        which I have seen from Dr Walker, Ian McDermott and Stephen Williams
        adds nothing to the evidence given at the Inquest.


Arguments about the response tn the disaster

67.     I now turn to consider the submission (5 in my summary of the arguments at
        para 52 above) that the inquest verdicts should be quashed because the fresh
        evidence, particularly that of the ambulance men, shows that lives could
        have been saved by a more prompt and efficient response from the
        emergency services.

68.     The fact that evidence was available, from ambulance men who were not
        called at the Taylor Inquiry, about confusion, lack of comprehension by
        some police officers and other difficulties, does not in any way undermine or
        affect the Coroner’s decision not to have a wide-ranging inquiry into the
        response of the emergency services or his decision to have a cut-off point
        into the inquiry as to how the deceased came to their death. Indeed it is only
        to be expected that evidence relating to the rescue operation existed. Had
        the Coroner embarked on such an inquiry, which was wholly unnecessary
        for the purpose of answering the question of how the victims met their
        deaths, it is quite evident to me that the Inquest, which lasted an extremely
        long time as it was, would have become totally impossible.

69.     As the Divisional Court pointed out, it was a matter for the Coroner’s
        discretion at what point he chose to confine the inquiry. Even if there had
        been no prior investigation into the response of the police and emergency
        services, the Coroner would have been perfectly entitled to limit the inquiry
        as he did. But again, as the Court pointed out, the decision was “reasonable
        and sustainable, particularly bearing in mind the exhaustive public inquiry
        which had already been conducted by Lord Taylor” (per McCowan LJ,
        transcript p3). I shall return to this matter in the second part of this chapter.


Fraud or suppression of evidence 1

70.      The suggestion that the evidence now put before me on this aspect of the
      | case was deliberately suppressed and concealed and those concerned acted in
       1 bad faith, is, in my opinion, wholly irresponsible. The evidence of Mr
         Edwards and Mr Flack was available to Lord Taylor s Inquiry. There is
nothing surprising in the fact that they were not called to give evidence since
they did not add materially to that which was given.

Dr Walker’s evidence was available to the Coroner and the fact that he had
treated Lee Nicol was referred to at the mini-inquest on him. It would be
unusual for a junior doctor to be called to give evidence of treatment, even if
he was the first anaesthetist on the scene. The matter was dealt with, as one
would expect, by Dr Appleyard, the Consultant Anaesthetist In charge of the
Intensive Care Unit who was called to give evidence. For reasons I have
already given, Dr Walker added nothing of any significance.

So far as the evidence of Ian McDermott and Stephen Williams is concerned,
the West Midlands Police took a very large number of statements from
Liverpool supporters including Mr McDermott. More than 50 were called
at the Taylor Inquiry and over 100 gave evidence at the Inquest (only 8 of
whom had done so before at the Inquiry). I think it is worth quoting what
Lord Taylor said about the West Midlands Police.

        “ / pay tribute particularly to the West Midlands Police fo r their
        speed and dedication in gathering the evidence and to all those
        responsible fo r processing it. The most eloquent tribute to fairness
        and thoroughness of the police investigation camefrom the Secretary
        of the Football Supporters ’ Association. He said there had been
        initial anxiety at Liverpool as to whether that investigation would be
       fa ir and objective. His Association therefore collected 200 witness
        statements themselves. Having heard the opening statement by
        Counsel to the Inquiry based upon the evidence gathered by the
       police, he found that it accorded entirely with his Association’s
        evidence and the initial anxiety was wholly dispelled.” (interim
        report, para 16).

It is obvious that the police could not take statements from all those who
were in pens 3 and 4 who survived the ordeal. As I have pointed out the
evidence of these witnesses did not differ materially from that of witnesses
who were called to give evidence. The suggestion, if indeed it is made in
respect of those witnesses that their evidence was concealed or suppressed,
is completely unfounded.

In my o p inion it is quite impossible on the basis of the evidence and
submissions now advanced to impugn the verdict of accidental death or
suggest that the Divisional Court should again be invited judicially to review
that verdict.

                   INSTRUCTIONS TO COUNSEL TO ADVISE


Counsel will receive herewith

(1)   Interim Reports of Lord Justice Taylor.

(2)   Copy Judgment   R -v- Dytham.

      Counsel will of course be aware of the publicity surrounding the
      publication of the report of Lord Justice Taylor. The report was
      considered by the Director who on 15 August wrote to Mr Peter Wright,
      Chief Constable of South Yorkshire stating that the matter should be the
      subject of a full criminal investigation.

      Counsel will also be aware that Lord Justice Taylor's inquiry was
      assisted by Mr Geoffrey Dear Chief Constable of West Midlands Police
      whose officers conducted initial enquiries and took statements from
      hundreds of witnesses many of whom gave evidence before the enquiry.

      Because of the close involvement of the West Midlands Police with the
      investigation Mr Wright appointed Mr Dear to conduct the criminal
      investigation and he is assisted by Assistant Chief Constable Mervyn
      Jones and a team of officers. Whilst the criminal investigation is, in
      part, an enquiry into officers of the South Yorkshire Police and this is
      how the enquiry has been projected by the media, it will in fact
      encompass the possibility of offences by persons and bodies in addition
      to South Yorkshire police officers, namely, South Yorkshire Police
      Authority, Sheffield Wednesday Football Club, Sheffield City Council, Dr
      Eastwood and football fans.

      Whilst the investigation will focus upon the possible offence of
      manslaughter, police officers may well have committed the Common Law
      offence of malfeasance or culpable non-feasance, this offence is not
      dealt with very Fully in Archbold and Counsel may be assisted by the
      judgment in Regina -v- Dytham.

      Counsel will in due course be asked to advise as to possible criminal
      charges, but that is someway ahead, but now Counsel is asked, having
      regard to the unusual circumstances of this investigation, to advise the
      Police on an ongoing basis as to the scope and direction of their
      enquiry.

      An early conference has been arranged to discuss the case in general
      terms when the Police will explain the extent of their enquiries to date
      and the number and form of witness statements that have been obtained.

                           JOINT FURTHER ADVICE



     1.   The request of the Hillsborough Steering Committee in

     their letter of 5th February 1990 for the release of copy

     witness statements and of the files prepared for the Coroner

     is in our view a reasonable one, and the only question that

     arises is whether its release might prejudice either the

     criminal investigation or any prosecution that later results.



     2.   Mr Mervyn Jones is satisfied that the release of the

     information on the restricted basis suggested by the Coroner

     in his letter of 15th February 1990 would not prejudice the

     criminal investigation, the restrictions being that only

     evidence of a medical nature and evidence directed at the

     location of each deceased be adduced. The Coroner appears to

     be satisfied that the proceedings can be controlled to achieve

     this object and it seems propitious that the Coroner's

     assistance is available in this way.



     3.    For our part we do not think the release of the

     information in this controlled way would be likely to

     prejudice a criminal trial and we do not advise that public

     interest immunity be claimed at this stage.



     4.   We agree that the civil trial should not be embarked on

     until after the conclusion of any criminal proceedings.

                                    1
Monday, 15 January 1990

1500 hrs

            Meeting with representatives of the Director of Public
            Prosecutions at Farrers Building, Strand, London. Present
            were Mr Peter Birts, Mr Colin Cleugh, Mr Mike Kennedy,
            Detective Chief Superintendent Foster and myself. The
            following items were discussed:-

1-      File format. After considerable discussion it was agreed
        that we would continue to prepare the file in the sections
        proposed but these would not be read by the Counsel
        appointed by the Director of Public Prosecutions until we
        have submitted our final report. They would then use the
        sections as a library to which the final report will be
        cross-referenced. This was always our intention and the
        meeting confirmed it as the right course.

        Mr Birts and representatives of the Director of Public
        Prosecutions heavily, underlined the need for an early
        finalisation of the investigations- Whilst they did not want"
        to effect the thoroughness of the investigation they really
        did wish to emphasise the need for an early announcement of
        a decision. Obviously going through their mind was the
        recent decisions on the abuse of the process as a result of
        time delays.                                               >»
                                                           A-
        They were particularly concerned that we should run the
        preparation of the final report in with the preparation of
        the sections, as well as the proposals for interview so that
        by March/April they could respond about interviews. Mr
        Birts said he would respond on the question of interviews
        within.10 days on ^receipt-of'the ^’initial" final report.
              *         .   .   . .                   .
        This .very much puts the onus upon us to be able to very
        quickly carry out the interviews.
      V -         _

        Mr Birts had prepared a summary of how he saw the format of
        the final report. A copy of this proposal, together with
        other items, follows immediately this policy book note

2.      We discussed the implications of the Wapping decision and
        another case involving Police Constable Woodcock which Mr
        Kennedy suggested had far more serious implications.

3.-     We discussed the interviews. Again Mr Birts' notes had
        addressed the issue (see later). We also indicated that a
        video tape recording facility would be available. Both the
        Director of Public Prosecutions1 representatives and Mr
        Birts feel most strongly that the video facility must be
        used, where the interviewee agrees, for the benefits were
        enormous to all parties. Mr Birts felt very strongly about
        this and indeed suggested that the issue might have to go as
        far as Mr Green for his reinforcement of the policy to use.

                representatives strongly emphasised the need for a common
                policy to be adopted to all those interviewed, not
                discriminating between any individual.

                It was their view that the decision to submit to a videod
                interview was a matter for the individual to decide once the
                interview commenced.

         4.     We discussed the documentary being prepared by Yorkshire
                Television, which was to be shown in London on Wednesday, 17
                January at 11.30 pm. Mr Birts emphasised that anything that
                was prejudiced must be stopped, particularly as it may
                relate to Chief Superintendent Duckenfield. Mr Kennedy
                agreed that he would attend the showing and arrangements are
                in hand to notify him.

         5.     We had a general discussion on the role of the Police
                Complaints Authority and the Coroner and their needs
                emerging from this investigation. However, Mr Birts
                stressed, and we all agreed, that we must "keep our eye on
                the ball". We must not be distracted to lesser offences,
                disciplinary matters separate to the main issues or their
                considerations which extend the time for the finalisation of
                the criminal investigation. The prime offences were "the
                ball". This will require a re-consideration of the emphasis
                we now place on the assembling of the file. Lord Justice     ,,
                Taylor's early report had made it easier for us in \
                determining where the investigation should concentrate.

         6.     We also discussed criminal culpability and in particular
                gross negligence and recklessness. Mr Birt's view is that
                we should concentrate on the dictionary definition and keep
                it as simple as that. There were two cases we may want to
                consider later, Caldwell5-and Lawrence. fWe;ialsovJiad a ?

                 RE: THE HILLSBOROUGH STADIUM DISASTER



                   INSTRUCTIONS TO COUNSEL TO ADVISE


Counsel will receive herewith

(1)   Interim Reports of Lord Justice Taylor.

(2)   Copy Judgment   R -v- Dytham.

      Counsel will of course be aware of the publicity surrounding the
      publication of the report of Lord Justice Taylor. The report was
      considered by the Director who on 15 August wrote to Mr Peter Wright,
      Chief Constable of South Yorkshire stating that the matter should be the
      subject of a full criminal investigation.

      Counsel will also be aware that Lord Justice Taylor's inquiry was
      assisted by Mr Geoffrey Dear Chief Constable of West Midlands Police
      whose officers conducted initial enquiries and took statements from
      hundreds of witnesses many of whom gave evidence before the enquiry.

      Because of the close involvement of the West Midlands Police with the
      investigation Mr Wright appointed Mr Dear to conduct the criminal
      investigation and he is assisted by Assistant Chief Constable Mervyn
      Jones and a team of officers. Whilst the criminal investigation is, in
      part, an enquiry into officers of the South Yorkshire Police and this is
      how the enquiry has been projected by the media, it will in fact
      encompass the possibility of offences by persons and bodies in addition
      to South Yorkshire police officers, namely, South Yorkshire Police
      Authority, Sheffield Wednesday Football Club, Sheffield City Council, Dr
      Eastwood and football fans.

      Whilst the investigation will focus upon the possible offence of
      manslaughter, police officers may well have committed the Common Law
      offence of malfeasance or culpable non-feasance, this offence is not
      dealt with very fully in Archbold and Counsel may be assisted by the
      judgment in Regina -v- Dytham.

      Counsel will in due course be asked to advise as to possible criminal
      charges, but that is someway ahead, but now Counsel is asked, having
      regard to the unusual circumstances of this investigation, to advise the
      Police on an ongoing basis as to the scope and direction of their
      enquiry.

      An early conference has been arranged to discuss the case in general
      terms when the Police will explain the extent of their enquiries to date
      and the number and form of witness statements that have been obtained.

              Hillsborough: Interview of Su p t Murray

     Thank you for your letter of 19th June.

     I have tried to reach you a couple of times so as to
advise by telephone, but with no success, so I thought I would
let you have my views by letter.

      If Supt Murray elects not to be interviewed in
conjunction with the use of the 1988 video film, the
investigating officers have two options, namely:

          (1) they accept that position and interview him
          without showing him the 1988 video, but questioning
          him nonetheless on the 1988 semi-final, as his role
          in that has been understood by them; or

          (2) they do not interview him at all.

     Obviously (1) is to be preferred, but it is a matter for
the officers' discretion.

     I hope this deals with the difficulty adequately.


Yours sincerely,


Peter Birts

                                       IN T E R IM   REPORT OF INQUIRY

                                                IN TRODUCTION

   1. On 15 April 1989 a football match to decide a semi-final round o f the FA Cup com petition was to be
played between the Liverpool an d N ottingham Forest Q ubs. The neutral venue chosen was Hillsborough
Football Stadium, Sheffield W ednesday’s ground. Only six minutes into the game, play was stopped when it
was realised that spectators on the terraces behind the Liverpool goal had been severely crushed. In the result,
95 died and over 400 received hospital tre a tm e n t

  2. On 17 April 19891 was appointed by you tocarry out an Inquiry with the following terms ofreference;

      To inquire into the events at Sheffield Wednesday football ground on 15 April 1989 and to make
      recom mendations about the needs o f crowd control and safety at sports events.

   3. Two Assessors were appointed to assist me: M r Brian Johnson Q PM , C h ief Constable o f Lancashire,
and Professor Leonard M aunder OBE, BSc, PhD , ScD, FEng, FI M ech E, Professor o f Mechanical
Engineering at the University o f Newcastle upon Tyne. Their help has been invaluable and I am very grateful
for their expert advice and wise counsels. W hile the sole responsibility for this report is mine, I am comforted
in the knowledge that both Assessors agree with it.

  4- M r Robert Whalley was appointed Secretary to the Inquiry. H e and his assistants have worked
prodigiously and skilfully to give m e all the advice and support I could have wished. I also wish to acknowledge
the help 1 have received, as always, from my clerk, M r Ernest Pott.

  5. T he policing arrangem ents for 15 April were in the hands o f the South Y orkshire Constabulary. The
efficacy of those arrangements a n d their im plem entation was from an early stage called into question. It was
therefore decided that the investigation o f the disaster and the gathering o f evidence for this Inquiry should be
conducted by an independent police force. M r Geoffrey Dear Q PM , C hief C onstable o f West Midlands
Constabulary, undertook this task. H e was m ade responsible directly to me; he appointed Assistant Chief
Constable Mervyn Jones to take full-tim e charge o f the investigation. I am deeply indebted to both of them.

  6. O n 18 April I visited Hillsborough Stadium. 1 inspected the scene o f the d isaster on the terraces and all
relevant parts o f the stadium an d its approaches. My Assessors an d I have m ade furth er visits during the
Inquiry. I also visited Liverpool o n 21 an d 29 April.

    7. T he Lord Mayor an d the Sheffield City Council kindly offered to make the accom m odation and facilities
 o f Sheffield Town Hall available for the hearing o f oral evidence. T his offer was gratefully accepted and I would
 like to record my thanks for those facilities and for the co-operation afforded to the Inquiry by the authorities
 in Sheffield.

    8. On 28 April 1989,1 held a prelim inary hearing to announce the date when the oral evidence wouldbegin,
 to give some directions as to the procedure I intended to follow and to hear applications from those wishing to
 be represented at the hearing. I accorded representation to the following:
       (i)    Those bereaved or inj ured as a result o f the disaster.
       (ii)   The Football Supporters' Association.
       (iii) The Football A ssociation.
       (iv) Sheffield City Council.
       (v) Sheffield W ednesday Football Club together with the Football League, the Club’s casual staff and
            their insurers, the Sun Alliance.
       (vi) South Yorkshire Constabulary.
       (vii) South Yorkshire Fire and Civil Defence Authority.
Subsequently, during the hearing, 1 further accorded representation lo:
     (viii) Trent Regional Health Authority, for the South Yorkshire M etropolitan Ambulance Service
           (SYMAS).
and (ix)    D r W Eastwood, consultant engineer 10 Sheffield Wednesday Football Club.

  9l Since the circumstances o f ihe disaster raised urgent questions of safety, especially at football grounds,
youindicated at the outset that you would welcome any recom mendations, even of an interim nature, which I
might be able to give in advance of the new football season due to commence in m id-August 1989.1 therefore
announced at the prelim inary hearing on 28 April that I would conduct an oral hearing with all possible
expedition as the first phase o f lhe Inquiry lo discover the facts and causcs o f the disaster and enable me to
make any im m ediate interim recom m endations necessary in the short term.                   "*“■

   10. T h e West M idlands Police investigation began on 24 April. A “Freephone" num ber was advertised to
enable m em bers o f the public, especially those who had attended the m atch, to offer their evidence to the
Inquiry. Initially this num ber was available for three days on 28 different lines. T he response from the public
was such th at the lines were continued for a further three days by the end o f which 2,666 calls had been
received. There were also many written offers o f help. Some 440 West M idlands officers were deployed on ihe
Inquiry. To service this operation, special police offices were established in Birm ingham , Liverpool and
Sheffield and com puter technology was used to the full. In all some 3776 statem ents were taken. There were
also some 1550 letters to Ministers, to the Inquiry and to me personally all o f which 1 read. The police,
Sheffield W ednesday Football O u b and the BBC had video cameras filming at the ground on 15 April. In
aggregate, they recorded some 71 hours o f film covering the period before, during and after the disaster. Thus
the m aterial gathered and potentially available for presentation at the oral hearing was enormous. From this
mass it was essential to select only sufficient good and reliable evidence necessary to establish the facts and
causes o f th e disaster.

   11. W here it seem ed likely that any allegation o r criticism might be made o f the conduct o f any person or
party, the Treasury Solicitor, after consultation with Counsel for the Inquiry, wrote to the party concerned
setting o u t the likely grounds for complaint. This followed the practice established by the Royal Commission
o n Tribunals o fln q u iry (the Salmon Commission).

  12. T he hearing began on 15 May. It continued, sitting long hours, for 31 days concluding on 29 June. In
that period, 174 witnesses gave oral evidence. Counsel’s submissions were delivered in writing on 7 July and
on 14 Ju ly ! heard th eir b rie f oral submissions supplem enting the written argum ent.

  13. W itnesses were not sworn. Since this is a departm ental inquiry, there was no power to adm inister the
oath b u t there was no instance o f any witness giving evidence which I considered m ight have been different
had he or she been sworn.

   14. T he witnesses called were only a small fraction o f those from whom statem ents were or could have been
taken. Nevertheless, I am satisfied that they were sufficient in num ber and reliability to enable m e to reach the
necessary conclusions. To have called m ore would have prevented me from presenting an interim report in the
required tim e an d would not h a v e added significantly to the relevant evidence. I have, however, been able to
take into account many w ritten statements in addition to oral testimony.

    15. A part from the evidence called by Counsel for the Inquiry which was drawn from statements taken by
 the West M idlands Police an d others volunteered by indi viduais, each o f the represented parties was given full
 opportunity to p u t forward any witnesses they considered should be called. A final subm ission was m ade by
 Counsel for the South Yorkshire Police th a t since the investigation by West M idlands Police is still continuing,
 all the evidence has not been assembled and it would be unsafe for me to make findings of fact. I should
 therefore m ake clear th at th e investigation continues principally to furnish as much detail as possible to HM
 Coroner for the City o f Sheffield as to the cause o f death, the precise position at death .an d the care and
 movement o f each o f the 95 victims individually. I am assured by C hief C onstable.D ear and Assistant Chief
 Constable M ervyn Jones that it is most unlikely any further evidence gathered will significantly alter o r add to
 the history o f events which emerged at the hearing.

   16. I should like to thank all those who made it possible for the oral hearing to take place so soon after the
 event and for evidence to be efficiently presented and tested so as to give a full and fair account o f what
 happened in all its aspects without irrelevancy or duplication. 1 pay tribute particularly to the West M idlands
 Police for th eir speed and dedication in gathering the evidence and to ail those responsible for processing it.

Fixing The Venue
  ■>\ On ->0 M arch 1989. the Football Association (ihe FA) rcqucsied that their Cup semi-final between
Liverpool and N ottingham Forest be held on 15 April at Hillsborough Football Stadium. The c o r r e s p o n d s
semi-final between the sam e tw o teams had been held there in April 1VS8. The arra^jem en'.s ha              een
successful in the view b oth o f the police and o f the host club. Sheffield W ednesday (the Club) w ere therefore
willing to accom m odate the 1989 match. South Yorkshire C onstabulary were prepared to police it but only if
the ticketing arrangem ents were the same as those for ! 988. O therw ise, the FA would have to look elsewhere.
Those arrangem ents did not please Liverpool or its supporters either in 19S8 o r 1989. They thought the ticket
allocation was u n fair for reasons to be explained later. Reluctantly, however, the pol.ee requ.rem ent was
accepted and the m atch was fixed for 15 April at Hillsborough.

The Ground
  V T he H illsborough Stadium is some 24 miles to the north-w est o f central Sheffield in the district of
Owicnon. The g round was opened in 1899 on what was then a greenfield site by the river Don. The pitch lies
roughly cast to west. A plan of the ground and its im m ediate environs is ai A ppendix 1.

    23 T he west end, with which this Inquiry is principally concerned, is known as the Leppings Lane end. T he ‘
 east end abuts on Pen is tone Road, the A 61. To the south is the river Don and to the north a residential street,
 V e r e Road, w hich runs between Leppings Lane and Penistone Road N orth.


    24 Alongside the river is a private roadway giving access to the south stand, to the Directors’ and players’
 entrances, and to the adm inistrative block under the stand. T he roadway gives both vehicular and Pedestrian
 access between P enistone Road and Leppings Lane, but there are gates which can s h u t o f f a l each end. There
 is some car parking along this roadway principally for D irectors, players and employees o f the Club T h e outh
 stand dates from 1914 an d is th e o ld e s ta tth e g ro u n d .lt is all seating with places for 8,800. 5,500 o f those arc
 roofed over a n d 3 ,3 0 0 a r e u ncovered.

    25. The north sta n d is also all seating and accom m odates about 9,700. Behind it is a gymnasium or sports
  hail. T here are also a first aid room and police room close by.

    •>6 T h e e a s t end is a l l terracing and is known as the Spion Kop. It was enlarged and roofed over in 1986 and
  now accom m odates som e 21,000 standing spectators. T here are crush barriers i n the Kop running parallel to
  the goal line but no dividing fences to prevent free movement from side to side.

     2"> At the west o r Leppings Lane end o f the ground there is terracing d o s e to the pitch. Behind it is f e w e s t
  stand which provides covered seating and was built in 1965 for World C up m atches some of which were held
  at Hillsborough in 1966. T h e covered stand accom m odates 4,456 seated spectators T he terracing in front o f it
  extends higher in th e corners between the stands and iis total capacity was stated to be 10,100. At both the Kop
  end and the west end access to the pitch is barred by perim eter fencing. T h e fencing is about eight te .t high
  mounted upon the low wall at the foot o f the terracing. At the lop of the fencing the wire returns back at a sharp
   angle for some 1 5 inches to make it difficult for anyone to clim b over tow ards the pitch. There are gates a
   intervals along the perim eter fencing to afford access between terrace and pitch. These gates are less ™an3
   metre wide and were designed to be opened only from the pitch side for police purposes or in an emergency.
   They arc m arked an d num bered on the plan A ppendix 1.

       18.      Unlike the Kop end. the west terracing has not only crush barriers parallel with the goal line
   fences at right angles lo ii, dividing the area into pens. T his division was begun after an FA Cup semi-final ii
    1981 when a u s h in g occurred due to overcrowding a n d gates had to be opened. H proceeded in stages the: fina
   arrangement beingshow n on the plan Appendix l.T h e first section o fth e west terrae.ng moving south to nort!
   contains gates 1 a n d 2 and is known as pens 1 and 2 although m fact con stitu tin g only one pen. N o t a p e n
   with one gate; next pen 4 with one gate; pen 5. whtch .s extremely narrow, was intended as a s t e n k a r « t
   divide oen 4 from pen 6. This was to isolate home and away fans on occasions when both might b
    a c c o m m o d a t e d on the west terracing in separate pens. Finally there is pen 7 at the north-west c o m e r Pens 5
    and 7 each have a perim eter gate. At the back of the pens, u nder the front o f the west stand, there is a gate >
each radial fence W hen those gates arc open, the back row of the tcrracing is intended to p erm it access from
pen to pen along the whale west side. in                                  " ru th S r^ e S ^ Ie s T a s ^ S to ra a

  19 Bccausc o f the housing in Vere Road there is no access from the north s,de o f the grounc Along

two teams a , appears later. Two o f them . 77 and 78. were however usee for access to .he KoJ>.

   30. At the south side o f the ground there were 24 turnstiles (num bered 19 to 42 on the plan). Those
 numbered 37 to 42 led to the Kop and the rest to the south stand.

   31. In summary, the south an d east sides of the ground accommodated some 29.800 whose access on the
 day was through 60 turnstiles.

    32. The o th er two sides o f the ground, north and west, with a capacity o f 24.256 were fed solely from the
  Leppings Lane entrance w here there were only 23 turnstiles.

      34. Liverpool supporters travelling by normal rail service would arrive
   like their N ottingham cou nterp arts. T he police aimed to segregate the rival fans and^put th e m .
   coaches Liverpool fans could alternatively travel by special train to Wadsley Bridge, a British R a l stauon
   catering solely for football supporters and situated to the north of the ground. A police escort was availbi e

    Sheffield either via the M 62 an d down the MI from the north or across the Pennmcs trom the n0^ ^ st. A1

       36. The effect o fth e decision was that for this all-ticket Cup Tie, Liverpool were

                                  15th APRIL: T H E BUILD-UP TO 2.3Qpra

Early Arrivals
  54.    15 April 1989 was a warm sunny spring Saturday. The match s,vas a scll-oui. so 54,000 ’.ickct hoiders
were expected. Others would come without tickets hoping to acquire them or even to gain^access otherwise.
The following account conceniraics, as did the cvidencc. on the western approaches an d the Liverpool
supporters since the disaster occurred at their end. They began to arrive in the H illsborough area quite early in
small numbers. Some brought cans o f beer with them and were seen drinking as they walked; others took
advantage o fth e weather and sat about on walls and open spaces. When the public houses opened?«nany
resorted there, drinking inside or spilling out into the sunshine. Leppings Lane and its environs comprise a
mixed shopping and residential area. Local residents s a w g r o u p s o f Liverpool supporters keen to find a public
house or off-licence. Many were asking for tickets or “spares". There were a few touts selling them at inflated
prices. From an early stage, som e o f the fans were using private gardens and yards to urinate. As the morning
 wore on. numbers increased. Requests for tickets and trespass to urinate also increased. Stiil the prevailing
 mood was one of carnival, good hum our and expectation.

Public Houses
  55. There were some 74 shops with off-licences in and around Sheffield. In general, they opened at 8 am,
Liverpool supporters did visit them but the evidence did not suggest a great am ount o f alcoholic drink was
bought there.

   56. Opening tim e at public houses was in general 11 am- Some remained closed all day. O f the others, some
 72, mostly in the city, were frequented by local patrons only. Some 23 public houses, however, served over a
 hundred Liverpool supporters each. A nother 51 served more than 20 each. Little trouble was reported, but
 many supporters drank enough to affect their mood. At first excitement: later frustration.

 The Gathering Crowd              _
   57. Towards the end o f the morning, fans gathered on and around the bridge n ear the Leppings Lane
 entrance. They seemed reluctant to enter the ground early. All turnstiles were open at 12 noon and one or two
 as early as 11.30 am. Some 53 police had been deployed to operate outside the turnstiles and in the Leppings
 Lane area. They enquired at random w hether fans had tickets. Those who had not were advised to go away;
 nevertheless, many returned m ore than once. Those who had tickets were guided in th e right direction. The
 police tried to persuade them to enter the ground early. Officers, male and female, h a d been posted outside
 each turnstile w ith the duty o f searching entrants for weapons, drink or drugs. O nce through the turnstile, an
  enirant was liable to be searched again by o n e o fa serial of officers positioned just inside.

     58. At about 12 noon C h ief Inspector Creaser asked Superintendent Murray w hether the pens on the west
  terrace were to be filled one by one successively, but was told that they should all be available from the start and
  the fans should find their own level.

    59. By 2 pm it was apparent to those inside the ground and those m onitoring events in th e police and Q u b
  control rooms that the num ber o f N ottingham fans in their places greatly outnum bered those from Liverpool.
  The Kop and the south stand were filling up steadily, but the north and west stands were h alf empty. It was
  noted about that tim e th a t the turnstile figures showed only 12,000 had entered as against 20,000 at the same
  time the previous year. O n the west terraces, although pens 3 and 4 were filline, the wing pens 1 ,2 ,6 and 7 were
  nearly empty. At 2.15 pm a Tannoy message asked fans in pens 3 and 4 to move forward a n d m ake room for
  others.

     60. There had been three special trains from Liverpool in 1988. T his time, there was only one. It arrived
   early, just before 2 pm , at Wadsley Bridge station. The 350 passengers were met by b o th m ounted and foot
   police officers who escorted them in a crocodile down Leppings Lane. They were orderly an d passed through
   the turnstiles into the ground by about 2.20 pm w ithout incident.

     6 L By this tim e the police Traffic Division reported that the Liverpool routes were clear, so the m ajority o f
   Liverpool fans were in the Sheffield area. The numbers converging on the Leppings Lane entrance were
   increasing rapidly. Between the perim eter gates and the turnstiles the crowd became c o n g e s ts . There was no
   longer a separate queue at each turnstile but a single phalanx filling the whole approach area. T he foot officers
   outside the turnstiles were no longer able to search everyone and had difficulty in searching even selectively.
    M ounted officers in and outside ihe turnstile area were having difficulty m anoeuvring in such a dense crowd. J
    T he police were beset by fans bemused by the lickct and turnstile labelling asking for directions. Many had]
    been drinking b u t up to an d just after 2.30 pm the mood rem ained good.                                         j
                                                                                                                       i
       62. Superintendent Marshall was on foot amongst ihe crowd. H e becam e anxious about the numbers!
    coming down Leppings Lane and spilling out onto the roadway where buses and cars were moving. At 2.17-;
    pm he radioed to control to have m otor traffic in Lcppings Lane slopped. jThis was eventually done at about:
    2.30 pm. U p to this lim e, despite the large mass outside the turnstiles and ihe num bers s;ill approaching, there!
    was still no panic in ihe crowd; no perception o f crisis by the police. In ihe control room M r Murray, who could-
    see Leppings Lane on the video, advised Mr Duckenfield that they would get everyone in by 3 pm. M r'
    Duckenfield reaffirm ed to him the policy about a delayed kick-off. It would be orderejxinly if there was some,
    m ajor external factor such as fog on the Pennines or delay on the m otorw ay; not if spectators merely turned up'
    late even in large num bers.

arrivals found them selves p ushed forw ard and the pressure becam e intense. At 2.54 prrt, s'ncrv** after this
influx began, the team s cam e on to the pitch. As usual, this was greeted by a surge forw ard . M any were now
acutely uncom fortable an d som e were in distress. The mass seethed ab ou t b u t v o lu n ta ry m ovem ent bv anv
individual was difficult; h an d s down could not be raised and some fans found it h ard to b re a th e . Sail the flow
continued through the tu n n el causing fu rth er surges forward. There w ere shouts for h elp a n d for the safes tc be
opened to the pitch. Police officers on the perim eter track did not im m ediately react. In th e deafening noise
from chanting and sho u tin g they d id not at first recognise the pro’o lerti. R ealisation c am e a t d iffers::: m om ents

   72. G ate 3 sprang o pen u n d e r the intense pressure from w ithin. An officer quick ly ciosec : l Shortly
afterw ards, it sprang again; officers tried to shut it. Those seeking to escape were urged an d p u sh ed back. G ate

to the wing pens w here there was still am ple room . Meanwhile, gate 4 was closed again a n d th e n re o p e n e d . At
gate 3, a Constable, now alive to th e crisis, followed strictly his w ritten orders and ra d io e d for cerm ission to
open that gate. Receiving no reply, he took it upon him self to open it.

  73. Ju st before 3 pm , the m atch kicked off. At the same tim e, gate C, which h ad b een closed at 2.57 pm .
was reopened and a steady trickle co n tin u ed to enter through the tunnel.

   74. To escape th e crush, fans began clim bing the radial fences out o f pens 3 an d 4 in to p en s 2 a a c 5. O thers
tried to get over th e fro n t p e rim e te r fence b u t were at first turned back by police w ho feared a pitch invasion.
N e a r the front, fans, m ostly youngsters, were w eakened to the point o f collapse an d in so m e instances death b u t
they were held u p rig h t by pressure all round. F u rth er back, m ost were so preoccupied w ith th e p a in o f being
pressed against b arriers an d w ith b reath ing problem s that they saw n o th in g o f th e gam e. B ut a t the rear there
were m any who, altho u g h c ram p ed , were w atching the football unaware o f the distress a t th e front.

   75. At 3.04 p m , Beardsley for L iverpool struck the crossbar at the Kop end. T h e re w as a r e a r from the
 Liverpool fans a n d at th e sam e tim e a powerful surge forwards in pen 3. T h e several surges w h ich occurred after
 the influx from gate C c a rrie d th e pressure down the pens towards the p itch . T h e force b ecam e such as to tw ist

 the influx from gate C so greatly increased the pressure in the pen. W h en the b a rrie r b ro k e th o se w hom it h ad

 were pressed h ard up against th e low wall a n d the wire mesh o f the fence above it.

   76. In pen 4 no b a rrie r broke. N evertheless those at the front were crushed against w all a n d fence. F urther
 back, two b arriers w ere bow ed a n d som e individuals succumbed to th e pressure aro u n d th e m .

    77. Surges o n terraces are c o m m o n . Usually, they go forward, th e n recede. H e re , w ith the weight o f
 num bers, there w as no receding. T h e pressure stayed and for those crushed breathless by it, stan d in g o r prone,
 life was ebbing away. I f no relief cam e in four m inutes there would be irreversible b ra in              if longer,

Fine W eather and D rinking
   194 T he likeliest ex p lan atio n s for the sparse Liverpool a tte n d a n c e in the ground before 2.30 pm were lour-
fold - the warm w eather, drinking, disinclination to enter the g ro u n c sa n y an d prolong the standing, a n c a
tendency o f L iverpool su p p o rters to cut it fine.

    >95 The police em phasised th a t at the 19SS semi-final there was no co m p arable b u ild -u p o f “late" arrivals.
 Thev claim, therefore, th a t thev h ad no reason to foresee it in 1989. H owever, m 1988, although the w eatner
 was'fin* it was I l ‘ F cooler th a n in 1989. 15 A p r i l was ihe s o n o f fine s p n n j day w hich tem p ted fans to sit or
 stand about in th e su n w ith a d rin k . If-vou had a ticket it would seem m ore p leasan t a n d sensible to relax m u .ai

 Was D runkenness a M a jo r F actor in the Crisis at the T urnstiles?
     196 O f those w ho arrived at 2.30 pm o r after, very m any h a d been d rin k in g at public houses o r had
 brought d rin k fro m h o m e o r an off-licence. I am satisfied on th e evidence, however, th a t the great m a jc n ty
  were not d ra n k n o r even the worse for drink. The police w itnesses varied on this. Som e described a hign
  o ro p o m o n as d ru n k , as “ lager-louts" or even as “anim als” . O th e rs described a generally norm al crowd w ith an
  u n c o o p e ra tiv e m in o ritv who h a d dru n k too m uch. In my view so m e otticers, seeking to rationalise th eir loss
  o f controL overestim ated th e d ru n k e n elem ent in the crowd. T h e re certain ly w as such an elem ent. T h ere were
  youngsters in fluenced bv d rin k a n d bravado pushing im p atien tly a t the rear o f th e crow d thereoy exaceroatm g
  the crush But th e m o re c o nv in cing police witnesses, including especially D etectiv e S up erin ten d en t McKay
   and C hief In sp ecto r C reaser as well as a num ber o f responsible civilian w itnesses, were in my view n g n t m
   describing this e le m e n t as a m inority. T hose witnesses a ttrib u te d th e crash to th e sh eer num bers o f fans ail

    turnstile area a n d its very d e n sity ham p ered its passage through th e tu rn stiles.

    4.1    This is fully covered in the Briefing N ote o f the 10 February 1998

    5.     K EY C O N SID ERA TIO N S

    5.1    The terms o f reference for the scrutiny by Lord Justice Stuart-Smith involve his
           consideration o f whether any new evidence exists, relating to the Hillsborough
           disaster, that was not available to Lord Taylor, the Director, thgAttorney General
           and South Yorkshire Police. H e was then to draw the attention o f the Director to such
           relevant evidence not previously considered. It was not envisaged that the scrutiny
           would exam ine the CPS decisions or the decision making process.

    5 .2   The Director’s letter o f the 30 July 1997 to the Judge stated that the CPS would co­
           operate fully with the scrutiny. A schedule o f material considered by the CPS in
           com ing to the decisions not to prosecute anyone in criminal proceedings (in 1990 and
            1997) would be sent by the 4 August. The Judge had previously asked for access to
           the material held by the CPS. The Director said the Judge or members o f his staff
            were w elcom e to inspect the substantial quantities o f material held at Central
            Casework York. She also welcomed the opportunity to discuss the CPS decision
            making process and identify the precise material inspected.

    5.3    CCP Central Casework sent a letter on the 1 August 1997 to the Judge enclosing the
            two schedules o f evidence considered in 1990 and 1997.
I




    -   "   -
5 .4   On the 11 August 1997 a request was received from the Judge for a copy o f counsels’
       joint opinion. In accordance withe the Director’s letter o f the 30 July this was
       provided by hand delivery on the 14 August.

5 .5   On 26 September 1997 a further request was received for a copy o f the 1997 review
       report. A Briefing N ote was sent to D.Sharpling on the 1 October for a decision to
       be made as to disclosure to him o f that report. I advised that it would be in our
       interest to co-operate with the Inquiry and that I had no objection to disclosure if PII
       was waived.

5 .6   On 14 October the CCP Central Casework sent written confirmation that my report
       should be disclosed. Disclosure took place by post on 15 October 1997; I confirmed
       that the Crown waived PII in the report.

5 .7   My Briefing Note o f the 10 February 1998 shows my concern about placing the two
       advices into the public domain. The arguments against disclosure are as follows:

       5.7.1     The two documents are o f a class that prior to the Attorney General’s
                 announcement to Parliament on the 18 December 1996 would generally have
                 been immune from disclosure. Counsels opinions are seen as being legally
                 privileged and CPS internal documents have until now been protected on
                 ‘candour’ grounds, ie the review function would be less effective if reasons
                 for decisions and minutes between prosecutors and caseworkers and their line
                 managers were in the public domain. The leading authority for this class o f
                 PII is Evans v C hief C onstable o f Surrey [1988] 1 Q B 588.

       5.7.2     The principle now is that there should be maximum disclosure consistent with
                 protecting essential public interests. The new ‘serious harm’ or ‘real damage’
                 test means that w e do not claim PII to protect internal advices merely by
                 pointing to the general nature o f the document. The principle applies to all
                 government documents which may be relevant to criminal or civil
                 proceedings.

       5.7.3     W hile PII has been waived for the purposes o f the Judge looking at the
                 material I would submit that it has not been waived for any other reason. It
                 is not yet in the public domain.

       5 .7 .4   The key question involves the relevance or materiality o f the two advices. The
                 scrutiny was to draw the Director’s attention to new evidence not previously
                 considered by her. The Home Secretary has said to the Judge that he intends
                 to publish the evidence which was considered during the scrutiny. The only
                 purpose for the Judge to look at the two advices was to ascertain exactly what
                 material the CPS had considered in 1990 and 1997. In that way he could say
                 what ‘new ’ evidence should be brought to the Director’s attention. The
                 advices were not ‘evidence;for the purposes o f the scrutiny, except for the
                 detail o f the schedules o f material that w e reviewed. For that reason I consider
                 that there is no duty o f disclosure based on a statement o f intention made by
                 the Home Secretary. If the Minister wished nevertheless to put these advices
                 into the public domain it would be a disclosure additional to what w e have
                been led to expect.

       5.7.5    There is an argument here that if w e were to disclose material without there
                being a corresponding duty to disclose there would need to be a substantial
                and clearly justified public interest in the administration o f justice involved.
                Without this, w e w ill in future be laying ourselves open to arguments that if
                w e disclose confidential internal advices in these circumstances w e should do
                so generally in criminal proceedings. It may not be an ‘opening o f the
                floodgates’ but it could cause problems o f national concern.

       5.7.6    Even if there were a duty to disclose the documents by putting them into the
                public domain PII arguments must still apply. The balancing exercise must be
                carried out to compare the competing public interests for and against
                disclosure. I submit that the public interest favours disclosure o f the schedules
                detailing the evidence considered by us in 1990 and 1997 but not the rationale
                o f the underlying decisions not to prosecute. The appendix to my letter o f the
                1 August 1997 to the Judge contains these schedules.

       5.7 .7   Lord Justice Stuart-Smith made no mention o f my 1997 advice in the scrutiny
                report. H e did comment favourably on the 1990 joint opinion o f counsel.
                There could be some force to an argument that this opinion should therefore
                be fully disclosed. However I would resist that by submitting that this mention
                is not enough to bring the advice within the definition o f ‘evidence’ that
                should be disclosed. The instant case is not one that would outweigh the
                strong public interest in not divulging details o f the decision making process.

6.     R ECO M M EN D A TIO N S

6.1    It is not in the overall interests o f justice that present policy on the disclosure o f
       confidential internal documents should be circumvented in the present case.
       Disclosure o f the scrutiny report and the associated ‘evidence’ considered by the
       Judge is sufficient to uphold the Home Secretary’s stated intention for putting material
       into the public domain.

6 .2   If pressed, w e are on stronger ground for the withholding o f the 1997 advice than that
       o f the 1990 counsels’ opinion.

7.     C O N C LU SIO N

7.1    That the Director should consider advising the Attorney General o f her view s along
       the lines expressed in this Briefing Note.

7 .2   I understand that the Legal Secretariat to the Law Officers concurs with this general
       viewpoint.

               Background Note: Hillsborough Disaster


1.      On the 15th April 1989 at the Hillsborough stadium,
        Sheffield 95 people died and over 400 were injured due to
        gross overcrowding and crushing in the two pens behind
        the goal at the Leppings Lane end of the ground.

2.      A public enquiry headed by Lord Justice Taylor produced
        an interim report in August 1989. The West Midlands
        Police assisted in the preparation of the report and
        later conducted a criminal investigation which was
        requested by the D.P.P.  The criminal investigation was
        extensive producing bulky documentation and a full
        transcript of the evidence given at the enquiry. The
        police investigation was meticulous.

3.      A copy of Lord Justice Taylor's Interim Report and a copy
        of Counsel's opinion by Gareth Williams Q.C. and Peter
        Birts Q.C. are attached.  It would be useful to refer to
        the plans at Appendix 1 and Appendix 4 of the report.


Facts

4.      There is little, if any, dispute as to what actually
        happened,Chief Superintendent Duckenfield was the police
        officer responsible for policing the match.

5.      At 2.52 pm (8 minutes before kick-off) Duckenfield
        ordered one of the exit gates, Gate C, at the Leppings
        Lane end to be opened. This was to relieve massive
        overcrowding and crushing at the turnstiles caused by a
        build up of supporters arriving after, 2-30 pm.  In the
        five minutes after the gate was opened 2000 supporters
        entered the ground and went into a tunnel under the west
        stand which gave access only to the central pens 3 and 4.
        Those pens were already full.  There was no controlled
        way in which supporters were allowed in to the pens. The
        additional influx caused intense pressure and resulted in
        the collapse of a crush barrier 124A near the front of
        pen 3. Many died from suffocation and crushing and some
        were trampled on. Perimeter gates were not opened by the
        police partly because of orders not to do so without
        permission and partly because officers did not appreciate
        the severity of what was occurring initially.   Later when
        the emergency was appreciated the small size and number
        of the gates made evacuation extremely difficult.

6.      The build up of fans outside the ground was due to the
        geography of the turnstiles, their marking and numbers
        and to a loss of police control of supporters outside
        becoming keen to get inside before the kick-off.
f




    7.    The three major causal factors wer e:-

          i.   the layout of the ground
          ii. the opening of the exit gate (gate C)
          iii. the build up outside the ground

    Layout of the Ground

    8.    The club were advised by a structural engineer, Dr
          Eastwood.  The Safety of Sports Grounds Act 1975 required
          expert advice to obtain a safety certificate under the
          Act from the local council.  Dr Eastwood advised
          additional crush barriers, these were installed in 1979.
          A certificate was granted.

    9.    The safety certificate did not specify maximum numbers
          for the pens.  This, with turnstile monitoring of
          numbers, would have limited entrance to the pens.      ,

    10.   It was the policy of the police at semi-finals to allow
          movement of supporters between pens before the kick-off
          after which the radial gates would be closed and locked.
          Hence without a control on the numbers entering the
          tunnel access pens 3 and 4 were liable to become grossly
          overcrowded.  The police had accepted responsibility for
          monitoring the pens and their policy of "letting the fans
          find their own level" was severely criticized by Taylor.

    11.   The exit gate C, opened following Duckenfield's
          instruction, is opposite the tunnel. No steps were taken
          to cordon off the tunnel or divert the fans around the
          sides of the West stand. The supporters had nowhere to
          go but the already crowded pens 3 and 4.

    12.   At 3.04 pm a surge forward in pen 3 caused the crush
          barrier 124A to break. This appears to have been a major
          factor in the deaths since there were far fewer deaths in
          pen 4 where no barrier collapsed.  Barrier number 144 had
          been removed in 1986, its absence meant there was no
          retarding structure as fans emerged from the tunnel into
          pen 3. There was unbroken diagonal pressure from the
          mouth of the tunnel down to barrier 124A.  the collapse
          of barrier 124A was a major factor in the cause of the
          deaths.  Barrier 124A was slightly corroded but it had
          been tested in July 1988 and had passed loading tests
          specified in the Government's Green Guide.  Taylor found
          that corrosion played a part in the collapse but the
          effective cause was the excessive unanticipated pressure
          exerted at the time of the forward surge.

    13.   The crushing in pens 3 and 4 was not recognised by police
          either in the control box or on the perimeter of the
          pitch.  Even supporters nearby, broadcasters and stewards
          were not immediately aware.

    14.   Even after the crush, and until 3.06 pm, the main police
          concern was to prevent a pitch invasion.
The build up outside the Ground

15.   The opening of gate C which precipitated the disaster was
      made necessary by the massive build up of supporters at
      the Leppings Lane turnstiles between 2.30 and 2.50 pm.
      As kick-off time approached the crushing increased. The
      police lost control of the crowd.  The crush became
      unmanageable, many feared for their lives.  The kick-off
      was not postponed. This course was only to be taken if
      there was a major cause of delay eg. a motorway accident
      or fog. Taylor concluded that the kick-off should have
      been postponed.

16.   There was considerable evidence that people would be
      killed if gate C was not opened and that Duckenfield had
      no alternative but to do so. That being so neither
      Duckenfield nor other officers took any steps to deal
      with the consequences of opening the gate.  The tunnel
      was not closed off even though such action had been taken
      by the police in 1988. Duckenfield did order the influx
      at gate A, which had been opened earlier, to be
      monitored. His omission to do so at gate C was said by
      Taylor to be "a blunder of the first magnitude". This
      was the immediate cause of the crushing in pens 3 and 4.
      It was not the sole cause.

17.   The layout of the turnstiles, inadequate space for the
      formation of orderly queues and the limited extent of the
      waiting area combined with poor designation and marking
      of turnstiles contributed to slow turnstile operation.

18.   There were only 7 turnstiles to admit 10,100 fans at the
      other end of the ground there were 60 turnstiles to admit
      29,800.  Taylor concluded that the police and club should
      have foreseen potential queuing and waiting to admit
      fans.

19.   Many supporters arrived after 2.30 pm. Tickets advised
      arriving 15 minutes before kick-off. Some arrived
      without tickets. The evidence shows many had been
      drinking.   Taylor concluded the majority had not been
      affected by drink.   Unruliness contributed to the pushing
      effect.   This contributed to the loss of control by the
      police.

20.   The main factor in the police loss of control was
      ineffective strategy planning for the large number of
      arrivals. Taylor concluded that by controlling the fans
      and postponing the kick-off gate C could have remained
      closed.

Responsibilities

21.   The layout of the ground was the responsibility of the
      Club, Eastwood, the Council and the police. No one
      foresaw that up to 2000 fans would ever be allowed to
      enter pens 3 and 4 when they were already overcrowded.
      No one anticipated gate 3 being opened or the crushing
      outside the ground.  The police must take the main
      responsibility for letting the fans "find their own
      level", however, the Club must share responsibility for
      the way in which supporters were allowed to fill the pens
      at semi-finals.

22.   The opening of gate C was Duckenfield's responsibility.
      In the circumstances his decision was correct. His
      failure was to give no order to deal with the sudden
      influx of fans. Had the tunnel been cordoned off the
      disaster would almost certainly have been averted.

23.   The layout of the turnstiles, their numbers and marking
       are primarily matters for the police and the Club, but
       the Council have a partial responsibility to ensure safe
       access to the ground.

Criminal Offences

24.   The two offences would be Manslaughter and Culpable
      Misfeasance.  These potential offences were considered
      against all parties, ie. the club, the Council, the
      police and the structural engineers (Mr Eastwood).

The Club

25.   The Club's responsibility for the layout and alterations
       inside the ground and for the layout of the turnstiles is
      where any potential liability exists.   It is clear that
       these were not the sole, or even the major causes and
       that any actions and omissions by the club only partly
       contributed to the crushing and deaths. The Club not
       only relied on its own consultant engineer Dr Eastwood
       but it responded to the suggestions and advice of the
       police in important matters.

26.   There is insufficient evidence to establish the actus
      reus of manslaughter against the Club.  Additionally the
      evidence does not show either the recklessness or gross
      negligence required for the manslaughter offence.
Eastwood and Partners

27.   Eastwood's advice formed only part of the events that
      lead tot he structural condition at the ground.  It could
      not be said that his advice caused the deaths.  In fact
      some of his advice, not acted on for financial reasons,
      may have lead to maximum limits being set for pens 3 and
      4.

28.   Again there is insufficient for the actus reus of
      manslaughter nor can the required recklessness or
      negligence be established against Eastwood or his firm.

The Council

29.   The Council is responsible for the safety certificate and
      compliance with the Green Guide. There were minor errors
      on the council's part but these only contributed in part
      to the ground conditions.   These are too remote to
      amount to the actus reus of manslaughter. Again there is
      no evidence of recklessness or gross negligence.

The Police

30.   It is agreed that the main responsibility for the
      disaster must rest with the police.   They have partial
      responsibility for the ground layout.   They were
      responsible for the "find their own level" policy with
      the supporters and also for supervising the Leppings Lane
      turnstiles.  The difficulties of large scale admission to
      the ground should have been foreseen.   However, the
      police failures occurred as part of a complex sequence of
      events, often outside the control of the police. The
      difficulties at Leppings Lane were partly geographical
      and resulted largely in the arrival of vast numbers of
      supporters after 2.30 pm. Those matters were beyond
      police control. Unruly behaviour by a minority created
      problems.

31.   Responsibility for the failure to postpone the kick-off
      and to cordon off the access tunnel is confined to
      Duckenfield. As an organisation the police cannot be
      said to have caused the deaths by their strategy and
      operational shortcomings.  Whilst there were errors of
      judgement and practice there is no evidence that the
      police acted recklessly or in a grossly negligent manner
      as an organisation.

Chief Superintendent Duckenfield

32.   The failure to cordon off the access tunnel and not to
      postpone the kick-off were bad errors of judgement. They
      were his ultimate responsibility.  He failed to notice
      the overcrowding in pens 3 and 4. He was recently
      promoted and had little experience for this semi-final
      match.  His slowness to respond to what was happening was
      a result of is lack of experience.
33.   His failures significantly contributed to the crowd
      pressure which caused the crushing and collapse of
      barrier 124A. Had Duckenfield the requisite intention to
      support a charge of manslaughter? Clearly there was no
      unlawful or dangerous act on his part.  In failing to
      postpone the kick-off or order closure of the tunnel
      after opening gate C did he do an act which created an
      obvious and serious risk of causing personal injury
      either not giving thought to the possibility of such risk
      or having recognised that there was some risk involved
      nevertheless gone ahead and taken it?

34.   There are difficulties in proving that he intended to do
      an act which created an obvious and serious risk of
      causing personal injury.  The Director and Counsel
      concluded that it was not an obvious risk at the time.
      It is easy with hindsight to judge, but there must be a
      grave doubt as to whether the omissions created a risk
      which was obvious to anyone on the ground at the time.

35.   The Director concluded that there was insufficient
      evidence under the recklessness head of manslaughter
      against Duckenfield. Nor was there evidence that he was
      grossly negligent in his failures to act.

36.   Counsel and the Director concluded that there was no
      evidence that Duckenfield was wilfully neglectful of his
      duty or was culpable so have to committed the offence of
      Culpable Malfeasance by a public official.

Conclusions

37.   The Director's decision not to issue proceedings was
      reached solely on the basis of an insufficiency of
      evidence to prove any criminal offence against any
      individual or body corporate ie. the City Council, the
      Police, the Engineers.   The decision was reached in
      accordance with the Director's code for Crown
      Prosecutors.  The Public Interest factor was not one
      which came into play as the evidential sufficiency
      criterium had not been established in respect of any
      potential defendant.   Full consideration was given to the
      possibility of the proseuction of each of the bodies
      involved despite their corporate status.

38.   The disaster was caused not by one single error or
      failure but by the combined effect of a series of
      mistakes, misjudgments and poor decisions, made by groups
      of people both over a period of time and by individuals
      on the day of the disaster.

Coroner's Inquests

39.   The Inquests began after the disaster and were adjourned
      when the Director requested a criminal investigation.
      The Coroner is obliged to adjourn an inquest when the
      Director makes such a request under the Coroner's Rules.
Once the Coroner has received notification that the
Director has decided not to issue criminal proceedings
(or after such proceedings have concluded) the Coroner
may resume the Inquest hearing.  The Hillsborough Inquest
recently recommenced in November 1990. The latest
estimate is that the Inquests will continue hearing
evidence and are likely to conclude in March 1991.

The point made by Kenneth Hind MP about the matter being
forgotten if action is not taken against those
responsible can be answered by pointing to the detailed
interim and final report of the Public Inquiry conducted
by Lord Justice Taylor, the civil proceedings at which
the police admitted liability and the fact that
disciplinary action is being considered by the Police
Complaints Authority against various officers.

The Coroner's jury may be influenced by the publicity
surrounding the Director's decision. The criminal
investigation and any prosecution must take precedence
over the Coroner's Inquisitorial hearing where no
individual can be held responsible.  The Public Inquiry
itself has been widely reported and such publicity can
also be said to influence the jury's conclusions.

                           JOINT OPINION



Introduction

1.   On 15th April 1989 the worst disaster in British football

history occurred inside the Hillsborough Stadium at Sheffield

where Liverpool were playing Nottingham Forest in the FA Cup

semi-final. 95 people died and over 400 were injured as a

result of gross overcrowding and crushing in the two pens

immediately behind the goal at the western (Leppings Lane) end

of the ground.

      We are instructed to advise whether there exists

sufficient evidence to justify bringing criminal proceedings

against any of the organisations or individuals concerned.



2.   We have been provided with the Interim Report of the

Inquiry headed by Lord Justice Taylor published in August 1989

("the Taylor Report") and the report to the Director of Public

Prosecutions of the criminal investigation carried out by the

West Midlands Police ("the West Midlands Report").



3.   Our views were sought at an early stage on the scope of

the investigation and the format of the report, and the

material which has been placed before us is very extensive.    In

addition to the reports mentioned, we have been provided with

the bulk of the documentation placed before Lord Justice

Taylor's Inquiry,   the full transcript of the evidence given at

the Inquiry, and a large quantity of visual evidence in the

form of photographs and video film.
             we   have also visited Hillsborough stadium and have had

      the opportunity of seeing for ourselves the physical

     characteristics of the ground which played such an'important
     part in the disaster.



     4-    Throughout our consideration of this case we have kept

     constantly in mind the appalling scale of the tragedy for the

           aved and those injured,     some of whom suffered devastating

     psychological injuries from which they are unlikely to

     recover. We have borne in mind, too, the strong feelings of

  anger and bitterness which the disaster has provoked within

 the Liverpool community and elsewhere, and the important role

             pursuit of justice which criminal proceedings are
 perceived to have by those aggrieved.



             the light of the prominent part played by the South

 Yorkshire Police in the disaster, we have reminded ourselves

 m    particular that police officers are in no different

          gory to others m      a criminal   investigation. We should s a y

that we are fully satisfied that             that has been the approach of

the West Midlands Police, who have conducted a meticulous

investigation in which no stone has been left unturned.



           ven the serious nature of the criminal liability under

consideration,       however,    it is essential that the available

material should be examined in an entirely dispassionate
manner. This we have tried to do.




                                       2
The facts

7.   A notable feature of the disaster is the absence of

conflict of fact as to what happened at Hillsborough. This

consistency of evidence was remarked on by the Taylor Inquiry

(see the Taylor Report para 113). Further, the criminal

investigation,    for all its thoroughness, has not significantly

added to or contradicted Lord Justice Taylor's findings.. In

our judgment,    therefore,   the Taylor analysis of the facts is

as firm a base as any from which to approach the question of

criminal liability and where necessary we shall make reference

in this Opinion to the Report and its Appendices.



Summary

8.   At 2.52 pm on 15th April 1989 one of the exit gates at the

Leppings Lane end of the Hillsborough Stadium was opened on

the instruction of Chief Superintendent Duckenfield,     the

Commander responsible for policing the match. The purpose was

to relieve unprecedented overcrowding and crushing at the

turnstiles caused by a build up of supporters arriving after

2.30 pm for the semi-final due to kick off at 3 pm. In the

ensuing 5 minutes,   some 2,000 supporters passed through the

gate and entered the tunnel under the West stand giving access

to the central pens of the terrace. Those pens were already

overfull because of the physical layout of the terrace and the

uncontrolled way in which supporters were allowed to enter

them. Gross overcrowding and crushing occurred. Moreover,      the

intense pressure exerted by the additional influx caused the

collapse of a crush barrier situated near the front of pen 3.


                                   3
Supporters were hurled down into the front of the pen and

crushed up against the low wall and the perimeter wire fence

above it. Many died from suffocation and crushing injuries;

some were trampled on. The crushing was not immediately

recognised, partly because those trampled upon were not

visible behind the wall, partly because police operational

orders prohibited officers on the perimeter track from opening

the perimeter gates without permission from a senior officer,

and partly because the crushing and distress was not expected.

The response of the police was therefore slow. Even when the

nature and extent of the emergency was appreciated and the

perimeter gates were opened, the small number of gates and the

height of the fence itself made rescue and evacuation a

hopelessly difficult task.

     The build up outside the ground which led to the opening

of the exit gate was due to the layout, numbers, designation

and marking of the turnstile entrances at the Leppings Lane

end, and to a loss of police control of the crowd as

supporters became desperate to get in before the kick-off.



9.   It will be clear from the above summary that the disaster

had three separate causative elements which need to be

examined: the layout of the ground; the opening of the exit

gate; and the build up outside the ground.




                               4
The layout of the ground

10.   Sheffield Wednesday Football Club ("the Club") was formed

in 1867 and moved to the Hillsborough ground in 1899. In the

90 years that elapsed before the disaster it was successfully

used for numerous sporting events, including FA Cup semi­

finals, international matches and 3 World Cup matches. Very

large crowds were accommodated, the record being over 72,000

in 1934. Significant changes were made to the layout of the

ground over the years and these need to be understood.



11.   The present South stand was built in 1913, the Spion Kop

(at the Eastern end) was added in 1914, and the West stand was

built in 1965. Before then the Leppings Lane end was entirely

terraced. Until fairly recently, not only were there no

perimeter fences between the terraces and the pitch, there

were relatively few crush barriers on the terraces themselves.

The plan at Appendix 4 to the Taylor Report shows the

arrangement of the barriers at the Leppings Lane end.



12.   Before 1979 there were continuous barriers along the

front, with two intermittent rows of barriers behind (coloured

black on the plan). There were no "radial" barriers,    that is

fences running at right angles to the crush barriers from back

to front of the terrace so as to form pens. The perimeter

fences were installed in 1977 as a response to the hooliganism

and pitch invasions of the 1970s.




                                5
  13.     in 1978 Dr Eastwood, a highly experienced civil and

  structural engineer and a principal of the firm of Eastwood

  and Partners who had been advising the Club on minor matters

  since the 1950s, was formally retained to act on the Club's

  behalf in its dealings with the local authority, then the

 South Yorkshire County Council, but which later became the

 Sheffield City Council ("the Council"). The Safety of Sports

 Ground Act 1975 had recently been passed and it was necessary

 for the Club to take expert advice if it was to receive a

 Safety Certificate under the Act from the Council. Dr Eastwood

 advised that further barriers should be installed in order to

 comply with the Home Office "Green Guide" then in force and

 the additional barriers shown and marked blue on the plan at

 Appendix 4 were installed in 1979.



 14.    The Council set up an Officer Working Party consisting of

representatives of the police, the fire services, and the

Council's building surveyors' division and legal and

administration department and, as a result of inspections and

consultations with the Club and Dr Eastwood, a Safety

Certificate was issued for the ground in 1979.



15.     in 1981, on the occasion of the semi-final between

Tottenham Hotspur and Wolverhampton Wanderers, a serious

crushing incident at the Leppings Lane end led to further

changes to the layout of the terrace. Late arrivals who surged

forward when a goal was scored at the Kop end caused the

crushing of several supporters at the front of the terrace.


                                 6
There were injuries but no deaths. This incident,   the further

significance of which will be returned to, prompted the police

to suggest that it had been caused by the sideways .movement,

of supporters to positions behind the goal, and that the

installation of radial fences would prevent such movement as

well as providing segregation of supporters of opposing teams

who could thus be accommodated on the same terrace.



16.   The police view was accepted by the Club and the Officer

Working Party, and the two radial fences shown pale green in

Appendix 4 were installed in 1981. The terrace was thereby

divided into three pens, with neither forward nor sideways

movement by supporters being possible once a pen became full.

The fences had gates at the top end to be locked once the pens

had filled up.



17.   Further changes to the layout in 1985 and 1986 resulted

in the addition of two more radial fences, the consequential

removal of some posts and rails, and the removal of a barrier

at the top of the terrace near the entrance tunnel, Barrier

144. The result of the addition of the central radial fence

was to divide the pen immediately behind the goal into the two

pens 3 and 4. These were to be the scene of the disaster in

April 1989.



18.   All these changes were discussed between the police,   the

Club and Dr Eastwood, and the Officer Working Party approved

the removal of Barrier 144 in August 1986, by which time Mr


                                7
Bownes had become the Licensing Officer responsible for the

Safety Certificate on behalf of the Council.



19.   Alterations to the turnstiles and concourse of the

Leppings Lane entrance were also made at this time in the

interests of segregation. To this end Dr Eastwood had

suggested a plan for separate access to the North stand,    to

each end of the West stand, and to each of the three central

pens by means of separate banks of turnstiles. This plan was

not adopted for financial reasons, but it seems that separate

entrances would have enabled the numbers of supporters

entering each of the pens to be monitored by mechanical or

computerised counting at the turnstiles. As it was, there was

no numerical monitoring or other means of limiting the numbers

of supporters entering the penned areas, including the popular

pens 3 and 4 immediately behind the goal.



20.   The effect was that these areas were likely to attract

more than their proper share of the 10,100 supporters allowed

into the Leppings Lane end under the Safety Certificate and

there was no physical way of preventing this. All had to be

left to visual monitoring by the police and the Club stewards

as the supporters took their places inside the ground.



21.   The police had requested the removal of Barrier 144 in

pen 3 for two reasons: first, to assist the flow of supporters

into the pens and, secondly, to assist evacuation through the

tunnel in an emergency. Unhappily, as later events showed, the


                               8
first purpose was all too successfully achieved. A further

consequence, however, unappreciated at the time, was to

increase the capacity of pen 3.



22.   The Safety Certificate should have been amended to take

account of these changes, which the Club notified to the

Council in accordance with its statutory obligations. Equally

importantly,   it should have contained maximum figures for

individual pens.



23.   The Certificate was not amended and maximum figures were

not inserted partly because Mr Bownes, as Chief Licensing

Officer responsible for 32 other licensing systems, was

overworked, and partly because Dr Eastwood thought that the

maximum stated capacity for the Leppings Lane end need not be

altered providing the police could ensure even distribution of

the supporters throughout the terrace by leaving the radial

gates open. The Taylor Report found that the insertion of

proper maximum figures into the Safety Certificate might have

prompted the Club and the police to find some way of limiting

the numbers entering pens 3 and 4. One way would have been the

adoption of Dr Eastwood's plan for separate turnstile

entrances mentioned above.



24.   The Taylor Report concluded that the fact that the Safety

Certificate was not amended and individual pen capacities not

reviewed could not be laid solely at Dr Eastwood s door. The

Council was ultimately responsible for the Certificate.
25.    Entry to pens 3 and 4 was via the tunnel running from

the concourse area behind turnstiles A-G, underneath       the West

stand and out into the terrace (see Appendices 1 and'3 to the

Taylor Report). The effect of the changes to the layout of the

Leppings Lane terrace, all of which were purportedly licensed

under the Safety Certificate, was that the only means of

controlling the numbers entering those pens was by cordoning

off the tunnel access.



26.   Moreover,   it was the policy of the police at semi-finals

(but not at League matches) to allow    free movement of

supporters between pens prior to the    kick off, when the radial

gates would be closed and locked. Unless steps were taken to

control the numbers entering the tunnel access, therefore,

pens 3 and 4 were liable to become grossly overcrowded at all

times. The police had accepted de facto responsibility for

monitoring the pens and their policy of "letting the fans find

their own level", was severely criticised in the Taylor Report

(see paras 172 to 183).



The opening of the exit gate

27.   As already stated, the exit gate (Gate C) was opened at

2.52 pm on the day of the disaster following an instruction

from Mr Duckenfield. Gate C is situated almost immediately

opposite the tunnel (see Appendix 1 to the Taylor Report) and

no steps had been taken to cordon off the tunnel or to divert

the influx away to the sides of the West stand. The result was


                                10
that the supporters effectively had nowhere to go but the

already overcrowded pens 3 and 4.



28.   As the supporters entered the tunnel some were.-swept off

their feet, accelerated by a 1 in 6 downward gradient in the

tunnel itself. A huge crush built up in pens 3 and 4 and some

supporters tried to escape on to the pitch. Others climbed

over the radial fences to the side pens where,    ironically,

there was still plenty of room. Later some began to be hauled

up out of the pens to safety in the West stand.



29.    The match kicked off just before 3 pm. The evidence

before the Taylor Inquiry satisfied that tribunal that it was

the near goal for Liverpool at 3.04 pm that caused a powerful

surge forward in pen 3, the force of which caused a crush

barrier at the front of the pen, barrier 124A, to collapse.

This in turn hurled supporters down against the wall and to

their deaths, putting yet more pressure on those already

suffocating at the perimeter wire at the front. The collapse

of this barrier appears to have been a major factor in the

deaths, since there were far fewer deaths in pen 4 where no

barrier collapsed.



30.   The Taylor Report found that a further contributory cause

of the collapse of barrier 124A was the removal of barrier 144

in 1986 already referred to. The absence of the latter

barrier,   in the exceptional conditions prevailing, meant that

the supporters met no retarding structure as they emerged from


                                11
the tunnel into pen 3, and that there was unbroken diagonal

pressure from the mouth of the tunnel down to barrier 124A.

Further, as the plan at Appendix 4 to the Taylor Report shows,

barrier 124A was vulnerable to downward pressure as a result

of the removal of the barrier immediately above it - one of

the alterations consequential to the installation of the two

additional radial fences. The Taylor Report's conclusions are

supported on this point by the evidence of Inspector Bullas

(see para 234) and by a concession made by Dr Eastwood.



31.   The Taylor Report's findings on the timing of the

collapse of barrier 124A and its probable cause and effects

are supported by the BBC video tape and the evidence of the

supporters near to the barrier itself. They are reinforced by

the probability that, had the barrier collapsed earlier,     the

police on the track would have appreciated that this

catastrophe had occurred and would have taken rescue action

much earlier.



32.   We have viewed the evidence and we are impressed by it.

With respect, we share the opinion of the Taylor Report that

this is what occurred. The collapse of barrier 124A was, of

course, a major factor in the causation of the deaths.



33.   The Taylor Report also found, on the basis of expert

evidence which is before us, that barrier 124A, although

corroded, had been tested by Dr Eastwood in July 1988 and had

passed the loading tests specified in the Green Guide.
Although the corrosion played a part in the collapse,   the

effective cause, the Report found, was the excessive and

unanticipated pressure to which it was exposed at the time of

the forward surge mentioned above. Th© Green Guide "made no

specific reference to testing for corrosion as a cause of

deterioration.



34.   The crushing in pens 3 and 4 was not recognised either by

the police officers in the control box in the South West

corner of the ground (see Appendix 1), or by the officers

detailed to the perimeter track, for several minutes after the

first signs of distress appeared, resulting in time being lost

before rescue efforts began. It is plain also,   from our

reading of the statements,   that the crushing and distress was

not recognised by nearby civilians, by many (but not all) of

the broadcasters and press, nor by stewards of the Club.

Having seen the video evidence, we can readily understand how

this situation arose. The truth is that no-one was expecting

to happen what in fact happened.



35.   There was no effective leadership until the arrival of

Chief Superintendent Nesbit just after 3pm and it was not

until 3.06pm that Mr Duckenfield appreciated that there had

been a major disaster rather than the pitch invasion that he

had assumed. The ambulance service was called at 3.06pm but no

request for cutting gear or the fire brigade was made until

3.13pm. The Taylor Report concluded, however, that it is




                                13
 unlikely (although possible) that these services could have

 saved lives had they been called promptly. We agree.



 36.   The evacuation of the supporters and those injured was

 achieved mainly through the perimeter gates. These were not

 designed as exits and those to pens 3 and 4 were narrower than

 provided by the Green guide. The Taylor report concluded,

 however,   that even if their width had complied with the Green

Guide, the gates would have been wholly inadequate to relieve

the pressure and release spectators swiftly. The Guide was

silent as to any recommended number of such gates and it is

clear that their use for large scale evacuation was not

intended or anticipated.



37.    The opening of gate C, which precipitated the disaster,

was made necessary by the massive build up of supporters at

the Leppings Lane turnstiles between 2.30 and 2.50 pm. The

perimeter gates to the ground (see Appendix 1) were open from

the outset, and severe congestion and crushing developed at

the turnstiles,   the number and capacity of which were

inadequate to cope in time with the large numbers. The

crushing worsened as kick-off time approached and supporters

realised they would be late into the ground. The police lost

control of the crowd and the crush became unmanageable and

dangerous, with many fearing for their lives. The kick-off was

not postponed because it had been agreed with the Club that

this course would only be taken if there was a major cause of

delay such as an accident on the motorway or fog. Mr


                                14
  Duckenfield gave inconsistent evidence to the Inquiry about

^^iis decision on this point and the Report concluded that the

  kick-off could and should have been postponed.



  38.    The request to open gate C was made by Superintendent

  Marshall,   the Commander in Leppings Lane, who told Mr

  Duckenfield by radio that someone would be killed if the gate

  was not opened. There is a very considerable body of evidence

  to show that Mr Marshall's view was correct and that Mr

  Duckenfield had no alternative but to agree to the opening of

  the gate.



  39.    However, neither Mr Duckenfield nor any other police

  officer took any steps to deal with the consequences of the

  opening of the gate.   In particular, the tunnel was not closed

  off. This action, which had been taken in 1988 by serial

  police officers apparently on their own initiative, could and

   should have been carried out by a small number of police

   forming a cordon and directing supporters to the unfilled wing

   pens. Mr Duckenfield did order police serials to go to the

   concourse to monitor an influx when another gate, gate A, was

   opened a little earlier, because he feared a pitch invasion

   from the North stand where there was no perimeter fence.



   40.   The Taylor Report concluded that Mr Duckenfield s failure

   to give a similar order on the opening of gate C was "a

   blunder of the first magnitude". Plainly, this error was the

   immediate, or proximate, cause of the crushing in pens 3 and


                                   15
and the pressure which led to the collapse of the barrier in

pen 3.



41.   But it was not of course the sole cause.   In addition to

the layout characteristics of the terrace described earlier,

the other main cause was the build up outside the ground which

led to the need to open the gate. This itself was due to a

combination of factors to which reference must now be made.



The build up outside the ground

42.   The first factor contributing to the build up outside the

ground was the layout of the Leppings Lane turnstiles and the

narrowness of the neck or forecourt at the bend in the Lane

itself where, coming from the North, it turns to the South-

West and crosses the river (see Appendix 1). Not only were the

turnstiles not in a straight line, affording adequate space

for the formation of orderly queues, therefore, but the

waiting area itself was extremely confined. Next,    there was

the designation and marking of the turnstiles, with the 10,100

ticket-holders for the West terrace all being required to

enter through turnstiles A-G at entrance "B", although the

three blocks of turnstiles serving the Leppings Lane entrance

were confusingly lettered "A,C,B". In addition, the colour

coding on the turnstile walls was too low to be seen through a

crowd. The Taylor Report found these to be factors

contributing to the delay in the turnstile operation.
43.   However, the turnstile operation itself was slow because

there were only seven turnstiles to admit the 10,100 ticket-

holders, an average of 1450 through each. This is to be

compared with the 60 turnstiles at the Penistone Road end

which served 29,800, a little under 500 per stile. The Green

Guide provided that in general no more than 750 could be

admitted in one hour. The Club, taking into account that it

was an all-ticket match with no cash passing, reckoned this

could be increased to 1000 per hour. However, as Lord Justice

Taylor observed, even at this higher rate it would have taken

almost 1% hours to admit all those with terrace tickets;    at

750 per hour it would have taken 2 hours. The Taylor Report

concluded that the police and the Club should have foreseen

that the turnstiles and the waiting area would be under strain

to admit all the Liverpool supporters in time.



44.   Many supporters arrived after 2.30 pm, the request on the

ticket being simply "to take up position 15 minutes before

kick off". Some arrived without tickets and tried to get in by

paying cash, others by trying to go over or under the paddle

of the turnstile or by sliding through with a ticket-holder.

All these activities slowed the admission rate and contributed

to the frustration of the crowd as kick-off approached.



45.    There is no question on the evidence that many of the

supporters had been drinking and some were abusive as a

result. Probably few offered violence and the Taylor Report

acquitted the majority of being affected by drink,   finding


                               17
that some police had overestimated this factor in their

evidence. Having read the relevant statements,    it seems to us

that drink and unruliness of the supporters certainly

contributed to the pushing from the back and was a factor in

making supporters less amenable to police requests to move

back. In some cases, too, drunk supporters tried to force

themselves in at the turnstiles, causing fighting with other

supporters and scuffles with the police trying to prevent

their entry. This minority contributed to the loss of control

of the crowd by police in our view.



46.   Nevertheless,   the main factor in this loss of control was

a failure of police strategy in not planning properly for the

crush likely to be caused by a large concentration of arrivals

from 2.30 pm onwards, and in failing to stem the flow of

supporters or filter them towards the turnstiles from some

position outside the perimeter gates. Such action had been

successfully carried out in 1988, as numerous witnesses have

confirmed. The Taylor Report concluded that a combination of

controlled filtering and a postponed kick-off would probably

haver obviated the need to open the gate.



Apportionment of responsibility

47.   The layout of the ground as it stood on the day of the

disaster was the responsibility of four organisations,    and

some of the individuals acting on their behalf, namely the

Club, Eastwood and Partners, the Council and the police.

However, none of them foresaw that the progressive alterations
made to the ground from about 1977 onwards in the interests of

safety and good order would come to constitute, in effect, a

death trap for supporters entering pens 3 and 4. This was

principally because no-one foresaw that up to 2000 supporters

would be allowed to enter these pens at a time when they were

already overcrowded,   and when spreading out to the side to

absorb the extra numbers would be impossible. Plainly, no-one

foresaw any circumstances akin to the opening of gate C, nor

the unprecedented crushing outside the ground which made that

action necessary on the day of the disaster. That said, all

four organisations share some responsibility for the lack of

safe maximum capacities, the lack of controlled entry to the

pens and the absence of any proper system of monitoring,    as

they must for the departures from the Green Guide and the

inadequacy of the Safety Certificate. The police must take the

main responsibility for the policy of letting the fans find

their own level although, as the lengthy exploration of the

borders of their duties at the Inquiry demonstrates,   the Club

must share some responsibility for the way in which supporters

were allowed to fill the pens at semi-final matches.



48.   It may be argued that the 1981 crushing incident already

mentioned ought to have alerted the police and the Club to the

dangers of admitting large numbers of supporters via the

tunnel access to the West terrace, where they were capable of

being crushed against the perimeter fence, and that knowledge

of this incident increased the responsibility on the police

and the Club for affording safe access to the West terrace. We


                                19
 consider that this is not so, because the response of the

 police in 1981, accepted by the other parties involved, was to

 instal the radial fences with the aim of preventing ‘the

inwards movement of supporters to the area behind the goal,

and until the disaster it was assumed that this was a correct

response. Whether it was correct or not, the incident in our

view has no direct bearing on the disaster eight years later

and does not add to the potential criminal responsibility of

the police and the Club.



49.   The opening of gate C was the responsibility of Mr

Duckenfield and, as already noted, his decision was correct in

the circumstances. However, the failure to give any order to

accommodate the influx was a serious error which must in our

view be Mr Duckenfield's responsibility and his alone. Mr

Duckenfield had been promoted to Chief Superintendent of F

Division only three weeks before the match, and it is

reasonable to ask whether he was competent to take charge of a

match of this importance. However, there is no evidence to

suggest that those responsible for his promotion so erred in

appointing him as to share responsibility for errors made by

him on the day.



50.   The fact that the tunnel was cordoned off in 1988 by a

handful of junior police officers apparently on their own

initiative - an action that almost certainly would have

averted the disaster a year later - is one of the most

unfortunate aspects of the case, and at first sight the


                               20
operational organisation of the police might seem responsible

for failing to incorporate this tactic in its match planning.

However, Mr Duckenfield's dispatch of a serial to deal with

the opening of gate A demonstrates to our mind that it was

within his power to accommodate the opening of gate C, and the

blame for his not doing so cannot in our view be laid

elsewhere.



51. The build up outside the ground was again the

responsibility of the four organisations identified above.

Given the restrictions of space attendant on the geography of

Leppings Lane itself, the layout of the turnstiles and their

numbers, designation and marking was primarily a matter for

the police and the Club. But the Council was also partly

responsible for ensuring that there was safe ingress to the

ground (see Chapter 5 of the Green Guide).



52.   Allowing for the policing difficulties to which the

layout and slow admission rate of the turnstiles gave rise,

the loss of police control, and in particular the failure to

follow the filtering tactics employed in 1988, was solely a

police responsibility. The responsibility was, however,     a

collective one and cannot be attributed to any individual

officer.



Criminal Offences
53.   We turn to consider whether any criminal offence is

disclosed against any of the organisations or individuals

identified or referred to above.



(1) Manslaughter

54. The police authority, the Club and the Council are in law

all corporations of one kind or another (see Halsbury's Laws

of England,   4th ed, Vol 9 at paras 1201-3) so an important

first question is whether a corporation can be indicted for

manslaughter.



55.   This question was considered at length by Professor J.C.

Smith in relation to the shipping company's liability for the

sinking of the Herald of Free Enterprise in an Opinion dated

25th November 1987. We have had the advantage of seeing that

Opinion, which concluded that the company in that case could

be properly indicted for manslaughter by gross negligence or

recklessness,   assuming it could be proved that one or more of

the directing minds of the company caused the deaths, and did

so with the fault required by the definition of manslaughter.

In due course proceedings were begun against the company and

others and on 5th June 1990 Turner J, sitting at the Central

Criminal Court, dismissed a motion to quash the indictment

against the company, holding that both on the authorities and

on principle a corporation is capable of committing

manslaughter. We have seen a note of the Reserved Judgment,

which includes a full consideration of the authorities,     and in

our respectful view it represents a correct view of the law.
56.   We accordingly advise that each of the corporations

mentioned above could properly be indicted for manslaughter if

it could be proved that one or more of the directing minds of

the corporation concerned committed manslaughter as that

offence is currently defined.



(2) Definition of manslaughter

57.   Involuntary manslaughter is committed when a person

causes the death of another either (1) intending to do an act

which, whether he knows it or not, is unlawful and dangerous

in that it is likely to cause direct personal injury ("an

unlawful and dangerous act"), or (2) intending to do an act

which creates an obvious and serious risk of causing personal

injury (a) not giving thought to the possibility of such risk,

or (b) having recognised that there was some risk involved,

nonetheless going on to take it ("recklessness" as defined by

Lord Diplock In R v Lawrence [1982] AC 510).



58.   To amount to manslaughter a person's conduct need not be

the only cause of the death, but it must be a substantial

cause in that it contributed significantly to the result.

Whether it did so contribute is generally a question of fact

for the jury: Pagett (1983) 76 Cr App Rep 279, 287-91.



59.   It may also be that manslaughter is committed if the

person causing the death intends to do an act, or omits to do

an act where there is a duty to do so, being grossly negligent
whether death or serious personal injury results ("gross

negligence"): see eg Smith and Hogan, Criminal Law,     6th ed

(1988) at p 345. The law is at present uncertain whether gross

negligence still exists as a separate head of liability,        two

recent authorities having held that the earlier cases where

manslaughter is defined in terms of negligence should not be

followed and that Lord Diplock's test should be applied
universally.



60-    In Seymour (1983) 76 Cr App Rep 211, Watkins LJ, giving

the judgment of the Court of Appeal in a reckless driving
case, said:

        ...we are of the view that it is no longer necessary or

      helpful to make reference to compensation and negligence.

          Lawrence direction on recklessness is comprehensive

      and of general application to all offences,   including

      manslaughter involving the driving of motor vehicles

      recklessly and should be given to juries without in any

      way being diluted. Whether a driver at the material time

      was conscious of the risk he was running or gave no

      thought to its existence,   is a matter which affects

      punishment for which purposes the judge will have to

      decide,   if he can, giving the benefit of doubt to the

      convicted person,   in which state of mind that person had

      driven at the material time."
        In Kong ChRuk Kwnn v R (1985) 82 Cr App Rep 18 Lo d

' koskill, giving the opinion of the Privy council,        said at p

  25:
        ■Their Lordships are of the view that the presen t.state

        of the relevant law in England and Wales...       is clear. The

        model direction suggested in Lawrence and held in Seymour

        equally applicable to cases of motor manslaughter

        requires,   first, that the vehicle was in fact being

        driven in such a manner as to create an obvious and

        serious risk of causing physical injury to another and

        secondly that the defendant so drove either without

        having given any thought to the possibility of there

        being such a risk or having recognised that there was

         such a risk nevertheless took it.
              in principle their Lordships see no reason why a

         comparable direction should not have been given in the

         present case as regards that part of the case which

         concerned the alleged navigation of the m i n ^ G o l d f i n c h

         by Kong and indeed as regards the alleged navigation of

         the F l v i . n o Flamingo by the other two defendants. Did

         their respective acts of navigation create an obvious and

         serious risk of causing physical damage to some other

         ship and thus to other persons who might have been

          travelling in the area of the collision at the material

          time? If so did any of the defendants...       so navigate

          either without having given any thought to the

          possibility of' that risk or, while recognising that the

          risk existed, take that risk?
     ^ ^ A t p 26, Lord Roskill said:

              "Their Lordships... respectively agree with the comment

              made by Watkins LJ. .. in Seymour."



        62.   However, as pointed out by Smith and Hogan (6th ed (1988)

        at p 353), while the clear implication from Kong Cheuk Kwan is

        that there is no longer any separate test of gross negligence

        in manslaughter,   it may be that the courts would not be

        prepared to exclude it altogether in an appropriate case. Some

        support for this view is found in Goodfellow (1986) 83 Cr App

        Rep 23, where Lord Lane LCJ said that the question in Kong

        Cheuk Kwan was whether the defendant was "guilty of

        recklessness (or gross negligence)".



        63.   We consider it right in the circumstances of Hillsborough
'i
I       to approach the evidence on the basis that the gross

        negligence test is sufficient to establish the offence of

        manslaughter and we propose to advise accordingly.



        (3) Neglect by police

        64.   When gross negligence or manslaughter by neglect is

        alleged against the police, however, authority indicates a

        more detailed test of liability. In R v West— London Coroner,'s
sm
        Court, ex p Gray [1988] QB 467, allegations were made against

        police following the death of a man while in police custody

        concerning the use of force against him and failure to summon
ii      an ambulance promptly when he became unconscious. The

        coroner's directions to the jury as to unlawful killing were


                                        26
q u a s h e d by the Divisional Court, which held that a coroner

d i r e c t i n g a Jury on manslaughter comprising unlawful killing

  alleged to have occurred because of neglect by police was

  required to direct them as follows:
           (1) that they had to be satisfied of four ingredients,

           namely (a) that the police were under a duty to have

           regard to the health and welfare of the deceased,    (b)

           that in the circumstances there was a failure to do what

           should have been done for the health and welfare of the

           deceased,   (c) that the failure amounted to a substantial
                             ^     that the failure amounted to
           cause of death, and (d)

           recklessness;
                           +.   "recklessness" was whether a police
           (2) that the test of recKiessn
                                ^ ^      dutv was indifferent to an
           officer, having regard to
           obvious and serious risk to the health and welfare of the

            deceased or, recognising that risk to be present,
                          , n tn run it bv doing nothing about it;
            deliberately chose to ru
            (3) that a failure to appreciate that there was such a

            risk was not by itself sufficient to amount to

            recklessness; and
            (4) that the Jury could only return a verdict of unlawful

            killing if they could attribute the unlawful conduct to a

            single police officer.



     65.     Plainly those directions are those to be given in any
                             a nolice officer where omission to act
     criminal prosecution of a poiic
                               Hp>ath In our view they have a
     is alleged to have caused death.




                                        27
^J^ect bearing on our consideration of the evidence in this

case.



(4) Culpable misfeasance
66.     We turn next to consider the common law offence of

culpable misfeasance or misconduct in public office. We are

satisfied that this offence exists, and that it is committed

where a public officer, such as a police officer, wilfully

neglects to perform a duty which he is bound to perform by

common law or statute. But the neglect has to be wilful, not

merely inadvertent, and must be culpable in the sense that it

is without reasonable excuse or justification. The element of

culpability is not restricted to corruption or dishonesty,

however, but must be of such a degree that the misconduct

calculated to injure the public interest: R v Dytham [1979]

QB 722.



 67.    Even if the words "likely to" are substituted for

 "calculated" in this definition, as we think they might be, it

 is clear that this little known offence is a difficult one

 prove to the satisfaction of a jury.



 Evidence to support manslaughter

 68.     We consider in turn the possible liability of (i) the

 Club,    (ii) Eastwood and Partners,   (iii) the Council and (iv)

 the police. It will be convenient to consider the evidence

 first against the four organisations,      and secondly in relat'o




                                   28
       to the individuals who acted on behalf of the organisations

       concerned.



       (i) The Club

       69.   The Club's responsibility for the crushing and deaths

       lies in its responsibility for (1) the layout of the inside of

       the ground as a result of the alterations to the West terrace

       and (2) the layout, number, designation and marking of the

       turnstiles in Leppings Lane. Whilst, on our factual analysis

       of the disaster, these two factors might be regarded as

       substantial causes of the deaths in that they contributed

       significantly to the result, it is clear not only that they
|P
       were not the sole causes, or even the major causes, but that
vm
 V\i   the Club's actions and omissions only partly contributed to

       them. As already observed (see para 47 above), the layout of

       the ground was the responsibility of the four organisations

       and in varying degrees. The Club not only relied on its own
ft
       consultant engineer Dr Eastwood, but it responded to the

       suggestions and advice of the police in important respects.

       The Council played its part.



       70.   For the purposes of the criminal law, where it is

       axiomatic that a case against each defendant must be given

       totally separate consideration, we consider that there is no

       sufficient evidence to support a prima facie case that the

       Club caused the deaths.




                                      29
 71.   In case we are wrong in that conclusion, we have

 considered whether the requisite intention for manslaughter

 could be proved against the Club. It seems to us, however,

 that the evidence does not    begin to show either   recklessness

 or gross negligence on its    part.



 72.   it follows that there is in our view no sufficient

 evidence to support a charge of manslaughter against either

 the Club or any of its officials.



 ( )   Eastwood and Partners

73.    Since Dr Eastwood was   the principal of the firm, it is

his actions and omissions alone that fall to be considered. As

consultant to the Club he too was responsible for the layout

of the inside of the ground and the layout and operation of

the turnstiles. However, his advice formed part only of the

sequence of events that led to the structural condition of the

ground as it was immediately before the disaster and by no

rational yardstick could his advice be said to have caused the

deaths. There are two further factors in his case, moreover.

First, his advice in relation to the forming of separate

turnstile entrances to the North stand, each end of the West

stand and each of the central plans, not acted on for

financial reasons, would if adopted have led to numerical

monitoring of the central pens, and might well have led to the

insertion of maximum figures for those pens in compliance with

the Safety Certificate. Second, so far as the Safety
Certificate is concerned, this was the ultimate responsibility

of the Council.



74.   There is no evidence that Dr Eastwood caused the deaths.

Nor is there any evidence that he was either reckless or

grossly negligent. We have no hesitation, therefore, in

concluding that there is no evidence to support a charge of

manslaughter against Dr Eastwood or indeed against Eastwood

and Partners.



(iii) The Council

75.   The Council bears responsibility for the Safety

Certificate, which should have been amended to provide for the

alterations and for the insertion of maximum figures for the

pens. The Council was also responsible for ensuring compliance

with the Green Guide in the respects detailed above,    as well

as in some other respects. There were departures from the

Green Guide, some more important then others. Of course,    it

does not follow that the disaster would not have happened even

if the Safety Certificate had been amended, since compliance

depended on the Club and Dr Eastwood. In common with the Club

and Dr Eastwood, however, the Council's errors only partly

contributed to the ground conditions identified above as

causes of the deaths and on any view were too remote to amount

to a prima facie case of manslaughter. There is no evidence of

recklessness or ’gross negligence on their part.

       early set out in the Taylor Report        a «?
                                            s an organisation they
       re partly responsible for the layout of the inside of the

  ™     .    They were responsible for the policy, heavily

 l a i c i s e d in the Taylor Report, whereby supporters were left

 ^               ^      own level" and not monitored as they entered
        pens m       semi-final matches. They were also partly

 responsible for the Leppings Lane turnstiles and, together

 —       the Club, should have foreseen the difficulties of
 admission of surh i ~
                cn large numbers. Ther^ ,,=><=■ •=
                                  m e r e was a serious failure
of policing m          Leppings Lane, due in part to a failure to

follow filtering tactics used effectively in 1988.



        These errors too, however, can only be viewed as part of

- complex sequence of events, many of which were outside the

control of the police. The layout'of the ground, both inside

and out, was the main responsibility of the Club as advised by

      astwood, „lth the Council and the Officer Working Party
superintending the alterations to the West terrace. Likewise,

the contents of the Safety Certificate were not the main

responsibility of the police. The difficulties inherent in the

policing of Leppings Lane, which were partly geographical,    and

the arrival of supporters in very large numbers after 2.30 pm

were not and could not be under police control. Finally,    the

unruly behaviour of a minority of them, although no doubt

foreseeable, created added difficulties.



80.   Once responsibility for the failure to postpone the

off and to cordon off the access tunnel is confined to Mr         ^

Duckenfield,   as we consider it should be (see para 48 above),

the conclusion becomes inescapable in our view that the p

as an organisation cannot be said to have caused the deaths by

their strategy and operational errors.



81.   We have examined the structure of the police command,

both on the day of the disaster itself and in previous years.

We have considered the operational orders for 1988 a

 and police practice at Hillsborough, inside and outside the

 ground, as detailed in the Taylor Report. We have also

 considered the interviews of Mr Marshall and Mr Murray.

 However, there seems to us to be no evidence that in making

 what were undoubtedly errors of judgment and practice,     the

 police organisation, or any individual within it, a

 recklessly or in a.grossly negligent manner either on the day

 of the disaster or beforehand.

             Mr Duckenfield was heavily criticised in the Taylor

   decision not to postpone the kick-off was regarded as a had

  error of judgment. We think both of these criticisms are
  entirely justified. Moreover
                                      /     e operational commander of
  the match, he was ultimately responsible for the policing both
  within and outside the ground. He was personally slow to

  recognise the crushing or signs of distress in the central

  pens which were going on before his eyes. He failed to notice
 the gross imbalance* nf           •
                                  ling between those pens and the
 outer wings which the video shows so clearly. His

 preoccupation with the possibility of a pitch invasion caused

             delay putting the Major Disaster Plan into operation.



 84.       Vet Mr Duckenfield had under his command officers with

considerable experience of policing the match and the ground

who also made operational errors or failed to react as they
should have done  t +- ic
                ■ It is unnecessary to set out here the chain

                 / uffice it to say that in the senior

               were officers who had successfully policed

Hillsborough in previous years, particularly in 1988, when the

operation was regarded as successful. Under them were other

 perienced inspectors and sector commanders,         if the


                                      34
which created an obvious and serious risk of causing personal

injury, either not giving thought to the possibility of such

risk, or having recognised that there was some risk involved,

nonetheless go on to take it?



88.    We consider that there are difficulties in proving that

he intended to do an act which created an obvious and serious

risk of causing personal injury. In the first place there was

no "act" as such, but an omission or omissions to act which

contributed to a rapidly developing state of affairs ending in

serious risk of injury. But was it an obvious risk at the

time? We think not. The complexity of the disaster as now

known to those who have analysed it in hindsight demonstrates

that there must be grave doubt as to whether the omissions

created a risk which was obvious to anyone at the time. The

considerations here are, of course, wholly different from the

driving cases or the collision at sea in the Kong Cheuk Kwan

ca s e .



89.    We conclude,   therefore,   that there is insufficient

evidence on which to found a charge of recklessness against Mr

Duckenfield. Nor is there evidence that he was grossly

negligent in failing to act as mentioned above. We bear in

mind particularly the judgment of the Divisional Court in the

West London Coroner's Court case,the requirements of which are

not in our view satisfied.




                                    36
90.    It follows, and we have come to the clear conclusion,

that there is no evidence that Mr Duckenfield was wilfully

neglectful of his duty or was culpable so as to have committed

the offence of culpable misfeasance.



91.    We conclude that there is no sufficient evidence of any

criminal offence having been committed by Mr Duckenfield.



Police Constables Smith and Illingworth
92.    We note the complaints made against these two officers

who were stationed on the perimeter track at gates 3 and 4

respectively and we have considered the interviews of both.

There is conflicting evidence in the case of each as to how he

reacted and when each gate was opened (see the West Midlands

Report Part VII at pp 252 to 259) and in the case of Smith

there is substantial doubt as to whether he pushed spectators,

 including the complainant Hendry and an unidentified boy, back

 into the crowd and if so when, ie whether before or after

 had appreciated the true nature of the disaster.



 93.    There is no evidence before us that either of these

 officers was guilty of manslaughter or culpable misfeasance,

 and we advise that the allegations made against them be

 investigated further and if appropriate pursued in

 disciplinary proceedings.




                                  37
94.   The balance of allegations against the other officers

mentioned in the West Midlands Report must likewise be a

matter for disciplinary proceedings.



95.   We therefore find no sufficent evidence to support

criminal proceedings of any kind against those persons

mentioned in the West Midlands Report whom we have not found

it necessary to identify in this Opinion.

                                    Introduction



  J hese representations are made in opposition to the requests by the defendants to the
  Crown Prosecution Service, asking that the prosecution of the defendants he taken
  over under section 6 (2) of the Prosecution of Offences Act 1985. for the purpose of
 discontinuing it under section 23 (3). These submissions reflect further reading of
 materials that have become available in the last year, and are .still becoming available.
  I hey should be read in the light of the documents submitted previously, particularly
 the following:



 (0 informations oi 10!h July 1998, and supporting documents, laid before the Leeds
 Magistrates Court;


 (a) the letter from the Hillsborough Family Support Group ("HFSli") to the Crown
 Prosecution Service of 31sl July 1998;


<m) the letter from the HFSG to Mr Cmston of 24thAugust I99S and supporting
documents.


 I he H1SG is a non-politieal organisation, and draws its members from many walks of
lift. I he author ot these representations had no involvement in the ease until he wm
instructed in the ease in the Judicial Review proceedings as leading counsel in about
September 1993 for the six families. After the hearing, he took no part until the end of
1<>%- whcn he was as*1" asked to advise in the light of the new evidence discovered,
some oi which was the subject of the drama-documentary televised in December
1996. He then represented and advised the Group before, during and after the
“Scrutiny” in 1997-8.


                                          1
3   It is regretted that this submission and supporting documents come at a late stage of

    the review. The Home Secretary said in Parliament in February 1998 that he would
    make available all material in the House o f Commons library considered by him “save
    where there are overriding reasons fordoing otherwise". (Annex 4. page 19X8). The
    attached correspondence (Auaex li ) shows that this process is incomplete, and that

    obvious omissions have not been made good by the South Yorkshire police. Since

    July 1998. the Assistant Chief Constable o f South Yorkshire has taken it upon himself
    to stop the provision even o f documents that the Howe Secretary ordered to be
    disclosed. (Sec Tab 17, pages 202-7, file o f 24th August 1998.)



                                  The right to prosecute



4   -Lhc.xiiiht to prosecute “privately". This right was preserved specifically by section 6

    o f (he Prosecution o f Offences Act 1985. The provision was reviewed in R v. Bow

                        Court. ffluatteJjomlLCflnst Shipping Company (1993196 Or.
    App. R. 405. This is not the occasion for a full review/of the right o f private subjects
    to prosccute. It is a right o f constitutional importance, and may properly be exercised
    where a “public" body, such as the Director o f Public Prosecutions, has declined to '
    prosecute.



5   The tests that the Crown Prosecution Scrviec adopts under its (.‘ode for Crown
    Prosecutors were borne well in mind in the decision to prosecute in this case. On the
    basis o f the Taylor findings alone, supported by a proper basis o f witness statements,

    there is a realistic prospect o f conviction tor the oflences o f manslaughter and
    misfeasance in public office. Further, the prospect o f a conviction for manslaughter is
    enhanced by the decision o f the Mouse o f Lords in R v. Adomako J1995 ] 1 A.C. 151.
    However, it is submitted that a “private” prosecutor would be entitled to apply a less
    strict test in deciding to prosecute; he need not follow the test imposed upon itself by
    the CPS. The CPS should not approach a review o f the present kind on the basis that
    it should apply its own test o f evidential sufficiency,

         6       Public interest and “interests o f justice” factors are reviewed below. The matters

                 raised by the defendants will probably form the bask o f an application that the case be
                 stayed, or not committed, because the prosecution, it will be said, is engaged in

                 abusing the process ofU tt court If the defendants do not fcr t t e W reasons present
                 such an argument, the prosecution may well decide to raise this matter with the

                 magistrates' court o f its own motion, and may invite the court, if it wishes, to hear

                 evidence on the subject


         ?       ft is submitted that, except in the very plainest o f cases, it would be h misuse o f the
                 discretion given to the Crown Prosecution Service to take over a prosecution such as
                  this for the purposes o f discontinuing it. Arguments about “abuse o f process” involve

                  questions o f fact and evidence- Matters such as the effect o f press publicity and
                  alleged prejudice caused by delay are evidential and they should be subject to
                  empirical tests. Increasingly, witnesses are called before the tribunals which are

                  called upon to decide “abuse o f process" arguments. Above a il all circumstances
                  should be balanced and weighed In determining whether to stay a east’, awl they

             9    The defendants ask why another, criminal trial of these events should take place, and.

                            JOINT OPINION



Introduction

1.   On 15th April 1989 the worst disaster in British football

history occurred inside the Hillsborough Stadium at Sheffield

where Liverpool were playing Nottingham Forest in the FA Cup

semi-final.    95 people died and over 400 were injured as a

result of gross overcrowding and crushing in the two pens

immediately behind the goal at the western (Leppings Lane) end

of the ground.

      We are instructed to advise whether there exists

sufficient evidence to justify bringing criminal proceedings

against any of the organisations or individuals concerned.



2.   We have been provided with the Interim Report of the

Inquiry headed by Lord Justice Taylor published in August 1989

("the Taylor Report") and the report to the Director of Public

Prosecutions of the criminal investigation carried out by the

West Midlands Police ("the West Midlands Report").



3.   Our views were sought at an early stage on the scope of

the investigation and the format of the report, and the

material which has been placed before us is very extensive.     In

addition to the reports mentioned, we have been provided with

the bulk of the documentation placed before Lord Justice

Taylor's Inquiry, the full transcript of the evidence given at

the Inquiry,   and a large quantity of visual evidence in the

form of photographs and video film.


                                 1
           We have also visited Hillsborough stadium and have had

      the opportunity of seeing for ourselves the physical

   characteristics of the ground which played such an important
  Part in the disaster.



  4-     Throughout our consideration of this case we have kept

  constantly m     mind the appalling scale of the tragedy for the

  bereaved and those injured, some of whom suffered devastating

  psychological injuries from which they are unlikely to
  recover. We have borne in mind, ^        ^                      ^

  anger and bitterness which the disaster has provoked within

 the Liverpool community and elsewhere, and the important role

 in the pursuit of justice which criminal proceedings are

 perceived to have by those aggrieved.



 5-     In the light of the prominent part played by the South

 Yorkshire Police in the disaster, we have reminded ourselves

      particular that police officers are in no different

 category to others in a criminal      investigation. We should say

that we are fully satisfied, that      that has been the approach     of

the West Midlands Police, who have conducted a meticulous

investigation in which no stone has been left unturned.



       Given the serious nature of the criminal liability under

consideration,    however,   it is essential that the available

material should be examined in an entirely dispassionate
manner. This we have tried to do.




                                   2
 The facts

 7. ~ A fiot-dble feature of the disaster is the absence of

 conflict of fact as to what •happened at Hillsborough.

•;-;#aiai®tyianey'•of evidence was remarked on by the Taylor Inquiry

 (g e m -;the Taylor Report para 113). Further, the criminal

 investigation,    for all its thoroughness, has not significantly

 added to or contradicted Lord Justice Taylor's findings,       in

our judgment,     therefore,   the Taylor analysis of the facts is

as firm a base as any from which to approach the question of

criminal liability and where necessary we shall make reference

in this Opinion to the Report and its Appendices.



Summary

8.   At 2i52 pm on 15th April 1989 one of the exit gates at the

Leppings Lane end of the Hillsborough Stadium was opened on

the instruction of Chief Superintendent Duckenfield,      the

Commander responsible for policing the match. The purpose was

to relieve unprecedented overcrowding and crushing at the

turnstiles caused by a build up of supporters arriving after

2.30 pm for the semi-final due to kick off at 3 pm. In the

ensuing 5 minutes,    some 2,000 supporters passed through the

gate and entered the tunnel under the West stand giving access

to the central pens of the terrace. Those pens were already

overfull because of the physical layout of the terrace and the

uncontrolled way in which supporters were allowed to enter

them. Gross overcrowding and crushing occurred. Moreover,       the

intense pressure exerted by the additional influx caused the

collapse of a crush barrier situated near the front of pen 3.


                                    3
Supporters were hurled down into the front of the pen and

crushed up against the low wall and the perimeter wire fence

above it. Many died from suffocation and crushing injuries;

some were trampled on. The crushing was not immediately-

recognised,   partly because those trampled upon were not

visible behind the wall,         -beca^sfe4'police .operational

ordters-prohibited officers on the perimeter track from opening

the perimeter gates without permission from a senior officer,

and partly because the crushing and distress was not expected.

The response of the police was therefore slow. Even when the

nature and extent of the emergency was appreciated and the

perimeter gates were opened, the small number of gates and the

height of the fence itself made rescue and evacuation a

hopelessly difficult task.

     The build up outside the ground which led fcjov't&fe. opening

of the exit gate was due to the layout, numbers, designation

and marking of the turnstile entrances at the Leppings Lane

end, and to a loss of police control, of the crowd as

supporters became desperate to get in before the kick-off.



9.   It will be clear from the above summary that the disaster

had three separate             Elements which need to be

examined: the layout of the ground; iSse opening of the exit

gate; and the build up outside the ground.




                                 4
The layout of the ground

10.   Sheffield Wednesday Football Club ("the Club") was formed

in 1867 and moved to the Hillsborough ground in 1899.    In the

90 years that elapsed before the disaster it was successfully

used for numerous sporting events, including FA Cup semi­

finals,   international matches and 3 World Cup matches. Very

large crowds were accommodated, the record being over 72,000

in 1934. Significant changes were made to the layout of the

ground over the years and these need to be understood.



11.   The present South stand was built in 1913, the Spion Kop

(at the Eastern end) was added in 1914, and the West stand was

built in 1965. Before then the Leppings Lane end was entirely

terraced. Until fairly recently, not only were there no

perimeter fences between the terraces and the pitch,    there

were relatively few crush barriers on the terraces themselves.

The plan at Appendix 4 to the Taylor Report shows the

arrangement of the barriers at the Leppings Lane end.



12.   Before 1979 there were continuous barriers along the

front, with two intermittent rows of barriers behind (coloured

black on the plan). There were no "radial" barriers,    that is

fences running at right angles to the crush barriers from back

to front of the terrace so as to form pens. The perimeter

fences were installed in 1977 as a response to the hooliganism

and pitch invasions of the 1970s.




                                5
       In 1978 Dr Eastwood,   a highly experienced civil and

 structural engineer and a principal of the firm of Eastwood

 and Partners who had been advising the Club on minor matters

 since the 1950s, was formally retained to act on the Club's

 behalf in its dealings with the local authority,   then the

 South Yorkshire County Council, but which later became the

 Sheffield City Council ("the Council").   The Safety of Sports

 Ground Act 1975 had recently been passed and it was necessary

 for the Club to take expert advice if it was to receive a

 Safety Certificate under the Act from the Council. Dr Eastwood

 advised that further barriers should be installed in order to

 comply with the Home Office "Green Guide” then in force and

 the additional barriers shown and marked blue on the plan at

Appendix 4 were installed in 1979.



14.   The Council set up an Officer Working Party consisting of

representatives of the police, the fire services, and the

Council's building surveyors' division and legal and

administration department and, as a result of inspections and

consultations with the Club and Dr Eastwood,   a Safety

Certificate was issued for the ground in 1979.



15.   in 1981, on the occasion of the semi-final between

Tottenham Hotspur and Wolverhampton Wanderers,   a serious

crushing incident at the Leppings Lane end led to further

changes to the layout of the terrace. Late arrivals who surged

forward when a goal was scored at the Kop end caused the

crushing of several supporters at the front of the terrace.


                                6
#
    There were injuries but no deaths. This incident,   the further

    significance of which will be returned to, prompted the police

    to suggest that it had been caused by the sideways .movement,

    of supporters to positions behind the goal, and that the

    installation of radial fences would prevent such movement as

    well as providing segregation of supporters of opposing teams

    who could thus be accommodated on the same terrace.



    16.   The police view was accepted by the Club and the Officer

    Working Party, and the two radial fences shown pale green in

    Appendix 4 were installed in 1981. The terrace was thereby

    divided into three pens, with neither forward nor sideways

    movement by supporters being possible once a pen became full.

    The fences had gates at the top end to be locked once the pens

    had filled up.



    17.   Further changes to the layout in 1985 and 1986 resulted

    in the addition of two more radial fences, the consequential

    removal of some posts and rails, and the removal of a barrier

    at the top of the terrace near the entrance tunnel, Barrier

    144. The result of the addition of the central radial fence

    was to divide the pen immediately behind the goal into the two

    pens 3 and 4. These were to be the scene of the disaster in

    April 1989.



    18.   All these changes were discussed between the police,   the

    Club and Dr Eastwood,   and the Officer Working Party approved

    the removal of Barrier 144 in August 1986, by which time Mr


                                    7
Bownes had become the Licensing Officer responsible for the

Safety Certificate on behalf of the Council.



19.   Alterations to the turnstiles and concourse of the

Leppings Lane entrance were also made at this time in the

interests of segregation. To this end Dr Eastwood had

suggested a plan for separate access to the North stand,    to

each end of the West stand, and to each of the three central

pens by means of separate banks of turnstiles. This plan was

not adopted for financial reasons, but it seems that separate

entrances would have enabled the numbers of supporters

entering each of the pens to be monitored by mechanical or

computerised counting at the turnstiles. As it was, there was

no numerical monitoring or other means of limiting the numbers

of supporters entering the penned areas, including the popular

pens 3 and 4 immediately behind the goal.



20.   The effect was that these areas were likely to attract

more than their proper share of the 10,100 supporters allowed

into the Leppings Lane end under the Safety Certificate and

there was no physical way of preventing this. All had to be

left to visual monitoring by the police and the Club stewards

as the supporters took their places inside the ground.



21.   The police had requested the removal of Barrier 144 in

pen 3 for two reasons:   first, to assist the flow of supporters

into the pens and, secondly,   to assist evacuation through the

tunnel in an emergency. Unhappily, as later events showed,     the
first purpose was all too successfully achieved. A further

consequence, however, unappreciated at the time, was to

increase the capacity of pen 3.



22.   The Safety Certificate should have been amended to take

account of these changes, which the Club notified to the

Council in accordance with its statutory obligations. Equally

importantly,    it should have contained maximum figures for

individual p e n s .



23.   The Certificate was not amended and maximum figures were

not inserted partly because Mr Bownes, as Chief Licensing

Officer responsible for 32 other licensing systems, was

overworked,    and partly because Dr Eastwood thought that the

maximum stated capacity for the Leppings Lane end need not be

altered providing the police could ensure even distribution of

the supporters throughout the terrace by leaving the radial

gates open. The Taylor Report found that the insertion of

proper maximum figures into the Safety Certificate might have

prompted the Club and the police to find some way of limiting

the numbers entering pens 3 and 4. One way would have been the

adoption of Dr Eastwood's plan for separate turnstile

entrances mentioned above.



24.   The Taylor Report concluded that the fact that the Safety

Certificate was not amended and individual pen capacities not

reviewed could not be laid solely at Dr Eastwood s door. The

Council was ultimately responsible for the Certificate.
25.     Entry to pens 3 and 4 was via the tunnel running from

the concourse area behind turnstiles A-G, underneath the West

stand and out into the terrace (see Appendices 1 and'3 to the

Taylor Report).    The effect of the changes to the layout of the

Leppings Lane terrace, all of which were purportedly licensed

under the Safety Certificate, was that the only means of

controlling the numbers entering those pens was by cordoning

off the tunnel access.



26.   Moreover,   it was the policy of the police at semi-finals

(but not at League matches) to allow free movement of

supporters between pens prior to the kick off, when the radial

gates would be closed and locked,                                   -to.

control the numbers entering the tunnel access, therefore,

pens 3 and 4 were liable to become grossly overcrowded at all

       • T^ - police had accepted de facto responsibility for

monitoring the pens and their policy of "letting the fans find

their own level", was severely criticised in the Taylor‘Report

(see paras 172 to 183).

         on the day of the disaster following an instruction

                  i e l d . Gate C is situated almost immediately

opposite the tunnel (see Appendix 1 to the Taylor Report) and

no steps had been taken to cordon off the tunnel or to divert

the influx away to the sides of the West stand. The result was


                                    10
that the supporters effectively had nowhere to go but the

already overcrowded pens 3 and 4.



28.   As the supporters entered the tunnel some were.-swept off

their feet, accelerated by a 1 in 6 downward gradient in the

tunnel itself. A huge crush built up in pens 3 and 4 and some

supporters tried to escape on to the pitch. Others climbed

over the radial fences to the side pens where, ironically,

there was still plenty of room. Later some began to be hauled

up out of the pens to safety in the West stand.



29.    The match kicked off just before 3 pm. The evidence

before the Taylor Inquiry satisfied that tribunal that it was

the near goal for Liverpool at 3.04 pm that caused a powerful

surge forward in pen 3, the force of which caused a crush

barrier at the front of the pen, barrier 124A, to collapse.

This in turn hurled supporters down against the wall and to

their deaths, putting yet more pressure on those already

suffocating at the perimeter wire at the front. The collapse

of this barrier appears to have been a major factor in the

deaths,    since there were far fewer deaths in pen 4 where no

barrier collapsed.



30.   The Taylor Report found that a further contributory cause

of the collapse of barrier 124A was the removal of barrier 144

in 1986 already referred to. The absence of the latter

barrier,   in the exceptional conditions prevailing, meant that

the supporters met no retarding structure as they emerged from


                                 11
the tunnel into pen 3, and that there was unbroken diagonal

pressure from the mouth of the tunnel down to barrier 124A.

Further, as the plan at Appendix 4 to the Taylor Report shows,

barrxer 124A was vulnerable to downward pressure as a result

of the removal of the barrier immediately above it - one of

the alterations consequential to the installation of the two

additional radial fences. The Taylor Report's conclusions are

supported on this point by the evidence of Inspector Bullas

(see para 234) and by a concession made by Dr Eastwood.



31.   The Taylor Report's findings on the timing of the

collapse of barrier 124A and its probable cause and effects

are supported by the BBC video tape and the evidence of the

supporters near to the barrier itself. They are reinforced by

the probability that, had the barrier collapsed earlier,     the

police on the track would have appreciated that this

catastrophe had occurred and would have taken rescue action

much earlier.



32.   We have viewed the evidence and we are impressed by it.

With respect, we share the opinion of the Taylor Report that

this is what occurred. The collapse of barrier 124A was,     of

course,   a major factor in the causation of the deaths.



33.   The Taylor Report also found, on the basis of expert

evidence which is before us, that barrier 124A, although

corroded, had been tested by Dr Eastwood in July 1988 and had

passed the loading tests specified in the Green Guide.

 unlikely (although possible) that these services could have

 saved lives had they been called promptly. We agree.



 36.   The evacuation of the supporters and those injured was

 achieved mainly through the perimeter gates. These were not

 designed as exits and those to pens 3 and 4 were narrower than

 provided by the Green guide. The Taylor report concluded,

 however, that even if their width had complied with the Green

Guide, the gates would have been wholly inadequate to relieve

the pressure and release spectators swiftly. The Guide was

silent as to any recommended number of such gates and it is

clear that their use for large scale evacuation was not

intended or anticipated.



37.    The opening of gate C, which precipitated the disaster,

was made necessary by the massive build up of supporters at

the Leppings Lane turnstiles between 2.30 and 2.50 pm. The

perimeter gates to the ground (see Appendix 1) were open from

the outset, and severe congestion and crushing developed at

the turnstiles,   the number and capacity of which were

inadequate to cope in time with the large numbers. The

crushing worsened as kick-off time approached and supporters

realised they would be late into the ground. The police lost

control of the crowd and the crush became unmanageable and

dangerous, with many fearing for their lives. The kick-off was

not postponed because it had been agreed with the Club that

this course would only be taken if there was a major cause of

delay such as an accident on the motorway or fog. Mr


                                14
Duckenfield gave inconsistent evidence to the Inquiry about

his decision on this point and the Report concluded that the

kick-off could and should have been postponed.



38.   The request to open gate C was made by Superintendent

Marshall, the Commander in Leppings Lane, who told Mr

Duckenfield by radio that someone would be killed if the gate

was not opened.   There is a very considerable body of evidence

to show that Mr Marshall's view was correct and that Mr

Duckenfield had no alternative but to agree to the opening of

the gate.



39.   However, neither Mr Duckenfield nor any other police

officer took any steps to deal with the consequences of the

opening of the gate.   In particular, the tunnel was not closed

off. This action, which had been taken in 1988 by serial

police officers apparently on their own initiative,   could and

should have been carried out by a small number of police

forming a cordon and directing supporters to the unfilled wing

pens. Mr Duckenfield did order police serials to go to the

concourse to monitor an influx when another gate, gate A, was

opened a little earlier, because he feared a pitch invasion

from the North stand where there was no perimeter fence.



40.   The Taylor Report concluded that Mr Duckenfield's failure

 to give a similar order on the opening of gate C was   a

 blunder of the first magnitude". Plainly, this error was the

 immediate, or proximate,   cause of the crushing in pens 3 and 4


                                 15
and the pressure which led to the collapse of the barrier in

pen 3.



41.   But it was not of course the sole cause.    In addition to

the layout characteristics of the terrace described earlier,

the other main cause was the build up outside the ground which

led to the need to open the gate. This itself was due to a

combination of factors to which reference must now be made.



The build up outside the ground

42.   The first factor contributing to the build up outside the

ground was the layout of the Leppings Lane turnstiles and the

narrowness of the neck or forecourt at the bend in the Lane

itself where, coming from the North, it turns to the South-

West and crosses the river (see Appendix 1). Not only were the

turnstiles not in a straight line, affording adequate space

for the formation of orderly queues, therefore, but the

waiting area itself was extremely confined. Next,    there was

the designation and marking of the .turnstiles, with the 10,100

ticket-holders for the West terrace all being required to

enter through turnstiles A-G at entrance "B", although the

three blocks of turnstiles serving the Leppings Lane entrance

were confusingly lettered "A,C,B". In addition,    the colour

coding on the turnstile walls was too low to be seen through a

crowd. The Taylor Report found these to be factors

contributing to the delay in the turnstile operation.
43.   However,   the turnstile operation itself was slow because

there were only seven turnstiles to admit the 10,100 ticket-

holders,   an average of 1450 through each. This is to be

compared with the 60 turnstiles at the Penistone Road end

which served 29,800,    a little under 500 per stile. The Green

Guide provided that in general no more than 750 could be

admitted in one hour. The Club, taking into account that it

was an all-ticket match with no cash passing, reckoned this

could be increased to 1000 per hour. However, as Lord Justice

Taylor observed,    even at this higher rate it would have taken

almost 1\ hours to admit all those with terrace tickets;    at

750 per hour it would have taken 2 hours. The Taylor Report

concluded that the police and the Club should have foreseen

that the turnstiles and the waiting area would be under strain

to admit all the Liverpool supporters in time.



44.   Many supporters arrived after 2.30 pm, the request on the

ticket being simply "to take up position 15 minutes before

kick off". Some arrived without tickets and tried to get in by

paying cash, others by trying to go over or under the paddle

of the turnstile or by sliding through with a ticket-holder.

All these activities slowed the admission rate and contributed

to the frustration of the crowd as kick-off approached.



45.   There is no question on the evidence that many of the

supporters had been drinking and some were abusive as a

result. Probably few offered violence and the Taylor Report

acquitted the majority of being affected by drink,    finding


                                 17
that some police had overestimated this factor in their

evidence. Having read the relevant statements,    it seems to us

that drink and unruliness of the supporters certainly

contributed to the pushing from the back and was a factor in

making supporters less amenable to police requests to move

back. In some cases,    too, drunk supporters tried to force

themselves in at the turnstiles, causing fighting with other

supporters and scuffles with the police trying to prevent

their entry. This minority contributed to the loss of control

of the crowd by police in our view.



46.   Nevertheless,   the main factor in this loss of control was

a failure of police strategy in not planning properly for the

crush likely to be caused by a large concentration of arrivals

from 2.30 pm onwards,   and in failing to stem the flow of

supporters or filter them towards the turnstiles from some

position outside the perimeter gates. Such action had been

successfully carried out in 1988, as numerous witnesses have

confirmed. The Taylor Report concluded that a combination of

controlled filtering and a postponed kick-off would probably

haver obviated the need to open the gate.



Apportionment of responsibility

47.   The layout of the ground as it stood on the day of the

disaster was the responsibility of four organisations,    and

some of the individuals acting on their behalf, namely the

Club, Eastwood and Partners,   the Council and the police.

However, none of them foresaw that the progressive alterations


                                 18
made to the ground from about 1977 onwards in the interests of

safety and good order would come to constitute,   in effect,      a

death trap for supporters entering pens 3 and 4. This was

principally because no-one foresaw that up to 2000 supporters

would be allowed to enter these pens at a time when they were

already overcrowded,   and when spreading out to the side to

absorb the extra numbers would be impossible.   Plainly,   no-one

foresaw any circumstances akin to the opening of gate C, nor

the unprecedented crushing outside the ground which made that

action necessary on the day of the disaster. That said,     all

four organisations share some responsibility for the lack of

safe maximum capacities, the lack of controlled entry to the

pens and the absence of any proper system of monitoring,     as

they must for the departures from the Green Guide and the

inadequacy of the Safety Certificate. The police must take the

main responsibility for the policy of letting the fans find

their own level although, as the lengthy exploration of the

borders of their duties at the Inquiry demonstrates,   the Club

must share some responsibility for the way in which supporters

were allowed to fill the pens at semi-final matches.



48.   It may be argued that the 1981 crushing incident already

mentioned ought to have alerted the police and the Club to the

dangers of admitting large numbers of supporters via the

tunnel access to the West terrace, where they were capable of

being crushed against the perimeter fence, and that knowledge

of this incident increased the responsibility on the police

and the Club for affording safe access to the West terrace. We


                                19
•
     consider that this is not so, because the response of the

    police in 1981, accepted by the other parties involved, was to

    instal the radial fences with the aim of preventing ‘the

    inwards movement of supporters to the area behind the goal,

    and until the disaster it was assumed that this was a correct

    response. Whether it was correct or not, the incident in our

    view has no direct bearing on the disaster eight years later

    and does not add to the potential criminal responsibility of

    the police and the Club.



    49.   The opening of gate C was the responsibility of Mr

    Duckenfield and, as already noted, his decision was correct in

    the circumstances. However, the failure to give any order to

    accommodate the influx was a serious error which must in our

    view be Mr Duckenfield's responsibility and his alone. Mr

    Duckenfield had been promoted to Chief Superintendent of F

    Division only three weeks before the match,   and it is

    reasonable to ask whether he was competent to take charge of a

    match of this importance. However, there is no evidence to

    suggest that those responsible for his promotion so erred in

    appointing him as to share responsibility for errors made by

    him on the day.



    50.   The fact that the tunnel was cordoned off in 1988 by a

    handful of junior police officers apparently on their own

    initiative - an action that almost certainly would have

    averted the disaster a year later - is one of the most

    unfortunate aspects of the case, and at first sight the


                                   20
#
    operational organisation of the police might seem responsible

     for failing to incorporate this tactic in its match planning.

    However, Mr Duckenfield's dispatch of a serial to deal with

    the opening of gate A demonstrates to our mind that it was

    within his power to accommodate the opening of gate C, and the

    blame for his not doing so cannot in our view be laid

    elsewhere.



    51. The build up outside the ground was again the

    responsibility of the four organisations identified above.

    Given the restrictions of space attendant on the geography of

    Leppings Lane itself,    the layout of the turnstiles and their

    numbers, designation and marking was primarily a matter for

    the police and the Club. But the Council was also partly

    responsible for ensuring that there was safe ingress to the

    ground (see Chapter 5 of the Green Guide).



    52.   Allowing for the policing difficulties to which the

    layout and slow admission rate of the turnstiles gave rise,

    the loss of police control,   and in particular the failure to

    follow the filtering tactics employed in 1988, was solely a

    police responsibility. The responsibility was, however,     a

    collective one and cannot be attributed to any individual

    officer.



    Criminal O f f e n d s




                                    21
53.   We turn to consider whether any criminal offence is

disclosed against any of the organisations or individuals

identified or referred to above.



(1) Manslaughter

54. The police authority,    the Club and the Council are in law

all corporations of one kind or another (see Halsbury's Laws

of England,   4th ed, Vol 9 at paras 1201-3) so an important

first question is whether a corporation can be indicted for

manslaughter.



55.   This question was considered at length by Professor J.C.

Smith in relation to the shipping company's liability for the

sinking of the Herald of Free Enterprise in an Opinion dated

25th November 1987. We have had the advantage of seeing that

Opinion, which concluded that the company in that case could

be properly indicted for manslaughter by gross negligence or

recklessness,   assuming it could be proved that one or more of

the directing minds of the company caused the deaths,    and did

so with the fault required by the definition of manslaughter.

In due course proceedings were begun against the company and

others and on 5th June 1990 Turner J, sitting at the Central

Criminal Court,    dismissed a motion to quash the indictment

against the company, holding that both on the authorities and

on principle a corporation is capable of committing

manslaughter. We have seen a note of the Reserved Judgment,

which includes a full consideration of the authorities,     and in

our respectful view it represents a correct view of the law.
56.   We accordingly advise that; each of the corporations

mentioned above could properly be indicted for manslaughter if

it could be proved that one or more of the directing minds of

the corporation concerned committed manslaughter as that

offence is currently defined.



(2) Definition of manslaughter

57.   Involuntary manslaughter is committed when a person

causes the death of another either (1 ) intending to do an act

which, whether he knows it or not, is unlawful and dangerous

in that it is likely to cause direct personal injury ("an

unlawful and dangerous act"), or (2 ) intending to do an act

which creates an obvious and serious risk of causing personal

injury (a) not giving thought to the possibility of such risk,

or (b) having recognised that there was some risk involved,

nonetheless going on to take it ("recklessness" as defined by

Lord Diplock In R v Lawrence [1982] AC 510).



58.   To amount to manslaughter a person's conduct need not be

the only cause of the death, but it must be a substantial

cause in that it contributed significantly to the result.

Whether it did so contribute is generally a question of fact

for the jury: Paqett (1983) 76 Cr App Rep 279, 287-91.



59.   It may also be that manslaughter is committed if the

person causing the death intends to do an act, or omits to do

an act where there is a duty to do so, being grossly negligent


                                 23
whether death or serious personal injury results ("gross

negligence"):      see eg Smith and Hogan, Criminal Law,   6th ed

(1988) at p 345. The law is at present uncertain whether gross

negligence still exists as a separate head of liability,         two

recent authorities having held that the earlier cases where

manslaughter is defined in terms of negligence should not be

followed and that Lord Diplock's test should be applied

universally.



60.     In Seymour (1983) 76 Cr App Rep 211, Watkins LJ, giving

the judgment of the Court of Appeal in a reckless driving
case,    said:

         •   -.we are of the view that it is no longer necessary or

        helpful to make reference to compensation and negligence.

        The Lawrence direction on recklessness is comprehensive

        and of general application to all offences,   including

        manslaughter involving the driving of motor vehicles

        recklessly and should be given to juries without in any

        way being diluted. Whether a driver at the material time

      was conscious of the risk he was running or gave no

      thought to its existence,    is a matter which affects

      punishment for which purposes the judge will have to

      decide,    if he can, giving the benefit of doubt to the

      convicted person,    in which state of mind that person had

      driven at the material time."




                                  24
      in Knn„ rhpnk K.an vj    (1985) B2 Cr App Rep 18 Lord

Roskill, giving the opinion of the Privy council,       said at p

25:
      "Their Lordships are of the view that the present.state

      of the relevant law in England and Wales...      is clear. The

      model direction suggested in Lawrence and held m        Seymour

      equally applicable to cases of motor manslaughter

      requires,   first, that the vehicle was in fact being

      driven in such a manner as to create an obvious and

      serious risk of causing physical injury to another and

      secondly that the defendant so drove either without

       having given any thought to the possibility of there

       being such a risk or having recognised that there was

       such a risk nevertheless took it.
            in principle their Lordships see no reason why a

       comparable direction should not have been given in the

       present case as regards that part of the case which

       concerned the alleged navigation of the F l y i n g ^ o i m r ^

       by Kong and indeed as regards the alleged navigation of

       the rlvlnn Flamingo by the other two defendants. Did

       their respective acts of navigation create an obvious and

        serious risk of causing physical damage to some other

        ship and thus to other persons who might have been

        travelling in the area of the collision at the material

        time? If so did any of the defendants...      so navigate

        either without having given any thought t

        possibility of that risk or, while recognising that the

        risk existed,   take that risk?


                                     25
At p 26, Lord Roskill said:

      "Their Lordships... respectively agree with the comment

      made by Watkins LJ... in Seymour."



62.   However,   as pointed out by Smith and Hogan (6th ed (1988)

at p 353), while the clear implication from Kong_Cheuk . Kwan is

that there is no longer any separate test of gross negligence

in manslaughter,    it may be that the courts would not be

prepared to exclude it altogether in an appropriate case. Some

support for this view is found in Goodfellow (1986) 83 Cr App

Rep 23, where Lord Lane LCJ said that the question in Kong

Cheuk Kwan was whether the defendant was "guilty of

recklessness (or gross negligence)".



63.   We consider it right in the circumstances of Hillsborough

to approach the evidence on the basis that the gross

negligence test is sufficient to establish the offence of

manslaughter and we propose to advise accordingly.



(3) Neglect by police

64.   When gross negligence or manslaughter by neglect is

alleged against the police, however, authority indicates a

more detailed test of liability.      In R v West London Coroner's

Court, ex p Gray [1988] QB 467, allegations were made against

police following the death of a man while in police custody

concerning the use of force against him and failure to summon

an ambulance promptly when he became unconscious. The

coroner's directions to the jury as to unlawful killing were


                                 26
• q u a s h e d by the Divisional Court, which held that

   directing a jury on manslaughter comprising unlawful killing

   alleged to have occurred because of neglect by police was

   required     to direct them as follows:
            (1 ) that they had to be satisfied of four ingredients,

            namely (a, that the police were under a duty to have

            regard to the health and welfare of the deceased,       (b)
                                                =1 -Failure to do what
            that in the circumstances there was a farlu

            should have been done for the health and welfare of the

            deceased,   (c) that the failure amounted to a substantial
                               , , x +->,-=+- +-hp failure amounted to
            cause of death, and (d) that the taixu

            recklessness;
                              , c "rpcklessness" was whether a police

                                 H -i-0 hj_s duty, wasindifferent         to an
            officer, having regard to his aux;y,

             deceased or, recognising that risk to be present,

             deliberately chose    to run it by doing nothing about rt,

             ,3 ) that a failure   toappreciate that there was such        a

             risk was not by itself sufficient to amount to

             recklessness; and
              (4 ) that the jury could only return a verdict of unlawful
                                ,       hnt-p the unlawful conduct to a
             killing if they could attribute tne u

              single police officer.



      65.     Plainly those directions are those to be given m           any

      criminal prosecution of a police officer where omission

      is alleged to have caused death.         In our view they have




                                          27
^J^rect bearing on our consideration of the evidence in this

ca se.



 (4 ) Culpable misfeasance
 66.    We turn next to consider the common law offence of

 culpable misfeasance or misconduct in public office. We are

 satisfied that this offence exists,       and that it is committed

 where a public officer, such as a police officer, wilfully

 neglects to perform a duty which he is bound to perform by

 common law or statute. But the neglect has to be wilful,        not

 merely inadvertent,    and must be culpable in the sense that it

 is without reasonable excuse or justification. The element of

 culpability is not restricted to corruption or dishonesty,

 however, but must be of such a degree that the misconduct is

 calculated to injure the public interest: R v Dytham [1979]

 QB 722.



  67.     Even if the words "likely to" are substituted for

  "calculated" in this definition,       as we think they might: be,   it

  is clear that this little known offence is a difficult one to

  prove to the satisfaction of a jury.



  Evidence to support manslaughter

  68.     We consider in turn the possible liability of (i) the

  Club,    (ii) Eastwood and Partners,    (iii) the Council and (i v )

  the police.    It will be convenient to consider the evidence

  first against the four organisations, and secondly in relation




                                    28
to the individuals who acted on behalf of the organisations

concerned.



(i ) The Club

69.   The Club's responsibility for the crushing and deaths

lies in its responsibility for (1 ) the layout of the inside of

the ground as a result of the alterations to the West terrace

and (2 ) the layout, number, designation and marking of the

turnstiles in Leppings Lane. Whilst, on our factual analysis

of the disaster,   these two factors might be regarded as

substantial causes of the deaths in that they contributed

significantly to the result,   it is clear not only that they

were not the sole causes, or even the major causes, but that

the Club's actions and omissions only partly contributed to

them. As already observed (see para 47 above), the layout of

the ground was the responsibility of the four organisations

and in varying degrees. The Club not only relied on its own

consultant engineer Dr Eastwood, but it responded to the

suggestions and advice of the police in important respects.

The Council played its part.



70.   For the purposes of the criminal law, where it is

axiomatic that a case against each defendant must be given

totally separate consideration, we consider that there is no

sufficient evidence to support a prima facie case that the

Club caused the deaths.
 71.   In case we are wrong in that conclusion, we have

 considered whether the requisite intention for manslaughter

 could be proved against the Club. It seems to us, however,

 that the evidence does not begin    toshow either recklessness

 or gross negligence on its part.



 72.   It follows that there is in our view no sufficient

 evidence to support a charge of manslaughter against either

 the Club or any of its officials.



 (ii ) Eastwood and Partners

 73.   Since Dr Eastwood was the principal of the firm,   it is

his actions and omissions alone that fall to be considered. As

consultant to the Club he too was responsible for the layout

of the inside of the ground and the layout and operation of

the turnstiles. However, his advice formed part only of the

sequence of events that led to the structural condition of the

ground as it was immediately before the disaster and by no

rational yardstick could his advice be said to have caused the

deaths. There are two further factors in his case, moreover.

First, his advice in relation to the forming of separate

turnstile entrances to the North stand, each end of the West

stand and each of the central plans, not acted on for

financial reasons, would if adopted have led to numerical

monitoring of the central pens, and might well have led to the

insertion of maximum figures for those pens in compliance with

the Safety Certificate.   Second, so far as the Safety




                                30
Certificate is concerned, this was the ultimate responsibility

of the Council.



74.   There is no evidence that Dr Eastwood caused the deaths.

Nor is there any evidence that he was either reckless or

grossly negligent. We have no hesitation,   therefore,   in

concluding that there is no evidence to support a charge of

manslaughter against Dr Eastwood or indeed against Eastwood

and Partners.



(iii) The Council

75.   The Council bears responsibility for the Safety

Certificate, which should have been amended to provide for the

alterations and for the insertion of maximum figures for the

pens. The Council was also responsible for ensuring compliance

with the Green Guide in the respects detailed above,     as well

as in some other respects. There were departures from the

Green Guide,   some more important then others. Of course,    it

does not follow that the disaster would not have happened even

if the Safety Certificate had been amended, since compliance

depended on the Club and Dr Eastwood. In common with the Club

and Dr Eastwood, however, the Council's errors only partly

contributed to the ground conditions identified above as

causes of the deaths and on any view were too remote to amount

to a prima facie case of manslaughter. There is no evidence of

recklessness or- gross negligence on their part.
                           -   accordingly no evidence to support a charoe of
       manslaughter against Mr Bownes.

       These errors too, however, can onl y be viewed as part of
 a complex sequence of «
c „ ,                       tS ' many °f ”hich »ere outside the
control Of the police. The layout of the

     out,was the main responsibility of the c, h

                                          32
superintending the alterations to the West terrace.    Likewise,

the contents of the Safety Certificate were not the main

responsibility of the police. The difficulties inherent in the

policing of Leppings Lane, which were partly geographical,

the arrival of supporters in very large numbers after 2.30 pm

were not and could not be under police control. Finally, the

unruly behaviour of a minority of them, although no doubt

foreseeable, created added difficulties.



80.     Once responsibility for the failure to postpone the

off and to cordon off the access tunnel is confined to

Duckenfield,    as we consider it should be (see para 48 above),

the conclusion becomes inescapable in our view that t         p

       an organisation cannot be said to have caused the deaths by

their strategy and operational errors.



 81.     We have examined the structure of the police command,

 both on the day of the disaster itself and in previous ye

 We have considered the operational orders for 1988 and

 and police practice at Hillsborough,    inside and outside t

 ground, as detailed in the Taylor Report. We have also

 considered the interviews of Mr Marshall and Mr Murray

 However, there seems to us to be no evidence that in making

 what were undoubtedly errors of judgment and practice, the

 police organisation,    or any individual within it, acted

 recklessly or in a.grossly negligent manner either on the day

 of the disaster or beforehand.

   S k ^ s t - ^ e s s b a m g e nt Duckenfi0 iH

             Mr Duckenfieid was heavily criticised in the Tavlor

   Heport for failing to cordon off the access tunnel, and his

   decision not to postpone the kick-off was regarded as a bad

   error of judgment. We think both of these c r i t i c
                                    wj. wiese criticisms are

   entirely Justified. Moreover,             as the operational commander of

   the match, he was ultimately responsible for the policing both
  within and outsirlo h-k
                               e ground. He was personally slow to
  recognise the crushing or signs of distress in th

    operational orders or police intelligence was inadequate,    as

    seems likely, it was not the fault of Mr Duckenfield who

    inherited a ready made match plan compiled by others and tried

    to follow it. The slowness of his response to the disaster,

    while much to be regretted, was doubtless due in part to his

    lack of experience of this particular match.



    85.   Mr Duckenfield, who declined to be interviewed for the

    purposes of the criminal investigation, would no doubt argue

    that none of these errors caused the deaths because of the

    interposition of the many other factors already rehearsed. It

    seems to us that that argument would be likely to succeed in

    relation to many of the criticisms. However, there is a case

    to be made in our view that his failure both to postpone the

    kick-off and to take no action to close the tunnel after the

    opening of gate C was a substantial cause of the deaths,    in

    that it significantly contributed to the crowd pressure which

    led to the crushing and the collapse of barrier 124A.



    86.   If that is so, it is necessary to consider whether there

    is evidence that Mr Duckenfield, when failing so to act, had

    the requisite intention to support a charge of manslaughter.



    87.   Clearly there was no unlawful and dangerous act on his

    part or intended by him which would found the first head of

    liability in involuntary manslaughter. But in failing to

    postpone the kick-off, or to order the closure of the tunnel

    after the opening of gate C, or both, did he intend an act


                                   35
which created an obvious and serious risk of causing personal

injury, either not giving thought to the possibility of such

risk, or having recognised that there was some risk involved,

nonetheless go on to take it?



88.   We consider that there are difficulties in proving that

he intended to do an act which created an obvious and serious

risk of causing personal injury.     In the first place there was

no "act" as such, but an omission or omissions to act which

contributed to a rapidly developing state of affairs ending in

serious risk of injury. But was it an obvious risk at the

time? We think not. The complexity of the disaster as now

known to those who have analysed it in hindsight demonstrates

that there must be grave doubt as to whether the omissions

created a risk which was obvious to anyone at the time. The

considerations here are, of course, wholly different from the

driving cases or the collision at sea in the Kong Cheuk Kwan

case .



89.   We conclude, therefore, that there is insufficient

evidence on which to found a charge of recklessness against Mr

Duckenfield. Nor is there evidence that he was grossly

negligent in failing to act as mentioned above. We bear in

mind particularly the judgment of the Divisional Court in the

West London Coroner1s Court caseythe requirements of which are

not in our view satisfied.

90.    It follows, and we have come to the clear conclusion,

that there is no evidence that Mr Duckenfield was wilfully

neglectful of his duty or was culpable so as to have committed

the offence of culpable misfeasance.



91. - We conclude that there is no sufficient evidence of any

criminal offence having been committed by Mr Duckenfield.



Police Constables Smith and_Illij3gwgrth

92.    We note the complaints made against these two officers

who were stationed on the perimeter track at gates 3 and 4

respectively and we have considered the interviews of bo

There is conflicting evidence in the case of each as to how he

reacted and when each gate was opened (see the West Midlands

 Report Part VII at pp 252 to 259) and in the case of Smith

 there is substantial doubt as to whether he pushed spectators,

 including the complainant Hendry and an unidentified boy, back

 into the crowd and if so when, ie whether before or after he

 had appreciated the true nature of the disaster.



 93.    There is no evidence before us that either of these

 officers was guilty of manslaughter or culpable misfeasance,

 and we advise that the allegations made against them be

 investigated further and if appropriate pursued in

 disciplinary proceedings.




                                  37
94.   The balance of allegations against the other officers

mentioned In the West Midlands Report must likewise be a

matter for disciplinary proceedings.



95.   We therefore find no sufficent evidence to support

criminal proceedings of any kind against those per

mentioned in the West Midlands Report whom we have not found

it necessary to identify in this Opinion.

                      NINTH DAY'S PROCEEDINGS

                       FRIDAY   26 TH MAY,      1989

                         (Afternoon Session )

                Cross-examined by MR. WOODWARD (cont.)


Mr. Duckenfield before I go to the major incident I am
asked to c o r r e c t something that was put to you this
morning in relation to tal.c-through, do you follow? -
A.   Yss   3 i r .

Talc-through is not a particular channel, it is a
particular facility that is available for different
channels. - A. Yes sir.

And one can switch to if, and then while you areoperating
on   that channel it exists for all who possess radios who
are listening and using them.     The major incident I was
going to ask you about, do you have with you volume 2 on
the South Yorkshire documents?     - A. Yes sir.

I am aoinci to ask. you simply about the procedure, the
major"incident manual is found after tab 24, and if we
look at section :4 there it says 'Ths Alert1 do y o u have
it? - A. Yes.

                "If notification is received, the
                information must be passed immediately
                to the Force Operations Room who will
                alert the ocher emergency services that
                a major incident may have occurred and
            •:! that -th'e Police are implementing the .: -v.       :-
     a■
      ..        major incident plan."                  u.             ..

So according to that, once the alert has been raised then
Force Operations have a-role to fuliil.  — A. Yes sir.

And; if .one goes :to 'section 7, page l.of. tnat, a \few .pages
further on, entitled "Force Operations Room"., doe; it
there identify, amongst the responsibilities of the
Operations Room, at B, the function and task of alerting
the emergency services and other autnorities and depart­
ments whose facilities and expertise will be needed.         - A.
Yes sir.

 So once this procedure is set in train, for example by
 communication from someone such as yourself, what
 responsibility or role do you then have in calling for
 those services?  - A. I don't have any, sir, they are all
 with Force Operations Room.

Q. A ooint was put to you concerning the number of Police
   Off icars who aopaared on tn e oitcn co torrn toe cordon,
   yestardav, and in relation to those Officers who appeared
   on the pitch to form the cordon right across it after the
   ■incident had become apparent is if your understanding
   that those Officers will have come from within the ground,
   from the Force already on site as it were? - A. I can'c
   be accurate in that reply sir.

Q. It is unlikely isn't it that they have come from
   'Operation Support1? - A. I would think so.

Q. Now may I ask you, not in great detail, but a little abouc
   the events of that day.  The build-up of people outside
   the turnstiles in the numbers and throng that, we sea or.
   the tapes, was that something that you had anticipated
   occurring?     A. I had anticipated a football crowd
   gathering, yes sir.

Q. Had you anticipated the sort of difficulties that the
   Officers there experienced?  - A. No sir.

Q. Did there come a.time when you asked for assistance to come
   from reserve within the stadium? — A. Yes sir.

Q. Do you remember what time that was or not?                   —      A. No sir.

Q. That- was to g e t . reserves to go to gate. A, Serial 20 I
   think was one of ./the serials that turned up.      - ..A. Yas
   sir .

Q.    Ara you aware that that serial was        unable immediately to
     get ouc of gate A?   - A. Yes sir.

Q. Were vou-.aware at the time?         -   A. N.o ’
                                                   .sir..       :

Q. Are- y o u . -av^ars .-.that in fact the-gate was:: locked-and.- it'.was-
   a little while before the gate was undone to enable those
   serials to get out?           - A. No sir, I wasn't aware of that.

Q.    Because -Lt has -been .put to you that: .tlt&rsr. were’.linas of
     O-f-ficsrs. iaside.gate A waiting to receive people who wer.e
     going to be let in, do you follow? - A. Yes sir.

Q.   Was that something you had arranged for or not?                      -   A. jno

from what has been said today I did sir. My concerns war
that 54 ,000 oeo.ole 'could cause massive disorder if they
were angry about my, or the Police Service, actions, and
Hil.ls'borough Stadium is .near a’ park, .=. shopping centra-'an
privet a., housing-,.. and I needed hot only -.the.-sscaoe.. routes
to be opened - I say "escape routes", for ambulances and
emergency services, but it the media or anyone told the
truS* st6‘£y initially I could have a major public disorder
hot so much in the ground but around it.

I follow that thinking but what I am concerned about is
that you appear to have conveyed the impression as part
of not telling what actually had happened, that it was
the breaking down of a gate by the fans that had actually
caused the trouble.  That is what the media picked upland
that is what the media broadcast? - A. When I was m that
Control Room, very difficult, very tense situation, and
vou have seen the size of the Control Room and from ti.e
pitch you have seen the difficulties that we were facing.

Chief S u p e r i n t e n d e n t , I don't want to interrupt you buu
that is not an answer to the question? - A. I know, 1 am
coming to the point.                Tl>§re were many people asking
questions of me.              There were many people wanting decisions
and the-opening and the closing o f that door.                  Mr. Kelly
came in with Mr. Mackrell, another person wanting an ^
immediate 'answer to -a difficulty and I was ^in the midst o^.
other things.            I tried as best I could to deal with my
own -situation satisfying my policing needs with the crowc
and in- some ways, this may seem unusual, being polite uC
Mr. Kelly and saying:                 "Look, this is .the .situation , in .
whatever words I said it and hoping he would leave me
very quickly so that I could get on with the matter m nana.

The only reason I am asking you this -is that in the light
cf your answer to Mr. Woodward, I am wondering why you
thouaht it would be less likely to lead to disorder to
tell "the true position than to imply that it was the . a u k ^
of the fans-.- Some might say o r ;might .think tha.t, that ;wpula
be more-likely to create disorder? - ft.. Sir,,.- with. Hindsight..-.,
todav- -we ean all lapk                 that situation.: -.I; actea
as I* believed to be correct in a crisis moment.       .

        MR. COLLINS:      Yes, very well.

           MR.' HYTNER-. ' ;May I just correct something^Mr. Collins
h a s'"p lit- ;-&ee-au’
                      s e it may, not be ab s o Iute 1y. .a c c u r a t e . ,>

      '-•>?he- impression-I have from the vast number; ofr....st.ate;
                                                                    r
          Knat t have read and from the evidence that nas been
 qZ e n    Ts t L t tie hostility o£ the fans after the .natch
 towards the Police was in large part, certainly in l a r g e ^
 part- and-may-‘have been in sole part, due to their perception
 of what- the P o l i c e -were doing on th« pitch ana.cn the tr&c*.

           MR. COLLINS:     Yes, I am obliged.  I think that may
 well be right and although I think it was a combination
 of the two and actually those who listened to that video
 a little later will hear, I think we all heara on the _
 television, fans with tickets complaining tnat the Police
 h a d o o e n e d the gate and let them in to tne overcrowcea
 oJn, so I thin* it is fair to say it is a combination o.
 pen
 both.

him      the full picture at that time.

Did you mention that the gate had been opened; thau ians
 had got in through an open gate? - A. I can't be s pe c i n c ,
my Lord.' I must have mentioned about the situation on tne
 pitchr ana briefly what had occurred, I mean about the first
 cate opening, but the full details including the actions
 by S u p e r i n t e n d e n t .M a r s h a l 1 and what had fully developed,
'I did not give him the full picture.

You did not tell him that you had given authority for the
gate to be opened? - A. No, my Lord.

Wei 1 wh-v -not?- - Aoart from anything else, it might, have.,been
h e l p f u l " t o have -his advice or discuss -with him. .what.it-was . .
best to say a t tha-t- -stage with a- view .to^tel-ling the Club
and so on? - A. Yes, my Lord, but I didn. t.

            LORD JUSTICE TAYLOR:         Yes.   thank you-

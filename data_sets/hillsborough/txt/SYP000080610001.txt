                   I am a S er geant         in the S ou th Yor ks hi re Police Force at                           present working

                  Hill,     Sheffield.

                   On Saturday,         15th April         1989,     I performed duty at the Football

                  A s s o c i a t i o n Cu p S em i- Fi na l    m at ch between L iverpool an d N o tt i n g h a m

                  F or e st at the H i l l s b o r o u g h Football            Stadium,       Sheffield.

                   I paraded for duty at 0 9 3 0 that day at the Driving School,                                          B ri gh t si d e

                  Lane,     Sheffield,        from where,          together with other officers,                          I made my

                  way to H i l l s b o r o u g h   by Police         transport.

                  At    1000 that      day    I a t t e n d e d the briefing             given by Chief S up e ri n te n de n t

u n if or me d officers.        One    of these mobile           patrols was Serial             51,   call

sign       'Tango Six'     of w hi ch     I was    in charge.           The serial       consisted of

five    constables.

Our w ri t te n      instructions were          to patrol        the G renoside area,            paying

special a t t e n t i o n to      licensed      p r e m i s e s . My    immediate su pe rv is or y
                           p/
officer        was   Inspector Robinson.

After      the mai n briefing          I collected a personal                  radio,   meal    tickets

etc.    an d had a brief          con ve rs at io n with       Inspector R ob in s on as to our

expec te d duties         before      leaving H i l l s b o r o u g h to       patrol    in the G r en os id e

ar e a .

From approximately              1100 to     1445 hours we          paid       passing a t t e n t i o n to

public houses          in the G r en os id e area.          It is fair          to say that there was

very       little    evidence     of Liverpool         s upporters        drinking       in that a r e a and

the whole        period    passed without          incident.

It is       perhaps    pertinent       to note that         personal          radio    communications

from the ground were              often broken and            it was      obvious       that

c on ve rs at io ns were        being m is s ed as a result a l t h ou g h              I had no

ne c es s it y to contact G ro un d Control               during        the    period and to my

k no wlege      they never a t t e m p t e d    to contact me.

At about        1445 hours w e drove           down Foxhill            R oad and      parked near to

Wads 1ey Bridge R a il w a y S ta t io n with the                i nt ention of remaining             there

before       going    to C l a yw h ee l s Lane for meal at              1515.

Al mo st     immedi at el y     I heard S u p e r i nt e nd e nt Marshall             asking   for a gate

to be opened at L ep pi n gs Lane               end of the g r o u n d . There a p p e a r e d to be

some       confusion from Gr ou nd Control as                to w hi ch gate should be opened

an d the       increased u r ge nc y of the t r an s mi ss io ns               gave the     i mpression

that       there was a     crowd      problem outside          the L ep pi ng s Lane           turnstiles.
                                                                          a / 1^-70

was    still        very   congested w ith Liverpool                 supporters

and having           parked on Lepp i ng s Lane               I got out of the van to walk

towards        the turnstiles.             F ro m    reco ll ec ti on this would be about              1455

hours.

O n arrival          it a p p e a r e d that        the    problem heard over         the   radio had been

resolved and there seemed to be s ufficient                                officers     in the a rea to

cope w ith those suppo rt er s                  still milling a ro u nd so after a few

minu te s      I i nstructed my serial                    to return to the van and we then               left

the area.           I told Pc M o rg a n to go to C la yw h ee l s Lane where                   I intended

to a l lo w my serial              to start         their m ea lt im e at     1515 hours.      The m atch

had o bv i ou s ly         commenced and this               course of a c t i on   complied with our

w r it t e n    instructions         regarding mealing arrangements.

Alm os t       immedi at el y on our arrival                 at C l ay w he e ls Lane    I heard a radio

t ra n s m i s s i o n asking all          a v ai la bl e    personnel      to go straight away          to the

ground.        We    resumed       im me di at el y a n d \returned to Lepoinqs L a n e,               parked

near     the     river      bridge and        I wa lk ed towards           the turnstile area.          As    I

approached           the a rea      I saw about            12 people    laid out on the tarmac

roadway w hich             leads    from Leppings Lane              round the back of the S o u th

S t a nd a nd m ain entrance               of the ground.           They were      laid near     the

railings w hich form a b ou nd ar y to the                         river.    It was     i mmediately

ap pa r en t     that      they were       dead.      Some Police      officers were a l r e a d y being

used as a cordon to                 protect         the bodies.      I got mv serial         to assist        in

forming a human barrier                    betw ee n Liverpool         fans and the dead bodies.

T here was a lot of verbal                    abuse        being   d ir ec te d towards us by some

L iver pool         supporters.       At     the same        time some      injured fans

were    being brought              out from the ground and                 it was deci de d to      place

them on the opposite                 side     of the        roadway to the dead bodies.

I cons id er ed the           p ro te ct io n of the dead bodies to be of paramount

imporlanr.e and             c o- or d in a ti o n of those         injured was being         s up er v is e d by

In spector Sykes and other                    officers.        Doct or s    were tending most          of the
                                                                                                  PAGE      4
                                                                                                  S2487

injured and shortly a ft er w ar d s about 3 a mb ul a nc e s a r ri ve d                 in quick

succession.

The    nature         of the    roadway       is such that there         is only room for one

vehicle at a time               trave ll in g       nose to tail and as each a m bu la nc e

s to p pe d the        rear doors were being opened by fans and their                      friends and

relatives were              being    placed     in that a mb u la n ce   irrespective      of their

medical        condition.         V ai n a tt em pt s were being made          by some officers        to

rationalise            the use of each ambulance.

I recall a doctor who was                     rendering     first aid     complaining     that as an

am b ul a nc e a rr i ve d and stopped on the                roadway the nearest          casualty to

the    rear doors was             being    placed      in the vehicle        either   by relatives/

friends        or by police          officers without         concern for the         injuries    of that

ca sualty        compaired with others waiting                   to be conveyed to

hospital.            Inspector Sykes was             doing his    best to prioritise        the

casualties            but   because     of the narrow        roadway     it was almost      impossible

to achi ev e          success.

A number         of other       constables          had by now a r r i v e d at the scene and       the

cordon was            o b vi ou sl y a de qu a te    to protect    the bodies.

I left       the      cordon and found Pc Mo rg an an d             instructed him to fetch the

transit        van to the track are a at the                 rear of the L ep pings Lane

turn st il es with the              inten tion of using          the vehicle     to transport      some

of the       injured to hospital              as     it seemed there were        insufficent

a m b u l al n ce s    to cater      for the        casualties.

By the time Pc M o r g a n            returned to me wit h our Transit                van other

a mb u l a n c e s    had a r r i v e d and    it became     obvious     that my original

in te nt io n of t ra ns p or t in g          casualties     had been supe rs ed ed by events.

As    the a mb u la n ce       cleared     in front of us all          the    injured had been

removed to hospital                 leaving     only the dead bodies still             guar de d by the

cordon of Police               officers.       I e st imated there were         between    12 -• "18

bodies a l t h o u g h       I never a c t u a l l y    counted them.

the two of us           in the    vehicle,      the    rest of the serial               remaining         in the

roadway area with the              bodies.                                                           /

As we drove          past the d ir ectors         entrance we were stopped by PCI Addi so n

who a s k ed us to        convey him to H a m m e rt o n R oa d Police S ta ti on

w h i c h we did.

From    there we        returned to Leppings Lane where                    I was       rejoined by those

of my serial          who had not       got    involved       in other duties.            We then         parked

S up po r te r s    leaving the      ground and        returning       to their         coaches      parked      in

H al i fa x Road.       Apart    from the odd abus iv e            comment      they were m a in ly

orde rl y an d o b vi ou sl y       subdued by the events              of the_

                                  by S u p e r i nt e nd e nt ~         h a m/ w ho    invited us to have

a hot drink a nd sit a nd talk                 to a"~lulmber of         police        officers who         I

re co gn i se d were      from the B a r n s l e y area.         He   informed me that            they had

been on duty          inside     the ground on the            perimeter       track near the

railings where           it seemed most         of the Liverpool            supporters          had died.

The y were         o b vi ou sl y d i s tr e ss e d a nd he a sk ed me to sit with them and

 just     listen to their a cc ounts              of the      events     leading up to the

tragedy.       I remained at C l ay wh ee ls Lane              for about 20 minutes               doing this

before     recommencing a mobile               patrol     in the area.          Traffic was

still     very      congested an d      I found that we were               being stop pe d by Police

officers       on foot who        had off duty doctors an d nurses with them who

were    trying       to get     to the N o r t he r n General         Hospital         in an sw er       to a

request      for     their a t t en d an c e w hi ch had been broadcast                  over    local

radio.     We    escorted several         of them to the hospital             if they had their

own    cars or took them           in the       back of the       transit   if they were       on foot.

We    remained on general           mobile       patrol    in the a rea until about          1845

hours.     By this       time   traffic was        light and there were          few supporters

left    in the v ic inity of the ground.

I     returned       to C la yw h ee l s Lane    from where my serial        was stood       down.

I     booked off duty at           the Driving School, B ri gh t si d e Lane at          1900

hours.     In conclusion,          I feel       it nec es sa ry to    re-iterate      that    prior   to

the m a tc h     I had not w i t n e ss e d any       public      order   incidents    involving

supp or te rs        from either     team but      following my arrival          at the L ep pings

Lake    roadway area at about             1505 hours to form the             cordon of       police

officers        surrounding       the   bodies     I was    sub je ct ed to more      verbal abuse

from L iverpool          suppo rt er s who were        ob vi ou sl y the worse for drink            than

I     have ever w it n es s ed      in 26 years       police service.



I     think     it   is fair    to say that        if the   circu ms ta nc es      had been different

numerous arrests would have                 been made       but    I am convinced that         such

a c t io n w ould have        inf lammed an a lr e ad y difficult and d istressing

s it u at i on and w ould only have been counter                    productive.    For   that    reason

and    for that        reason only those          involved were       politely

but    firmly told to move a wa y from the area.

                                                    PATHOLOGICAL ASPECTS OF THE DISASTER



                  My medical qualifications are MB, BS, FRC Path, DMJ (Clin et Path).                                                   J hav« been

                   in active practicc in forensic Pathology for almost thirty years and have been

                  Consultant Pathologist to the Home Office for South Yorkshire and the East

                  Midlands for twenty-five of those years.                                           During that time I have performed more

                   than twenty-six thousand post mortem examinations for Her Majesty's coroners and

                   have taken part in some seven hundred and sixty murder investigations.



                   1 have been asked by Mr Mervyn JONES, Assistant Chief Constable of the West

                   Midlands Police in charge of the Hillsborough Enquiry Tearn, to provide a genera]

                   overview of the pathological aspects of the Hillsborough disaster in which some

                   ninety-five persons were killed on the afternoon of Saturday, 15 April, 1989,

                   during a cup semi-final match.



                   I took part in the investigation of the deaths myself, being present at the

                   request of Her Majesty's coroner at Hillsborough Stadium on the evening of It?

                   April, 19B9, and at the Medio.o-r.egal Centre on Sunday, 16 April and Monday, 17

                   April.   I personally carried out nineteen of the ninety-five post mortems.                                                    The

                   other examinations were carried out by teams of pathologists working five or six

                   at a time in the mortuary of the Sheffield Medico-Legal Centre at Watery Street

                   - following the transfer of the bodies from the temporary mortuary in the

               gymnasium of the Sheffield Wednesday Football Ground.         Initially, I believe,

               some thirteen bodies were taken to the mortuary of the Northern General Hospital

               jn Sheffield, but later' they were removed from there and brought l,o the

               Medico-Legal Centro.       As far as I know, the only body autopsied at the Northern

               General Hospital was that or a Lee N1CHOL (body No 95), aged IA years, who

               survived, under treatment, until about 2 am on Tuesday, 18 April, and whose body

               was examined that same day by Dr Shirley HOLT, Consultant Pathologist at the

               Northern General Hospital, Herries Koad, Sheffield, S5 7AU          (Tel: 074? -

               434343).     The work at the Medico-Legal Centre was performed by five forensic

               pathologists and four clinical pathologists - ail of consultant status.            They

                 I can only speak in a detailed way of the nineteen examinations which I

                 personally carried out.    However, having read all ninety-five post mortem

                 reports and seen certain statements made by witnesses, I believe I can speak in

                 a general way about the pathological conditions which proved fat.al in the total

                 of ninety-five cases which were examined.        The details of individual cases will

                 need to be obtained from the pathologists who examined them, which is why their

                 naines and professional addresses, together with the body numbers, have been

                 provided above.

                 SEX

                 Of the ninety-five dead, eighty-eight were males and seven were females, which,

                 in my view, merely reflects the nature uf the occasion.




                 AGE

                 Of the ninety-five who died, the youngest was a 10 year old boy and the eldest a

                 GY year old man.

                   Thir'ty-eight persons (approximately 40%) were under 20 years of age

                   Thirty-nine persons (41%) were between 20 and 2 9 years of age

                   Twelve persons 0 3%) were between 30 and 39 years of age

                   Three persons (3%) were between 40 and 49 years of age

                   One person (1%) was between 50 and 59 years

                   Two persons (2%) were between 60 and 69 years old.

                   Seventy-seven of the ninety-five (81%) dead were below 30 years of age.

                 Again, I imagine these figures probably reflect the composition of the average

                 soccer crowd.



                 CAUSE OK DEATH

                 In virtually every case, the cause of death was basically compression of the

                 chest wall - against the bodies of the persons immediately around the deceased

                 or against fixed structures such as the walls of the stadium and the crash

                 barriers.   In the vast majority of the cases, this pressure caused the condition

                 of traumatic or crush asphyxia - the two terms are synonymous.



                 Asphyxia pathologically means some mechanical obstruction to normal breathing.

                 That obstruction may be caused in a variety of ways - by a hand across the nose

                 and mouth (suffocation), by a ligature tightened around the neck

                 (strangulation), by a bolus of food which sticks in the airways (choking), or by

                  a strong pressure upon the chest wall so that It becomes fixed and cannot move

                  in and out t o ’enable the person to draw breath.     Whatever the impedance to

                  respiration, the result is similar.       The oxygen in the air cannot be drawn into

                  the lungs and passed into the blood to be transported to the body tissues which

                  require it for their normal function.       The deoxygenated blood in the tissues

                  turns a dark colour, giving the victim's complexion a bluish or cyanotic hue.

                  The heart begins to rail and the walls of the smallest vessels (capillaries)

                  which are under pressure and themselves starved of oxygen, give way and allow

                  spurts of red cells to pass into the surrounding tissues where they show as tiny

                  pin-point haemorrhages (petechiae) in the loose skin around the eyes, on the

                  forehead and behind the ears as well as on many of the internal organs.       Thus, a

                  somewhat bloatd cyanotic appearance with external and internal petechiae arises.

                  If the impediment to breathing is not removed .in some four to six minutes -

                  perhaps less If the victim is struggling and thus using up oxygen at a higher

                  rate - then the brain cells cease to function, unconsciousness supervenes and

                  ultimately the vital, centres in the hind brain are damaged and die and then life

                  is no longer possible.



                  Appearances such as these were seen in almost every person who died at

                  Hillsborough, and in all      but nine    cases death was attributed solelyto traumatic

                  (or crush) asphyxia.     In   one case    (No 76)     the force compressing thechest was

                  (perhaps momentarily) so great that the rear surface of the breast bone almost

                  touched the anterior surface     of the spine,       nipping and splitting theaorta

                  between them so that the      man bled   to death    internally before he could be

                  asphyxiated.    Tn only eight other cases (Nos 3, ?7, 29, 48, 69, 91, 93 and 95)

                  were factors other than traumatic asphyxia thought to have even contributed to

                  the death, and in six of these eight, the contributory factor arose out of

                  trauma to the chcst, neck or head.       Tn the remaining two cases (3 and 6y) only,

                 truly natural disease was believed to be a significant contributory factor in

                 the death.



                 INHALATION OF VOMIT

                 Jn any form of asphyxia vomiting may occur before death arid because of

                 unconsciousness and the lack of the protective reflex mechanism, vomitus may be

                 aspirated into the lung3 , greatly increasing the likelihood of death.    Most

                 pathologists regard this vomiting as merely a f’acot of death from asphyxia and

                 though recording it in their post mortem reports, do not dignify it with a

                 separate heading in the cause of death.     This is my view and the one ] have

                 adopted in compiling the simple statistics for this report.     It has, however, to

                 be said that for- purely mechanical and obvious reasons, vomiting is more likely

                 to occur if the stomach is distended with food and/or drink and is subjected to

                 hard external mechanical compression.     Vomiting is also more likely to occur 3n

                 those persons intoxicated with a]coho3.



                 OTHKH INJURIES

                 In eighteen cases bones were broken - mostly ribs (thirteen cases), but in

                 addition the bones and/or cartilages of the Jarynx (voice box) were fractured in

                 three cases (4Y, t>J and 81) - perhaps suggesting that the throat of these

                 persons had been trodden on accidentally ie that they were on the ground when

                 they sustained that injury.



                 In only two cases were long bonea fractured.     In one of these cases (18), both

                 bones in a woman’s forearm were broken and in one (1]) a young boy's femur was

                 broken.   Both injuries could have occurred as the result of accidental

                 trampling.

                  In two eases impacts to the chest wall were so severe an to cause extensive

                  bruising to the underlying lungs, affecting the victim's ability to breathe and

                  in one of these the ribs were actually fractured and their ends tore the

                  underlying lung allowing air to escape from the lung into the chwst

                  (pneumothorax) and seriously adversely affect the victim's breathing.



                  In one case damage to the nose with subsequent bleeding allowed the inhalation

                  of blood into the lungs and this was thought to be a significant factor* in the

                  death.



                  As one would perhaps have suspected, a very high proportion of these bodies bore

                  superficial grazes and scratches - evidence of blunt impact against all manner

                  of solid objects such as walls, concrete flooring, barriers and fences. These

                  injuries are too numerous to be described or interpreted here and details should

                  be obtained in each individual case from the pathologist who actually performed

                  the post mortem (see above).



                  ALCOHOL

                  In discussing this matter, my impression is that the dead came mostly from the

                  front (ie near to the pitch) areas of the Leppings Lane end, from amongst

                  persons who had arrived early in order to get a good view and thus their blood

                  alcohols are not necessarily an indication of the alcoholic status of those who

                  arrived later and were pushing to get in at the Leppings Lane end of the ground.



                  No blood was taken from the victim who died last ie no 95, because of the

                  interval of time which had passed between the accident arid his death.

                  No alcohol was found in the bodies of any of the seven female victims.

                  Of the remaining eighty-seven men and boys, fifty-one (58%) were shown to have

                 nor more .than 10 mg% in their blood, which is negligible, but fifteen had more

                 than 80 mg% in their blood, which means they could not legally have driven a

                 car, and six had upwards of 120 mg% in their blood.      Six youths below the age of

                 18, who were not legally allowed to drink, had taken drink, of which group one

                 boy, aged l ’f year's, had a blood alcohol of 341 mg%, whilst a 15 year old had a

                 blood alcohol of' 56 mg%.



                 FYF HAEMORRHAGES

                 I have been asked to comment on the proposition that a distinction can be made

                 in this ease between those persons who died from traumatic asphyxia standing up

                 in the crowd and those dying from the same cause lying down.       The latter, it. is

                 said, will have petechial haemorrhages in their eyes whilst the former will not.

                 I have seen a very large number of cases of traumatic asphyxia and I am certain

                 that no such distinction can be made - both groups will in all probability have

                 petechial haemorrhages in their- eyes.



                 GENERAL COMMENT

                 The Hillsborough disaster occurred between 3 pm and 3.30 pm on Saturday, 15

                 April, 1989.     By 2 pm on Monday, 17 April, ie less than forty-eight hours later,

                 all ninety-four of the victims who were then dead had been examined post mortem

                 arid had a blood sample taken for analysis, so that their bodies were ready for

                 release to relatives.     I believe that several factors were responsible for this

                 feat:-



                   1.     The excellence of Her Majesty's Coroner's arrangements and Organisation.

                   2.     The immediate availability of the Football Club's gymnasium, sited just a

                          few yards from the pitch.   This huge room was easily corripartmwnlaliswd

                          into three large chamber’s, each invisible from the others.   One was used

as a mortuary for temporary body storage, One as a makeshift, canteen arid

f.he third as a reception area for relatives where they were greeted arid

assisted by padres of various denominations, social workers and

ancillaries.

The fact that the victim.?' bodies were not fragmented nor greatly

disfigured as might have happened in an explosion or an aircraft crash.

This meant that the Initial identification was possible from Polaroid

photographs taken by the police, which made the identificat.ion process

rapid and meant that relatives were generally required to view only one

body and were spared the harrowing task of entering the main mortuary and

searching for their dead.

The use of the facilities available at the Sheffield Medico-Legal Centre -

the only building of its kind in the United Kingdom.    This meant that in

one day it was possible for up to six teams of pathologists and their

assistants to work simultaneously in excellent conditions with modern

equipment so that they were able to perform seventy autopsies on Sunday

alone.    This building was designed with an emergency facility to deal with

disaster involving up to one hundred bodies, and when the disaster

arrived, the building worked well.   Sheffield City Council are to be

congratulated on their' provision of such a building.

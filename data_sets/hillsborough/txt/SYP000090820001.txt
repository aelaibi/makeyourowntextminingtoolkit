a r r i v e d at S h e f f i e l d about      11.30 am        <1130)     to    12 m \ < 1200)

B e ca u s e we were       e a rl y the six of us             i ncluding                                 w a l k e d to

a Public House           near       the ground for a drink and some food.                           I do not

know where         the bus      parked or the name               of the       pub we went        to.      On the

road to the         pub there was            loads of P ol ic e         on every street

corner,      there was        plenty of people a r o u n d              but    I did not see any

trouble.

We all     left the        pub at about 2.3 0            pm     <1430)    and s tar te d to walk

towards      the ground,            it took about        ten m i nu t es      to walk      to the ground.

I have     been to the ground before and knew w he re                            to make       for, and there

were    still P ol ic e along the route.

As    I w a l k e d a long L e p p in gs Lane towar ds             the g round the           crowd was           solid

all along,         and as     1 got riearel\to the ground                     it became worse.              The
                                                                                  roojwo
o n h t Police      I could see was two m o u n t e d O f fi c e r s              near the''outer blue

iron gafes,         and a Por^s^e officer              on the wall a bove              the t u r n s t i l e s

pulling      people      up and over          the wall        into the ground.             Although         it was

very busy there was                 no one    causing       any trouble.

All    six of us en te re d           the    crowd t ogethe r a nd tried to make                    our way

towards      the turnstiles.                B ecause                             and                      had

tickets      for    the L ep pi n g s Lane terrace               they    left us as we made our way

to the t u r n s t i l e s N f o r    the stand.

T here were        no q u e u e s    just a mass       of     people all   trying to get towards
                                                                         .
the turnstiles.             I $sas crushed but not                injured and there was shouts of

“Ease     it back."          I could hear           screams      from w o m e n a nd      c h il dr en    in the

crowd as       if they were           in a panic       because       of the      crush      I did not see

a nyone    injured       in the       crush.

We were      pushed towards            the    left hand side            of the t u r ns t il e s as you

look at the ground,                 this    being    the w ay we w a n t e d      to go to reach our

turnstile.          It took about            ten m in u t e s    I think to       reach the turnstile,
                                                                                                       PAGE        3
                                                                                                       S3508

and    I h anded my ticket         in to the gateman.                B ec a us e    I was     over    to the

left    I did not       see what    the m o u n t e d P ol ic e      offi ce rs were          doing as they

were over     towards      the    right of the turnstiles.

The    four of us all went          t hrough the t ur n st i le and s t ay ed                 together

beforeN^eaching         our seats.

Once    t hrough the t urnstile           it was       less      c ro wded a nd no        crush.      I was

glad to be      inside and out of the                crush,       but the    crush outs id e the

t u rnstile   I went      th ro ug h did not a ppe ar             to be as bad as further across

to the    right.

I w a l k e d a cross    the area      inside       the    t u rn st il e and to the steps w hi ch

lead to the stand at this               point a s t ew ar d         checked my ticket again.                   1

did not see any P ol ic e a r o u n d this area                   that    I can remember.             The four

^of us went up the steps and into the s ta nd at this time it was about
      5»^e<X(Z_<dl Kl S (-euvtSl .
 five to three (-1455).          The stand was very busy but we made our way to

our seats w h i c h w ere        empty.       Our    seats were          to the     left of the goal as

y ou   looks^at the      pitch and about half w ay down the stand.

I a t t e n d e d tine same m a tc h    last year w i t h m y son                    and I had a seat

in the same stand but                   was    in the L ep p in g s Lane            terrace.         After

     ____ |said to me that
this |                                 he was       never going          to go     into that       terrace

again,    this was       because    of the       crush he said            it was     terrible.          His

words    to me were       " T h e r e ’s going      to be m u r d e r     in there        s o me ti me ."

Once    into my seat       1 cannot       remember         seeing    the    players        out on the

pitch but my a t t e n t i o n was        drawn to         people at the front               of the stand

pulling    people       up from the terrace               into    the stand.

I remember     the game       kicking      off a nd the s tand was                 very    crowded with

people    coming up from the terrace.                      I could also see that                the terrace

in L e p p in gs Lane     under    our stand was            very    crowded,        just a solid mass


of p e o p l e '    Courts
I remember Peter B E A R D S L E Y hitting                the    cross    bar,     a nd the next thing             I

saw people      climbing      over the perimeter                 fence    onto the        pitch.      I did
                                                                                                   P A GE           4
                                                                                                   S3503

not see more         of the game my a t t e n t i o n was d ra wn to the terrace area,

a nd   p a r t i cu la rl y to one     lad aged a bout        16 to 20 years who was             ripping

at the      perimeter     fence as       if he was       trying      pull    it down    I saw a

Policeman       pull    the y outh off the fence a nd                I lost sight       of him,

I realised then that             there was a serious             prob le m and saw people             lying

on the      pitch    injured or dead,            I saw one       person      I do not know       if it

was a lad or girl          but    they put a coat over               the body and       I real is ed the

pers on was      dead.     A person behind me had a radio and he told me that

it had said on the           radio      that    six    people had died.

I saw several          lads w it h hoardings           carrying      people a c ro ss    the    pitch but

I could not get down from the stand to help.                            My a t t e n t i o n was drawn

to a group of y ouths who               chased a p h ot o gr a ph e r       to the o ther end of the

pitch.

F ro m my    position     I was       too far from the         pitch to       iden ti fy a ny bodies,

but    I was    trying    to see                 and           who    I knew were       in the terrace

area,    but    I did not see tms^n

It a p p e a r e d to me that         the Police       reacted    very s l ow l y to the        s it ua t io n

a nd were treating          it like a pitch            invasion.       Some    of them were giving

m o u t h to mouth,      I remember a Police W o m a n giving m o u th to m o u th but a

lot of them were          just    standing around.             The only bit of o r g a n i s a t i o n          I

saw from the P ol ic e was w h e n they all m a r c h e d on acro ss                    the    pitch.       I

cannot      the Fire S er v i c e att en di n g        but   I did see an a m b u l a n c e     on the

pitch.

I h eard an a n n o u n c e m e n t    that    the game      had been p os t po n ed a nd there was

so m uc h going on,         I think      I was    in a daze,         really a nd s t ay e d     in the

stand a good while.              I d o n ’t know e xa c t l y how        long.    I was       still

trying      to see               dnd            but    could not see them.

We de ci de d to go back          to the       coach and made         our way down the steps

into the a re a b ehind the stand,                I did not       see a ny     injured or dead

people      in this area.

             We got back to the bus               I do not know the time                 but after what          seemed an

             e t e r n i t y a nother    lad who      had t r a v e ll e d on the bus told me that he had

             seen               and             on the     pitch a nd they were            ok.       He also     told me

             that he had phoned home.

                        and             cams    back to the bus              later and we were all           then

             conc erned about           two young       lads who were missing,                 they did not turn up

             but     later f ound out          they were alright.

             We then made         our w ay back        to Liv er p oo l        from w here      I t e l e p h o n e d home.

                        was     in pain on the          coach and had to stand up,                   he c om pl a in e d of

             pain a ro un d the         ribs.

             After     this     I went    home a r r i v i n ^ a f a o u t    7.30 pm    (1930).       The Poli ce

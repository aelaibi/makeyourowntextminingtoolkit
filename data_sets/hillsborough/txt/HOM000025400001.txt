Dear Mr Entwistle

This letter follows up your exchange of correspondence with the
Hillsborough Inquiry which, as you know, was copied to us for
information.

I quite understand your concern about the effects of safety
requirements on small, non-league football clubs whose fixtures
attract only a few hundred spectators.         Although I cannot
authoritatively interpret the Interim Report recommendations,
Home Office Circular 68/1989 sent to local authorities and police
forces with a copy of the Report did make the point that we felt
the recommendations were aimed primarily at football league
clubs. I enclose a copy of that Circular for your information.
Your attention is drawn to paragraph 4 of the Circular which, as
you would expect, also draws attention to the need for
consideration   to    be     given to the   application  of   the
recommendations eisecchere-.

Police operational arrangements are a matter for the Chief
Constable.    I cannot say therefore how far the interim
recommendations relating to the policing of football grounds can,
or should, be applied to Twerton Park when it is used for
non-league fixtures.    Similarly, responsibility for terms and
conditions of the safety certificate rests with the local
authority (Avon County Council) who must decide whether it would
be right to build into the safety certificate additional
conditions on policing/stewarding for certain types of fixture.
Existing advice from the Home Office to local authorities does
allow for this (Home Office Circular 7/1986 refers) and I enclose
for your information a copy of the relevant extract from Annex C
to that Circular.

I am copying this letter to both Avon County Council and the
Chief Constable of Avon and Somerset Police. I am also copying
this letter to the Hillsborough Inquiry.

                                                         Yours sincerely

       Dear Sir/Madam

       HOME OFFICE CIRCULAR 68/1989

       INTERIM REPORT OF THE HILLSBOROUGH INQUIRY
       Introduction
       The Interim Report of the Inquiry set up by the Home Secretary
       into the tragic events at Hillsborough football ground Sheffield
       on 15 April has now been published. A copy of the Report is
       attached.  Further copies are available from HMSO bookshops.

       2.   The purpose of this circular is to inform recipients of the
       contents of the Report and to urge them to take required action
       without delay in order to implement, as necessary, the Inquiry's
       recommendations to improve safety arrangements at sports grounds.
       Government response

       3.   The Home Secretary has welcomed the thoroughness of the
       Report and its recommendations which he believes should be dealt
       with without delay pending the longer term findings of the
       Inquiry which will be published in its Final Report.

      As regards the scope of a general safety certificate, section 2(5) of the
Act provides that different terras and conditions may be included for different
activities.     Although, therefore, a stadium may be in regular use only as a foot­
ball ground, in cases where it is also used firora time to time to stage other

events it would be desirable, and in many cas 2 S obviate the need for special
safety certificates, if the terras and conditi jns appropriate to those events were
to be included in the general certificate.      I ; is suggested that any such events
for which it is considered desirable to provi ie might conveniently be divided into
2 classes


      1.    those sufficiently similar in chara ;ter to the main purpose of the
      stadium for the normal terms and conditi 3ns to be equally applicable;


      2.      those of a fundamentally different character, eg boxing matches, pop
      concerts, etc which may involve all or part of the playing area being given
      over to     spectator accommodation and for which separate terms and conditions
      will have to be devised..    It' is. not, of/course, necessary to provide for
      these contingencies in cases where no clear need is foreseen by the stadium

      authorities.                              I


7.    There may also be circumstances in which the terms and conditions applicable
 to the normal activity of the stadium may be found to be inappropriate, eg when a
 special event, such as a cup tie or a "local Derby", is expected vo attract signi­
 ficantly more than the usual attendance.      In the'case especially of cup re plays
 these special events may arise with only a few days' notice, within which it would
 not be possible to accommodate the whole of the statutory procedure appropriate to
 the grant of a special safety certificate .     In order to overcome this difficulty,
 it would seem desirable for the local authorities and stadium authorities to seek
 to work out in advance the modifications to the normal terms and conditions which
 might be appropriate to such occasions, eg the admission of increased numbers to
 certain areas on the condition that extra stewards and police are employed, that
 notice is given to the local authority, and so on, and to provide for their
 incorporation in the general safety certificate.


 8.    Once a general safety certificate has b^en issued, subject to the determina­
 tion of any appeal, the terms and conditions can be varied only by formal amend-
 ment of the certificate, which may be at the initiative either of the holder of
 the certificate or of the local authority (see section 4(2) of the Act) and will

 presumably reflect changes in circumstances o Dcurring since the grant of the

Thank you for your letter of 12 December.   In so far as you are
making points which you would like Lord Justice Taylor to bear in
mind in the course of the second part of his Inquiry, I can show
him your letter, and.I know he will note what you say. But the
application of recommendations in Lord Justice Taylor's Interim
Report is not a matter for him, neither in general nor in an
individual case.  So far as the proposal in the last two
paragraphs of your letter is concerned, you must take it up with
those concerned with your arrangements locally.   I am, however,
copying your letter and my reply to those in the Home Office who
are concerned with safety of sports grounds, for information.

       12 December 1989


      Dear Sir,

      A PLEA ON BEHALF OF MINOR CLUBS


      IvWrite/ ° makS reP resentati°ns on behalf of a small number of little clubs
                      V0S/ n an invidious Position because of the implementation
         certain recommendations in your Interim Report. May I explain the
      problem by quoting the case of Bath City Football Club as an example.

      THE FACTS

       1. We own the freehold of our ground, Twerton Park, Bath, where we play all
          our home matches.                                                  y

      2. We have issued a licence to Bristol Rovers Football Club, who are
         members of the Third Division of the Football League, to play their
         home matches at Twerton Park.

      3. Twerton Park is a designated ground and has a Safety Certificate for a
         total occupancy of 9800.

      4 ‘ ! ^ - t0i'R°VerS arS resP°nsible for implementing the recommendations at
          T h .Qr °me matches which are normally attended by 5000/6000 spectators.
          This causes no problems.

      5. Bath City Football Club is a member of the Premier Division of the
         Southern League (known as the Beazer Homes League).

      6 * 700   a "te n d a n C !   at   B ath   C lty 's    h o m e League matches varies between 500 and
          accommodate^SOO.° f SPeCtat°rS is "l0St" in *                                            that can safely




                                                                                                           /continued.

12 December 1989




7. At these home League matches we get very few "away" supporters and
   there has never been any need for segregation. All spectators enter
   through the same turnstiles and are free to go to any part of the
   terraces including the "segregation pens" (see 8. below).
8. At the western end of the ground, behind the goal, there are two
   "segregation pens" with perimeter fencing and having a total approved
   capacity of 3000, i.e. approximately 1500 each. These were provided
   to cope with Bristol Rovers matches.
9. At Bath City's home League matches the maximum number of spectators
   observed to be occupying these "pens" is 70 in total. Mostly, the
   number is less than this.

THE PROBLEM

This can be summed up as the rigid application of the recommendations
to all designated football grounds without regard to the nature of the
matches played there or the number of spectators attending those matches.
The best examples of this are recommendations 5 and 9 in Chapter 24 of
the Interim Report.

The Avon and Somerset Constabulary inform us that if any spectators are
allowed into the "segregation pens" (even though the two sets of supporters
are not being segregated and all gate's of the "pens" are open) , then they
must have a police presence there with radio contact to a police-manned
control room. The declared objective of such police officer(s) is to
relieve overcrowding.But at Bath City's home League matches they would be
dealing with no more than 70 spectators in an area approved for 3000. The
police inform us that the recommendations give them no discretion in the
matter and that they are bound to insist on this police presence even if
there is only one spectator in the area. Common-sense dictates that this
cannot have been the intention of the recommendations.

Provision of police officers in   the circumstances indicated above would
represent a lamentable waste of   police manpower. It would also impose an
unnecessary financial burden on   minor clubs who are struggling to keep
their heads above water on very   small gate receipts.

It would be possible to seal off the "segregation pens" for Bath City's
matches so that spectators are not allowed into that area. However, we
consider this to be quite unnecessary. Moreover, it would create another
problem. At our level of football it is traditional for a small group of
supporters to gather behind the opposing team's goal and, at half-time,
to change over to the other end. It is common practice throughout our
League and has never caused any problems. We fear that if such a facility
were banned at our ground this would create resentment and a loss of goodwill
on the part of other clubs who are able to permit free movefnent.




                                                                  /continued
12 December 1989                                                           3.




THE PROPOSAL

The requirement to make attendance at football matches completely safe
has the wholehearted support of Bath City Football Club. On those rare
occasions when we have had a special match with a much larger attendance
than usual we have taken all the appropriate steps. For example , we
recently had a home match with Fulham in the first round of the F.A.Cup
and the attendance was 4283 - a much larger gate than we have had at any
match for many years. With the co-operation of Bristol Rovers the full
recommendations of the Interim Report were met.

However, we submit that with regard to our run-of-the-mill League matches,
the recommendations represent a "steam hammer to crack a nut". We believe
that, understandably, having regard to the time available, they were drawn
up primarily with the larger Football League clubs in mind. But their rigid
application to the "minnows" would result in hardship to these clubs and a
waste of police time and effort.

We propose that there should be a dispensation,suspending the application
of the recommendations , in all cases where the attendance is either less
than 25% of the total Safety Certificate limit or below a fixed number of
2000, whichever is the lower.

We have reason to believe that a proposal along these lines would have the
support of our local police and safety authorities and we submit this for
your earnest consideration.

Yours faithfully,




F.A.Entwistle

       12 December 1989


       Dear Sir,

       A PLEA ON BEHALF OF MINOR CLUBS

       I write to make representations on behalf of a small number of little clubs
       who find themselves in an invidious position because of the implementation
       of certain recommendations in your Interim Report. May I explain the
       problem by quoting the case of Bath City Football Club as an example.

       THE FACTS

       1. We own the freehold of our ground, Twerton Park, Bath, where we play all
          our home matches.

       2. We have issued a licence to Bristol Rovers Football Club, who are
          members of the Third Division of the Football League, to play their
          home matches at Twerton Park.

       3. Twerton Park is a designated ground and has a Safety Certificate for a
          total occupancy of 9800.

       4. Bristol Rovers are responsible for implementing the recommendations at
          their home matches which are normally attended by 5000/6000 spectators.
          This causes no problems.

       5. Bath City Football Club is a member of the Premier Division of the
          Southern League (known as the Beazer Homes League).
      6. The attendance at Bath City's home League matches varies between 500 and
         700. This number of spectators is "lost" in a ground that can sJLfely
         accommodate 9600.




                                                                                                /continued.
12 December 1989                                                             2.




7. At these home League matches we get very few "away" supporters and
   there has never been any need for segregation. All spectators enter
   through the same turnstiles and are free to go to any part of the
   terraces including the "segregation pens" (see 8. below).
8. At the western end of the ground, behind the goal, there are two
   "segregation pens" with perimeter fencing and having a total approved
   capacity of 3000, i.e. approximately 1500 each. These were provided
   to cope with Bristol Rovers matches.
9. At Bath City's home League matches the maximum number of spectators
   observed to be occupying these "pens" is 70 in total. Mostly, the
   number is less than this.

THE PROBLEM

This can be summed up as the rigid application of the recommendations
to all designated football grounds without regard to the nature of the
matches played there or the number of spectators attending those matches.
The best examples of this are recommendations 5 and 9 in Chapter 24 of
the Interim Report.

The Avon and Somerset Constabulary inform us that if any spectators are
allowed into the "segregation pens" (even though the two sets of supporters
are not being segregated and all gate^ of the "pens" are open), then they
must have a police presence there with radio contact to a police-manned
control room. The declared objective of such police officer(s) is to
relieve overcrowding.But at Bath City's home League matches they would be
dealing with no more than 70 spectators in an area approved for 3000. The
police inform us that the recommendations give them no discretion in the
matter and that they are bound to insist on this police presence even if
there is only one spectator in the area. Common-sense dictates that this
cannot have been the intention of the recommendations.

Provision of police officers in   the circumstances indicated above would
represent a lamentable waste of   police manpower. It would also impose an
unnecessary financial burden on   minor clubs who are struggling to keep
their heads above water on very   small gate receipts.
It would be possible to seal off the "segregation pens" for Bath City's
matches so that spectators are not allowed into that area. However, we
consider this to be quite unnecessary. Moreover, it would create another
problem. At our level of football it is traditional for a small group of
supporters to gather behind the opposing team's goal and, at half-time,
to change over to the other end. It is common practice throughout our
League and has never caused any problems. We fear that if such a facility
were banned at our ground this would create resentment and a loss of goodwill
on the part of other clubs who are able to permit free movement.




                                                                  /continued
12 December 1989                                                           3.




THE PROPOSAL

The requirement to make attendance at football matches completely safe
has the wholehearted support of Bath City Football Club. On those rare
occasions when we have had a special match with a much larger attendance
than usual we have taken all the appropriate steps. For example, we
recently had a home match with Fulham in the first round of the F.A.Cup
and the attendance was 4283 - a much larger gate than we have had at any
match for many years. With the co-operation of Bristol Rovers the full
recommendations of the Interim Report were met.
However, we submit that with regard to our run-of-the-mill League matches,
the recommendations represent a "steam hammer to crack a nut". We believe
that, understandably, having regard to the time available, they were drawn
up primarily with the larger Football League clubs in mind. But their rigid
application to the "minnows" would result in hardship to these clubs and a
waste of police time and effort.
We propose that there should be a dispensation,suspending the application
of the recommendations, in all cases where the attendance is either less
than 25% of the total Safety Certificate limit or below a fixed number of
2000, whichever is the lower.
We have reason to believe that a proposal along these lines would have the
support of our local police and safety authorities and we submit this for
your earnest consideration.

Yours faithfully,




F.A.Entwistle
Chairman

        Dear Mr Baden

        FOOTBALL LICENSING AUTHORITY BUSINESS PLANS

        As requested I attended a meeting at the FLA on Friday 5 June
        with John De Quidt (FLA) and Peter Lee (Football Trust).      The
        purpose of the meeting was to discuss the progress being made by
        Premier League and Football League clubs in going all-seater in
        the light of those Business Plans which have so far been returned
        to the FLA.

        A summary of the returned Business Plans (in table form) had been
        distributed beforehand and formed the basis of the meeting,
        although many clubs had not yet returned them.
        During the meeting the following points were made:

        1 . Progress towards all-seating amongst the Premier League clubs
        is generally good. However, Alan Sugar, Chairman of Tottenham,
        is apparantly spreading his opinion that the Government will back
        down on the all-seater requirement for Premier League clubs.

        2. It seems likely that Southampton will not have been able to
        relocate to a new ground in time to meet the 1994 deadline
        despite making the effort to do so. Whilst they would not wish
        to inform Southampton of any decision to grant them an extension
        to the deadline for at least another year, the FLA will be
        looking for guidance from DNH as to what dispensation they should
        grant in such cases.

        3. Of the clubs in the new First Division who have yet to return
        their Business Plans, several are making good progress and the
        FLA do not envisage them having trouble in meeting the 1994
        deadline (1995 in the case of the three newly promoted clubs).

        4.   Several    clubs in the new First Division are hoping to
        relocate but    have no definite plans to do so such as Bristol
        Rovers, Luton   and Watford. It appears increasingly unlikely that
        relocation is   a viable option for these clubs in time for 1994.
        5.   Grimsby    Town   appear   to    have       had       problems      with   their


S 363
certifying authority under the Safety of Sports Grounds Act 1975.
The FLA consider the ground to be in a very poor condition, due
more to the failure of Humberside County Council rather than any
fault of the club. Barnsley, however, appear to be refusing to
go all-seated on principle. The FLA are geared up to making an
example of them if need be.

6. The FLA would advise the DNH not to write to those clubs in
the new First Division that have yet to return their Business
Plans with a reminder that they are expected to comply with the
1994 deadline.    The FLA consider this to be their area of
responsibility and argue that any clubs which did not receive a
letter would consider themselves to have been let off the all-
seater requirement. The FLA will, however, chase up those clubs
in the top two Divisions who have yet to return their Business
Plans.

7. It was agreed that there was little point in chasing up those
clubs in the new Divisions Two and Three who had yet to return
their Business Plans. They would be unlikely to do so until the
outcome of the Government's review of the all-seater policy had
been announced.

8!   T.he assumPtion of the meeting was that clubs in the new
Divisions Two and Three would not be required to go all-seater.
John De Quidt therefore focussed more on the general standards
of safety that exist at these grounds rather than on the progress
they are making in going all-seated.

9. The general picture for the lower divisions is as one would
expect, with many clubs having poor grounds and poor finances.
The grounds at Bournemouth, Doncaster and Wigan were identified
as being in particularly poor condition. In addition four clubs
were considered by the FLA to be in very severe financial
difficulties: Doncaster, Maidstone, Northampton and Wigan.

10.  Chester had demonstrated their intentions not to go all-
seater by their decision to build a new 6,000 capacity ground,
including terrace space for 3,000.       One bright spot was
Huddersfield who were intending to relocate with Huddersfield
RLFC to a new purpose built 20,000 capacity ground.

The FLA are concerned that they have lost credibility due to the
recent announcement that the Government is to review the all-
seater policy.    They are keen that any announcement on the
outcome of the review should be accompanied by a statement that
clubs not required to go all-seater will have to improve the
standard of their terracing.   I informed John de Quidt that I
envisaged that this would happen.

                                    Yours sincerely



                                    STEVE BILBE

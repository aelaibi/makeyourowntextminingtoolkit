           I am                                    of the above address.

           On Saturday 15 April             1989    (150489),     I went to Sheffield for the

           football match between Nottingham Forrest and Liverpool Football

           Clubs which took place at the Hillsborough F o o t b a l 1 Grot

           I am,      in fact, a Liverpool           s>tpporter and went to                field with my
                              n> 7 <sn                                                       7^ 5
           brother,                            4 n d brother-in-law,                                  We

           each had a £6 ticket / or the Leppings Ln standing area which we

           bought from the A-fff ie 1 d g r o u n d .

           We travelled to Sheff/eld by an independently organised coach from

           ’Barnes T ra v e l ’, Ccyfinty Rd, Walton,             Liverpool     4.     The coach no was

           41.       En route to The ground we did not stop.                    We were     checked by the

           police officers before we started off for anyone who had any beer.

           When we arrived in Sheffield,                on the outskirts?            we were again checked.
                                                                                      PAGE        2
                                                                                      S436

En route to the ground we did not experienoe any abnormal                       delays.

Ones    that did occur we re usual traf f i cymii Id ups.

At about         1.30 pm (1330),    1.40 pm (i^40), we arrived and parked near

some factories         in,    I think,   Wheels Ln.     We left the coach and walked

to a nearby supermarkert, 'Gatew ay *, 1ooking for a d r i n k .                           went

into the store and boughtyabout a dozen cans of beer and lager.                           We

then went to a nearby g^ass bank where there were other groups of men

also drinking from c^fis.            I would say there were between 30 to 40 men

dr ink i n g ,

After a short time we'd finished the beer and made our way towards

the ground, down Leppings Ln, arriving there at about 2.35 pm <1435).

As we made our way towards the ground I did not see any police giving

directions or any escorts to the fans.                 Police were       in the area but

did not really need to direct the fans because                      it seemed as though

most knew where it was,            I did.    I did not see any fighting between

where we parked the coach and the ground.                   Some fans were drinking

and were singing,            enjoying themselves^/lbut not really being

disorder ly , they were only a mi norjfty.

As we were approaching the g r o u m you could see a steady crowd going

in the same direction.             As war got to the entrance you could only see

a mass of bod ies , a crowdj/ v e r y d i s o r g a n i s e d .    People w e r e pushing,

trying to find a way injf> their             part of the ground.           1 made my way at

first into thl West SCand seating turnstiles.                      As   I neared them I

realised I was\hej|*fing in the wrong directy^n so I turned back.                         It

was quite a struggle to get to the r ight Jturnsti l e s .

I do remember seeing 4 or 5 mounted pojn.ce outside a pair of closed

blue gates which were the entrance t # the terrace t u r n s t i l e s .             These

horses we r e , in f a c t , spread out alp about the Leppings Ln area and

were trying to get some order                   the crowd b u t , be cause of the mass

of people,        they weren't having much effect.                I also saw some

          but it was almost      impossible,        1 aduld see through a crack       in the

          gates that,    on the other s ide -^p,here was another         crowd of people also

           involved in a crush,      pushi xyj towards the turnstiles.           I could not see

         , any stewards anywhere         injfide or outside these qates.

Y         After a short time thfie gates opened and I was               carried forward in a

          rush of supporters J*nto the back of the crowd already by the

          turnstiles. V I wjp about 3 yards from a wall              I would say was about           12

          to 14 foot    < 12' ~ 14') tall.         I could see people , m e n , youths and

          boys, were being pushed up onto the top of the wall                 to get out of the

          crush.     I saw a boy, aged between 8 and 1 1 , very distressed,               crying,

          picked up off the ground and lifted up onto the top of the wall.

          As the crowd continued to become more dense,               people were pushing and

          shoving to get air to breath.             There were qutie a few that       I could

          see,    between 6 and 12,      crying.     I thought   panic was setting     in.       This

          went on for about 5 minutes when,            all of a sudden,      a blue gate ne;;t

          to the turnstiles      slid open.        As it slid open,    the   crowd surged

          through,    it seemed as though people were            carried on a wave.       They

          and I were unable to control          our direction of travel.         I was,    in

          fact,    carried to the far end of the West Stand by area 6 which I got
                          T
          to by a t un nel .'

                                I got    into the jrompound at a b o u t 3.02 pm <1502) and

          could see the crowd in tHe^j^mer            compounds becoming more d e n s e .        I

          saw some of the supporters          being passed up into the seating stands

          with people    pulling them up.

          The gates    I entered,    the blue wooden ones before the turnstiles and

          the blue sliding one on the left of the turnstiles,                 are the only

          gates    I saw opened in an effort to avoid people getting hurt.

          Once    I got into the ground I had little trouble getting to the

          compound.     As I made /my way to the        compound,    I did not see any

          police.
                                     I
                      I did see a; couple of stewards by a refreshment stand and a

                                                                                           S456

         fan vomitt in g.       I don't know why he was being sick-           I d i d n ’t see

         anyone drinking.

         Once       in my compound I did not see ,jt*-trTcT’not see , anything specif i c

         taking place.

         As time went on I saw people being lifted up into the stands,,                   over

         railings and onto the pitch.             Forrest and Liverpool      fans worked

         together trying to help the            injured.    Police,    stewards,   also helped.

         A line of police were eventually set up across the pitch,                   I don't

         know why.        /

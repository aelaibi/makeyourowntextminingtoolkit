  NOTES
1 Modify this as necessary according to whether the
  inquest is held with or without a jury or partly
  with and partly without a jury.
2 In the case of a death from natural causes or from
  industrial disease, want of attention at birth, chronic
  alcoholism or addiction to drugs insert the immediate
  cause of death and morbid conditions (if any) giving                    Date              19
  rise to the immediate cause of death.
3 Omit this if the cause of death is one to which
  Note 2 applies.

4 a Where the cause of death is one to which Note 2
    applies, it is suggested that one of the following
    forms be adopted:
     C.D. died from natural causes.
                                                                          Re
     C.D. died from the industrial disease of

     C.D. died from dependence on drugs/non-dependable
     on drugs.
     C.D. died from want of attention at birth.
     (In any of the above cases, but in no other, it is
     suggested that the following words may, where
     appropriate, be added:
     "and the cause of death was aggravated by lack of                    Cause o f death
     care/self-neglect').

  b In any other case except murder, manslaughter,
    infanticide or stillbirth, it is suggested that one
    of the following forms be adopted:
     C.D. killed himself/herself (whilst the balance of
     his/her mind was disturbed).
     C.D. died as the result of an attempted/self­
     induced abortion.                                                    Verdict
     C.D. died as the result of an accident/misadventure.
     C.D. was killed lawfully.

     Open verdict, namely, the evidence did not fully or
     further disclose the means whereby the cause of death
     arose.
  c In the case of murder, manslaughter or infanticide
    it is suggested that the following form be adopted.

     C.D. was killed unlawfully.
  d In the case of a stillbirth insert 'stillbirth' and do not
    complete the remainder of the form.

           Dear Sirs,

           Re:    R E SU MED INQUESTS 19th N O V E MBER 1990.



           If you are not already aware, I intend to resume the Inquests into the deaths
           of the 95 pe ople w h o died at Hillsborough, one or mor e of w h o m you represent,
           on the 19th of No vemb er 1990 at 10.a.m.   Details of v enue w i l l be n o t i f i e d in
           due course.


           I do not have to remind you of the fact that a c o n sid era ble amount of
           evidence has already been taken, nor of the n a t u r e and limitations of a
           coronal i n v e sti gat ion w h i c h you will recollect is not a dv ersa ria l but
           i n q uisi tor ial in nature, and w h i c h of course has only limited objectives.

           Subject to the C o r o n e r s ’ Act 1988 and the C o r o n e r s ’ Rules, the Inquest is
           u n d e r my control, and in particular, it is m y r e s p o nsi bil ity to select the
           w i t n ess es w h o w i s h to give evidence.    I am at presen t engaged in consider ing
           this and in de ter m i n i n g w h o I w i s h to invite to attend.

           W i t h o u t p r e j u dice in any w a y to my rights in the matter, I am w r i t i n g to you
           to give you an o p po rtu nit y to d r a w to my a t t e n t i o n the names and other
           ap pro p r i a t e details of any witness or w i t n es ses w h o m you w o u l d like me to
           co n sid er c a l li ng to give evidence at the resumed Inquests.

          Ma y I pl ease ask you in consi der ing w h e t h e r you w i s h to d r a w any names            to my
          attention, to bear in m i n d the scope and limitations of an Inquest.

          I also want to make it a b sol utel y clear that the submis sio n of a name or
          names for c ons id e r a t i o n is nothing more than that, and that the d e c i s i o n as
          to w h o to call to give evidence is and remains a m a t t e r for me.

          I w o u l d be grateful if y ou could respond as soon as possible. If I have not
          he a r d from you by the end^o.f^^S’p t e mbe r I will assume you have no names to

             re :       Paul David Brady (deceased)

             Thank you for your letter of 20th February. We were not aware of any
             request made by the Metropolitan Borough of Sefton. We have had no
             contact with them and frankly are a little puzzled by their request.
                 Perhaps you could oblige by forwarding a further copy to this office.

Dear Sirs,

Re: PAUL DAVID BRADY (deceased)

Thank you for your letter of 15th February 1990. We rec&Aved a
request from the Metropolitan Borough of Sefton to send a copy of
the post-mortem report to a Mr. Philip Simms, Consultant A.E.D,
Walton Hospital, Rice Lane, Liverpool, L9 1AE and this was done
on the 17th January 1990.

In the circumstances I assume that you do notrequire     a further
copy.




Yours faithfully.

De31         Sirs,

Res        PAUL M T C D 3RADX (deceased) Ko.34*

As you are aware, the Inquest(s) arising out of the Hillsborough
Disaster stand adjourned to a date to be fixed. You may also
be aware that it had been in my mind to resume these Inquests
on the 15th of January 1990.

 I have now been informed that the Director of Public Prosecutions
 has decided to have a criminal investigation undertaken on his
 behalf. In these circumstances, I have decided not' to resume the
 Inquest(s) on the date mentioned.

 I will review the matter further after the Director of Public
 Prosecutions has announced his decision as to what action (if any)
 he may wish to undertake.

 I am not in a position to say how long the Police Inquiry
 or the Director of Public Prosecutions consideration of the
 matter will take. I anticipate however that there will be
 a substantial period of time before I am in a position to communicate
 on this matter further.

 I would be grateful if you could please ensure that this information
 is conveyed to members of the bereaved family so that they may be
 fully informed of the position regarding the Inquest(s).

 Yours faithfully,



 S.L.Popper,
 H.M.Coroner

 Thank you for your letter of the 25th of May. We will of
 course let you know when we are in a position to fix a
 date for the Inquest,

 I am not quite clear as to what it is that you are
 requesting in respect of the third sentence of your letter.
 If you are saying that you wish to approach the pathologist
 for a copy of the post mortem report, then that will not
 be possible at the present time. If the post mortem reports
 are to be released before the Inquest, this will be done
 either by me or through the Inquiry.

I am actively considering the question of release of the
reports and if I decide to do so, I will be in touch with
you in due oourse.

 Yours faithfully,

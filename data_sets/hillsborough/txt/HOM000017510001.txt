FOOTBALL SPECTATORS BILL:            INSTRUCTION


I enclose a copy of an instruction to the Commirtee
                                          Committee on this Bill

which I have today drafted for DOE and which has the approval of

the Commons House authorities.              Their Secretary of State may ask

for it to be tabled for the second reading on (it seems) Tuesday.



It is approved as authorising amendments to the Bill (limited to

designated football matches, in England and Wales) to enable

provision to be made to cover any aspect of the safety of

spectators, including the state of the premises and including

some form of enforcing inspectorate.                 It is designed to be

capable of franking amendments for these purposes whether by

operating through the Bill (DOE) licence to admit spectators or

by means of amendments to your Safety of Sports Grounds Act 1975.




J S MASON
                 FOOTBALL SPECTATORS BILL [LORDS]



[Secretary Ridley]

      To move, That it be an instruction to the Committee on the

 Football Spectators Bill [Lords] that they have power to make

 provision in the Bill relating to any aspect of the safety of

 spectators at designated football matches.

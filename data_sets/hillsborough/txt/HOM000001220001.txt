                 I am       a    married              woman   and    I    live    at     the   above     premises       with    my


                 hus b a n d •

                 On       Saturday             15     April   198?       (150489)        my    husband    and   myself       were     in   the




                     From    about             half    past   ten,       there     was    a    steady    trickle       of    Liverpool

                     fans    heading                                           towards         the   ground.      A    few    were    sitting

                     on   garden           walls,       eating      chips      and      drinking       beer,    pop,    milk.

                     Quite       a   few        people    started         to   come      down    the    driveway       obviously

                     looking             for    somewhere      to    urinate.

                     I    knocked          on    the    window      and    waved       them     off.

A    few        just       nodded          and       moved           off.

A f t er        midday          between             12     1 1 2 0 0 ) and            1    o'clock                (1 2 0 0 ) tn*         trickle          began


to       crow     neavier             and        the       fans       were        not       30       keen          to    move        away      from       the

driveway              wnen       I        knocked          so    I walked                 down       t h e .g a r d e n         to      tne    drive          at


the        oottom          to    move           them       on.

One        or    two       were           quite          noticeably              drunk           I       remember             one       telling         me        in a

slurred           voice          "I        dont          know    what       y o u ’ re           worried                about.           I t ’s    only


lager."

He       was     of     stocky             build,          a    large        framed             man        with          I think          blona         hair

and        moustache.                     He    was       dressed           in    a       red        long         sleeved           t   shirt      and         I

    think       blue       jeans           but       to    be     quite          honest              I    dind't          pay       much      attention

    to   him.          When          he    had       finished             urinating                  he    moved          away          towards         the


    g round.

    As   the      fans       moved             towards           the       ground,             several              threw       empty          beer      cans

    from    the        roadway             into          our     garden.               When          we       later       collected               the    beer

    cans        they       were       placed             into        an    industrial                    dustbin          which          we    have       of

    cubic        capacity             240       litres.               The    dustbin                 had          been    empty          before         save

    some        wood       shavings             about           an    inch        in      the        bottom.              By     the      time      we

    finished           the       dustbin              was       completely                full           of       beer    cans,          the      majority

    of     which       were          of        super       strength              Tennents                 lager,         high        alcohol        or


    gravity           beer.

    From        about        half          past          two    (1430)           there           was          a    noticeable             surge         off a n s

     towards           the      ground              in    the    main       mostly               drunk             in    my    opinion.

     The    group          seemed              to    be    mostly           youths             rather             than        families.            Several

     fans       were       a c t u a l l y          coming        from       the          ground           asking             oncoming         fans          if


     they       had     any          tickets..

     increased              and       they          were        now       coming          in     groups             of    about          twenty.

            Police              Officer.

            A      Policeman                   late."    came     and     tried         to     prevent            any       further           disorder.

            The        next          thing        a     virtual        stream        of       Liverpool               fans       mo-it     of    them           upset,

            the        others              angry        came    out     of     the      g? o u n d

            Before              we    did        so     two    Liverpool           fans        actually               came

            demanding                     to    use     the    phone.          Unfortunately                     my    husband            was    already

            using              it,    at        this     the    fans      became          very           abusive           and    a    Police          Officer-


            had        to       remove           them

                                                                                                                      to    find       out      what        had
            At        this

             happened                on        television.

             In       my       opinion,            if    the     Liverpool            fans       had        been       more       co-operative                      I

             believe                this        would     never        have      happened.                  I was          upset,         angered           by

             their             actions           towards         me,    very        upsetting.                   The       only       difference                from

               last        y e a r ’s          semi-final         was     the      sheer         volume           of       fans       coming          at    such         a

               late        stage           in    the     proceedings.                 Behaviourwise                    I    regarded            it     as       a


               normal           football              match.

               I     would           be    willing        to     give      evidence             in       any     further          enquiries                in       this

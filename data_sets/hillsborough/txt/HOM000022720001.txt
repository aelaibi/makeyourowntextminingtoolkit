         THE HILLSBOROUGH INQUIRY - STAGE 2

         WORKING PARTY ON THE GREEN GUIDE - IDENTIFICATION OF AREAS

         POSSIBLY NEEDING IMPROVEMENT



         CHAPTER 7 - STAIRWAYS AND RAMPS



         73.   Profile dimensions should agree with the Building Regulation

                approved document for public stairs.



         74.   (i)     Substitute 'tapered treads' for      'winders'.



                (ii)   Reduce maximum of 16 down to ........

#
                (iii) 'in a turn' should read 'without a turn of at least

                       90° on a landing'.



         75.   Add a sentence.    "A longer landing in      the line of successive

               flights is not a substitute for the turn required by paragraph

               74(iii).



         76.   This paragraph has a contradiction in        requiring a handrail to be

               available for all persons, and then allowing a width of 1.8m, which

               is a generous 3 units wide.        The handrails provided should extend

               from 300mm before the first        step at the   head of a stairway, to at

               least 300mm beyond the last        step at the   bottom ofa stairway.   At

               the head of stairways leading down off a terrace or other open

               area, which are therefore subject to extra crowd pressures, the

               handrails should preferably        extend from   a distance at least         equal

               to the width of the channel        before the top step.

         77.   Heights of handrails should agree with the Building Regulations

               approved document for public stairs.



         78.   The requirement that protection (balustrades) to open sides 'should

               be enclosed1, needs further clarification.



         81.   The last sentence would be clearer if it simply finished at the

               word 1stairway 1 .



         82.   Suggest new wording as follows.            "The width   of an approach   to the

               head of a stairvay should not be less than 1.1            metres,    nor more

               than 3 metres.   Where the total stairway width exceeds 4.5 metres,

               one or two additional approaches should be arranged using barriers

               and handrails, :o provide lines of approach to the head of the

               stairway separated by an angle of at least 90°.".



         83.   Given the foregoing means of restricting the effect of pressures at

               the head of stairs (handrails, paras. 76, 81 and 82), I consider

               'throttling down' access to       ^ / o,   the width of the stair to be an

               unnecessary complication.



         84.   Fig. 1 needs to be redrawn.

               Fig. 2 could be improved.

               See attached rough sketches.



         85.   This paragraph is superfluous.

         Additional Paragraphs Needed



         E g r ^ ramps (do-**.) should not lead direct onto the rear of terraces.
          /



         Barriers, required,



         Ramps adjacent tc a lower level need a protective balustrade and handrail,



         Wide ramps need rlow channelling with handrails, like stairways.



         Long ramps need landings at intervals, possibly with 90° turns, to avoid

         cascade pressures, like stairways.



         Ramps to be used b~ wheelchair-bound disabled should not exceed 1 in 15

         and need additional handrails at a lower level.    (Unless we are to

         continue to insist on such disabled persons being accompanied by an

         at tendant).

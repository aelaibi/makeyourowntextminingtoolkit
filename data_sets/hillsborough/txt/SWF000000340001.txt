                                       TUESDAY, 27th JUNE, 1989

                                             (MORNING   SESSION)


                             HR. GOLDSACK:     Mr. Sanderson, please.

                                       ANDREW SANDERSON Called

                                       Examined by MR. GOLDSACK;

                    Q. Are you Andrew Sanderson? - A. Yes.

                    Q. A communications assistant employed by South Yorkshire
                       Police? - A. That is correct.

                    Q. And on the 15th of April was it your responsibility to
                       be present within the Hillsborough ground to assist with
                       any communication problems? - A. That is right, yes.

                    Q. Did you visit the Police control room early that morning?
                       - A. Yes, about just before 9 o'clock.

                    Q. What was the purpose of that visit? - A. We took some
                       spare equipment up.

                    Q. Was that the spare base station? - A. Spare base station,
                       battery in case of power supply failure and a couple of
                       personal radios.

                    Q.   Do you have in front of you West Midland volume 2? - A. Yes

                    Q.   Would you like to turn to 48, 49, 50 and have those
                         available? They are the photos, of the Police control
                         box. Having put that spare equipment in the room did you
                         then go to was it the gymnasium area? - A. We went to
                         the briefing first, yes.

                    Q. And then you had some responsibility, did you, with the
                       issue of radios to certain personnel?- A. Well, on com­
                       pletion of the briefing I went round to the gymnasium
                       and just made myself available in case there were any
                       queries or problems with the issue of the radios, yes.

                    Q. All right.  Now, you had your own radio during the day?
                       - A. That is correct.

                    Q. Was that with an ear piece? - A. It was, yes.

                    Q. How many ear pieces were available that day? - A. Cannot
                       remember offhand.  I think there were about 30.

                    Q. Who was issuing them? - A. The personnel who worked in
                       the inside perimeter or inside the ground as far as I am
                       aware, yes.

                                                    A. SANDERSON

Q. Why did they have ear pieces? - A. Well, it helped them
   being able to listen.  The only equipment we have that
   can help them listen to the radio messages inside the
   ground.  But the noise is so great with just a normal
   radio it is virtually impossible.

Q. So it was envisaged before the day, was it-, that those
   inside the ground would be unlikely to hear messages
   unless they had an ear piece with the handset?- A. Yes,
   I would say that, yes.

Q. Was that based on previous experience at similar big
   matches? - A. Yes, and other events as well with a great
   amount of noise, yes.

Q. Now, in the past had your experience simply been that
   because of the noise individuals simply could not hear
   the messages or that because of the amount of noise
   the messages were breaking up? - A. Usually with the
   great amount of noise it is impossible to hear the
   radios, yes.

0.        LORD JUSTICE TAYLOR:   Can you just help me about
     the ear piece? It is one ear only, is it?— A. That is
     right, sir. It is a little hanger, hangs over your ear.
     It is a little'inductor that just presses against the ....
     eardrum there.

Q. Is it the kind of thing which if anybody grabbed it can
   do any harm to the wearer? - A. Oh, no. If it is pulled
   it iust comes away from the ears.  It is like clipped
   together.

Q. Are there other devices you could have? I mean, I suppose
   you could have earphones, could you, for both ears, shut
   out some more noise and get some more sound in?- A. Yes,
   sir, there is the ear defender type receiver which actually
   works like an ear defender, two cups over the ear with the
   receiver noise inside.

Q. Is there any disadvantage to that? - A. Well, it is rather
   large.  You would not be able to wear helmets or anything
   with them.

Q. Yes.  You would not probably be able to hear anything you
   wanted to hear other than the radio? - A. Well, that is
   right, sir. You would not be able to hear anything going
   on around you. You would only be able to hear the radio.

Q.        MR. GOLDSACK:   Well now, a time came, Mr. Sanderson,
     when you heard that the radio was breaking up? - A. That
     is right, yes.

Q. What time was that? - A. It would be just after 2 o'clock.

                                              A. SANDERSON

Q. And where were you then? - A. I was in the gymnasium.at
   the time.

Q. And by breaking up what do you actually mean? - A. It
   sounded at first, it was intermittent, it started at
   first, it was just, sort of, being clipped, the voices
   were being clipped off. My original thought was there
   had been some interference coming in. Apparently, I
   was not there last year, but they had some interference
   from a radio station last year and about the same time.

Q. Was the breaking up affecting both messages from control
   and messages to control?- A. It x*as coming from the control.
   Could not tell that at first but after listening to it for
   about five or six minutes I deduced that it was coming from
   the control room. That is when I started to make my way
   towards the control room, thinking there was a fault.

Q. Believing at first that it was interference from another
   radio, did you do anything at that stage?- A. No, because
   I was the other side any way so there was nothing I could
   have done any way.

Q. You say within a few minutes when it continued you made
   your way towards the Police control room? - A. That is
   right.                                             '"" ‘

Q. What is your best estimate of the time you reached the
   Police control box?- A. It would be about half-past-2,
   just after half-past-2, because I remember walking round
   the inside perimeter of the fence with Mr. Beal and the
   players had just started coming out for a warm-up.

Q. By then was it possible to make sense of what was coming
   out over the radio?- A. Well, the messages were still being
   passed around but I was not really taking a great deal of
   notice of what was being said.  I was just listening to
   the radio itself.  I know it sounds a bit double Dutch but,

Q. I think I follow. - A. Yes.

Q. At all events, once you got into the Police control room
   what was the first thing that you did? If it helps to
   identify it on the photographs, please do so? - A. Well,
   the first thing I did was to change the desk microphone.
   That is photograph No. 48, right in the centre. There is
   a blue desk microphone, what we call a tulip microphone.
   My first thoughts xteve that this could be breaking up, so
   I changed that for a small black telephone type handset.

Q. That just plugs in, does it? - A. Yes, it just plugs into
   the front of the set.

Q. So you unplugged that and plugged a different one in?
   - A. Plugged a different one m .

                                                 A. SANDERSON

Q. Any difference? - A. No. The fault continued.   So I thought
   then that there could be a problem with the fixed equipment,
   so then I connected up the emergency set which was placed
   underneath the bench.

Q. Now, were you aware prior to doing that that the lead from
   the stand-by equipment was not long enough to reach the
   desk? - A. Well, no, not really thought about that, not if
   they were going to use it as a handset, but in the situation
   where they have it, switch to talk-through, it is irr­
   elevant any way. They would not need it.

Q. Having changed from the original to the reserve base
   station was there any improvement? - A. As far as I know,
   yes. They seemed quite happy with it. They tried it out
   and it was all working fine.

Q. When you say it was working fine do you mean that the radio
   messages were not breaking up then? - A. That is right.
   What they were using, they did not use the handset on the
   emergency set, they used a Motorola personal radio which
   they sat on top of the desk acting in the same way as the
   tulip microphone so they would be able to pick it up, use
   it on the desk. They started using that. It was working
   fine. There were no problems then. They were quite happy
   with it.

0. For how long did you remain in the Police control room?
   - A. After connecting it up, do you mean?

Q. Yes. - A. Yes. Not long.   About five minutes, probably
   not even that long.

Q. Did you then make your way back to the gymnasium? - A. No.
   I informed them that I would be staying available in case
   the fault came again, so I just went down the bottom of
   the stairs and stayed underneath the control room.

Q. And were you continuing to listen in on your own radio?
   - A. That is right, yes.

Q. This would be - what - about 20-to-3?~ A. About 10-to-3.

Q. Did you hear the messages coming over the radio?- A. Yes,
   I could hear messages being passed, yes.

0. Was there any difficulty in hearing them from where you
   were? - A. No.

Q. That is both messages in and messages out? - A. Yes. I
   could not, like I said before, I am not really taking a
   great deal of notice of what was being said.  I v/as just
   listening to make sure that that problem especially did
   not occur again, the breaking up, so I was just listening

                           to the messages being passed without taking a great deal
                           of notice what was being said.

                             anything to do with that? - A. No, it was nothing to do with
                             me.

                        Q. Mr. Sanderson would you wait a moment.  There may be another
                           question.  If you would just wait a moment-
                    B                   POLICE CONSTABLE PHILIP HOPSON Called

                                              Examined bv MR. PHILLIPS:

                        Q. You are Police Constable Philip Hooson?    Is that right? - a .
                           That is correct, sir.

                        O. There are one or two matters out of your statement I want to
                           ask you about, mr. Hooson.  You were on duty at the match, and
                           part of your duty was to go to the Midland Station, was it
                           not? - A. That is correct, sir.

                        Q. with a serial of other Officers to meet supporters off the
                           trains? - A. That is correct.

                        Q. These would be the ordinary service trains at the Midland
                           Station, and they were supporters from both Liverpool and
                           Nottingham Forest? — A. That is correct, yes.       ....

                        Q. When the supporters came off the trains at the station did you
                           and the rest of your serial have some method of searching and
                           filtering the fans? - A. We did, sir, yes.

                        Q. What did you do with regard to the football supporters? How
                           did you filter them? - A. What do you mean? How, phvsicaiiy
                           or how did the arrangement work?

                        Q. Yes. - A. How would you like me to explain it to you?    What I
                           am trying to say is when they arrived at the exit it was like
                           a matter of depending on the identification with whatever
                           scarf they were wearing or what ticket they had on them.   The
                           Nottingham Forest went down to the bottom end of the train
                           station and the Liverpool fans went to the top side.

                        Q. So you separated them into two groups effectively at the
                           ticket barrier? - A. More or less, yes, sir.

                        Q. When you got them into the appropriate group what did you
                           do? Did you search each one? - A. No.  My serial did not
                           search each one.

                        Q.        LORD JUSTICE TAYLOR:    How did you get them into the same
                             group?   I can see it if they are obviously wearing colours of
                             the club, but otherwise what do you do? Liverpool on the
                             left, Nottingham on the right? How did you separate them off?
                             - A.   That is basically it, sir.  British Transport Police,
                             they have all the information as regards what trains what fans
                    H        were using and which platform they were going to arrive at.
                             and they basically did the segregation prior to them arriving

     to us.  We just continued it, ensuring that the Nottingham
     Forest fans went down to their collection point and the
     Liverpool fans went to theirs, basically speaking.

Q.        MR. PHILLIPS:    So the Liverpool trains and the
     Nottingham trains arrived at different times, did they? - a .
     As far as I am aware.

Q. And you would get a batch of supporters all from the Liverpool
   train and another batch from the Nottingham train? - A. That
   is right, sir.

0. Were you concerned to know whether the people who came through
   the barriers had tickets for the match? - A. What we did. when
   they came through and if we had identified them as football
   supporters, we asked them where they were going.  Our
   instructions were not to allow them into the city centre.   So
   we searched them for a ticket, and if they had a ticket,
   dependent whether they came from Liverpool or Nottingham,
   determined which end of the platform we sent them to.

Q. You say you searched them for a ticket.  Does that mean you
   searched everyone who appeared to be a football supporter for
   a ticket? - a . Basically, yes, sir.

G.       ■ l o I d 'JUSTICE TAYLOR: -That -really means, .that -thv.^e^jrJXio . .
     came without tickets had the advantage of going into the town
     that those who came with tickets did not have? - A. That is
     it, basically, sir.

G.        MR. PHILLIPS;    And it was only those with tickets you
     sent along to the buses that were going to the ground? - A.
     That is   it, sir. As far as I can remember, yes.

G. So if a  person had said to you he was going    to the matchbut
   had not   got a ticket with him you would not let him get on the
   bus? - A. If a person what, sir?

Q. Said that he was going to the football match but did not have
   a ticket with him when you searched him. you would not let him
   go to the appropriate bus to go to the ground? - a . I d o n ’t
   know, sir.  I did not particularly come across that problem
   that I can remember.

Q.    All of those who came.... - A. As far        as I can recollect, yes.

G.    Then I think you and your serial went off to the ground after
     you had finished dealing with the arrival of supporters at the
     station? - A. That is right, sir.

0. And the bus you went on travelled along Middlewood Road, past
   Hillsborough Park and down Leppings Lane from the Catcn Bar
   Lane end? - A. That is right, sir.

G. I think you had a journey along Leppings Lane.  What time
   would it be when you were going down Leppings Lane? - A.
   Roughly speaking it would be 20-to-3, quarter-to-3, roughly.

                       Q. About quarter-to-3? - A. Roughly speaking, yes.

                       G. And how was your journey down Leppings Lane? - A. it was very
                          slow because there were quite a lot of people down there.

                       Q. What sort of bus was it you were in? - A. A double decker.
                   B   Q. A South Yorkshire Transport bus? - A. That is right, sir.

                       G. Had that bus been held up at the Catch Bar Lane end for any
                          time? - A. What do you mean by the Catch Bar Lane end?

                       Q. At the Catch Bar Lane end of Leppings Lane.        We have heard
                          some evidence that there was a line of three       buses held up by
                          a Police serial, and was eventually let down       Leppings Lane? -
                          A. It did stop, sir, but the exact location I       am not sure.
                          It was in Leppings Lane.

                       Q. Had you previously attended at football Semi-Finals at this
                          ground? - A. Yes, one or two over the years.

                       Q. How did you consider the people in Leppings Lane?
                   D
                                 MR. WOODWARD:    Sir, I do apologise for rising and
                            interrupting-' but it is-.in relation to^.Mr. „Sander.3 0 n.... The .
                            purpose of calling him first this morning is that’ his            '
                            attendance is required urgently elsewhere in relation to some
                            matters that are happening in Barnsley.     Might he be released.

                                 LORD JUSTICE TAYLOR:    I was about to take an opportunity
                            of saying that, because I have found what I wanted, which was
                            something which     confirmed what he had to say.So Idon't
                            think I need to ask him anything further about it.

                                 MR. WOODWARD:   He will be available should later
                            information be required from him, but his attendance is
                            required urgently elsewhere, sir.

                                 LORD JUSTICE TAYLOR:      Yes, he is free to go.

                       Q.        MR. PHILLIPS:   Did the situation in Leppings Lane seem
                            to you to be unusual? - A. It did inasmuch that there were
                            quite a lot of people there which I thought for that time of
                            day.

                       0.   And your bus had some trouble getting down Leppings Lane,      did
                            it? - A. We did, sir.  We had to travel very slowly.

                       G. Were   the fans out on the road then as well as on the pavement?
                          - A.   From the.Leppings Lane they were .both sides, but in the
                          main   at the Leppings Lane turnstiles, but they were walking
                          down   the road towards the turnstiles.

                       G . I think you went to the gymnasium as you were expected        to do
                   H       and got there at about 5-minutes-to-3? - A. That would       be
                           approximately.

G. And you were to be kept in reserve in the gymnasium? - a . That
   is right, sir.

Q. For further.duties if required.  You then got orders to go to
   the Leppings Lane stand? - A. To the West Stand, yes, sir.

Q.   And did you go in fact on the pitch side or at the back of                     the
     North Stand? - A. We went on the pitch side, sir, on the
     track.

O. What did you see as you were walking towards the stand? - A.
   a s I was walking up towards it I saw the ground was full, and
   we neared the West Stand I could see that the West Stand was
   quite full, but the section to the right as you walk towards
   it did not seem quite as full.

Q. When talking about the West Stand I think we should say the
   terraces, the Leppings Lane terraces, rather than the stand.
   The section to the extreme right you say was not very full? -
   A. It did not appear to be so.

0. Where did you see the biggest concentration of people? - A.
     The most of the stadium appeared full, but to direct it
     straight at the Leppings Lane end, the full face of the
  -• LeppiTigs-Lane.. end. seemed to. be -quite .full-..;.-as.-..fait as.-..I.jsa«^lt.-

Q. Did you come to gate 4? - A. I did, sir, yes.

Q. Was that gate open or closed when you got there? - A. It was
   closed, sir.

Q. What did you see.

          LORD JUSTICE TAYLOR:           Have you the time when this was
     going on?

G.         m r . PHILLIPS:   What time was it when you got to or were
     approaching gate 4? - A. I would not be quite sure to give you
     an exact time.     As far as i can remember it was before 3
     o ’clock, before the kick-off, because the players were warming
     up on the pitch as we walked into the stadium.

G. Did you see anything that happened on the pitch after you got
   to the Leppings Lane terraces? - A. On the pitch, sir?

G.   Yes? - A. No,not on the pitch.

G.   You don't know whether the game had started or how long                   it
     went on? - A. Absolutely no idea, sir.

G.   You say gate      4 was closed? - A. That is right, sir.

0. What did you see in pen 4? - A. I saw that there was quite  a
   number of people crushed up to the fencing.   They seemed to be
   in quite a desperate situation.

G. Thar, of course, would be the first of the two centre pens you
   came to? - A. That is right, sir.

Q. Were there other Officers on duty outside pen 4? - A. As I
   walked on the track as I can remember there were three Police
   Officers standing on the track.

0. Were they conscious or appear to be conscious of what was
   going on in pen 4? - A. I can't say, sir.  I really don't
   know.

0. Were they looking towards pen 4 or out towards the pitch? - A.
   As far as I can remember they were not looking towards the
   pitch.

G. When you got to pen u you found the gate closed, you saw
   people crushed up against the fence.  Did you take the
   opportunity of looking along towards pen 3? -A. Not that I can
   remember, sir.

G. You can't say whether No. 3 gate was open or not? - A. What I
   can say to you. when I walked on that track towards pen 4
   there were no gates open.

G. None at all? - A. None at all, sir.

G. Were there spectators on the perimeter track? - A.-no,- sir.

G. None at all? - A. None at        all, sir.

G.4 What did you do then when you saw what you did see in pen 4? -
    A. What I did. i realised there was something desperately
    wrong, and of course understanding that the orders are that
    nobody goes on to the track, I had to decide to open the gate.
    I told the Police Officer there - I have no idea who he is -
    to inform the control room that we will need some assistance
    and we would open the gate, and then I went and opened the
    gate.

G. I think you debated a bit with yourself, did you, before doing
   so? - A. I think so, sir, yes.

G. And we have the views or the thoughts you had in your
   statement? - A. That is right, sir.

G.           LORD JUSTICE TAYLOR:   What was the thought? - A. I
        think, "If I'm wrong I'm going to get a right bollocking for
        this".

q   .       m h . PHILLIPS:  That tends to suggest that you had had it
        clearly drummed into you not to open these gates.  Is that
        right? - A. It is, sir.  Over the years of attending football
        matches the practice is that nobody goes on to the track
        except in exceptional circumstances, i.e. they are under
        arrest or they are ill or in the wrong part of the football
        stadium and consequently would be escorted to where they
        wanted to go or taken to the Police room or whatever.

                              Basically they are not allowed freedom of movement on to the
                              pitch.

                         Q.   Was that something that had been told to you that very day or
                              something you had heard previously? - A. It is something that
                              you know which is drummed into you, as you suggested, over the
                              years.   It is not something I was aware of-being told on that

                            I d o n ’t know, sir. I did not necessarily wait for him.

                         Q. We   heard evidence from a Constable Illingworth who said that
                            he   was the one who opened gate 4. Could you comment cn that.
                            Do   you know him? - A. I have no idea, sir.  I don't know who
                            he   is.

                         0. He would have been in position already before you arrived? -

                             A. I opened the gate and the people who were behind did not
                             move.  They were squashed and crushed, so much so that they
                             could not move.

                         Q./They could not get out through the gateway?        A. That is
                            right, sir.

Q. When you opened the gate did you have any difficulty
   opening it? - A. No, I had no difficulty.

Q. It did not spring open?- A. I mean, not that I can
   remember.  I just grabbed the gate, opened the gate,
   pulled it open and that is it. Whether there was any
   pressure behind it or not I did not recogttise it as
   such.

Q. Were you able to get any of the people out of the pen?
   - A. Yes.

Q. And did that seem to do any good? - A. Well, as soon as you
   pulled one out there was another one to take their place.
   It did not matter - it seemed at the time, initially, no
   matter how many you pulled out, and each one took a great
   deal of effort, there was another one to take their place.

Q. The people you pulled out, did they appear to be to you
   either injured or in physical distress? - A. Oh, yes, sir,
   they were very distressed.

Q. Did they appear to be injured? - A. There were some app­
   eared to be injured.

Q. The ;o.aes-Lyo-u •tooH-’Out, were able.! to- walk^           "•
   extracted them from the gateway, were they? -A.-Yes.     " • —
   Some ran off.

Q. Some ran off.    You of course had other Officers with you,
  / did not you? - A. That is right, sir.

Q. How many of you altogether do you think there were trying
   to get people out? - A. Well, initially there would be
   myself, P.C. Akred and Sergeant Swift, as far as I can
   remember. I v/as not taking particular notice at the time
   who was there.   Of course, as time went by ....

Q.        LORD JUSTICE TAYLOR:   Sorry.  There was yourself,
     P.C. Akred and .... - A       Sergeant Swift, sir.

Q.Swift. ~ A. And consequently we were joined by other
   Officers as time went by.

Q.        MR. PHILLIPS:   And you three, I suppose, would be all
     busily engaged at the gateway itself?- A. Initially, sir,
     yes.

Q. There would not really be much room for other Officers to
   help there,, would there? - A. No, sir.

Q.       LORD JUSTICE TAYLOR:    Were you all part of the same
     serial? - A. That is correct.

Q.       MR. PHILLIPS:    Were other efforts being made to get

                                                     P. HOPSON

  people out of that pen that you were aware of? - A. As
  time went by, from what I can recollect, Police Officers
  were trying to pull the fencing down with their hands and
  drag people out as best they could.

Q. You    were not one of those? - A. No, sir.

Q. You stayed at the gateway, did you, for sometime?      - A. I
   stayed there.

Q. Can I iust go back to one matter that I should have asked
   you about? When you got to the pen in the first place did
   you hear anything from the crowd itself? - A. Well,
   initially, it was iust a lot of noise, a real lot of
   noise, that is not unusual for a match this size, you do
   not particularly take notice of, not knowing anything was
   wrong at this time. But as I neared pen 4 it became
   apparent these people were shouting and screaming and
   they were screaming for help.

Q. For help? - A. That is right, sir.

Q, Can you remember anything that was said or is     itimpossible?
   - A. It is difficult, sir.  It is difficult.

Q. They: clear.1y '.wante.d to get out of where they were? — A-,- . •
   Clearly.

Q. And then I think you have given us in your statement some
    examples of particular people that you helped to get out
  . of the pen.  I think there was one person with a broken
    arm, was there? - A. That is right, sir.

Q. This was a young boy? - A. About 16 I think he was.

Q. How did you manage to get him out? - A. He seemed to have
   managed to pull himself up above other people and he was
   shouting to us. We leaned over, just grabbed over and
   dragged him out.

0. When you say leaned over do you mean over the top of the
   fence or through the gateway? - A. No, through the gateway.
   Had to hold on to the side of the gate to grab hold of
   him ....

Q. Were the people then in the gateway standing up or were
   they on the ground? - A. They were standing up, sir, well,
   in a fashion.  They were not erect, as such, but standing,
   sir.
Q. From your position which was perhaps'the clo-sest into the
   pen that we have seen did you see any people on the ground?
   - A. There were some on the ground in front of the gate,
   sir.

                                                         P. HOOSON

Q. In front of the gate?- A. Yes.

Q. They would of course be difficult to see when you were at
   first taking peopleout, would not they? - A. They would,
   sir, yes.

Q. Did you get to them eventually? - A.        We did,   sir.

Q. Can you give us any idea how many people there were like
   that? - A. On the ground?

Q. Yes. - A. From what I can remember, probably four or five.

Q. Four or five. - A. Yes.        They were, kind of, stuck at the
   gate.

Q. Stuck at the gate. - A. On the floor, yes.

Q. All in the close proximity of the gate? - A. At that time,
   yes, sir.

Q. Did you see any way in which the pressure on these people
   at the front could be relieved? -A. The only way I could
   see it at that time was to perhaps get a serial into the
   back of this stand to start pulling people out from the
   back to make the people at the front or near the front
   move back and relieve'pressure ... . ;7 ’                 ;

Q.Did you do anything about that? - A. From what I can
    remember, there was an Inspector present but at the
  , time everything was very confused and I cannot remember
    who it was. No idea who it was. And I asked him to get
    a serial in the back and do this.

Q. Yes. Were you able to observe from where you were any
   Officers getting into the back of the terrace? - A. Yes,
   sir.

Q. Did they go into the   back of the terrace? - A. From what
   I can remember, they   did go in the back end of the
   terrace eventually.

0. And did that relieve some of the pressure that there was
   at the front? - A. Eventually it did, when they had to work
   their way through these people.

Q.   How long do you say it was really before the pressure was
     relieved sufficiently for people to get out under their own
     steam?- A. It is hard to say. Could be 20 minutes.

0. As long as 20 minutes? - A. It is hard to say, sir.          Could
   be totally incorrect on my estimation.

0. And that is starting from just before the match kicked off?
   - A. That is right, sir.

                     Q. Yes. And then I think you went away from the gate and did
                        a lot to help those who had beentaken out on to the pitch?
                        - A. That   is right, sir.

                     Q. To see if    you could assist, along with manyother people?
                        - A. That    is right, sir.

                                        Cross-examined by MR. HYTNER:

                     Q. In view of the thoughts you had to yourself on the day I
                        can keep my questions very short.   The reason that you
                        thought you might get a bollocking if you made a mistake
                        is that the whole of your training was to the effect that
                        those gates were meant for Police use, to get somebody out
                        who was under arrest or to allow a Policeman into the
                        terrace to make an arrest or do something of that sort.
                        - A. That is right, is it? - A. That is the basic under­
                        standing, sir.

                     Q. Yes. The one thing you were never trained in relation
                        to the gates was that they might be for use to get fans
                        out who were under pressure through crowd trouble, through
                D       crowd pressure?- A. Well, it is not a matter of training.
                        It is.  matter ;.0 'f.-AitiLi sing what you have -atf 'the ••
                        sir.

                     Q. Common sense.     That is what you did. - A. Yes.

                     Q.- It was not due to anything that you had been taught? -A.
                         No, sir, it is common sense.

                     Q. The next thing is this. Going back in time, if I may.
                        Coming up Leppings Lane from Catch Bar Lane you were in
                        a prime position to see the back of the crowd that was
                        pressing into the turnstile area? - A. That is right, sir.

                     Q. You skirted the     back of that crowd?- A. That is right, sir.

                     Q. And there were still people coming down and up Leppings Lane
                        to join that throng?   - A. That is right, sir.

                     Q. And all you saw, the   impression that you had, having your
                        bus skirting just the edge of that mob or press, was of a
                        press of people, a mass of people, simply trying to get
                        into a football ground?- A. That is basically it, sir.

                     Q.   Nothing more.   Nothing less? - A. That is it, sir.

                     Q.    And coming forward in time aga-in, can you tell us because
                          it may be important when you made your statement that we
                          are now going from?   Do you remember how soon      afterthe
                          incident?- A. It would be - the disaster happened on the

   Saturday, returned to work on the Monday, returned on nights
   - it would be some time during that week.

Q. You see, the importance is this, that many things that are said
    now about what the Police should have done it may be said,
    well, this is all with the benefit of hindsight.       It was
    at the very time of this tragedy that you appreciated that
    it was no good asking people at the front of the terrace
    to push back, you needed a serial at the back to pull
    people backwards at the back? - A. That is how I saw it.

Q. You actually made that suggestion to a Superior Officer at
   the time? - A. That is correct, sir.

          MR. HYTNER:    Thank you.

                 Cross-examined by MR. JACKSON:

0. Two matters, Mr. Hooson.       Would you look at this photo­
   graph, please?

          MR. JACKSON:   My Lord, it is not one that is before
   you:

Q. Perhaps before I ask you questions would you hand it to
   -My Lord, please? .The questions I am going...to .ask...concern.
    the time, 1475-9, the gates that are opened, 3, 4 and''5',
    and the observation that you have as to the relative
    densities of pens 6 and 7 and pens 3 and 4.

        MR. JACKSON:   This is the first witness, My Lord,
   who has come from that side of the ground. All the
   others have come .... Each of my friends has seen the
   photograph.

        LORD JUSTICE TAYLOR:        Sorry.   This is the first
   witness who has come from?

          MR. JACKSON:    Has    approached it that way round.

          MR. COLLINS:   That is not correct.

          LORD JUSTICE TAYLOR:      I do not think that is right.

        MR. COLLINS:   We have had about half-a-dozen who
   came from that ....

          MR. JACKSON:    Since I had the photograph.

          LORD JUSTICE TAYLOR:      Since you had the photograph.

          MR. COLLINS:    Oh, since you had the photograph.

          MR. JACKSON:    I understand each of my friends has

seen the photograph.

    MR. COLLINS:       I have not.

    MR. WOODWARD:       Thatis not right.       I have notseen it.

     LORD JUSTICE TAYLOR:    I will pass it to you in a
moment, Mr. Woodward.  Is this, by any chance, one of a
series that appeared in the Liverpool evening paper?

     MR. JACKSON:      Yes.

     LORD JUSTICE TAYLOR:   I remember seeing.            Taken by a
fan in the stand, is that right?

     MR. JACKSON:   I understand it to be from the paper
itself. There are a number of other amateur photographers.
I understand this is the Liverpool evening paper.

     LORD JUSTICE   TAYLOR:     Yes, I see.

     MR. JACKSON:       Iam told it is The Echo.

     LORD JUSTICETAYLOR:       That is an evening paper, is it?

     MR. JACKSON:   I understand so.

     LORD JUSTICE TAYLOR:      Was that on the Friday after?

     MR. JACKSON:    I am receiving, as it were, information
from my side.  I have the sequence. This is the earliest.
I apologise to those of my learned friends who have not
seen it.  I did think the ....

     LORD JUSTICE      TAYLOR: There is only one copy, is there?

     MR.   JACKSON: At this stage there are negatives and
smaller copies available.

     MR. COLLINS:      Does not appear to be timed.

     LORD JUSTICE TAYLOR:      It is.   2.59.

     MR.   COLLINS: I did not see that./

     MR.   JACKSON: Yes.  As far as we can gather the match
kicked off some 25 seconds before 3 o'clock.

     LORD JUSTICE TAYLOR:      Just see the goalkeeper on the
left edge.

     MR. JACKSON:    Mr. Hooson, I want to ask you three
questions about that. You told us when you arrived that
there w e % n0 people on the track.

          LORD JUSTICE TAYLOR: Sorry. Just forgive me a moment.
     Has everybody not seen it? I think it should go along the
     line just before you go any further. Then hope to get
     another copy.   (Photograph shown)   I do not think either
     of the Assessors have had a chance to see it yet either.

         MR. WOODWARD:    There is a timing on it, sir.

          LORD JUSTICE TAYLOR: Yes.    If I remember there is     a
     whole series with the time on.

Q.        MR. JACKSON:   Mr. Hooson, clearly, looking at things
     from different angles can give different impressions, but
     there we see a photograph that rather strikingly reveals
     the difference in density between the pens on the extreme
     right and the pens in the centre. Having seen what you
     saw. does that photograph reflect the difference that you
     perceived? _ A. Basically ....

Q. In fairness to all other witnesses, does that exaggerate
   that which you saw or does it reflect pretty accurately
   the difference between the two? - A. Well, when you are
   stood on the ground you are looking at it from different
   angles. You obviously get a different impression.

Q. That is why I asked the question. - A. What I perceived
   when I approached the West Stand was simply that these -
   side pens did not seem as full as the centre pens.

0. May I then move on to the next point?

          LORD JUSTICE TAYLOR.:  I just wonder whether, because
     we have seen something of the same on these photographs,
     looking at these photographs one wondered whether part
     of the visual effect may be due to shadow and sun on the
     front part and shadow further back but I am not sure.   I
     merely'raise that point for consideration.

                                                G. CAMMACK


                   Cross-Examined bv MR. WOODWARD:

Q. Mr. Cammack, may I ask you about the railway station.  You
   were there early and you were there waiting for orders and
   instructions in the event of being required? - A. That is
   right.

Q. You did not only stay at the railway station, I think a number
   of you were called down by Mr. Marshall to go and attend to a
   potential source of problem.  Is that right? - A. Across the
   road at the Gateway Supermarket.

Q. So you were in reserve-in case of need in that area? - A. That
   is right, sir.

Q. And did in fact help.  On the question of the people who were
   going to the ground and your experience, you have been to many
   football matches before, have you, as a Police Officer? - A.
   Oh, yes, sir.

G. On the question of tickets I think you said in your statement
   there were quite a number of people who were looking for
   tickets? - A. That is right, sir, yes.

0. And your words were, "It was apparent that lots of people, and
   I mean lots, were .looking for tickets"? - A. Yes.

G. That was something that impressed you, was it? - A. 1 was
   asked at least three times personally if I had any tickets or
   if I knew where any tickets were.

G. It has been put to you by Mr. Hytner that the base of the
   problem at the turnstiles was first of all the number of
   people that were there? - A. That is right, sir.

0.    In your experience have you ever observed that sort ofnumber
     at that sort of time down at the turnstiles? - A. I have never
     in all my life been in a crush like that, sir.

0.    It was something quite outside your experience? - A.
     Frightening.

Q.   You were asked that there may have been one or two people at
     the back causing difficulty.  It was put to ;you that there
     were a few people there.  You describe I think the attitude of
     a number of supporters in your statement? - A. yes, sir.

0. And whilst there was the crowd at the turnstile were there
   other people coming into and pushing into the back of that
   crowd? - A. Yes, sir.

0.,. Was what you saw deliberate activity and determined? - A. The
     youngsters, some would be on the younger end as well , they
     were just pushing in the back of the supporters waiting, and
     they seemed to think it was a huge joke.

Q. Yes.    I think you spoke in your statement of people just
                                                 42

                                                                    G. CAMMACK


                         pushing into the backs and being bloody daft? - A. That is
                         right, sir.

                    0. Were these people pushing .into the back causing surges in the
                       crowd? - A. The were increasing the pressure on the rest of
                       rhe crowd all the time, causing problems further down the
                       line.
                B   G.   You saw you saw individuals withdraw from the crowd? - A.That
                         is right, and I had to withdraw them myself.

                    G.   In your statement you made a reference to one man in
                         particular who came out observing upon the sanity of those   who
                         were there? - A. Yes, very explicit.

                    0. Do you remember what he said? - A. He said something to the
                       effect of "Fucking mad.  Fucking mad".

                    Q. From what you observed was he describing just the behaviour of
                       one or two people? - A. I think he was commenting on the
                       situation as a whole, because he was halfway down the queue.

                    G. Did you observe a swelling in the crowd that occurred? - A.
                       It was increasing all the time I was there.
                D
                    0 . -.With individuals coming to it, not simply joining the back but^
                         forcing their way in? - A. Yes, sir.

                    0. And again was that just one or two people doing that or
                       substantial numbers? - A. Large numbers all the time.

                    G. You did what you could? - A. I did what I thought was right.

                    G.        LORD JUSTICE TAYLOR:   I would like to understand what
                         this pushing amounted to.  Obviously people come to the back
                         and pressing forward, that is one thing.  You are not
                         suggesting they came rushing into the back like forwards
                         arriving at a loose scrum in a rugby game, are you, and
                         put their heads down and went? - A. Literally some people, the
                         younger end, were just jumping into the backs of people
                         queueing in front of them.  It was that bad they were singing
                         and literally jumping into people with their arms up.   I
                         literally lost my temper with two or three and told them in no
                         uncertain circumstances to get themselves back.

                    G.        MR. WOODWARD:   You see the point that is being made that
                         those who were joining were .... - A. Not gentle pressure.

                    G. Not just gentle pressure or gentlemen joining the crowd, but
                       individuals who were as it were attacking the back of the
                       crowd? - A. Or being stupid.

                    G.   For whatever reason. - A. Yes.

                    G.   And adding totally unnecessary pressure with considerable
                H        force, causing those ahead to be embarrassed or further
                         embarrassed by the situation? - A. Yes, that is right.

                     Q.    And this was deliberate behaviour, may    beoutof foolishness
                          or stupidity, but it was deliberate? - A.I don't know if    it
                          was deliberate on their part or if they just did not care,-but
                          that is what happened.

                     Q. They were heedless of the consequences? - A. I think that
                        is the best way to put i t , y e s .
                 B
                     G.   Later on in your statement you talk of    people pushing and
                          chanting, and individuals being just wild to get in? - A. That
                          is right.  That is the impression I gained.

                     G. Are you intending to describe determined behaviour by a number
                        of people? - A. Very determined.

                                          Re-Examined bv MR. COLLINS:

                     G. Do I gather your impression was that the bulk of these people
                        behaving as Mr. Woodward has put to you were behaving like
                        that because they were being stupid? - A. The majority of
                        supporters there were reasonable, but there were t h e ....

                     0.   I am concerned with the minority you have been talking about
                 D        - A. The minority did not seem to have any reason.

                     Q. Were you'able to tell whether drink appeared to have played a
                        part in that? - A. You could smell drink from the crowd, but
                        basically you could not get near enough to the individuals
                        concerned because of the numbers to get the fumes. type of
                        thing.

                     Q. Was it your impression that these people were trying to get
                        their own way into the crowd to get nearer the front in order
                        to queue barge, if there were a queue, if you see what I
                        mean, or was it just they saw this crowd and thought it was
                        funny to jump on the back? - A. It was both.

                     G. A combination? - A. Yes.  There were some just barging through
                        and being ignorant and others seemed to think it was a huge
                        joke and pushing at the back.

                     0. The ones with whom you lost your temper, those were some who
                        appeared to think it was a joke, were they? - A. Both, again.

                     G. What was their reaction when you told them in no uncertain
                        terms to stop? - A. I got the standard reply, basically.

                     G. Which is "Fuck off", something like that? - A. Yes, sir.
                        because they knew I could not get to them.

                               MR. COLLINS:   Mr. Bow ne s, please.

                               LORD JUSTICE TAYLOR:   Can I just say, Mr. Collins, and
                          of course a great deal of it is simply reciting the history
                 H        which we have been through of the documentation.

          MR. COLLINS:   Sir, the whole purpose of my going through
     the documentation was to avoid having to repeat it through
     witnesses.  1 am mindful of that.  May I say for the benefit
     of the press what X propose to do is to treat Mr. Bownes'
     statement as his evidence without requiring him to go through
     it in any detail at all.

          LORD   JUSTICE TAYLOR:   Shall I make it clear to the press
     that that   means in this case the statement they have, of which
     they have   a copy, is the evidence-in-chief, so they can quote
     any of it   they want to.

          MR. COLLINS:   The same of course applied to the Fire
     witness and to Dr. Eastwood as well.

                           DAVID BOWNES Called

                        Examined bv MR. COLLINS:

G.    Mr. Bownes, you have heard that, and I take it you will
     confirm the accuracy of the statement which you made? - A.
     Yes, sir.

Q. You are the Chief Licensing Officer of the Sheffield City
   Council? - A. Yes. sir.

G. In the Administration and Legal Department? - A. Yes, sir.

G.   Mr. Bownes, football grounds are not the only licensing
     concern of the City Council.   Is that right? - A. That
     is right, sir, yes.

Q. You say in your statement that you have 33 different systems
   of licensing to administer? - A. That is correct, sir.

Q. Which range from taxis through sex shops, through.... - A.
   Cinemas, theatres, places of public entertainment and so on.

Q.   How many people do you have to assist you in this licensing
     concern? - A. Five in addition to myself.

G.   So there are six of you altogether? - A. Yes.

G. And if there have to be prosecutions for breaches of any of
  • the licensing requirements is that something your Department
    also handles? - A. Yes.

G. So the six of you have to handle not only control, you also
   have to handle prosecutions? - A. Yes.

Q. Have you found it possible generally to cope? - A. Yes, in
   general term s.

G. Does it mean you have to adopt a system of priorities? - A.
   Yes, sir.

Q. I am going to come to this later.      As you appreciate there has

                                                   D. BOWNES


     been on the face of it some degree of delay in attending to
     the Sheffield Wednesday football ground safety certificate? -
     A. Yes.

0. You, of course, come into the picture as a result of local
   government reorganisation which came into force in April 1986?-
   - A . Yes.

0. And that meant you became the licensing a u t h o r i t y in the place
   of the South Yorkshire County Council? - A. The City Council
   did, yes.

G. I say "you".  I mean the City Council.  When you realised you
   were going to have to take this over no doubt....

          LORD JUSTICE TAYLOR:     Just give me that date again?

          MR. COLLINS:   1st April 1986 is the change over day.
     The old Councils expired on 31st March and the new ones took
     over on 1st April:

G. Mr. Bownes, were there other licensing functions you took over
   from the old South Yorkshire apart from football grounds? - A.
   Not that the licensing section took over.  There were some
   others in relation to poisons and what have you that went to
   other Departments.

Q. But your Department, this was the only extra matter that you
   took over as a result of local government reorganisation? - A.
   Yes.

Q. You no doubt got from South Yorkshire the relevant files? - A.
   yes.

G.    And you familiarised yourself with those? - A. Yes.

G.    Did you go to Sheffield Wednesday ground? - A. Not in April
     1986, no.

G. When did you first go to the ground? - A. I believe that was
   later on that year.  The inspection was in August 1986.  I
   think there may have been a visit before that to deal with the
   Kop.

G. The other ground the City Council became concerned with was
   Sheffield United? - A. Yes.

G.    Were there any other grounds within the jurisdiction of the
     city? - A. Yes, sir, Owlerton turned up in August 1986
     designated as a new stadium.

Q. That had not then been designated when you took over, but it
   was thought it was about to be? - A. Yes.

Q. But the two most important ones at the time you took over were
   Sheffield Wednesday and Sheffield United? - A . Yes.
                                46


                                                  D. BOWNES


Q. We know Sheffield Wednesday had a safety certificate which had
   been issued in 1979 and which had never been changed? - A.
   Yes.

G. So far as Sheffield United was concerned did that have a
   safety certificate? - A. It did not.

G. Is there a safety certificate in being for Sheffield United
   now? - A. No, there is not.

G. When was it designated?

0.        LORD JUSTICE TAYLOR:    Has it been? - A. It has been
     designated, sir, yes.  I don't know, sir.

G. Is that a separate instrument? There was one especially for
   Hillsborough, I gather? - A. Yes, it was a separate one, a
   much later one, I think, owing to this question of moving up
   and down the Divisions.   I am not too sure when it was. I can
   find it out, though, sir.

G.        MR. COLLINS:   The result is Sheffield United has been
     operating without a safety certificate when it should have had
     one? - A. That is not quite right, sir.  Any designated ground
     can continue to operate as a sports ground provided an
     application has been submitted.  It is my understanding a n . -
     application has been submitted for Sheffield United.

G.        LORD JUSTICE TAYLOR:   Can you let us know when that was
     done? - A. That can certainly be found out.

G.        MR. COLLINS:   Anyway, had you ever been to Sheffield
     Wednesday, even as a paying customer or not? - A. No. sir.

Q. So the significance of whatever might have appeared in the
   safety certificate of itself would have meant nothing to you?
   Obviously when you read the files you could follow some of the
   history, but the details themselves meant very little? - A.
   The details of the safety  certificate are reasonably clear,
   sir.  It does not require knowledge of the ground as such.

G. I am sorry, I   am talking    about things like capacity and the
   layout of the   ground and    so on? - A. Obviously the layout of
   the ground is   a bit of a    closed book without the advantage of
   seeing it and   looking at    the plan.

G. Did you, for example, appreciate on reading through the files
   that ”there had been the creation of these pens on the West
   terraces? - A. No, sir, it was not immediately apparent to me.
   That is a very detailed matter which would require a great
   deal of research at the time.

G. So you were not aware of the significance when you took over
   of those pens and their effect or potential effect on the
   capacities? - A. No, sir, not at all, that would be true.

G. We know that the system under South Yorkshire had been via a

                         working party? - A. Yes.

                    Q. Which had inspected bi-annually? - A. Yes, for part of its
                       history.

                    Q. And had reported back to the relevant subcommittee of the
                       County Council?   It is not entirely clear precisely what its
                       status was? - A. That is entirely right, sir.  I am not sure
                B      what its status was, actually.

                    Q. And did you consider in any event that was something that was
                       rather unsatisfactory? - A. I regarded it as a matter that
                       perhaps needed clarifying somewhat, yes.

                    G. When you came into the picture you came in effectively with
                       the memorandum at page 313 of the core bundle attached to a
                       letter dated 5th June, with the report annexed to it. an
                       earlier report.  Have you got page 133? - A. Yes, I have.

                    G. If we look at the first sentence we see that there is a
                       reference to a report submitted to the March 1986 meeting,
                       which of course was the meeting which was held prior to take
                       over.

                D              LORD JUSTICE TAYLOR:   As I have it in front of me I
                         gather that Sheffield United was designated on 3rd July. 198-


                    G.          MR. COLLINS:   Which means, speaking from memory, it had
                          then to put in an application for a certificate once it had
                         .been designated? - A. No, sir, I believe would have to put in
                          an application immediately before it was designated.

                    Q. That is right.  It was then up to the relevant licensing
                       authority to decide on what were the particular terms required
                       in any safety certificate? - A. Strictly, sir, to determine
                       whether or not the applicant was a qualified person.

                    G. It has taken effectively therefore 5 years? - A. Yes, sir.

                    G. And there is still no safety certificate? - A. That is right,
                       sir.  I should explain that the County Council on its
                       dissolution was about to issue a safety certificate for it
                       pending the completion of certain works that the Fire Service
                       required.  I understand those works were not completed by the
                       time of the dissolution of the County Council.

                    G. We are not strictly concerned with Sheffield United.    Let us
                       come back to Sheffield Wednesday.    Can I just ask you as a
                       matter of introduction, and I am sorry this is not in our core
                       bundle, but it is page 122 of your bundle, Mr. Bownes, because
                       this is the March 1986 report, just in order to put the whole
                       matter in context.    I say "your report", it is under Mr.
                       Pens am ’s name but drafted by you? - A. Yes, sir, that is the
                       normal practice.
                H   G. I am not suggesting otherwise.     It is so we know it was you

                           speaking, although Mr. Pensam adopted what you had said. - A.
                           Yes, but I would not seek to transfer responsibility by that,
                           sir.

                        0. No, I fully understand that, as I am sure anyone who has any
                           knowledge of local government also understands.  Really, what
                           you are doing there is recording that the Gity Council will
                           have to take over as a result of the legislation, and you
                    B      refer to the Bradford disaster and the Popplewell Report, and
                           indicate that a more detailed report will be submitted as soon
                           as possible? - A. Yes, sir.

                        0. And really you recommend the delegations, that the General
                           Purposes Panel should have the powers under the 1975 Act? - A.

Q. So can we come on, please, to the report at our page 313
   or your page 124, whichever you prefer? Nov;, you refer
   to the current situation which was inherited. You say two
   sports grounds currently subject.   First, Sheffield
   Wednesday. Yes, if I bother to look I .... Sheffield
   Wednesday designated in August, 1978, certificate issued
   December, 1979, undergoing major works to The Kop. And
   then you refer to Sheffield United and indicate that it
   was hoped that the Council would be in a position to
   issue a certificate before the start of the 86/87 season.
   Then you refer to Owlerton which is expected to be des­
   ignated.  Can I ask you to look over the page, please,
   at the paragraph safety certificate, standard conditions?
   You indicate tfie desirability of standardisation for
   obvious reasons.   Then you say this, "The conditions do,
   however, give some cause for concern as they appear to be
   inadequate or inappropriate in some areas." Now, the only
   conditions or the only safety certificate that existed
   was of course Sheffield Wednesday's.   Is that right? - A.
   That is correct, sir, yes.

Q. And therefore the inadequacy and inappropriateness of the
   conditions in some areas must have referred, must it not,
   to Sheffield Wednesday, on the face of it? - A. It did,
   sir, ves.

Q. Can you help us, please, as to what conditions you consider
    to be either inadequate or inappropriate?- A. Yes.   I
    should explain, sir, first of all, that that phrase is
    what, if I may use one of Dr. Eastwood's comments, is a
  :
  • daft phrase, to be honest.  It was not carefully thought
    out by the look of it. In fact it is ray view that there
    were no fatal errors in the conditions themselves.
    There were certain areas that needed tightening up.
    For example, it refers to the County Council throughout
    whereas it should of course now refer to the City Council.

Q. Well, yes, that is a fairly obvious one but that does not
   make much difference, does it? I think in the legislation
   there was a provision, was not there, an interim provision,
   which effectively provided that in any document where
   County Council appeared read relevant .... - A. Yes, sir.
   The point I was making was that is the sort of order of
   defect that there was in the certificate.

Q.        LORD JUSTICE TAYLOR:    Really one would not get that
     impression from this, not talking about .... - A. Yes, I
     agree with you entirely, sir. On looking at it again in
     the light of this Inquiry I would entirely agree the words
     are wrong ....

Q. So there x*as nothing that gave cause for concern? - A.
   The conditions gave some cause for concern in that there
   were were drafting corrections that needed to be made.

                                                   D. BOWNES

Q.        MR. COLLINS:   Was there anything of substance that
     you had identified that needed to be addressed? - A. There
     was nothing, if you like, fatal in the conditions that I
     could see that needed to be addressed immediately.

Q. If I had been asking you in May of 1986, Mr. Bownes, which
   conditions do you regard as inadequate and_ which do you
   regard as inappropriate what would you have told me? - A.
   Exactly what I have told you already, sir. As I have
   explained, the wording is inappropriate. There is no
   question about that.

Q.Did anyone on the committee ask, as far as you are aware,
   which were the inadequacies and which were the .... - A.
   I cannot honestly recall, sir.  It is an awful long time.

Q.        LORD JUSTICE TAYLOR:    If it is just a question of
     changing South Yorkshire to Sheffield City it would hardly
     merit, if you look further down, a redraft of conditions
     would of course be submitted to the Fire Service, the
     Police and building surveyor for .... - A. I think in
     anticipating the redrafting, sir, I anticipated there may
     be changes that would be needed as well,simply to update
     things.   Changes may have occurred at the ground that
     needed reflecting.

Q.        MR. COLLINS:   Why? Were you aware on looking through
     the file that there were changes that had occurred which
     would need reconsideration of the certificate or was this
     just an assumption? - A. It was an assumption, sir. I
     believe conditions that had been in operation for that long
     could well require review and people might well have
     changed their views as to the sort of things that needed
     addressing.

Q. But if South Yorkshire had been doing its job properly
   surely you would have expected it to pass on a note, or
   your opposite number in South Yorkshire to pass on a
   note, saying look, this needs to be dealt with or that
   needs to be dealt with?- A. Yes, sir.  I find with
   certificate conditions and what have you that people
   tend to take them as read for years without constructively
   looking at them to decide whether or not they ought to be
   changed.  That is my experience with other conditions the
   Council has been involved in in licensing areas.

Q. So what you are saying is your experience told you that
   it would be sensible to have a fresh look at these? - A.
   Yes, sir.

Q. And you intended to mean no more than that when you used
   these words inadequate or inappropriate? - A. Yes, sir.

Q. Well, if that is right, Mr. Bownes,I think one is inclined
                                                  51


                                                                         D. BOWNES

                           to agree it was a daft expression to use. - A. It was, sir.
                           I would fully support that. That is right.

                        Q. On the face of it, it goes a lot further than that, does not
                           it? - A. Yes, sir, without question.

                        Q. Yes, I see. Did you have available a draft certificate
                           for Sheffield United? - A. Yes, sir, I believe there was
                    B      one copy on the Sheffield United file.

                        Q. Because you also refer to the redraft where appropriate
                           and to submit to the panel for approval and then go on,
                           "The Sheffield United certificate could then be issued
                           with the new conditions before the start of the &S/87
                           season." That rather suggests that you had spotted
                           something other than mere drafting natters in the
                           Sheffield United certificate which you thought ought
                           to be brought up-to-date or changed?- A. No, I would
                           not accept that necessarily, sir.  I must admit I have
                           not read the Sheffield United certificate recently
                           so I cannot really say what that comment referred to.

                        Q. I see. Now, over the page you refer to an attempt to
                           get the Health and Safety Executive in the picture. - A.
                    D      Yes.

                        Q. Was that in the .hope that it would take the burden off
                           the City Council and your shoulders?- A. Not at all, sir.
                           It came from a recommendation in the Popplewell Report.

                        Q. I know it did but was your hope that if the Health and
                           Safety could be persuaded to involve themselves this would
                           mean that your department would not have to shoulder the
                           responsibility? - A. I cannot see how that could happen, sir,
                           The Council is the certificating authority ....

                        Q. Well, I know. - A.      and therefore carrys the can any way.

                        Q. I see.  So there was no hope of getting someone else to
                           carry out some work that otherwise you might have to do?
                           - A. I do not agree with the way you phrase that, sir, to
                           be honest.  I would have hoped the Health and Safety
                           Executive could have put a useful input into the Council's
                           advisory system, if you like, for certificating.

                        Q. I follow. Now, one of the matters that I think you spotted
                           when you received the safety certificate from the County
                           Council was that the plans had not been signed, is that
                           right, the plans .... - A. No, sir.

                        0. When you say "No, sir" you mean they had not been signed?
                           - A. No, sir.  I had not spotted anything about the plans,
                           to be quite honest.

                        Q. Can I ask you to ‘cok at paragraph 130 of your proof?     Do
                H

you see you refer in that paragraph first of all to
sections of the Act and then you say under Schedule
1 of the certificate the definition of plans is - we
can see this at our page 107, I think - document or
documents attached to and forming part of the general
safety certificate and signed by the person signing
the certificate. When the files were hand-ed over to
the Sheffield City Council in April, 1986, a copy of
the general safety certificate was in an envelope
together with a number of plans none of which were
signed by Mr. Mallett,the original signatory of the
certificate.  This, do I understand from your answer
you gave a moment ago, this is something you have
spotted since? - A. Yes, sir, that is entirely correct.

But you did not spot that at the time? - A. I did not,
sir, no.

One thing that has  not come out and I am looking at your
paragraph 134 in the history so far is that it would
appear that there were one or two amendments to the
safety certificate which had not been incorporated in
the certificate itself? - A. Yes, sir, those are a
mystery to m e .

Again, is that a. matter which you have discovered since
this tragedy and you have been investigating for the
purpose of giving evidence? - A. Yes, sir. As you will
appreciate, for the benefit of the Inquiry, considerable
work has gone into   the files to extract all relevant
information as far as possible.

Maybe slightly surprising, Mr. Bownes, that that had not
been done in the last three or four years, three years,
rather, since the City Council was considering what ought
to be in the safety certificate? - A. Yes. The impression
I had on taking over the administrative system was that
everything was O.K., everybody was happy with what was
going off essentially.

Well, one thing that must have become perfectly - well, no,
I will come to that later. Any way, there were apparently
amendments to the conditions, details of which we have not
seen, but they are somewhere on the file, are they, indic­
ating wording amendments to conditions 10 and 26, wording
amendments to 10 and a time limit variation on 26? ~ A.
Yes,_sir. They are not actually on this file, though
they can be produced if required.

You mean they were not even on the right file, they were
on a different file? - A. No, sir. They are not in this
file here.

I follow.   I am not asking you to produce them. - A. Mo.

                            You refer to them there, and I imagine they are not
                            enormously material or are they? - A. No, I do not
                            think they are, sir, no.

                            Just indicates a slight, if one may be forgiven to use
                            the word, sloppiness in approach to what goes into the
                            safety certificate? - A. That is a matter of speculation
               B            as to what the County Council actually did ....

                                 LORD JUSTICE TAYLOR:   Sorry. Would you speak up?
                            - A. Sorry.  It is a auestion of speculation there as to
                            what the County Council actually did and what they
                            intended by these alterations.  It is not possible to
                            pick that up from the file.

                                 MR. COLLINS:   Any way we know that there was a
                            meeting at the ground in August of 1986. Is that right?
                            - A. The inspection, sir?

                       Q.   Inspection, yes. - A. Yes, sir.

                       Q.   And you attended that, did you? - A. I did, sir, yes.

                   D   Q.   And I think you told us you had been to the ground before
                            that? - A. Yes, sir.

                            Was that correct? The purpose of that inspection was
                            what, as you understood it?- A. It was one of the inspections
                            of the ground, the usual ones the County Council used*to
                            organise, sir.

                       Q.   Yes. And also was it, as you understood it, to view the new
                            works that had been completed at the Kop? - A. No,sir.

                       Q-   That was wholly separate, was it? - A. That was an entirely
                            separate issue.  If I could just mention, I had previously"
                            been to Sheffield Wednesday on the 10th of July, 1986, to
                            discuss questions of the ICop.

                       Q-        LORD JUSTICE TAYLOR:   2 0 t h o f July? - A. No, sir.
                            The 10th of July.

                       Q-   Was that the first lvisit you ever made? - A. To the best
                            of my recollection, sir, yes.

                       Q.   10th of July, 1986. - A. Yes.

     the composition of the - what do you call it - safety
q    committee? - A. At that stage, sir, it was the working
     party still.

Q. Still the working party? - A. Yes, sir.

Q. And what was your intention about its composition and how
   it should work and its responsibilities? -A. I had formed
   no intention at that stage, sir. Formed a number of views,
   but the intention was at that stageit should operate as
   the old working party did.

Q. Now, it would appear that_the old working party had no
   chairman? - A. To be quite honest, sir, I have not really
   been able to establish how the old working party worked
   as such.

Q. It does not matter how the old one worked. How did yours
   work when it started its operations ? - A. Well, sir, it
   started its operation strictly, if I may go back in histo

   a while to a meeting that took place on Friday, the 4th o
   July, 1986. That was a meeting to discuss a letter from
   Dr. Eastwood, the 26th of June, relating to The Kop.   I
   recall that that letter included a number of plans, I
   believe, sir, and there were discussions about what was
   going to happen in relation to them.   Immediately prior
   to that meeting, sir, I formed the view I was going to
   follow exactly as far as I could what the old County
   Council had done, as  far as Icould understand it, in
   relation to preparing notes of meetings and so on and
   so forth. However, sir, I was struck at that time,
   within a few minutes of getting into the meeting, that
   there were potentially serious problems with the Kop,
   particularly from the point of view of the-Fire Service.

Q.        LORD JUSTICE TAYLOR:  It is very difficult to hear
     you.  I am sorry. Would you bring the microphone closer
     and try and speak a little louder? - A. Yes.

Q. Now, after the meeting in August, 1986, and the approval of
   the extension of the Kop, what was the next matter that the
   City Council did in relation to the safety certificate, the
   review of the safety certificate? Can you help us about that.
   Mr. Bownes? - A. I am not sure to what you are referring.

Q. You had indicate in that minute we looked at in May 1966 you
   were intending to redraft the safety certificate, ana you were
   going to seek comments from the interested parties, that is
   the Fire Service, the Police and the Building Surveyor? - A.
   Yes, sir.

Q. And you started that process, did you? - A. If I can refer to
   some notes I have made, sir?

0. Yes, of course.  I just wanted to find out when that process
   started.  It would seem to have been in the late autumn of
   1986. but I will be corrected if I am wrong. - A. Perhaps it
   might be useful for me to go through a chronology of this?

Q. If you have got a chronology that would be very helpful.

0.        LORD JUSTICE TAYLOR:   We have not got it in this bundle,
     have we? - A. I think it can be made available, sir.

Q. We have not got it in the bundle? - A. It is not in this
   bundle at the moment.

Q. Is there a copy?

          MR. MAXWELL:    There is, sir.   There is a copy I have
     made available to Mr. Collins.

          MR. COLLINS:    This is the chronology we are talking
     about?

          MR. MAXWELL:   Yes, sir, and I think it is the schedule
     of safety conditions at the end, its chronology set out with
     letters.  I have not got 20 copies but I can get them.

          THE WITNESS:   I believe it is the last two pages of the
     document you have, sir.

G.        MR. COLLINS:   Yes.  You had asked other Councils for
     copies of their safety certificates and their conditions, and
     you had done that in April and May 1986? - A. That is correct.

G. And in June 1986 you sent a memorandum....

          LORD JUSTICE TAYLOR:   If this is tabulated in some form
     I would very much like to have it rather than have to write it
     all down again.

           MR. MAXWELL:   Yes, I am sending someone off now to do
     it.

           LORD JUSTICE TAYLOR:   I will listen and get a copy

                         afterwards.

                              MR. COLLINS:     I was handed this by Mr. Maxwell this
                         morning:

                    Q. Let me take it fairly quickly because copies will be made
                       available, and we can see them later.  18th April, 1966. you
                       refer to a response from Liverpool enclosing copies of their
                B      safety certificate conditions.

                              MR. MAXWELL:   I hesitate to interrupt, but in the mean
                         time could I offer you mine, marked somewhat as it is, but it
                         may assist you.

                              LORD JUSTICE TAYLOR:      I will be patient.

                    Q.        MR. COLLINS:   6th May 1986, meeting of General Purposes
                         Panel, the resolution we have seen.  That is in our bundle,
                         313.  29th May your Chief Executive writes to his opposite
                         numbers in Birmingham, Manchester and Leeds asking for their
                         safety certificates? - A. Yes, sir.

                    0. 5th June memo to building surveyor, and letters containing the
                       same comments to the Chief Constable and Chief Fire Officer,
                D      informing them that the certificate conditions were shortly to
                       be redrafted when they would be asked for comments. That was
                       putting them on notice they were going to be asked for
                       comments but not actually asking them? - A. That is right.

                    Q. You get a reply from Birmingham on 10th June.  You      write to
                       your opposite numbers in Barnsley and Doncaster on      4 tn July
                       inviting consultation, because they had taken over      some of the
                       old South Yorkshire grounds in their jurisdiction?      - A. Yes,
                       and Rotherham Council as well.

                    Q. And Rotherham.  29th August you get some response from the
                       Home Office? - A. Yes, sir.  I don't think that should be in
                       there.  It is not really relevant.

                    Q. We will forget about that.       - A. The next entry is 24tn
                       September.

                    Q. You get a copy from Manchester.   I can see you were doing
                       that, but you did not start the process of asking for the
                       specific comments of the Fire Service, the Building Department
                       and the Police, it would seem until November 1986 or
                       thereabouts, because if you look at our page 374.... - A. I
                       think. I can speed this up a bit.  The drafting of the safety
                       certificate conditions actually took place during the 6 months
                       January-June 1987.

                    Q. Yes, I -follow that. All I am asking you about at the moment
                       is when you requested the input to help you with the drafting
                       from the Fire, Police and Building Department? - A. That was
                       on 7th July, 1987.
                H   Q. 7th July?       No, you told them you were going to ask them on 7th

                         July? - A. I think you have mistaken 1986 and 1987.

                    Q. You say you did not ask them until July 1987? - A. Yes.

                    G.       LORD JUSTICE TAYLOR:      About a year later? - A. Yes.

                    G.        MR. COLLINS:   I think you are doing yourself an
                         injustice there, Mr. Bownes, because unless I have misread the
               B         purpose of the letter at page 374 you had asked in November
                         1986.

                              MR. MAXWELL:   I hesitate to say the purpose has been
                         misunderstood, but I think it has, because it is a response to
                         another letter asking whether the Fire Service has any
                         comments about the ground rather than in the context of safety
                         certificate conditions.

                              MR. COLLINS:   I follow.  I got myself into the same mess
                         before as I remember, in relation to the Fire documents:

                    Q. It was not until July 1987 that you asked for the input that
                       had been referred to in the meeting of May 1986.  Is that
                       right? - A. Yes, sir.

                D   G. It seems to have taken, with respect, an awful long time to
                       get round to asking for their comments? - A. Yes, sir.    The
                       problem essentially was that the exercise which I originally '
                       anticipated would be relatively straightforward was not.    By
                       looking at the other Council certificates I noticed very much
                       in the way that M r . Justice Popplewell noticed that matters
                       differed considerably between authorities. It took me a great
                       deal of time to wrestle with that and to try and get it down
                       and take the best bits of each certificate and put them
                       together.

                    Q. That was the problem,    was it? - A. It was a very great
                       problem, yes, sir.

                    Q. Having requested that you, I think, had a draft report for a
                       meeting in September 1987 which appears on our page 417? Is
                       that correct, or your page 128, whichever you prefer. - A.
                       Yes, a report to the General Purposes Panel in September 1987.

                    Q.   What you     say there, I think so far as relevant is that you
                         refer back under the heading, "Current situation” to the
                         pa n e l ’s meeting in May 1986, and identified several main areas
                         for further investigation? - A. Yes, sir.

                    Q. Then you deal with the review of the administrative system and
                       say it is going to be changed.  In the meantime presumably
                       there had been an inspection meeting in August 1987, or the
                       summer of 198/, or not? - A. yes, there had been one in 1-987.

                    G.   That was  under the old system again, was it? - A. No, sir,
                         that wasunder the new system slightly anticipating this
                         report, where individual officers were asked to submit
                         comments in writing, which indeed happened.

                                                                        D. BOWNES



                       Q. That we can see, for example, at - no we c a n ’t. - A. It is in
                          my bundle.

                       0. I am not particularly concerned with that because no doubt it
                          was sensible to anticipate what was clearly a sensible
                          reorganisation.  I d o n ’t doubt that at all. Can I get
                          absolutely clear what was the new system as you understood it
                   B      that was going to operate? - A.     The inspection system or the
                          administrative system, sir?

                       0. First of all the inspection system? - A. Yes, sir.  My
                          impression was that the best way of operating an inspection
                          system like this was to persuade officers to submit the
                          comment subsequently in writing and then those comments would
                          be submitted to the club, which would make it reasonably clear
                          what exactly was being raised and who was raising it in order
                          that the matter could be dealt with more efficiently than I
                          thought had been done in the past.  So it occurred to me that
                          some of the working party minutes did not make it clear who
                          was saying what in relation to matters.

                       G. I follow that, but you would have an annual inspection? - A.
                          Y'es .
                   D
                       Q. That would take how long, was it anticipated? One day, two
                        : -days? - A. In terms of officer time or in terms of time on the.
                           ground?

                       Q. In terms of time actually on the ground?     A. That would take
                          perhaps a full day, I would have thought.

                       Q. Who would decide which parts were to be inspected? - A. That
                          would be for the individual officers to form their own views.
                          They would go to the areas they were most concerned with.

                       Q. Was there a chairman of that group? - A. No, sir, it can't
                          work like that effectively.  This is a very similar system to
                          that used for public entertainment inspections in those sort
                          of premises, where officers simply go to the areas they are
                          particularly interested in in order to obtain their comments
                          or make comments.

                       0. Did you attend? - A. Yes, 1 did.

                       G. What parts did you look at? - A. I c a n ’t recall offhand, sir.

                       G. What did you consider to be the area with which you were
                          concerned when you went on these inspections? - A. Any area
                          which somebody pointed out to me was a matter for concern, for
                          example, sir.

                       0. Such as? - A. I c a n ’t actually recall what happened on the
                          inspection, sir.

                       0. Did you have any knowledge of what you were going to look for?
                   H      - A. No, sir.  As far as I am concerned I am not an expert.

                                                                          D, BOWNES



                        Q. I follow that.  - A. I rely on the advice of experts, and they
                           have frequently given advice on various matters relating to
                           safety.  My job as I saw it was to ensure that the inspectors
                           could go where they wanted to, were not obstructed in any way
                           - there was no suggestion they were ever obstructed - and to
                           ensure they had all the information they needed to carry out
                           their job.
                    B   Q. Did you have an advance meeting before you went on this
                           inspection to discuss among yourselves what you should look
                           for an so on? - A. Not as I recall in those terms. All the
                           services involved are very familiar with doing inspections in
                           this way.

                        0. Did you have a meeting afterwards to decide what each of you
                           required to be done or was it simply left to the individual to
                           write a letter to you? - A. Individuals wrote a letter, sir.

                        Q. To you? - A. To me.

                        Q. And you would send on to the club? You would write to the
                           club incorporating such of the points as you thought the club
                           ought to know about? - A. No, sir.  What happened on this
                    D      occasion is that the newly set up advisory group, which is
                           referred to in this report in September 1987, considered the
                           various comments made by the Building Surveyor and the .
                           Environmental Health Department, and from their input I .was
                           able to extract a list of comments to send to the club.

                        Q. The advisory group was going to consist of who? - A. The Fire
                          . Service, the Police, the Building Surveyor, the Health &
                            Consumer Services and ourselves, sir.

                        0.       LORD JUSTICE TAYLOR;   You have got a working party which
                             consists of these.  They conduct an inspection? - A. Yes.

                        Q. With you there.  They then write to you with their comments on
                           the inspection for consideration by an advisory group? - A.
                           Yes.

                        Q. Which is the same outfit? - A. Yes, sir, effectively.

                        Q. Then I don't understand.  It is probably my fault, but I don't
                           understand the difference between the working party and the
                           advisory group at the moment. - A. There is none effectively.
                           It is simply a change of name.

                        Q.    Why do you call it something different? - A. Because that    more
                             accurately reflected what it did, sir.

                        Q.       MR. COLLINS:   Are there two different bodies? One goes
                             and does the inspection and then reports back to another
                             group? - A. No, sir.

                        Q.    It is the same group? - A. It is the same individuals. The
                H            individuals do not inspect as a group.

Q.          LORD JUSTICE TAYLOR:   What we have got then is a change
        of nomenclature.  What was the officer working party is now
        going to be the advisory group? - A. Yes, sir.

Q. And the officer working party can be buried.           Is that it? - A.
   Yes.

Q. As a name? - A. Yes, sir.

q   .       MR. COLLINS:   I am sorry, but this meeting you attend at
        the ground, is that all the advisory group going along on the
        same day? - A. It is not a meeting as such.  It is an
        inspection.

0.      I am sorry.  This inspection of the ground, is this all the
        advisory group going along on the same day? - A. Yes, it is
        representatives from all the authorities going there and
        inspecting.

Q. And then you have a meeting after that to decide what should
   be done? - A. When the comments are in, if it is appropriate
   to do so.

0.      E a c h after that •-inspection-writes you a letter indicating what'
        •he has seen that he considers ought to be put to the club? -
        A. Yes, sir.

Q.      You receive all those letters?    - A. Yes.

Q.       Y'outhen put them together and  decide what should go to the
        club.    Is that right? - A. No, as I have just explained....

G. You have another meeting of the advisory group? - A. No, a
   meeting, not another meeting.

G.          LORD JUSTICE TAYLOR:   You have an inspection. Now   you
        are having a meeting.  The same personnel? - A. Sometimes the
        same personnel, sir.   It depends who is available at the time.

Q. That meeting is not on site.          That is round a table somewhere?
   - A. yes, sir.

G. And if something like removal of a barrier is proposed at a
   meeting of that kind you consider it is down to you to decide
   whether it happens or it does not? - A. No, sir, that is not
   right at a l l .

G. Well, I have misunderstood what you said before about
   delegation. - A. When the comments are collated and brought
   together then they are submitted to the club acting under the
   appropriate delegated power, sir, after they have been
   discussed if necessary.

G. They are submitted to the club, you say? - A.           Yes. sir.

                        Q. And then? - A. And then the club takes action and the
                           individual members check the work has been done.

                        Q. Forgive me, but can I just get this clear in my mind. At what
                           point is the city's approval given and by whom? - A. At the
                           point the letter goes out to the club with the consolidated
                           comments, sir.
                    B
                        0. But between the meeting of the advisory group and your sending
                           that letter out, has anyone other than you from the city
                           considered it? - A. No, sir, effectively not.

                        G. So it is your decision as-far as the city is concerned as to
                           whether it goes to the club with approval? - A. Yes, sir,

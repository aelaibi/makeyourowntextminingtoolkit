Dear Sir

        Having seen the programme on the Hiliborough disaster,
recently screened, on I.T.V, I have come to my own conclusion that
the South Yorkshire Police appear to have some very serious
questions still to answer. I am concerned that there are many
issues that were not raised during the original inquest and I
fully support your campaign for a new inquest and urge you to
continue to lobby your M.P. and the Home Secretary until positive
steps are taken to find the truth of what did actually happen on
that tragic day.
In closing X would be grateful if you would pass on my best
wishes to all the families involved and assure you that if I can
be of any assistance in the future please d o n ft hesitate to
contact me.




Yours Faithfully

                                   <
 6th December 1996



 I am writing to you having seen the TV programme about the Hillsborough Disaster
 shown here in Scotland last night. It brought back vividly the horror of that
 ° ^ rahsi° n’ f nd ' WJS distressed to learn that the authorities still not have done very
 ^jured           6     pain and anguish for the relatives of those who were killed or


 I have to assume that those relatives intend to continue in a quest for justice and
 that is why I am writing. I may be of some minor help because of an experience at
 a football match in Nottingham’s City Ground in late 1983 when Celtic played
 to th n U   m ' m h UEF^ CuP tie- The circumstances bore an uncanny resemblance
 to those at Hillsborough with the fortunate difference that there was no loss of life
 and only slight injuries.


     ml Ch,Wf f ”'!lCket’ and 1*oined the lineuP at the turnstiles about an hour
before the kickoff. Because the turnstiles were in close proximity to a parkinq lot
the queues were angled to the side (See diagram which accompanies this le tte r)...
there were police on duty, some on horseback and the crowd which was
               was under control... only a handful of turnstiles were in operation
probably because it was an all-ticket game - and that caused some of the problems
... after 45 minutes in the queue I had advanced only about two yards, and many in
the crowd now swelling with later arrivals were becoming anxious ... a more senbr
              made the decision to open up an exit gate and siphon off the crowd
and this was done in an orderly m anner... the crowd entered the City Ground       ’
through this gate and no attempt was made to collect or check tickets.

 At the time, I thought in general that this was a smart move on the part of the police
as it meant spectators would get into the ground in time for the match ... B u t... at the
top of the flight of stairs three or four policemen, vastly disinterested in the
proceedings, were lounging or leaning against barricades .. the Glasqow
supporters unfamiliar with the layout of the ground, asked for directions ... the
police nodded or pointed to one entrance to the terracing. This part of the qround
was rapidly becoming overcrowded, dangerously so - and yet the police were
doing nothing to stop more and more hundreds from entering i t ... meanwhile other
parts of the same terracing adjacent to this corner were comfortably filled and had
lots of room available ... unfortunately, there was no access to those parts from that
particular corner, nor was there any possibility of going back up the terracinq ...
within a minute or so of the kickoff, the spectators were chanting “W e are
                in T iSOn’ and went 0ver the waN and onto the Pitch until something
could be done ... there was no violence and , although the match was halted for
several minutes, the players were in no danger and stood chatting to “the-invaders”
... the next day the newspapers, at least the tabloids, wrote about field invasions
and football hooligans.

I was there, and I can remember being part of that well-behaved crowd; I can
remember being moved several yards to right and left as the crowd swayed; I can
remember realising that for some seconds my feet were not touching the ground
and that there was nothing I could do about it. The TV programme brought back
some of those memories - and made me angry yet again.

I think that your legal advisers might consider the following points, which might
indicate a common policy practised to exercise crowd control:

1:- the actual number of turnstiles in operation at all-ticket matches;

2:-the habit of the police in opening exit gates to allow spectators to enter the
ground at the last minute;

3:- the lack of direction given by police or stewards to visiting spectators unfamiliar
with the ground.



I am an educated person, the owner of a large guest house here in Edinburgh, and
I write books about the history of Scottish football. I would like to be of some
assistance, and feel that, along with my co-author (who may still have his
uncollected ticket for that match in 1983), we might make reliable witnesses if
required. W e would be willing to make a sworn affadavit if that would be of any
assistance. Feel free to contact me at this address.

Yours sincerely,

6th December, 1996.

Dear Hillsborough Families and Survivors,

Like many people I am writing to you following the screening of the Hillsborough
docu-drama on 5th December. I feel a deep sense of grief, anger and outrage at what
occured in April 1989 - the manner in which it occured, and the shameful way in which
the survivors, and the victims' families and loved ones were treated afterwards.

I have spent many many hours watching football - mostly in the old days standing on
the terraces. I am sure like everyone who has ever attended a big match, I have
experienced a "surge" on the terraces, and a "crush" in the tunnel. It seems so
obvious now that a disaster like Hillsborough was just waiting to happen, and so I
must be one of the millions of fortunate ones because it didn't happen to me or anyone
I know and love.

What is it that happened in our country that made the police and the authorities view
spectators of our national sport as hooligans who needed to be caged. Where did the
switch happen so that what I used to call a "celebration" became an "pitch invasion".
How can they ever have thought of putting up fences with spikes on? How can they
have got it all so badly wrong?

You deserve our gratitude that it was you and yours who paid this terrible price and
possibly saved some of our lives along the way. But you also deserve justice and
compensation.

I do not know what routes remain open to you to pursue this justice. I only hope and
pray that you get it, and when you do that it affords you some peace in your lives.

Yours sincerely,

Please find enclosed correspondence between myself and West Midlands Police.

At the time of the disaster I was living in 1    LReading and sent the letter to the West
Midlands Police as soon as I could because I was so incensed by their incompetence.

I was visited by two police officers at my home and their level of questioning was such that I felt
that it would get the inquiry nowhere. The two officers also presented me with a plan o f the
Leppings lane terrace that could only be described as deliberately misleading. I was then asked to
locate my movements on a grid diagram. I am an Architect and I should know how something as
important as this should be drawn in order that a clear picture of events be presented to an inquiry.

On the diagram there were no indications of fences, barriers, walls or writing telling you which way
up the drawing should be, so it was only my personal skill of being able to identify the general area
that was of any use. The diagram was not, in my opinion to any scale. What I am suggesting is that
if I could not understand it, how could anybody else and therefore an inaccurate picture could have
been formulated. The police employ Architects to produce diagrams for this kind of eventuality but
the one I had to fill in was ‘childlike’.

How could a Pathologist describe the effects of a crush without an accurate pattern of the events 1.

I hope this information is of some use to you and I will be more than willing to act as an expert
witness if called upon to do so. If there is anything else you need for help (drawings, plans etc.),
please don’t hesitate to ask.

Good Luck.

Yours,

Dear Sir

HILLSBOROUGH DISASTER - 15 APRIL 1989

I only feel it is right to record the details of the sequence of events frcm
the way I saw them on the day.

Firstly, I must say that I have been a Liverpool supporter for many years and
have travelled to see them play in numerous forms and sizes of stadium, both
seated and standing, in this country and throughout Europe. I am 26 years of
age and since 1984 have left ray native Merseyside to live and work in
Reading.

I travelled to Sheffield frcm my parents hone in Widnes, Cheshire, with a
friend, leaving at approximately 12.40 pm, a later start than was anticipated,
due to a problem with the car and intending to travel into Sheffield by using
the A 5:?. snake pass route, therefore avoiding traffic on the troubled M62, Ml
route. However, we were to be held up for quite sane time in both Stockport
and Glossop en route. In Sheffield, sate 2 miles away fron the ground,
roadside Police Officers, having questioned us as to which team we were
supporting, directed us to park approximately % mile away fran the ground in a
side street adjacent to a park. I closed the door of the car and checked my
watch - it was 2.55 pm.

 Already, we could hear the cheers frcm inside the ground. We made our way
 down a steep road, past an old school building and the crowd was gathering
 into fairly large numbers and walking quite briskly to/ards the Leppings Lane
 end of the ground. I was confronted, along with everybody else, by a line of
 six Police horses, positioned nose to tail as a barrier adjacent to the open,
 iron gates before the terracing.

 While waiting for the nenacing task of passing between one horse's mouth and
 another's backside, I checked the time - it as 3.02 pn and fans were scaling
 the wall adjacent to the turnstiles and were left alone by the Police and
 ground Officials.
                                    - 2 -




It was at this point, to ray utter amazement, that a large blue sliding folding
door to the left of the turnstiles slid open - this was also witnessed by my
friend. A large number of people passed through the gate, including fans with
tickets who had left their queues for the turnstiles, obviously to get in more
quickly (just like the new till being opened at the Post Office).

Having passed through the ordeal of the horses, I, along with my friend, made
my way to the third turnstile fran the left, everybody around me had tickets.
It was crowded but there was no crush. The Police located between the horses
and the turnstiles were silent. No indication was given as to the condition
of the crowd inside the ground and fran the manent I reached the close
proximity of the ground, right up until the turnstile, I did not see a ground
Steward, nor did I receive any direction to a position on the terrace. I did
not hear anything over the P.A. system.

Once through the turnstile, not a single Police Officer, Steward or any other
ground Official offered advice as to the situation inside the ground or any
alternative direction for passageway onto the terraces. My friend and I had
to make our cwn choice. A natural route to follow was into the central tunnel
beneath the main stand at the Leppings Lane end.

More than half way into the tunnel, I   suggested that we vent into the left
hand entrance onto the terrace. Both    entrances onto the terrace were crowded
and very tight with people. The game    was still in play and crowd surges
forced my friend and myself apart. I    was thrown quickly to my left and
managed to stay upright.

At this point I must say that crcwd surges in the initial stages of a football
match are normal and soon after kick-off, normally, people find their own
 (limited) space and remain comfortable for the rest of the gane.

The game had been stopped and Police Officers (3 no.) were gesturing with
their arms for the crowd to push back - their voices could not be heard and
none of the 3 Officers on the wall at the botton of the terrace or anybody
else on the pitch did not have a 'loud hailer' type, hand held loudspeaker.
Because of the noise of the crcwd, I could not hear the announcements made on.
the Public Address system.

My position at this point was 6 - 1 0 people deep, right of centre of the
terrace. The crowd surged forward again and I became held up against a
barrier. I held off another surge that frightened me because my hips were
pressed against the barrier and-tighfely and I began to get anggy.

I am a level headed, rational person and realised the situation was
dangerous, only at this point because of previous ground experience. The
Officers on the wall at the front of the terrace were still offering silent
gestures of "get back". I, along with countless others, replied with "we
can't move". There was nowhere to move. Another surge meant I was pushed
further left and I was becoming anxious about getting out and also about the
whereabouts of my friend.
                                         - 3 -

                            f No p-i^-OiD f e f c W b Wtaet. "tftCjc-

At this stage, I, quite put of desperation, was shouting at a solitary
Officer, positioned aboue and behind me in the stand above the terrace. Mv
desperate cries of "Hey!'.... Hey! Sort this out now! .... Ccne on, sort it
out!..." were ignored. ^bw^apid-rep©^fes-w«s»^.inade. The Officer'did not do
anything. I will be able to identify this Officer if called upon to do so.

Fans around me at this time were becoming increasingly aware of the situation
and cries and calls of "Somebody is dead down there" were heard by a man in
his early twenties standing on a wall about 1.8 m high, adjacent to the
entrance to the terrace.

The Officer in the stands had now disappeared and fans, not Officials or
      ' were lifting people out frcm the terrace below up onto the stands
above. In desperation, I too tried to be lifted out but I was too far down
the terrace.

Still no indication as the scale of the problem. Due to the successful
operation made by fans of lifting people out to the stands, the intense
pressure on myself was relieved sufficiently to enable ire to move of my own
free will back towards the entrance frcm which I came and to find my friend.
Police Officers were stood at the end of the entrance/exit tunnel while fans
were shouting "Get out, there are people dead down there!!"

I found my friend and told him. that we should get out. At this point, a tall
W.P.c., with blond hair and a short pony tail, rushed onto the terrace, just
under the end of the tunnel. It was then and only then for the first time I
received sound advice from a Police Officer. She called "Cate on lads, get
out! Get out!" I will be able to identify this Officer if called upon'to do
so.

Vfe made our way back   along the tunnel to be warned away by Police Officers
hauling bodies along    the tunnel and out to lay them out in survival position
^ the ground in the     space between the back of the stand and the turnstiles
fran which my friend    and I entered.

Between this time, now 3.15 pn, and the time the Elnergency Services arrived,
fifteen minutes later, I witnessed P.C. 2322 standing around offering no
resusitation to any of the injured or any words of assurance or ccmfort to the
now extremely distressed and angry fans, sate of which had already seen their
dead relatives and friends.

A sudden stream of "water" came froa behind sate of the steel cladding, high
above at the back of the stand. This cascaded onto a number of people, sane
of which were Police Officers, obviously unknown to the person relieving          I
themselves. It was fifteen minutes before the Emergency Services arrived.
While I was waiting behind the stand, for the first tine, I heard a request       ’
for Doctors inside the ground to cane forward. I witnessed the Police as
being silent and evidently subdued. The Ambulancemen took hold of the             '
situation more positively.

I left the ground because it was as much as I could take.

Just for the record, I believe we left in good time because ray friend had been
to the previous year's semi-final. I did not drink any alcohol because I was
driving. Everything in this statement is, to the best of my knowledge, true,
and these events did happen as I saw them.
The Police video made at the ground will reveal my position, tiite and sequence
of events as recorded.
                                                                             1
                                    - 4 -




En route to the ground fran the car, I did not see any football supporters
intoxicated, any scenes of tension or any Nottingham Forest supporters.

I am of sound body and mind and I am in good health. I hold no prejudice
against the Police Force and have found then both helpful and courteous in
previous difficult situations.

Dear Sirs

Ss.: HILLSBOROUGH - ITV THURSDAY 5TH DKCBMBKR 1QQR
First of all I would like to express my deepest sympathy to ftr.T.
families bereaved by this tragedy.

nm7 rtu0ll?Ci:' q u ^'te clearly the scenes as they were unfolding on
IV the day it happened and was horrified when I learned the
        total of u n —necessary deaths — however, I never for one
minute thought that after obvious police mis-management that
the police would endeavour to 'cover-up' actual events of the
day.

Although the main culprit has retired on 'FULL PENSION', I
really believe he and indeed all of the police involved in this
tragedy should be brought to justice.

My husband and I are both Liverpool supporters and could never
comprehend the pain and suffering you have all endured, if we
were in a similar situation with our children and family.  But
for all of you to have suffered the aftermath of this blatant
cover-up is totally un-acceptable.

We commend all of you for your constant fight for justice and
if there is anything we can do to help in any way, please write
back at your earliest convenience to the above-address.

Yours sincerely

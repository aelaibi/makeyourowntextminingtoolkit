              Until      incident           not deviated from point                 of work on upper        concourse:,:

              N orth stand.

               I became aware that                  closer    to 3pm        (1500)     various    radio m e s s a g e s about

              the     'opening            of some g a t e s ’ being         necessary

              to be of an urgent                   sounding       nature.      I believe       they    came from some

              officer        in a u t h o r i t y Leppings Lane              end.                                    Y

              As 3pm       <1500)          a p p r o a c h e d the volume     of supporters         increased to         .

              e xtremely heavy                level.       Some    obv io us ly the worse         for wear     for drink.

              N ois i e r a n d much           louder      in conversation.

              A number           of a l l e g a t io ns made about           the    lack of control        at L ep pings

              L ane    end of ground,               made    by numerous        supporters as kick off

              approached.                 Obscene    language used at us by many                  regarding      policing

               outside       of ground.             L o o k e d over gantry at Leppings Lane and saw a

               large number               of men urinating          below me at against wall               below N orth

'Returned                  to upper       concourse.               D et ai n ed another man for                       ^se       of        obsc

language                   and- a d vi s ed him.        He a p o l o g i s e d and I a l lo we d him to

continue                  on his way.

At 3 .05pm                 (1505)     on the outbreak                    of trouble        1 heard a radio message

"All       officers               to a ss em bl e    on pitch".                   With PC Roe at this stage and

a t t e m p t e d to          cut     through N orth stand from upper                             concourse       to ground.

We quickly                  realised this was           impossible as abuse an d threats                               from

Liverpool                  supporters was           so fierce we had to                     retreat        to upper

concourse                  level    from N ort h stand.

We then a ss e mb l ed                 on Hop end of N or th stand on ground floor with

P olice Dogs,                 horses,      many other officers.                           I thought we had a pitch

invasion at                  this time         on our hands.

Art-officer                 in charge      then directed my group onto the                                 pitch and we

were       told to line up facing North                                       stand on the        pitch. Whilst

standing facing                    the N orth stand             I saw somethings                  being        thrown from

the        crowd in our direction,                     possibly                  coins.

At this stage                     lots of threats and abus iv e                       shouts       from the       crowd who

were        pointing              in d irection of L ep pi ng s Lane end.
                                                                                             i,    \ *f\   '




I still             belie ve d we were              dealing wit h a                 pitch invasion at this

stage.               I could see many supporters who a pp ea r ed to have                                        spilled onto
                                           V            v   V   ‘'? ’   ...                                                 ■
pitch.              Some      of them were           Issuing on the ground near                        to the goal m outh

an d       penalty area.                       ;

Some       supporters^/jumped from the N or th stand                                       in front        of me and Z o o k

ad ve rt is in g             boards which they              carried towards                  the area where            the

trouble             seemed to be.

Almost              i mmediately one of these                       groups         of supporters           r et urned w ith a

supporter                  laying on the stretcher whose                            body was       twisted and

a pp ea r ed              to me    to be obviously dead.                          It was not until             this   point          in

time that the gravity of the                            incident                  came home to me an d            I began to
r e a l i s e .that we had a serious             incident        on our h a n d s .
      ,


I. remember         thinking       there was,     for some        reason,     little    radio

dir ec t i o n from control and so as                 I a p p e a r e d to be doing      nothing more

than ag gr av at in g        the    crowd by my       presence with a few other             officers

facing the N or th stand,               I decided to move            into the area where          people

were       lying down       injured and offered assistance.

The       first    person    I helped was a y outh aged about                  18 years who       said he
                                                                                                            # •


could not move          one     leg and one arm.            As    I spoke wit h him a stretcher

a pp ea r ed beside         him and w ith the help of another                  officer    I a ss is te d

the       injured man onto          the stretcher.          W ith the help of some supporters

we    carried this          person off the pitch,             and    placed him down near          to the

gym where a large             number     of casualties           had now a p p e ar e d to have     been

put.

I returned          to the    pitch and a s s is t ed w ith the             removal    of two other

injured s u p p o r t e r s ,       And was     then direc te d by a s u pe rv is or y officer

w ith a group of other               officers to go to the Leppings Lane                   end of the

outside          of the ground.

On arrival          at that     point    I saw a p p r o x i m a t e l y   14 bodies    laid at    the

side of some          fencing,       a number of Police             officers wire a l re a d y near

to these          bodies.     The    bodies were        s e ct io ne d off by a s t re tc h of      crowd

control          barriers.

On    route       to this    location I saw 2 or 3 fire me n wit h ox yg en equipment

working a p p ar e nt l y without            success     to revive a supporter            laid near to

the       rear    of the/control        hut,    but outside         of the ground.

Whilst standing             near    to the     14 bodies,        I together with other          officers

was       insulted by Liverpool             s upporters as they            left the ground      showing

open h o s t i 1 i ty towards         us.      Someone     shouted that was all           we were     fit

for,, standing around.

An    Irish doctor          from the Hal lamshi re Hospital                 put the keys     of his      car

in my hand tailing me where                    it was    in case       it needed moving as he was

         busy tending           to the      injured

         A police officer             scuffled with a Liverpool              supporter       in my viewing

         and a further             group of Liverpool        s upporters m oved        in the d i r e ct io n of

         the officer          but an ambulance         drove    slowly between the group and                     it

         dispersed.           The    crowd continued to         leave     the Leppi ng s Lane           end.

         I then returned to the g ymnasium and                       I r e c a l 1 going    to a de-briefing

         in the North stand.                                                                                       t*

         After     that      1 took up a point of duty at the P en istone R oad entrance                                 to

            PRESENTER:

              Well, before we go to our news headlines, we go now to the Labour MP for
              Liverpool Walton, Peter Kilfoyle, to hear his reaction to the news that a hospital
              doctor who treated victims of the Hillsborough disaster has offered fresh evidence to
              help a legal bid to overturn the original inquest verdict. Briefly, some details before
              we do speak to Mr Kilfoyle. Doctor Ed Walker, who tended more than a dozen fans
              on the day of the disaster in April 1989, claims he has new medical evidence which
              contradicts what the inquest was told.                              The evidence, reported in tomorrow's
              edition of Hospital Doctor, will be used by the Hillsborough Family Support Group to
              get the original hearing's accidental verdict overturned. Mr Kilfoyle, first of all, good

               morning.



            PETER KILFOYLE MP: Lab., Liverpool Walton

               Good morning.



            PRESENTER;

               What, were you expecting anything like this?



            PETER KILFOYLE MP:

               Well, not this particular piece of evidence. But yesterday I did receive a letter from
               the Home Office asking me to go along and speak to the Operational Policing Policy
               Unit on the new evidence. They were particularly concerned with the new evidence
               attributed to Roger Holdsworth, the video technician.                                   So, this evidence from the
               hospital doctor, Ed Walker, it will obviously add impetus to the calls for the re­

               opening of the inquiry.




                                                                           Page: 2

       PRESENTER:

         He's actually quoted by the Press Association this morning as saying that he only
         recently worked out the significance of this evidence. And he says 'I can't believe
         I've been sitting on this stuff for 8 years.                        I had no idea it was so important'.                        Is it
         fair to say that the drama documentary which was broadcast some weeks ago will
         have pin-pointed the fact that it was very important for him and for many others?



       PETER KIUFOYLE MP:

         Well, it certainly prompted so much. As you know, we had a debate in the House of
         Commons as a result of the docu-drama, and it certainly prompted the Home
          Secretary to take it far more seriously then I might have anticipated, initially. Hence
          his request for the interview on new evidence.                                    But it does raise very serious
          questions about what actually happened at the time of the inquest, and the gravity
          with which certain parts of the evidence were treated, or rather lack gravity.



       PRESENTER:

          Now, Doctor Walker, who didn't give evidence at the time, has offered to testify
          that 14 year old victim, Philip Hammond, was actually alive until 3:40pm , twenty to
          four on that afternoon, even though quarter past three was the cut-off point for
          people being alive and well. But they claim that, the families claim that that ruling,
          the 3:15 ruling, denied them the chance to submit evidence that South Yorkshire
          police failed to activate a proper disaster plan in time. Do you think that that is the

          heart of the matter at the moment?




                                                                       Page: 3

       PETER KILFOYLE MP:

         It's s very, very serious issue.                 It's not the only issue, but obviously, it s extremely                                    i
         important in terms of the way in which, to my recollection, the evidence was                                                                   £
         presented as being really of no, or rather, the argument about what happened after                                                         <
         3:15, was of no consequence. Obviously, the families have always believed in it.                                                  I
         believe it to be the case, that it's a matter of great importance because it does beg
         questions about the whole role of the emergency services on that day, and their

         failure to respond adequately to the circumstances.



       PRESENTER:

          Now, I know that you played host to some of the relatives of those who died at
          Hillsborough, after the adjournment debate in the House of Commons, when they
          actually met the home secretary, Michael Howard.                                   Your impression at the time, I
          seem to recall, was that Michael Howard was taking this matter extremely seriously.

          Will you be contacting him about this latest development?



       PETER KILFOYLE MP:

          Well, I will indeed.             And, obviously I have contacted the family support group
          yesterday, in fact, Philip Hammond Senior, in order to ensure at least one member of
          the family support group is with me when I meet with the Home Office.                                                     Though
          obviously, any fresh evidence, and the letter's quite specific about looking at fresh
          evidence as it becomes available, that this ought to be presented to the internal
          investigation, or whatever form it’s taken, within the Home Office. And I will write

          directly to Michael Howard, as home secretary, anyway.




                                                                       Page: 4

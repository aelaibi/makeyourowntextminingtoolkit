HAVE YOU GIVEN ANY ADVICE TO CLUBS ABOUT THE REMOVAL OF PITCH
PERIMETER FENCES AT FOOTBALL GROUNDS?


No.   This is a matter for the inquiry.   It would be inappropriate
to amend the 'Guide to Safety at Sports Grounds' until the
outcome of the inquiry is known.


SOME LONDON CLUBS HAVE ALREADY REMOVED THEIR PITCH PERIMETER
FENCING.   SHOULD THEY HAVE DONE SO?


That is for the individual clubs themselves, in consultation as
necessary with the police and local authority responsible for the
issue of the safety certificate.


SHOULD ALL FUTURE SEMI-FINALS BE HELD AT WEMBLEY?


This is a matter for the Football Association.


HOW SHOULD MATCH TICKETS BE ALLOCATED IN FUTURE?


This is a matter.for investigation during the inquiry and no
doubt is something the football authorities will wish to
consider.


WILL SOME CLUBS BE REQUIRED TO CONVERT ALL STANDING TERRACES TO
ALL-SEAT STANDS?


The Government shares the view expressed by the football
authorities and others that there should be a move towards all
seater stadia for the major clubs.     The Government will be
discussing that with the football authorities.

FUTURE OF THE FOOTBALL SPECTATORS BILL


It is still most important to exclude from football grounds those
who are known to go there to cause trouble.     Part I of the Bill
provides a framework for a membership scheme,* the Government is
committed not to implement any such scheme until suitable
practical arrangement can be made.     The scheme will therefore be
able to take account of relevant points made by Lord Justice
Taylor.   The Bill also provides a possible opportunity to
legislate once conclusions from the Taylor inquiry are known.


WHO IS IN CHARGE OF A FOOTBALL MATCH - THE CLUB OR THE POLICE?


It will be one of the tasks of the Taylor inquiry to examine the
arrangements made by the club and the police for the stewarding
and policing of spectators at the match.     There is invariably
close consultation between the police and the clubs over such
arrangements.


[If pressed:


The police have responsibility for the preservation of the peace
and the maintenance of public order.     If they perceive a threat
to public order or public safety, they have a duty to take action
-to counter it. This is an operational judgement for the senior
 police officer involved.]

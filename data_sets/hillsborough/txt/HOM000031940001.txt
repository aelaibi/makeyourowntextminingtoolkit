Dear Mr Pyne

Thank you for your letter 27 February regarding the Hillsborough
Disaster. I confirm I have not objections to this document being
placed in the House of Commons Library.

In reviewing the letter, there is a small typographical error on
top of page 2, it should read "victims were unable to get oxygen
into the lungs".  The second is in the third paragraph, page 2,
the second sentence should read "you probably have access to the
statement I made at the time but I could provide a further copy
if you wish."

Yours sincerely

very          abusive          towards         the       Police        with    comments              of    being       murderous

On this date I commenced duty at Hammerton, Road Police Station at
9.0am. 1 travelled to the ground where I attended the brieflag at
10.0am. 'I was allocated Serial 3 which was the South Stand, upper
level and turnstiles*  I had 11 other officers'to assist me with
this serial and I Relieve those officers were as follows*
    m ,     Sumer, > '«> .V       5 »y# 1977 lathing, 1584 Collier,60 Cofccfiy
               Hirst,3341 Mitchell, 261 Cooper, 1317 Bennett, 591
    Tune, 1949 Storey and 2817 Hudson, all from F1»

The South Stand had   beenallocated to the Motti.ngha.giForrest   fans.
The officer to whom   I was responsible was Inspect*
Prior to the turnstiles opening my serial did a security     check of
the seating area of the upper level of the South Stand.      When the
turnstiles opened the P C s were deputed to the searching-   of fans
entering the stand whilst PS Turner and myself patrolled     the snack
bars amid "betting booth.

About 2.50pm I heard# traffic over the radio that large numbers of
fans were at the Leppings Lane end and trying to get into the ground.
About the same time I heard some mention on the radio that a gate had
been broken. Up to this time I had periodically checked the seating
area and 1 was amazed at the apparent slowness of the        dX fans
to take their seats in the worth and West stands and on the lappings
lane terraces. By about 2.50pm the seats and, terraces were begining
t-» i'41i ui,/ s- » l, f- '' ■
                             H >e wings of the Leppings Lane terraces
in which there was still plenty of room.

I think it was before the players took to the field that 1 heard a
request over                  >r the start to be delayed# It was
suggested this would have a calming effect on the fans outside the
Leppings Lane end, knowing they would             j of the game, I
gathered from the transmissions that a large number of fans had
turned up suddenly, swelling the already large numbers# There was
mention over the radio of the fans outside the Leppings Lane end
♦pressing forward**

Around the start of the game I was hearing calls over the radio from
Superintendent Marshall for a gate at the rear of the West Stand, terraces
to be opened to ease the pressure outside. This request was repeated
several times. Radio reception was not very good due to the noise of
the crowd around the officer and the fact he was having to shout• There
was a note of desperation and fright in Superintendent Marshall’s
vod.ce and I heard him mention there was going to be serious injury if
this gate was not opened* The order was then given to open the gate.

The game was about five minutes old when I was able to get a view of
it from one of the gangways' in the South Stand, Play was in the goal
mouth at the Leppings Lane end of the ground#   1 noticed a \\ n .;lia»b
over the high barrier which, divides the terraces from the playing area*
I saw the crowd on these terraces surge forward a couple of times, a
sight which is quite common. I could not see anything wrong from my
position and dismissed the pushing and climbing           mruly
behaviour of the fans.

 I then saw a senior police oficer run. onto the pitch and approach the
   ■ ('-i ee, . The game was stopped but .1 could not see why and still put
 it down to the.behaviour-of the fana* Several fans came over the~
 "barrier and I saw one'of them run the full length of the pitch to
 the Sop end, Nottingham.Storrest- end-, •of the ground and began to taunt
 the fans. The fan was detained aad it.              then did -I-realise
,something was seriously wrosg.

J saw policemen, helping fans over- tlie .barrier at the lappings Lane
end and other beckoning the fans in the centre of the'terraces to
move back. It was obvious that fans at the front were getting crushed
and I saw some of them apparently uncorscious and being treated on the
pitch.           .                                       "

 Baring this, time there were many radio transmissions        was motion
 of fans dying and getting more officers to the Leppings Lane end of
 the ground.

I rounded up the ren          fleers of my serial., two were involved
with a prisoner and two were on. meal, and when the chance came 1 used
my radio# I informed ground control that the Nottingham fans in the
South Stand# were cal m-and orderly and asked if I should take my serial
onto the pitch. This was confirmed and on we went.

Once on the pitch and at the Leppings Lane end it was impoi     e to
ren    together as a group as there were many people lying about injured
I made my way to near to the touch line, ignoring the people who were
sitting or did not appear to be in any danger, and. went to two males .
who were unconscious * I first gave mouth to mouth resuscitation to the
elder one who I could only describe as heavy build and about 50 years
old.  1 don*t know how long 1 continued with this man but there was no
response. whilst trying to resuscitate this man 1 was kicked on my
right thigh by a Liverpool fan who shouted at me, “You fucking murderer11
I went to the next man, about.20 years, wearing a bright greea short
sleeved shirt and began mouth to mouth resuscitation on him. I was
assisted, at this time by a woman who said she was a nurse who gave
heart massage. This continued for some time until it seemed obvious
the man was dead.
I dont know if it was m x m i x m m M on the radio or by someone on the pitch
but there was some mention of removing the bodies. With the hej r of
three or four Liverpool fans I placed the body of the younger man onto
ansi advertising board and carried it off the pitch via the South. Stand
to the ser        ad at the south side of the West Stand. It was here
several other bodies were laid out and' I put the body of the young man
with them.

1 returned to the pitch but was almost immediately directed with other
officers to outside the heppiags Lane end of          ownd where 1 assisted
in .insuring a free passage for ambulances. Mmmercras Liverpool fans were
leaving the ground by this Jjiifi© and many of them app ear ed to be drunk *
Many of them, including thesober ones, were very abusive towards the -
Police with comments      mrafrous bastards, the ooening of a gate and
of not having sufficient tickets for their greater numbe
During the incident 1 cannot remember any breakdown in radio
transmissions but when on the pitch, I was probably oblivious
to transmissions because of the urgent task at hand.

I went off duty at 7.0pm, the same date.

Whilst on the pitch during the early stages- and afterwards outside
the toppings lane end of the ground I and other officers were subjected
to- abuse,         v-    from the Liverpool fans. Everyone *■>:' »;hem
seemed to agree with the fact that they had not been allocated the
parts of the ground which would have have afforded them a greater      -
number r>i tickets. This maybe so but I believe ife* Nottingham
Forrest sold all their allocation and cc           bly have sold more.
I did not hear any reports or see any evidence of them crushing at
turnstiles to get into the groimt even though, with the allocation
O tickets, they should h a w u - a greater in ntambers. T h e Nottingham
fans appeared to get to the ground earlier arnd take their seats and
places on the terraces far sooner than the Liverpool fans.

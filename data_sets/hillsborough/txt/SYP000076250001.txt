             Approximately               two    weeks       before          the m a t c h             at H i l l s b o r o u g h          A n drew,

         At    the    g r o u n d we all           walked             completely               around           the    stadiujri,            this    had       no

         Upon       arriving          it w a s     apparent                that      the       Leppings           Lane          e n t r a n c e was

         around       the       turnstiles,              all       of      us    j u st    joined           on the          back        of    this       mass

         awaiting          to    get       in.    At     this         time      we      were     all        together             and where           we

          were       at    the    b ac k     there          wa s      no    crushing            but     as we          neared           the     front

         towards          the    turnstiles              and more               people         joining           the m a s s          you     started          to

         become       crushed,             unable        to m o v e         your        arms     and_had              to     follow           the s w a y      of

         the    crowd.          Eventually             we. r e a c h e d         ttje      turnstiles                 but    as       a g r o u p we       had

         lot    of    people          but    you       could move                around         quite           easily,          anywhere           yo u

         wanted       to    go.       Because          of     being         split         up we/ h a d a r r a n g e d                to m e e t      up

         just       inside       the       ground        but as            it was         n o y ,2.5?5pm we                thought           the    others

         was    quite       empty when             we       entered             it ykut        I remember              turning           round and

         saw    that       a gate          had    been       opened a/d                 that     there           was       a wave        of

         that       it wa s      packed          directly             in f r o n t        but    I thought                 we w o u l d       be a b l e       to

         get    into       the    empty          pens       at     Ihe      side,         but     1 was          wrong          so we        had    to     stop

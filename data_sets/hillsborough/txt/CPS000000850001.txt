Dear Mr Manning

RE: HILLSBOROUGH: ADLINGTON -v- DUCKENFIELD & MURRAY

Thank you for your letter of 1 September 1998 requesting a copy of the documents attached
to the HFSG letter of 24 August.

While I am prepared to copy relevant correspondence in my possession to those parties who
may request it, I must regretfully decline to copy and pass on extensive document files that
may be enclosed with such correspondence. I have informed the HFSG that you may wish
to contact them on this point.

Enclosed are copies of further relevant letters.

Yours sincerely

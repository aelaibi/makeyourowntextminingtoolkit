I am a Police Constable currently serving at the Communications
School, Ecclesfield Training Centre, Sheffield.


I commenced duty at 9.00am on Saturday 15 April 1989 at Barnsley
Police Station to perform duties at the F.A. Cup Semi Final at
Hillsborough,   Sheffield.       I then travelled to Hillsborough
Football Ground arriving there at 9.30am for a 10.00am briefing.


My duties for the day were as a mobile patrol in company with 4
other officers.    These officers were PS Hallett, PC Pont, PC
Gillott and PC Frith, using call sign Tango 10.            We were to
 patrol the north side of Sheffield city, which is the Neepsend
 and Penistone Road area and supervise the Nottingham Forrest
 fans arriving at the ground.


 At 10.30am we commenced our patrol and at this time the area was
 relatively quiet with no problems.     Within a short time however
 it did start to get busy and there were a number of supporters
 gathering at the public houses in the area.        The supporters all
 appeared to be Nottingham Forrest fans and they were in good
 humour and well behaved.


 By about 1.00pm the Penistone Road area was crowded with people
 and all the pubs in the area had supporters outside with their
 drinks   and other than attending one or two minor incidents
 everybody appeared to be in good humour.
At about     2.00pm we attended at the Royal Public             House as a
result of a call over        the radio for assistance from a Police
Officer.     On arrival       there was a large crowd           outside the
premises     and it was      obvious   there had been     a     large scale
disturbance with supporters, some of whom were still inside the
premises.      We gave assistance in clearing the premises both
inside and outside.        The landlord then closed the premises and
we remained in the area for a short while until the crowd had
dispersed.


After leaving the Royal Public House we continued on general
patrol and by about 2.45pm Penistone Road was clearing quickly
of supporters, most of whom had arrived at the ground.                 It was
at this time I became aware that there was a large build up of
supporters at the Leppings Lane end of the ground.                 The radio
transmissions were sometimes very distorted and weak but what I
could hear, the voices had a sense of urgency in them.


 I heard an officer ask several- times for the gate to be opened
and   also    another     officer   asking   for   the   kick    off   to   be
postponed. This was refused as another officer stated over the
radio that the players were already on the pitch.               I can clearly
 remember this because it was at this time about 2.55pm that we
 parked the vehicle up on Penistone Road at its junction with
 Bradfield Road.
                                                            5-i^} .
                                                                                             3.




We remained at this location                    for the next 10 minutes or so and

monitored       both       UHF    and     VHF   radio       channels.            The    UHF       radio

transmissions         were continuous           but messages were still distorted

and drowned out by screaming and shouting from the crowds in the

background.



It became apparent to me that something serious was happening at

the Leppings Lane end of the ground because what transmissions I

could    hear    on    the       radio now had a real               feeling of urgency               in

them.     At this point shortly after 3.00 pm as a result of a radio

message to all units on the VHF radio we attended at the Football

Ground    and     entered          it    from   Penistone Road.             We    joined       other

officers at       the junction of the Kop and the North Stand.                                We were

all     instructed         by    Inspector      Wallace      to     remain       there       for    the

moment    which       we    did.         Also   at   this    location       was        a number      of

Mounted    Officers.               We    remained     there for      some    seven        or      eight

minutes    not knowing             what had happened or what we were required

for.     I had assumed at this point there must have been a pitch

invasion    and       we    were        required     for    crowd    control,          but    I    soon

became aware that this was not the case because whilst stood at

this    location       I saw a number of very distressed and apparently

injured supporters coming from the pitch with Police Officers and

I also saw St.             John's Ambulancemen running on to the pitch and

down    towards       the       Leppings    Lane     end.     We     were    then ordered by

Inspector Wallace to follow him on to the pitch and form a cordon

in front of the Liverpool supporters sat in the North Stand.                                         As

we were going on to the pitch a Liverpool supporter grabbed me

and told me people were dying down there, pointing to the West

Stand at the Leppings Lane end of the ground.
As we walked on to the pitch there was a roar from the crowd.
We formed the cordon as ordered and I remained there for some 4
or 5 minutes.          Whilst I was there I was subjected to both verbal
and   physical          abuse.   Liverpool    supporters         were   spitting,
punching and poking at us.            We tried our best to calm them but
to no avail.         They asked why we were there and not helping with
the dead and injured.               I knew by now we had a large scale
disaster to deal with and not a pitch invasion.                   I decided that
I would be more effectively employed at the West Stand where
supporters were obviously in difficulties                   and so as not to
aggravate      the     Liverpool     supporters in        the North Stand       any
further, I left the cordon and ran to the            West Stand area as did
many other officers.


What I saw was horrific, there were people lying all over the
pitch, a number of them obviously dead.              I helped where I could
and I assisted with the removal of both dead and injured persons
from the pitch to the First Aid Room and gymnasium situated at
the rear of the North Stand.


When I first           arrived at the First Aid Room it was already full
with injured           people. There were a number of ambulances parked
 under the North Stand and other Police Officers were laying
 injured people on the ground underneath the overhang of the
 North Stand.        Several fans were receiving medical attention from
 St. John's and Ambulance personnel.


 Whilst this was taking place I saw some Liverpool supporters in
 the North Stand urinating, and the urine was running through the
 spaces   in     the     concrete    stand   and   down     on    to    the   people
 underneath.
The fans were well aware what they were doing and were laughing
and jeering at Police Qfficers whilst they were urinating.


I returned to the pitch and by this time saw a large number of
officers, some of them in a state of confusion and shock.    Sadly
some of the younger officers did not really know what had
happened or what to do next.    I had to escort a young Special
Constable off the pitch as he was in a state of shock.


The atmosphere inside the ground was very frightening and I
formed the opinion that the crowd were not aware of what had
happened and we had to bear the brunt of their anger.        Whilst
assisting with the injured I was both physically and verbally
abused and blamed for what was happening and at one point had it
not been for the intervention of a male P.C., whose identity I
do not know, I would have been attacked by an angry Liverpool
supporter, who stated it was my fault and he was going to "have
me."    I saw a number of Police Officers and Firemen being
punched and kicked whilst they were helping the injured.       Some
of the angry supporters I tried to calm were in shock but a
large number were obviously drunk.


At some time shortly before 4.00pm whilst near the First Aid
Room I was informed by Inspector Barker that they were opening
the Casualty Bureau at Ecclesfield and that I may be required.
We went together into the gymnasium at Hillsborough and I was
instructed by Superintendent Bates to attend at Ecclesfield as a
matter of urgency.    I left Hillsborough just after 4.00pm and
was driven by a Traffic Officer to Ecclesfield Training Centre,
arriving   there   at   approximately   4.10pm   where   I   commenced
Casualty Bureau duties fcfor the remainder of the day until going
off duty at 10.45pm that day.

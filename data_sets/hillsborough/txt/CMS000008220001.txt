HILLSBOROUGH : COSTS OF INVESTIGATION BY WEST MIDLANDS POLICE

At the meeting with South Yorkshire Police Authority Lord Ferrers
undertook to write to them setting out the details of the proposed
special payment.   A draft letter to the Chairman of the Authority
is attached for Lord Ferrers' consideration.

2.   Lord Ferrers asked whether a case might be made out to the
Treasury    for  further   limiting   South  Yorkshire's maximum
contribution (for example from £975,000 to £500,000).

3.   The formulas used for previous special payments have varied
according to circumstances, but all of them would have been less
generous to South Yorkshire than the proposed formula. We would
thus be asking the Treasury for a payment effectively more generous
than all previous ones (including the one for the miners' strike).

4.    When we discussed this with the Treasury, they pointed out
that it would be the first special payment to a police authority
since police grant was increased from 50% to 51%.   In 1988-89, for
example, South Yorkshire would have received about £810,000 more
from the Government than they would have done under the old rate of
gra nt .

5.   The Treasury could also have pointed to changes in the block
grant position which effectively treat police authorities, in
particular the metropolitan authorities, more favourably than was
the case at the time of the miners' strike.   Under the new system,
South Yorkshire received a year on year increase of block grant in
1989-90 of £1,067,000.   The contribution by central government to
South Yorkshire's budget in 1989-90 will be around 75% (and single
service authorities, unlike county police forces, are certain of
receiving all the block grant assigned for policing).

6.   The Treasury also pointed out that assistance provided to
local authorities as a result of the 1987 hurricane was at 75%
above a penny rate threshold. We pressed in South Yorkshire's case
E.R.
   for a more generous payment on the grounds that police authorities
   face more uncertainties over possible large-scale demands and that
   the single service authorities have fewer resources with which to
   cushion themselves than do local authorities.

   7.   The Treasury accepted the case but would be very unwilling    to
   concede any further ground.   They would say that with a budget    of
   £85 million and a contingency fund of £1 million plus reserves     of
   nearly £1 million South Yorkshire should be able to absorb costs   of
   up to £975,000.

   8.   There is also a claim for a special payment from Kent Police
   Authority under consideration.     They expect to incur £5.1 million
   additional c o s ^ on policing the P and O ferries dispute and their
   lp rate produce is £2.034 million.      So far Kent have not pursued
   their claim vociferously (in part because they probably anticipate
   a favourable outcome) but they are unlikely to take it quietly if
   they are refused a special payment once South Yorkshire are known
   to have received one.    Our chances of doing something for Kent are
   likely to be reduced if we squeeze the Treasury for more for South
   Yorkshire.

   9.   As I said after the meeting with South Yorkshire, I believe
   that a number of the representatives at the meeting were favourably
   impressed by the offer and there is a reasonable hope that, on the
   full Police Authority, their views will carry the day.

  10. When we made the offer we were aware of the main points which
  South Yorkshire put to us at the meeting.  I believe that a payment
  which will effectively apportion the costs some 23 to 20% to South
  Yorkshire and some 77% to 80% to Central Government (with Central
  Government paying an even higher percentage if costs were to go
  above £5 million) does take account of South Yorkshire's position
  and that^ there is a good case for putting it as it stands to the
  full Police Authority for consideration.

                         HILLSBOROUGH      : COST    OF       INVESTIGATION       BY WEST MIDLANDS
                         POLICE


                         I promised to write to you following our recent meeting
                         on this subject.         I would like to say that I very much
                         enjoyed meeting you and the other members of your Police
                         Authority.     I am      only    sorry    that      it    should have been
                         occasioned   by    the     distressing      events        at   Hillsborough.
                         May I again express my sympathy for all of you at this
                         difficult time?


                         2.   I was very grateful for the clear and courteous way
                         in which you explained your Authority's position to me.


                         3.   As   I understand the position,                you accept that the
                         Chief Constable of South Yorkshire initially decided that
                         another   force    should       be    called   in    to    investigate       the
                         events at Hillsborough because it was desirable that the
                         investigation should be seen to be independent of South
                         Yorkshire police.



         H.O. EST. 112
 S 531                                                                                      35688 9.85 XNW
4.     You     also      take        the view,      as    I understand          it,       that
when it was subsequently decided to establish the enquiry
under Lord Justice Taylor and to place the results of the
investigation            at     the    service      of    that    enquiry,          this    so
changed       the       character          of   the      investigation,             and    its
scope, that as a matter of principle the South Yorkshire
Police Authority should no longer be expected to bear the
costs.


5.      You also made the point that the expected scale of
costs        could       be     such       as    seriously        to        threaten       the
efficiency of the South Yorkshire police force and could
not be absorbed within the Authority's own resources.


6.      As    I explained at               the meeting,          the Home Secretary
accepts that,            because of the scale of the investigation
and its unexpected nature, the likely costs could not be
absorbed          by     South       Yorkshire        within      the       usual     police
funding       arrangements             without      serious       detriment          to    the
efficiency of the force.


7.      He also recognises that, as a result of the decision
to   make         the     results          of    the     investigation              directly
available to Lord Justice Taylor,                         it has been widened to
cover national aspects which go wider than the concerns
of South Yorkshire, or even South Yorkshire policing.


8.      Nevertheless             it remains the case that much of the
investigation             will       be    concerned      with        the    policing       of
events       on    the        day,    a    matter     which      is    inescapably the
concern of the South Yorkshire police.                                  We have looked
therefore         for     a     solution        which    reflects        the    statutory
responsibility, shared between police authorities and the
Home      Secretary,                 for    meeting       the     costs        of     police
operations in England and Wales.


9.      Taking          all    these       consideratons         into       account,       the
Government             is prepared         to   offer South Yorkshire                 Police
Authority          a    special         payment        towards        the    costs     of    the
investigation.                   This would         apply       to    costs    incurred by
South         Y orkshire              Police        A u th or i ty     in      reimbursing
additional         costs          incurred by West Midlands Police as a
result    of       the       investigation.                (By additional            costs   we
mean    costs          such       as    overtime,          travel,      subsistence          and
accommodation               of     personnel         directly          involved       in     the
investigation, together with consequential overtime costs
incurred as a result of the need to provide cover for the
officers assigned to the investigation.)


10.     The    level         of       assistance which we               are    prepared to
offer in this case would be                           for the Government to meet
90% of all costs above the product of a lp rate (which we
understand would be around £1.3 million).                                    Up to the £1.3
million mark the normal police grant of 51% would apply.
Moreover       a       limit       would      be    placed       on    the    total    amount
which     South         Yorkshire            Police       Authority         would     have    to
contribute.                      Whatever           the        total    costs         of     the
investigations,              South Yorkshire would have to contribute
no     more    than          the       product      of     a    3/4p    rate,        which    we
calculate would be about £975,000.                              Beyond that point the
Government would meet 100% of the cost.


11.     Special payments have previously been made in only a
small    number of cases.                         Government already            contributes
substantially to police expenditure through police grant
and     bloc k          grant.            In       South       Yorkshire's          case     the
contribution                amounts          to     some         75%    of      the     Police
Authority's budget.


12.     This       would         be    the     first      special      payment        provided
since the increase in police grant from 50% to 51%^which
was     intended            in part to            leave police         authorities          in a
better position to meet unexpected expenditure.


13.     There          is    no        pre-determined            formula       for     special
payments.              In deciding to adopt the formula used in the
miners' strike we are taking into account the particular
circumstances of this case.


14.   I have considered very carefully the points you made
to me at the meeting.            I have reflected in particular on
what you told me about South Yorkshire Police Authority's
operational      contingency          fund   and    its    balances.          I
appreciate that the position here is tight.


15.   Nevertheless I believe that the terms of the offer
recognise      South Yorkshire's position            and the       fact that
the investigation is contributing to the enquiry by Lord
Justice      Taylor    as well       as being   of relevance to South
Yorkshire Police.        No more than £975,000 would need to be
contributed      by    the    Authority      whatever     the    costs.      On
present estimates,           the costs may reach £4 to £5 million.
At    that     level     of     costs     the      authority       would     be
contributing between 23% and 20% of the total costs, and
the Government between 77% to 80%.


16.   I   look    forward       to    your    authority's        very     early
agreement to proceeding              on these terms.        It     is,    as we
agreed    at    the    meeting,       very   important      that    we     move
quickly to reimburse the West Midlands Police Authority
the additional costs it has incurred.                My officials would
be happy to discuss with yours any queries they may have
about the details of what would qualify for payment.

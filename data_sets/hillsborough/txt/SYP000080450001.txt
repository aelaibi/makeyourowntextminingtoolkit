              the M63 and so the jour ne y to S he f fi e ld took a very                                 long while       I would

              say over three              hours.



              The    coach finally              parked    in a dual       c a rr i ag ew ay by the ground where all

              the other Liverpool                   coaches were at about 2.40p.m.                   (1440).            I recall

              at about 2. £ 5 - 2 . 30prn (1425-1430)                   as the    coach         left the M1       it was

              stopped t          jk< i   ice,    I saw about          '12 officers     standing          by the    roadside.

              Three      officers         came onto       the    coach and a sked           if wg^tlad any drink,               the

              answer was          no but        they did not          check.      T h er ^w sT we re asked         if we all

              had tickets and a gain the answer was yes.                                 One of the officers               then

              said       'Lets    see a few tickets              then'.        Some     of us showed tickets which

              seemed to satisfy the                   officers and they            left.           I would say that             tomy

C att         knowledge at             least 3 people           on the    coacj^-iTad no tickets and                 if the

              As we      parked the           coach there were a number                of       police    giving     d irections

              but    in fact all you had to do was                       to follow the            crowd.       The      four    of

              us went       to the Leppi ng s            Ln end of the ground,              where                 and

              left    us as       they had tickets              for    the seated area.              I did not          see them

              a g a i n till      after we got           on the       coach.      There was a very             large      crowd

              of    people all a rr iving at               the L ep pings Ln end at the same                      time    the

              full w id t h of the              road was    just a mass          of   people.            I could see       the

              could not          get     to   it.       We were at         re back of the           crowd and so were

              not    really       in the        crush       Almoaa as          soon as we joined the               crowd there

              was    a sudden          releasing        of t h jf pressure and a section of the                      crowd

              moved      off     to the       right     of the turnstile.              We            and    I f ol lo w ed on

             and went       through what       I w ould describ^'STs a large exit                        gate    just     round
Q    ^   C
             the    corner       on the   right    of the           nst, i l e ,      I did not see w hen               the

     inI     police       opened    or who    opened                I took         little    notice of what was

             going    on aro un d me and ju/st wa lk ed              into     the ground.



             Inside       the ground      I saw no        police,    no stewards

             w here   to go.         As   it was     so    late,    we deci de d       it                      packed behind

             the    goal    so we went       round to the          left   of the st

             the    corner       of the terrace       in what       I now know to                                        I was

             very s urprised how empty this                  part    of the ground was                           then    it was

             2.55pm       (1455).         I looked at       the    pens behind         the ^ o a l       and    right    away

             r ea lized that        they were      very very full.                  I saw fans J^j^ing            to    climb

             out    over    the front      fence and being            pushed back           b y ^ th e   police.         I also

             saw fans       being    pulled up       into the stands abp^e and                     climbing       over

             fences       into    pens at the      side.



             What     I felt at that         time was that          I knew that         there was a problem on

             the    terrace       in front    of us but the          police         did not seem to             realize       it

             quite as quickly.



             I felt       that    in using a line of police across                     the     pitch      it was       reducing

             the    number of officers ava il ab le                to get     people out of the terraces and

             to treat       the    injured.



                    and    I event ua ll y    left    the ground          I w ou ld say at almost                five

             o'clock       (1700)    and went      back     to the     coach.

Christopher Jones,
Police Constable 1176, Force Operations Room.



On Saturday 15th April 1989 I was on duty in the Major Incident Room at
Police Headquarters, and was deputed to work the radio within that office
to control Traffic mobiles in connection with the Semi - Final.


At 1506hrs I received a radio message on Channel 1, V.H.F., fiom the Hillsborough
Ground Control, for Operation Support to be implemented at Hillsborough.
At this time Chief Inspector Edmundson was in the Major Incident Room, he also
heard this message, and took action on its receipt#


I then made a broadcast on Channel 1 to the effect that Operation Support
had been requested, and that all available mobiles should attend at Hillsborough.
As mobiles answered this call I directed them to the Police Control at Hillsborough
and added the mobile's call sign to the extended incident on the Command &
Control computer.

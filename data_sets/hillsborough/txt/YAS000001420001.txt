RAYMOND CLARKE will state:-




1.   I am 43 years old, 6.10.1945.         I live with my girlfriend
                  and four children by previous marriages.


2.   I am employed by SYMAS as Control Superintendent and I work
     from the Control Centre, Moorgate, Rotherham.       I joined the
     ambulance service in 1968 and I have worked through the
     ranks since then.     I have been in the control room for 10/12
     years and have gained considerable experience.          I work a
     three shift rota.


3.   On Saturday the 15th April 1989 my tour of duty was 1400-
     2200 hours but as usual I went in early to take over and be
     brought up to date by the earlier Superintendent.


4.   The control room staff consisted of myself in charge,
     Control Officer on the emergency desk,
     Control Officer on the outpatients desk,
     control assistants                on 1400/2200 hours,
            on days.     It was the usual shift staff.


5.   From 1400 hours it was just routine, dealing with everyday
     incidents.    I was      aware   of   the   football   match   at
     Hillsborough as we had been given information about it and I
     had made myself familiar with the information.
6.At' 1506.29 anemergency call from force control         at Snlg Hill
    was taken by            and put through to me.

     the ground, who have portable radios.        The ambulances   also
     have radios.       I did not test the    portable radios, but the
       tests would have been done when the officers at the ground
       began duty during the morning.

11.    A radio message had already come in from Alpha 3 (Patrick
       Higgins). The call was received at 15.05.53 and stated
                 Alpha 3 - Alpha 3       C.
                 C. A 3 K.

       Mr Hopkins, was in the control room when call was, received
       from Alpha 3 and^he immediately decided to leave for

12.   Shortly afterwards I took a further call from police control
      and was informed that there were a number of fatalities and
      a number of injuries.                  I was given information that a
      "general response" was in operation at Hillsborough.                          I
      aksed what this term meant and was informed that all
      available police manpower from South Yorkshire were being
      requested to attend Hillsborough to deal with the incident.
      (Track 10, Page 2)


13.   Two off duty officers                               and                had by
      chance come into the office.                 Before they arrived I had
      assessed what ambulances                 were available, bearing in mind
      that we still had to allow for routine calls.


14.   I satisfied myself that the control officers had kept back
      sufficient cover and was left with several units, I believe
      eight, and they were all despatched to Hillsborough.                       They
      were sent from various stations within South Yorkshire.


15.   Up to now everything was in order, response was good and
      communications were good.
16    I told               to start a log and record as much as she
      could.                    started to involve himself in the
      control room work mobilising vehicles and contacting other
      ambulance services, West Yorkshire, Nottingham and Derby,
      along with myself.


17.   The other services were informed that we had a major
      incident at Hillsborough Football Ground.         They were asked
      to mobilise whatever vehicles they had available          towards
      the South Yorkshire boundary.            They would be used if
      required at the incident and if necessary to assist in
      routine work. My call to W.Y.M.A.S. is recorded on Track 11
      pages 8 and 9 and .stated.: - to c   c    o   -

18.   I had given                a list of control room staff and told
      her to contact as many as she could and get them into
      control.


19.   It soon became obvious that we were dealing with a major
      incident.     Calls were coming in by radio and telephone about
      Hillsborough and additionally routine calls were coming in
      and being dealt with.      Among the calls were several from the
      press and T.V.     These calls started very early the first one
      being received at 15^28 from the Mail on Sunday.      Throughout
      the afternoon the calls from the media were persistent and
      very often a nuisance. The calls blocked our telephone
      lines, thus hindering our emergency calls to bring in extra
      staff , mobilise extra vehicles and also relaying calls from
      off duty doctors and nurses who could not get through to
      their own hospitals.       Most of the press, when we told them
      that we did not have time to speak to them were considerate
      enough to ring off and telephone back at a given time. Some,
      however,     were extremely persistent and certainly one
      newspaper,     the Sunday Mirror used the 999 call to get
      through to us in their search for information. I and the
      other control staff were particularly annoyed at this
      intrusion. The volume of the press calls was such that
                 Public Relations Officer and P.A. to Mr Page, came
         in off duty and took over the responsibility for answering
         all the press calls. This meant that one of our trained
         staff who would have assisted in the control room with the
         emergency was effectively removed from this function and
         devoted her whole time to deal with media requests for
         information.


20   .                    informed me that the emergency   desk could not
         cope with the volume of work, and I decided the incident
         from then on would be run from the major incident room,
         which is next door. I told the staff what was going to
         happen and with                 went next door to the major

         incident room.


21.      At 15^22 I opened up the Emergency Reserve Channel which
         meant that the majority, if not all, of the calls connected
         with the Hillsborough incident would be taken in the Major
         Incident Room.


22.      I received calls from our units which were mobilised and en
         route, I also received calls from other areas to confirm
         that their units were mobile and available.


23.      I do not know how many ambulances were available from other
         areas, but from the calls I took I knew there were quite a
         lot.   Calls still came in about the incident and demands
      from ambulances grew, so I directed ambulances from other
      areas to the ground with our own units.


24.   At 15^29 (Track 16, Page 3) a call from pwr j^Mr Hopkins| was
      received requesting the major incident vehicle to be
      mobilised.    This vehicle is based at Rotherham and it was
      mobilised at once, as requested.     The vehicle was reported
      mobile and communication with the vehicle was good.    It was
      directed to the ground.


25. I got reports from units sent to the ground to the effect
      that they had arrived.    They reported when they were leaving
      and going to hospitals.      Some reported seriously injured
      people, but all kind of messages came in.


26. When the units had left the patients at the hospitals they
      reported green, that is, empty and were sent back to the
      ground.      Casualties were initially taken to Northern
      General, but when we were told that it was full all units
      were directed to the Hallamshire.


27.   From the feed back I got I felt that we were coping with the
      situation.    The ambulances deployed to the football ground
      seemed to be sufficient for the demand I did not have any
      requests indicating that insufficient units were available.


28.   When the staff on the ambulances came over the radio they
      were calm and when they asked for orders they were given
      them.


29.   The response to the call for control room staff was being
      answered, and as they reported they were deployed to give
      assistance where it was needed.    The routine work was being
      dealt with all the time as well as the Hillsborough
      incident.


30.   All the time I was getting reports from our staff at the
      ground and fairly quickly from this information all or most
      of the casualties had been taken from the ground. The demand
      for units scaled down,      and when they     were no longer
      required I began to "stack" them at two locations, Herries
      Road bus depot and Netherthorpe Road.



31* There was no point having empty ambulances at the ground,
      but they remained at locations easily accessible to the
      ground should they be further required.


32.   Mr Albert Smith who is in charge of communications had
      answered our calls for off duty staff and arrived at
      Control.    I briefed him of the situation.


33.   The situation from the emergency control room began to ease,
      At some stage we were informed that all casualties had been
      cleared and the incident began to wind down.
    34.   During the incident at odd times I was unable to contact a
          certain individual, but all messages that needed to get
          through got through.       It was possible that on those rare
          times when I couldn't contact personnel they were busy
          looking after injured people.    I would describe the overall
          communication throughout the incident as good.


    35.   I do not know how long the incident took.      It was   so busy
          that it was impossible to note the time,          but I would
          describe the response of the services as excellent,      I was
          very proud of the staff.    They kept calm and did a good job.


    36.   As the incident began to close I left the emergency control
          room in the hands of                    and assistant
                took over from


    37.   I went back into the main control room to ensure that the

i         routine work was still going on and I found that it was.     It
          was very orderly and very efficiently run.       Throughout the
          afternoon from the time of the         initial   call on the
          Hillsborough incident between 1500 and 1800 we handled a
          total of 49 emergency calls over and above the Hillsborough
          incident.


    38.   One of the extra tasks we had to perform during the incident
          was to empty a ward at Hallamshire.         We moved several
      patients to the King Edward VII Hospital at Rotherham.


39.   The request came from the hospital to move the patients and
      we used ambulances that we had available to complete the
      move.

Dated this       day of June 1989
RAYMOND CLARKE will state




1.   I am 43 years old, 6.10.1945.         I live with my girlfriend
                  and four children by previous marriages.


2.   I am employed by SYMAS as Control Superintendent and I work
     from the Control Centre, Moorgate, Rotherham.       I joined the
     ambulance service in 1968 and I have worked through the
     ranks since then.     I have been in the control room for 10/12
     years and have gained considerable experience.          I work a
     three shift rota.


3.   On Saturday the 15th April 1989 my tour of duty was 1400-
     2200 hours but as usual I went in early to take over and be
     brought up to date by the earlier Superintendent.


4.   The control room staff consisted of myself in charge,
     Control Officer on the emergency desk,                           l
                                                                      f
     Control Officer on the outpatients desk,
     control assistants                on 1400/2200 hours,
            on days.     It was the usual shift staff.


5.   From 1400 hours it was just routine, dealing with everyday
     incidents.    I was     aware   of   the   football   mat c h   at
     Hillsborough as we had been given information about it and I
     had made myself familiar with the information.

                                   chance come into the office.                                                        Before they arrived I had
                                   assessed what ambulances                                                   were available, bearing in mind
                                   that we still had to allow for routine calls.


                        14.        I satisfied myself that the control officers had kept back
                                   sufficient cover and was left with several units, I believe
                                   eight, and they were all despatched to Hillsborough.                                                                                                    They
                                   were sent from various stations within South Yorkshire.


                        15.        Up to now everything was in order, response was good and
                                   communications were good.


                        16         I told                                    to start a log and record as much as she

                               and if necessary to assist in routine work.                                            1

                      18.      I had given                         a list of control room staff and
                               told her to contact as many as she could and get them into

                      19.      It soon became obvious that we were dealing with a major
                               incident.       Calls were coming in by radio and telephone about

                               cope with the volume of work, and I decided the incident
                               from then on would be run from the major incident room,
                               which is next door*


                               I told the staff what was going to happen and with
                                       went next door to the major incident room.


                                                                                         aaio                                    would

2%,   I received calls from our units which were mobilised and en
      route, I also received calls from other areas to confirm
      that their units were mobile and available.


2^.   I do not know how many ambulances were available from other
      areas, but from the calls I took I knew there were quite a
      lot.   Calls still came in about the incident and demands
      from ambulances grew, so I directed ambulances from other
      areas to the ground with our own units.

       re** (•**<«V * >
2 qu Af/'call from our/Mr Hopkinsj had oomo— in and askad— far the
      major incident vehicle to be mobilised.                This vehicle is
      based at Rotherham and it was mobilised at once,                        as
      requested.          The   v e h icle   was   rep o r t e d   m obile   and
      communication with the vehicle was good.                It was directed
      to the ground.


2^.   I got reports from units sent to the ground to the effect
      that they had arrived.        They reported when they were leaving
      and going to hospitals.              Some reported seriously injured
      people, but all kind of messages came in.


2     When the units had left the patients at the hospitals they
      reported green, that is, empty and were sent back to the
      ground.     Casualties were initially taken to Northern
      General, but when we were told that it was full all units


                                     10{
       were directed to the Hallamshire.


2j?.   From the feed back I got I felt that we were coping with the
       situation.   The ambulances deployed to the football ground
       seemed to be sufficient for the demand I did not have any
       requests indicating that insufficient units were available.


20.    When the staff on the ambulances came over the radio they
       soomod to remain'calmA -They asked for ordersAand were given
       them.


26.    The response to the call for control room staff was being
V\
       answered, and as they reported they were deployed to give
       assistance where it was needed.     The routine work was being
       dealt with all the time as well         as the Hillsborough
       incident.


z/.    All the time I was getting reports from our staff at the
y>
       ground and fairly quickly from this information all or most
       of the casualties had been taken from the ground. The demand
       for units scaled down,    and when they      were no longer
       required I began to "stack" them at two locations, Herries
       Road bus depot and Netherthorpe Road.

3£.    There was no point having empty ambulances at the ground,
       but they remained at locations easily accessible to the
       ground should they be further required.


                                102.
3%.   Mr      Smith A :ho Superintendent had answered our call^ and
      arrived at Control.    I briefed him of the situation.


3^. The situation from the emergency control room began to ease,
      At some stage we were informed that all casualties had been
      cleared and the incident began to wind down.


3^. During the incident at odd times I was unable to contact a
      certain individual, but all messages that needed to get
      through got through.        It was possible that on those rare
      times when I couldn't contact personnel they were busy
      looking after injured people.      I would describe the overall
      communication throughout the incident as good.


3^. I do not know how long the incident took.           It was so busy
      that it was impossible to note the time,            but I would
      describe the response of the services as excellent,         I was
      very proud of the staff.     They kept calm and did a good job.


3$y   As the incident began to close I left the emergency control
      room in the hands of                        and assistant
            took over from


38.   I went back into the main control room to ensure that the
      routine work was still going on and I found that it was.       It
      was very orderly             efficiently run.          ^

        3^.   One of the extra tasks we had to perform during the incident
              was to empty a ward at Hallamshire.       We moved several
              patients to the King Edward VII Hospital at Rotherham.


    jtO.      The request came from the hospital to move the patients and
              we used ambulances that we had available to complete the
              move.

      HILLSBOROUGH DISASTER - CRIMINAL INQUIRY

      Thank you for copying to me the letter from Mr Mervyn Jones,
      Assistant Chief Constable, West Midlands Police.                 It would
      seem that no other major assistance is to be requested from
      RLSD; it is particularly gratifying to note his appreciative
      comments on the excellent work 'carried out by Dr Nicholson
      and his colleagues - who have thus earned much credit for
      themselves and HSE.

        Dear Mr McQuaid

        HILLSBOROUGH DISASTER - CRIMINAL INQUIRY

        I refer to our previous letters of 6 September and 1 November 1989 in
        respect of further Health and Safety Executive involvement in the
        criminal investigation phase of the Hillsborough Inquiry.

        You will no doubt have heard by now from Dr Chris Nicholson, that we
        have involved the Forensic Science Service in the criminal
        investigation. Mr Wilson of the Forensic Science Service, has reviewed
        the work carried out by Dr Nicholson and his colleagues and is well
        satisfied that all that needs to be undertaken, from a technical point
        of view in respect of the broken barrier 124A, has been fulfilled.   The
        only further test which he thought could be a possibility and which I
        believe Dr Nicholson may be contemplating, is a bending test on a similar
        barrier. However, no other major research is foreseen by Mr Wilson,
        consequently it is unlikely that I will be calling upon the Health and
        Safety Executive to do any other major work.

        However, there is one proviso and that relates to subsequent tests which
        will be undertaken by engineers appointed by the various parties to the
        civil proceedings.  I will be supervising these subsequent tests, with
        the assistance of the Forensic Science Service.  One of the conditions
        of access to the barrier for testing purposes is that the Director of
        Public Prosecutions is supplied with the results of these tests and in
        good time. It will be my intention to copy these results, on a
        confidential basis, to Dr Nicholson for his consideration.  This you
        may find helpful because it is feasible that they could effect the
        current deliberations being made by Dr Nicholson and his colleagues in
        conjunction with Professor Maunder's Working Group.




  PLEASE REPLY TO THE OFFICE A T ........ Lloyd House,. Birmingham
                                   -   2   -




To summarise, therefore, we do not see any significant involvement of
the Health and Safety Executive in the future, other than perhaps giving
evidence of their findings to any proceedings which may follow in the
Criminal Courts and which will certainly occur in the Coroner's Court.

Can I take this opportunity of thanking you for all the excellent work
which has been carried out by Dr Nicholson and his colleagues.   I was
particularly appreciative of how they were able to explain in very
simple and clear terms, highly technical subjects.   It is the feeling of
myself and all my officers on the investigation that it has been a
pleasure to work with your organisation.  Thank you.

Yours sincerely

Dear Mr Jones


HILLSBOROUGH DISASTER - CRIMINAL INQUIRY


Thank you for your letter of 11 December and the information about
the future involvement of Dr Nicholson.   I see no difficulty in
agreeing to your consulting with Dr Nicholson and enlisting his
support in the ways you describe.

May I thank you for your kind words on the work carried out by
Dr Nicholson and his colleagues.   We were grateful for the
opportunity to provide technical support to the Inquiry and it is
pleasing to know that the response we were able to provide was
well received.   I shall ensure that your sentiments are brought
to the attention of all the staff involved and, in particular.
Dr Nicholson.

Yours sincerely

1    Mr Jones kindly copied to me his note of 18 August on
Hillsborough.    I must say - without wishing to be sycophantic
that Mr Jones seems to have well and truly impressed RLSD with the
logic of our position and the errors of their ways. Excellent.

2    There     are some points which we shall need to continue to keep
in mind:

     i)    Dr Jones' acceptance that the final HSE compilation
           report should contain references to all that we have
           done; I note that Annex 1, Dr Nicholson's letter to
           Professor Maunder, does not include the work on wall
            stability or - inevitably - revisions of crowd density
            figures;

     ii)   I assume Dr Jones/Dr Nicholson will liaise with TD3 on
           permissible crowd densities in the actual circumstances
           of the Hillsborough ground so that an agreed HSE figure
           can be derived, and on future research needs; on the
            latter, is there a case for a "fast lane" proposal from


     iii) as regards the formation of an HSE Working Group on
          updating the Green Guide, it might be best ifTD took the
          initiative      by writing to Linda Derrick (following
          Mr Jones' consultation with FAID) to let her know of TD's
          expertise and to stimulate action by SPD - action which
          should go wider than her directions to ______________
          Perhaps any research proposals should go before such a
          Working Group.

3    All in all, this is an excellent outcome from what was a
difficult situation.   I am particularly glad to see that Dr Jones
accepts   that the     existing   procedures as regards   obtaining
scientific support via FCGs are sensible.

        4    By means of this note I am asking Mr Jones if he will report
        the broad outlines of this success to the HFCG meeting in
        Folkestone on 2/4 October under matters arising,      ie a verbal
        report.

Dear Miss Kennah

RE:   RESUMED INQUESTS - INDIVIDUAL QUERIES
I r e f e r to your l e t t e r of 3rd January 1991.

Most of the queries which have been raised I do not think a c tu a lly will
a s s i s t the Jury in t h e i r d e lib e ra tio n s but I do understand of course
th a t Some Of the issu es are of very real concern to th e individual

       >g     With the individual c a s e s : -
1.    Christopher Edwards
      I do not think i t appropriate to deal with a ll the queries w ich
      Mr Edwards appears to have r a is e d , n e ith e r do I intend to c a ll
      every named witness who had anything to do with Christopher.
      I t i s n e ith e r necessary nor approp riate. I do intend to l i s t e n
      to PS M J Hemmingway i f p o ssible l a t e r on t h i s week and I also
      a t the mopping up session w ill endeavour to i n v it e Paul Ibbotson
      and Ma r t i n Stanley Smith.                                         —
2#    James Gary Aspinall
      You w ill appreciate from the f a c t th a t you have been at the Inquests
      th a t th e re i s a vast amount of visual evidence and i t would not
      be possib le fo r me to say t h a t there i s :no other in r e l a t i o n to
      James but I am not aware of any and I do not think t h a t I can
      help any f u r t h e r .

3.    Jonathon Owens
      We have d e a lt with t h i s matter* by hearing Michael Robertson and
      L?$-.^**Pr ®P°s e ..tb do anything f u r t h e r . (I w ill w rite to you
      se p arately in due course about your l e t t e r regarding the t i c k e t . )


                                                                      / c o n tin u e d ,..

             4*      Adam Edward Spearitt
                     I am not c le a r whether you are a c tu a lly asking f o r PC H arratt
                     to attend to deal with the point t h a t i s worrying M r~Speantt,
                     but I would be prepared to c a ll him i f i t would help. I do
                     not th ink th e re i s any need to amend th e Summary as such.

             5.      P h i l l i p John S teele
                   —^ r Boyle i s in A u stra lia as I understand i t , but i f i t would
                      help I am prepared to read as documentary evidence on th e basis
                     th a t t h i s i s not evidence which will be disputed, any rele v an t
                     part of his statement.

             6.      Paul Brian Murray
                      In order to a s s i s t I will ask DayidJEfi* to deal with his tim ings.
                     Mr Murray seems to have misunderstood the comment of the
                      p a th o lo g ist. I do not think t h a t anything more i s requ ired .
                      I do not intend to c a ll any of the other o f f i c e r s .

              7/8 Sarah and V ictoria Hicks
                   I think I have d e a lt comprehensively With these two young g i r l s
                   and I do not propose to c a ll any fu r th e r w itnesses.
           ^ f i l W ^ T l t l f f ' b t h e i r outstanding queries -(Page 3 of your l f e t t e r ) : -   ’:   -

              1)      John Alfred Anderson
                      Mr Anderson has already given evidence, as indeed have the
                      patho lo g ist and Dr F o rre st. I do not think anything more needs
                      to be said or done other than any comments I may wish to make in
                      my Summing up.
              2)      Colin Mark Ashcroft
                      I will r e f e r t h i s query to West Midlands Police but I am doubtful
                      th ere i s very much more th a t can be done plus possible statistical
                      analysis.

              3)      Nicholas Peter Joynes
                      I think 1f we knew the name we would have passed i t on to you, but
                      unfortunately information i s not av ailab le.
              Yours sin c ere ly

           said on the radio and all I oould see was the football matoh

  Had been stopped and there were hundreds of supporters on the pitch.

          After a few moments injured and dead football supporters were

  "being carried off the pitch to this entranoe and I began to assist
  the first aid people.

          Several minutes later I heard over the radio that police dogs

 had been requested to enter the ground and I returned to the police

 dog van collected Polioe Dog 'Bruno» and went on to the pitch and stood

 in a line with numerous other dog handlers in front of the Penistone

 Road stand where the Nottingham Forest fans were standing.                                                       At this

 point the Nottingham Forest supporters were subdued and kept asking

 what was happening and were not aggressive.

         After the match had been officially abandoned I returned to the

 police vehicle and resumed patrol with Po HZBBMD assisting with escort­
 ing emergency vehicles eto*

        Returning to the City Centre area it was apparent that most of the

 football supporters were upset and were causing no problems at all.

        At about 7 Pffl the same evening reinxmed to Niagara Polioe Dog

Section where we were subsequently stood down and returned to

Nottingham Police Headquarters.

    ADJOURNMENT DEBATE FRIDAY 24 JANUARY: GEORGE HOWARTH MP (LAB) ON
    THE IMPLEMENTATION OF THE TAYLOR REPORT

    As requested by Mr Wilson in his note of 16 January to Mr Peters,
    we prepared the attached draft speech and briefing papers for
    Mr Lloyd's use when replying to the debate for the Government.

    The speech was prepared in accordance with advice from the Chief
    Whip's Office that Mr Howarth intends to raise the subject of
    implementation of Lord Justice Taylor's Final Report.

    We have since learned that Mr Howarth is also likely to refer to
    police matters which were raised in Lord Justice Taylor's Interim
    Report. Consequently, Mr Lloyd will be advised to make greater
    use of briefing material provided by F2 Division on police
    responsibility and disciplinary procedures (see Annex B, page
    13ff of the attached).   This briefing follows closely the text
    of a letter dated 26 November which Lord Ferrers sent in reply
    to one from Mr Howarth dated 5 November which first raised the
    matter with the Home Secretary.

    On the question of responding to recent press comment on
    Government policy on the Taylor deadlines for all-seated
    accommodation at football grounds in England and Wales,
    I understand that the Minister for Sport confirmed yesterday that
    the Government intends to ensure that the deadlines are met
    whilst acknowledging the financial implications for clubs.
    I would therefore advise against a similar press release being
    issued by the Home Office today.

    DRAFT SPEECH FOR ADJOURNMENT DEBATE - FRIDAY 24 JANUARY 1992




    1. I should like to thank the Hon Member for
                             i



    Knowsley North for providing an opportunity
    for this matter to come before this House once
    more.          Even those of us who were not
    present or did not experience the trauma of
    seeing friends or relatives injured or killed
    before our very eyes cannot escape the
    indelible images created by the terrible events
    that day at Hillsborough.               I know that the
    Hon Member receives constant reminders of
    the disaster from the continuing distress of his
    constituents and I welcome this opportunity to
    go through the way in which the various
    bodies with responsibilities in this area have


    GIM-M084.GIM                  1
sought to respond to this dreadful and
unforeseen disaster.

                    i




2. ’Unforeseen’ is in many ways, I think, the
key word.      It is easy to say now that the
possibility should have been foreseen - and of
course it should.       But nothing like this had
happened before - not in all the previous years
of capacity crowds at football matches or pop
concerts - and a disaster of this magnitude was
simply not something anybody conceived of as
imaginable much less as actually happening.



3. Cataclysms       like       this   which   come
apparently out of the blue nearly always have

GIM-M084.GIM               2
multiple       causes   with     come    together
fortuitously to enable something dreadful and
quite out of the ordinary to happen.          These
may include what the insurers call Act of God,
natural causes and human carelessness or
deliberate misconduct.         Any one of these,
taken separately would have had little effect -
coming together, they can be devastating. As
with many less far-reaching accidents, the
degree of blame which may attach to any of
the people involved in the run-up to the
catastrophe      may    not be     in   any    way
commensurate with the degree of harm
caused.        And this must be pre-eminently a
case where this is true




GIM-M084.GIM              3
4. I think it might help the House if, having
made these preliminary observations, I went
through what has already been done to seek
                     i


out and address the causes which led to this
dreadful accident.
History




5. Within two days of the disaster, Lord
Justice Taylor had been commissioned to
enquire into its causes and his enquiry was
under way.


6   . As a result, as Mr Howarth is aware, the
West Midlands Police Force undertook two
major investigations into the events at
Hillsborough on 15 April 1989.


GIM-M084.GIM             4
7. The first of these investigations was, of
course, the formal enquiry by the Lord Justice
Taylor which was commissioned by the Home
                    i



Secretary on the second day after the disaster.


8   . The investigation, which was inaugurated
by the Taylor inquiry, involved some 440
officers from the West Midlands police force.
They took some 3,776 statements as well as
taking advantage of video films from 3
separate sources which provided, in all, some
71 hours of further evidence.


9. This vast store of evidence was carefully
sifted, and I think that it is fair to say that the
interim report of Lord Justice Taylor on the


GIM-M084.GIM            5
disaster gives a very clear picture of police
activity on the day.

                          i



10.            The   inquest       into   the   death   at
Hillsborough, which took over 100 days to
examine the material facts, constituted a
second inquiry into these events.


11.            The inquest, in fact, served a separate
function, in that the law states that its purpose
is to ascertain the identity of the deceased, and
how, when and where he came by his death.
The Coroners Rules provides that neither the
coroner nor the jury shall express any opinion
on any other matters.




GIM-M084.GIM                   6
12.            In addition, the rules specifically
prohibit the framing of an inquest verdict in
such a way as to appear to determine any
                          i



question of criminal liability on the part of a
named person, or civil liability. Any issue of
civil or criminal liability is a matter for the
civil or criminal courts and not the coroners
inquest.



Criminal Proceedings


13.            In the third inquiry, which followed up
their work for Lord Justice Taylor, the West
Midlands Police Force conducted a further
major investigation with a view to discovering
whether the disaster resulted from, or was

GIM-M084.GIM                  7
made worse by, criminal activity on the part
of any individual.

                         i



14.            The Director of Public Prosecutions
concluded that the results did not indicate that
any one should be made the subject of
criminal proceedings. Perhaps I could add a
comment on this. The conclusions at which
the Director of Public Prosecutions arrived
mean that, so far as anyone can discover - and
the evidence which has been amassed has been
considerable - this terrible disaster was not the
result of criminal activity. The result is that
neither Chief Superintendent Duckenfield nor
Superintendent Murray - nor, for that matter,
any other person - has been charged with any
crime.

GIM-M084.GIM                 8
The Police


15.            For anyone other than a police officer
                          i


that would be the end of the matter.             For
police officers, though, there remains the
question of whether, without having good or
sufficient cause, they failed to fulfil all the
requirements of their role as police officers.
Had they, perhaps, been guilty of a deliberate
neglect of duty, or had there been professional
failure or momentary loss of ’grip’.           Were
there any faults to be addressed in the
organisation as a whole?


16.            All these matters have been addressed
in the intervening years.                One matter
Hillsborough pointed up, tragically, was the

GIM-M084.GIM                  9
need           for   thorough        training   of   police
commanders.                 The Association of Chief
Police           Officers     has      since    developed
appropriate training courses, and those who
act as police commanders at such events now
have the benefit of preparation which
unfortunately was not available to Mr
Duckenfield.


17.            However, as Lord Justice Taylor said,
with such truth, in paragraph 25 of his final
report,
        "Complacency is the enemy of safety"


After Hillsborough I think that anyone
responsible for crowd control where large
numbers of people are present will find it

GIM-M084.GIM                    10
difficult to be complacent ever again, so
perhaps those grieving can draw some comfort
from the thought that their loved ones’ deaths
have not been wholly wasted.


Disciplinary Proceedings


18.            Another investigation of the event? of
the day, therefore covered complaints which
had been made regarding police behaviour.
This investigation involved the taking of a
further 5,341 statements as well as the
scrutiny of all the material which had
previously been examined. It was supervised
throughout           by     the   Police Complaints
Authority.


GIM-M084.GIM                 11
19.            The   Police     Complaints    Authority
subsequently expressed themselves as satisfied
that it had been properly and thoroughly
conducted.


20.            I know that many people would feel
more confidence in these investigations if the
report could be published, but this is one of
those unfortunate instances where decisions
taken to protect one branch of the public
militates against another.             The courts have
decided, in a number of judgements that
people would be less willing to complain of
bad behaviour by the police if there was any
risk that what they had said would become
generally known.              As a result they have said
that such statements are immune from

GIM-M084.GIM                    12
disclosure in the public interest, with the result
that the report of this investigation cannot be
made public.



21.            In order to maintain discipline within
the force, the Police Complaints Authority and
the Deputy Chief Constable are required to
consider whether there are ways in which the
officer may have failed in his duty.           If so,
they are required to arrange for a formal
hearing of the charges against him.


22.            This was done.     After receiving the
report of the complaint investigation, the PCA
decided that Chief Superintendent Duckenfield


GIM-M084.GIM                 13
and Superintendent Murray should face
disciplinary charges.


23.            A police disciplinary hearing is held in
private. It is concerned only with whether or
not the officer concerned may have failed to
conform to police discipline.             The hearing
would not, therefore, in any way contribute to
public knowledge of what happened on the
day, nor would it do more than receive and
consider the evidence, which is already
known,            as   to   the    propriety   of   Mr
Duckenfield’s conduct.




GIM-M084.GIM                  14
Maximum punishment - dismissal


24.            There is one important issue in relation
to police discipline which is often ignored.
There are a number of punishments which can
be imposed for bad discipline. The most
serious          punishment,        though,   which   a
disciplinary tribunal can impose, is that of
dismissal or of requirement to resign.


25.            This is the heaviest punishment which
it is possible to award an officer for the very
worst offence which he could have committed.
In other words, his conduct must have been so
bad that it would be inappropriate for him to
remain as a police officer.


GIM-M084.GIM                   15
26.             By retiring, in advance of whether or
not he had been found guilty, Mr Duckenfield
has, in fact, done what the worst disciplinary
                           5



judgement could have imposed upon him to
do.            He has resigned.     He is no longer a
police officer. A disciplinary hearing can no
longer be undertaken against a person who is
not a police officer.


27.             It must be remembered too that it is
impossible to tell, in advance of any hearing
whether or not Mr Duckenfield was guilty of
the precise charges which had been laid
against him.           Nor would it have been easy to
determine the issue, had it been decided that
disciplinary proceedings must be carried to
their ultimate conclusion. A man as ill as Mr

GIM-M084.GIM                   16
Duckenfield is said to be might well not be fit
enough to attend a hearing of the disciplinary
charges against him, and the whole procedure
would be at risk of being overturned on
judicial review had the hearing proceeded in
his absence when that absence was the result
of genuine and demonstrable illness.



28.            Whilst our sympathies are all very
much with those who were caught up in this
terrib le          tragedy,        the   position   of
Mr Duckenfield needs equally careful and just
handling.


29.            If Mr Duckenfield is a sick man, as
seems to be the case, it would not have been

GIM-M084.GIM                  17
right to refuse him retirement on medical
grounds in order that charges could be heard
against him, which might or might not be
proved, but whose most serious result could
only be that he would leave the service which
he was already ready to leave voluntarily.


30.            Finally, I should inform the House that
on 13 January 1992 the Police Complaints
Authority           announced       that      disciplinary
proceedings against Superintendent Murray
would be withdrawn. When explaining their
decision          the   Authority    stated     that   the
retirement of the Chief Superintendent on
medical grounds meant that what is, in effect,
a joint allegation of neglect of duty could not


GIM-M084.GIM                  18
    be fairly heard in the absence of the more
    senior officer.


    31   . These decisions are ones for the Police
^   Complaints           Authority,   the   local   police
    authority and the chief constable, but I hope I
    have said enough to explain to the House that
    their actions had a sound foundation in
    common-sense, although they are not matters
    in which my right Hon friend, the Home
    Secretary, has a role to play.


    The Coroner


    32.            The hon member also mentioned in the
    course of his speech the dissatisfaction of
    some of his constituents with the results of the

    GIM-M084.GIM                 19
coroners’ inquest.           As I said earlier, I think
that some of this dissatisfaction comes from a
misperception of what an inquest is and does.


33.            If anyone is dissatisfied with any aspect
of an inquest including the verdict (as I believe
some relatives are), a coroners inquest, like
many other things, is open to challenge by
way of judicial review although clearly anyone
contemplating such a course of action would
be well advised to seek legal advice at an early
stage.


34.            It is also open to them, under section
13 of the Coroners Act 1988, to apply with
the authority of the Attorney-General, for the
High Court to quash the verdict and order a

GIM-M084.GIM                  20
fresh inquest to be held, either by the same
coroner or by a different one from the same
administrative area. This however would be
                  S


a matter for my right hon friend the Attorney
General to speak to rather than myself.




GIM-M084.GIM          21

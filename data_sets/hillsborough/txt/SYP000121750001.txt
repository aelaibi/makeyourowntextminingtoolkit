           On Saturday,,           15th April,          1989     (150489)          I was       on duty        in connection

           w ith the FA C u p Semi--Final                  at H i l l s b o r o u g h Football              Ground.        I

            commenced        duty at E c c l e s f i e l d Po l i c e S t a t i o n at 9am                  (0900)      on that

           date and t o g e t h e r w i t h other              officers,           was    t r a n s p o r t e d to the

           football        ground       for     the    10am     (1000)      briefing.               My serial       number      for

           this duty was              serial     46.

           Following         the      briefing        I took     up mobile          patrol          in the S t o c k s b r i d g e /

           accompanied           by    Inspector Walker,,

           Whilst      on patrol         in that area,            I saw numerous                vehicles        of various

           types     travelling          in the d i r e c t i o n s      of H i l l s b o r o u g h w h i c h were

           that     the    large       car    park a d j a c e n t    to these           premises was           full     of

           private        cars,       vans and mini"buses,               some       of which were             display!

Liverpool          favours.

In    view    of       this       I entered             the       ’S i l v e r        Fox'       in       company            with    Inspector

Walker       and       PC    1363       Smyk.           We    visited                both       the      main        rooms      within          the

premises          and       saw    that       a    large          number             of    persons             w e re    present          who

could    be       readily          identified                as    Liverpool                   supporters               by    the    favours

they    w e re     wearing.                 There       were       in       the       premises             well         in    excess       of       1 00

fans,    all       of       whom       were       very       voluble             and       obviously              under        the       influence

of    intoxicants                  all       having          part       consumed                alcoholic               drinks       in    front

of    them.        The       mood       was       boisterous                and       noisy          but       not      aggressive.                 The

distance          between          the       ’S i l v e r     Fox"          public             house       and       Hillsborough

Football          Ground          is    some       7 miles.

We    then    resumed             patrol,          travelling                in       the       direction               of    Hillsborough.

As we     came w i t h i n             range       of the G r o u n d Control                             radio transmi s s i o n s ,                      I

a perimeter             gate.           I did       not hear what                         call       sign this officer                     used

but    there was a dete c t a b l e                      note          of    conc e r n          in the voice and during

On    arrival          outside          Hillsborough                   Football                Ground          I saw         that    a    large

number       of    people          were       gathered             near          to       the    Leppings               Lane    end       of    the

ground       but       there       were       no    obvious             signs             of    "trouble',.                  1 saw

Superintendent                Marshall             standing             on       a    wall       in L e p p i n g s           Lane

We    alighted          from       our       Police          vehicle             and       on    instructions                  from

Superintendent                Marshall             formed          a    line          across             the    access         to    the

Lappings          Lane       end       of    the    ground             to    discourage                   the     large        number          of

fans    who       were       still          arriving          expecting                   to    be       given       entry      to       the

ground.           By    this       time,          the    sounds             of       the       game       inside         the    ground          could

although             I did       not          consult                my    watch         at    this       stage.              I saw       an

ambulance             arrive             and       it      was        directed            to    the       Lane       at       the    side       of    the

Leppings             Lane       Terraces.                       Whilst          turning         to    see       why       the       ambulance             had

been       summoned,             I saw             a       large          number         of    supporters                in    the       area    to       the

rear       of    the       turnstiles                      giving          access         to    the       Leppings             Lane       Terraces,

some       of    whom          were       very             clearly          distressed               although             not       apparently

injured.              Certain             comments                   were       made      with       reference                to    our    being

needed          inside          the       ground.                    I indicated               to    my       crew       that       we    should

enter       the       L.e p p i ng s L a n e                Terraces             w h i ch we         did.           On    e nt r y , I s a w

towards          the       rear          of    the          terraces,               a    number       of       supporters                staggering

towards          the       tunnel,,            some             of    whom       had      apparently                suffered             main

injuries             to    limbs          and          one       who       had      blood       on    his       face.              I assisted             a

number          of    these          into          the          area       between            the    tunnel          giving          access          to       t he

terraces             and       the       turnstiles.                       1 then         returned             to    the       terraces          where           I

saw    a    large          number             of       supporters                milling            around          and,       towards          the

front,          several          prostrate                      supporters,               some       of       whom       were       moving       and

amongst          those          present,                   some       of    whom         were       applying             artifical

respiration                arid h e a r t              massage             to    persons            lying       on       the       terraces.

Other       officers             were          carrying                   persons         from       the       terraces             and    passing

them       to    other          officers                   on    the       perimeter            track.              I also          saw

Superintendent                   Greenwood                      standing            in    the       open       gate       in       the    fence       which

borders          the       Leppings                Lane          Terraces.                He    had       a    hard       megaphone             and       was

attempting                to    direct             operations,                   I heard            him       instruct             the    persons

working          on       the    terraces                   to       pass       the      injured          persons             to    other       officers

instead          of       trying          to       accompany                them         through          the       gate.

There       were          also       a    number                of    Liverpool               supporters             assisting             in    the

removal          of       bodies          and          injured             persons            and    several             hoardings             were       torn

from       the       walls       of       the          West          Stand       to      be    used       as    stretcher^                 ~---------------

                                                                                                                                          R536

I made       my    way       to       the    front          of    the       terraces          and       saw       a    male       person

lying       across          the       terrace          on    top       of    another          male          person.              The    latter

was    moving          slightly             whilst          the    person          lying          on    top       of       him    was

completely             inert.           I assisted                two       Liverpool             supporters                to    move    the

uppermost          person             and    then          carry       the       lower       man       to    the       perimeter          gate

where       he    was       passed          to    other          officers.              I then          assisted             in    passing           a

further          three       bodies          onto          the    perimeter             track          but       I cannot          say

whether          any    of       these       persons             were       alive       or    dead.

Whilst       carrying             out       these          duties,          I became          aware          of       other       Liverpool

supporters             in    the       seated          area       of    the       West       Stand          who       spitting          and

throwing          coins          at    the       officers          working          on       the       terraces             to    the    extent

that    I felt          constrained                   to    tell       the       officers          closest             to    me    to    arrest

their       gaze       from       the       West       Stand       to       prevent          possible             injury          to    their

eyes.        Whilst          working             alongside             the       Liverpool             fans       I noticed             that

there       was    a    very          strong          smell       of    intoxicants                and       a    large          number        of

them    were       being          abusive             to    Police          O f f icers,,

Whilst       I was          in    the       Leppings             Lane       Terrace,          a    Scenes             of    Crime       Officer

entered          the    terrace             to    photograph                the    debris          remaining                and    was

jostled          and    jeered          at       by    the       Liverpool          supporters.                       Police       Officers

intervened             and       brought          the       photographer                to    the       perimeter                track.

Almost       immediately                I saw          a    man    wearing          a    * T ’ shirt              bearing          the

Liverpool          FC       logo       stooping             to    pick       up    coins          which          had       been    thrown           by

the    occupants             of       the    West          Stand.           Me    was    immediately                   attacked          by-

other       supporters                and    1    was       obliged          to    intervene                to    prevent          him    being

i njuured.

I    then    received             information                via       personal          radio          that          the    fans       were        to

be    allowed          to    leave          the       ground       and       I    returned,            after           mustering          my

crew,       to    mobile          patrol          outside          the       ground.

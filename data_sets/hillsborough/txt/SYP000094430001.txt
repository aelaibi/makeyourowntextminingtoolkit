              very       tight and          I was      being      pushed from behind so                    I got       up onto     the

              people and sort                 of    rolled my way forw ar d to the front, hoping                              to find a

                somebody          I d o n ’t      know          who,    helped       me       and    I got      pulled      over          the    fence

                and    then       I    collapsed            on    the    floor       trying          to   get   my        breath          back.

                During       the       time    all         this    was    going       on       I d o n 't k n o w         where      D a v e was,      but

                I did       not       see   him       and       neither       did    1 see          anything      of      the       opening       of    the

                gate    at    the       front         of    the    pen.        All    I can          remember        is    that       there       were    a

                lot    of    people         around          that       area    when       I    looked.

                I have       no       complaint            to    make    against          any       individual            policeman.

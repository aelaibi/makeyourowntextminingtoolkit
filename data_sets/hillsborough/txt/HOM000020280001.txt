Dear Sirs


HILLSBOROUGH STADIUM DISASTER
YOUR CLIENTS: TRENT RHA/SYMAS

Thank you for your letter of 25 September regarding paragraph 105
of Lord Justice Taylor's Interim Report and the positioning of
ambulances.

Lord Justice Taylor has considered the points you have made but
does not consider it appropriate to make any reference to the
matter in the Final Report, which will deal with the wider issues
of crowd control and safety at sports grounds. In any case, as
you say, it is clear to all the parties concerned with the
Inquiry exactly where the ambulances were positioned and it
therefore seems unnecessary to pursue the point further.

                                        Yours faithfully



                                           1^.

                      Dear Sir


                      Hillsborough Stadium Disaster
                      Our clients - Trent Regional Health Authority/SYMAS



                      Thank you for your letter of 14 September.

                      We have considered the evidence given by Mr Higgins on day 24
                      of the Inquiry, as set out on pages 35 & 36 of the transcript
                      for day 24.

                      We believe it is clear to all parties concerned with the
                      Inquiry that on the occasions of the 1988 and 1989 semi­
                      finals, in addition to the 4 SYMAS Officers inside the ground,
                      the ambulance in which they travelled was located between the
                      Spion Kop and the North Stand as indicated on the enclosed
                      plan.    This was made clear by Mr Higgins on page 35 of the
                      transcript for day 24 when Mr Goldsack requested Mr Higgins to
                      identify the position of his ambulance at the 1988 semi-final.
                      Mr Higgins then proceeded to confirm the same arrangements for
                      the 1989 semi-final on page 36 of the transcript.

                      As you quite rightly point out in paragraph 3 of your letter
                      of 14 Sept emb er, Mr H i g g i n s a p p e a r s to h a v e us ed the
                      expressions "outside" and "inside" the ground to cover the
                      same description i.e. the area between the Penistone Road
                      entrance and the ramp leading to the pitch between the Spion
                      Kop and North Stand.

                       Our only worry concerns a possible misunderstanding by any

        member of the general public who reads the report as to the
        location of the ambulance if they simply read Lord Justice
        T a y l o r ’s interim report without having had sight of the
        evidence given by Mr Higgins to the Inquiry.       For the most
        part Lord Justice Taylor has regarded the area within the
        curtilage of the stadium, rather than simply the pitch area,
        as being inside the ground.       Bearing this point in mind we
        would be grateful if the location of the ambulance at the
        1989 semi-final could be clarified either by use of the word
        "inside" in place of "outside", or by specifically referrring
        to its position being between the Spion Kop and the North

HILLSBOROUGH STADIUM DISASTER
YOUR CLIENTS: TRENT RHA/SYMAS


Thank you for your fax of 7 August in which you draw attention to
paragraph 105 of Lord Justice Taylor's Interim Report.  I fear
that the question whether the reference to the ambulance being
outside or inside the ground is not as simple as you suggest.
There has been no printing error. Lord Justice Taylor was guided
by the evidence given by Mr Higgins (Day 24 pages 35 and 36).
You will see that in the course of questioning Mr Higgins was not
asked specifically where the ambulances were at the 1989 semi­
final: there was a detailed description of the 1988 semi-final
and those arrangements were said to have "occurred" this year
also.

In the account of the 1988 semi-final, Mr Higgins said first that
there was an ambulance outside the ground, in an area between the
Spion Kop and the north stand, close to the gymnasium (contrasted
with the four SYMAS officials inside the ground). A few lines
later, however, Mr Higgins agreed with a description of the
arrangements in 1988 as an ambulance inside, with a second one on
standby nearby.

That seems to be where the difficulty has arisen. Mr Higgins
seems to have used the expression outside and inside the ground
to mean the same. Presumably, however, there is no doubt in his
mind where the ambulance was located.  In other contexts, Lord
Justice Taylor has indeed regarded the area within the curtilage
of the ground, rather than the playing area and viewing areas, as
"inside" the ground.
I should be grateful if you could look through the transcript and
confirm our understanding of what Mr Higgins was saying, and
whether you agree with us as to how the difficulty has arisen.

                                           We believe that there has been a printing error and that the
                                           sentence should bet

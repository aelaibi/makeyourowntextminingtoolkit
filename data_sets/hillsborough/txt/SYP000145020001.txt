'       325. DID YOU SELL ALCOHOL TO FANS FOR CONSUMPTION OFF THE PREMISES

             AND CAN YOU ESTIMATE THE QUANTITY?


5. o.
             I sold cans which were for drinking on the premises as I had run
AlXQfiOl     out of glasses.             In addition it is quicker to sell a can than to

Ej£-ufi£J)   pour a pint.           This made life easier in view of the large custom

             and demand.

                That a similar thing was building up last year <1988) and was

                narrowly avoided.      They did not impress how it was avoided but

                were implying it was on the cards last year.

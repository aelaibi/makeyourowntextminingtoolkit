Q37„    DO YOU HAVE ANY VIEWS ON THE WAY THIS DISASTER WAS CONTROLLED

        FOLLOWING THE RECOGNITION OF THE INCIDENT HAPPENING?



        When the incident happened,      we went to the dressing        room with

        the players.      We were   informed by the referee that there would

        be a 15 minute delay because of crowd problems,,             We remained

        in the dressing     room avid were occasionally informed of wnat was

        going on and were not told of any fatalities,,           Mot straight

        away anyway.      I c a n ’t remember the time but,    at about 4.00 pm

        <1600),     Graham KELLY and the referee    came and asked the manager

        to make a. message to the crowd,       I didn't hear the m e s s a g e .

        The manager then came back to the changing          room and said the

        game would not go on and the players got into the bath.                We

        all got changed and waited to leave the ground.              At this time

        we knew there were a few fatalities had occurred but no

        f igures.

        At about 5.15 pm (1715)       I was on the coach and talking to our
                                                                                           PAGE
                                                                                           D547

                 do c to r,                    and ha said he heard nothing over the

                 P ufal i c address    as :•<i n g for doctors to go and give ass ista n ce ,

                Also there was our Club Surgeon,                                      and a

                                      a friend o i                        None heard any

                message or were asked to give as s is ta n ce .

                 They were in the stand but did/not know what was going on.

                Equally,      I know first aid aryfi had mouthpieces but we did not

                 know what was going on otherwise we could have helped,

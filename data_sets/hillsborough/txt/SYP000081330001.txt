                   I have         been             asked       about       events          at      Hillsborough             Football       Ground       on

                   Saturday               15th       April          1989       </l 5 0 4 8 9 ) .

                   I arrived                  at    the       ground       w j.th     my    wife         at    about    1410     hours      on    that       day.

S .fO . £          At    this         time          there       was       no    trouble          at      the    turnstiles.           In    fact       there
  U -L~.
                   were      only             about       5    or    10    people          outside            our    turnstile.

                   We    made         our          way    to    our       seats       in    the       North         Stand

                   It    was      about             1445       hours       when       I noticed               that    there     was   extra       pressure

                   in    the      middle             sections             of    the     West        Stand.           I couldn't       pick       out    any    one

                   thing         in       particular.                 1 witnessed                  the     general      situation          after       the

                   match         was          stopped.              I was       situated            about       100    yards     away      from    the       West

                   Stand         so       I    couldn't             see    things          very       clearly.          I    could    see    the       general

                   situation,                  people          being       carried          away,          e tc.

               I would          describe             one     as     a    white          youth,           about        13    or       14 y e a r s      old.              He

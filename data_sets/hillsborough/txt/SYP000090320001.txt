               States s

                I have been a supporter               of Liverpool            Football       Club all   my   life.     I am

               a season ticket            holder=       I got a ticket           for the FA Cup Semi-Final

                b etween Liverpool           & N o t t i n g h a m Forest      to be played at H i l l s b o r o u g h

               S t a di um    in S h e f f i e l d on 15th April        1989      (150489)      wit h the use of the

               voucher        from my season ticket.               It was a p6 L a p p i n g s Lane Terrace

               Ticket.



                I t ravelled t£ the match with                                        my broths?

                                     f and                                     As far as       I remember we

                hired a car and                                       drove     it.     We    left home ai

               about      11,00 am        <1100)   and went to S h e f f i e l d via the M a nc he st er

               mo to rw ay s and         then via some       ’A 5 roads.         The    traffic was      quite
                                                                                                      PAGE
                                                                                                      S3458

bad ’& it took           us quite a bit          longer    than usual



A bout 7 miles away from the ground we stopped at a pub for a

drink.          I d o n ’t remember       the name of the          pub or

I think we got to the               pub at about          1.30 pm    (1330)      a nd we stayed about

40 minutes.           I just      had some       food & 1.1/2       (one and a half)            pints    of

beer.      We a rri ve d     in S h e f f i e l d & parked the        car    in H e at h Roa d quite

close      to the ground,          by that       time    it was about 2.30         pm.     (1430)        I did

not see any         police where we          parked the          car but an yw ay we knew which

way to go.



On our way to the            ground       I did not       see any fans who were            drunk

or who were         behaving       badly.        I was    never    checked by the         police

on my way to the            ground       to see    if I had a ticket.                      X'
                                                                                    ^ X d )

I got to the L e p p i n g s Lane           entrance       t o the grcNjnd^^ t      a b o u t 2 .40     pm.

(1440)          There were     no queues         being    formed,    just a large mass            of fans

like a wedge          in front      of the turnstiles.              I saw a number         of mounted

police at this            point    but they a p p e a r e d to be just           stuck    in the      crowd

themselves.



I   knew    I    had to go to the          right hand turnstile             so   I just joined the

crowd.          Suddenly    1 realised       I    was    on my own & I had         lost all my mates.



I e ventually got through a turnstile                          the second on the         left    next    to

the wall.          I handed my ticket             in,    but    it must   have    been about       15

minutes         before    1 got    in.     While I was outside the turnstile I did see
                                                        /
fans    climbing         out of the       crush onto t/te top of the turnstiles. I.

remember         hearing    fans    saying       go to ithe      right of me as a gate was               open:
                                                                                                          P A GE      3
                                                                                                          33458

When* I got t hrough the turnstile                       I just went      straight         over to my         left.
k
I did not hang about.                  I     made for the      tunnel.        I    did not       look to see

if any gates were              open.         In the are a between the turnstiles & the

tunnel       I saw a number           of     Stewards but       no-one    gave me         any directions.

I w an te d     to stand behind              the goal so       I just went          for the tunnel.            I

did not        look for any « <**■»« 1'" tell              me where      to go.



I was able           to get down the tunnel               quite    e a s i l y and at      the end     I went

sli gh tl y to/ffiy left            into a pen I now know              is No 4.       I got       over to the

left ha era fence about               half way down to the front                   fence.        It was     very

fulL/but        by pushing          I was able       to get     through.          I got to this        point

    st before 3.0 0           pm    (1500)    as    I did see the kick             off.



V ery shortly after                the kick off        I lost     interest        in the m a tc h as the

crush got so tight                 that my    chest     started to hurt & I could not get my

b r e a t h , and     I was    feeling       sick.       I could not see what was                 going     on in

the    rest of my pen or the other                     pens,    all    I wa nt ed to do was           get    out.

E v en t u a l l y   I was able       to    push down towards           the front and            I got out of

a small       gate     to the       left of the goal as            I looked at        it, and        I got out

onto the         pitch.       I must       have    got out     quite quickly as whe n I got                   on

the    pitch there were              not man y      people     there.      I thought        the m atch may

start a gain so           1 went      through anot he r         gate    back onto         the    terraces      in

either       pen 6 or 7 & I stood watching                     what was       going    on       but I was    just

numb & didn't           realise what was happening.



I e ve nt u al ly went         back out onto the             pitch to try & find my brother.                        I

w a l k e d a ro u n d but     I could not find him.                  While   I was       on the     pitch that

time     I saw fans        taking other            fap C ^ a w a y on the a d v e r ti si ng      boards & I

helped once to            carry a casual                  We just took him the              length of the

pitch to the           corner       by thVjk'op.         I am sure the man            I helped to           carry

                 wa?* ^ rrian of about 3 8 / 4 0 y r s , about         16 stone,      he had on a dark

                 pullover w hich was           pulled up over his        face,       I think he had dark         hair.

vj<cA^a-eP       We had picked this man up from a point                      just   to the    left of the      penalty

             •   spot as        I looked back     towards       the Leppings Lane       terrace.



                 I then spent a long            time just walking about             looking    for my brother &

                 e ve nt u al l y went    out of the ground at about 4.30               pm    (1630)   via the

                 L e p pi ng s Lane    gate.



                 I believe       that the      first    thing     that went wrong was         that   the Liverpool

                 fans had the L ep pi ng s Lane            end.     I think we should have           had the    larges

                 kop end.        I also   think     that    the game    should have      been held up for         15/

                 20 minutes       to try to sort a bit of order.



                 At the m atch         I was wearing a                        sweatshirt,      track   suit bottoms

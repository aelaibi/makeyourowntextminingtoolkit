        Dear Mr Kennedy

        Now that all of the interviews are complete I forward to you the
        transcripts of those interviews.

        It has been necessary to refer to additional statements and documents which
        are not currently in the file we forwarded to you.  These statements and
        documents are included with the transcripts and I have enclosed a schedule
        which explains exactly what these additions are.

        My officers will insert the documentation into your file on delivery if you
        so wish.

        As you know initially in Part VII5; the report, we recommended interviewing
        both Mr McGee, the then Chairman of Sheffield Wednesday Football Club and
        Mr Keith Addy, the Director with specific responsibility for structural
        matters at Hillsborough.  I would be grateful if, after consideration of
        the interview with the Secretary, Mr Mackrell, you could reply with
        confirmation as to whether these interviews should take place.

        Certainly it is unlikely Mr McGee and his solicitor would agree to an
        interview based upon my previous explanation to you.  However, Mr Addy
        would, I understand, make himself available if necessary.

        We have encountered difficulty in obtaining a full statement from Mr B0WNES
        of the Council.  That is complete now but has led to further enquiries and
        documentation to explain the points you wanted to cover.   I am hopeful this
        documentation will be with you in the next seven d a y s .

        If I can be of further assistance please contact either myself or Detective
        Chief Superintendent Foster of Nechells Green Police Station.

        Yours sincerely

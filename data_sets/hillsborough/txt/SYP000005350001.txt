    I a m also a native of L i v e r p o o l                and      i ndeed have       supported Liverpool

    Last year        there was an          identical           game at H i l l s b o r o u g h a nd my brother,

    only ticket          he could get          then he w o u l d not attend.                     It seems

             their      r es pe ct iv e m o t o r w a y     exits was         the    reason.        However,         the       lad^-tfT

             witnessed         in those        pictures went              some way,        if not all       the way,            to

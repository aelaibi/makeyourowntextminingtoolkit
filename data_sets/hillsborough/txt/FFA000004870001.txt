1.   INTRODUCTION



        I. 1   ;X5h 3 Times reported on 17th May,          "Bvaryone wants a

simple,        sasy solution to the ills of English football,                  'There is

notis,      Tha solution, must address a complexcombination                   of social

and political issues and those of the game itself",



     i.          2   rhe game has Seen .beset by the twin problems of

hooliganism and outdated facilities.                   It has attempted to tackle

both.



     1,          3   Hooliganism has been contained by the deployment of

hugh resources,        tooth in terms ox manpower and finances.                 Better

intelligsnc®,        closed circuit television surveillance and blanket
                 %
policing,       Sacked by public order legislation in general and

alcohol legislation in particular,                 havg drastically reduced the

number of incidents inside grounds.



     L. 4       Clubs have spent an rsstisiated £50 million                 on safety

jisagurss sines tha Safety of Sports Grounds Act 1975 led to tha

^stablishaent of The Football Grounds improvement Trust.                          3>ut

have becrun to recalve grants for ground iimprovements generally.

•aillion per year from pools sources,        Thsre is no need to create

a Football Levy Board,        as proposed by the Rothschild Commission

in 1977 'when it recommended a reduction, of duty to 37%., because

the Football Trust/Football Grounds Improvement Trust already

acts asa suitable vehicle         with proven track record.



     •2. 3    ‘
              Tharo is also the need for ready access to expertise in

th_$ area of modernisation and construction of football stadia.

The Football Association is investigating ways of 'providing a

3 0 nsultancy   service.



3.   CROWD CONTROL



     3, 1    The confrontation between supporters needs to be

eliminated,      This can toe achieved not by embracing the National

Membership Schema,        which threatens the very sxistenc© of the game

by detering the casual supporter,        costing millions of pounds and

•alienating ths& trya rah,, but by going down a different road

whereby ths> away fan must belong to the away club; s membership

•scheme.     The tribal aspects of football support would to©

Bliminatsd and tha element of friendly rivalry would come back to

th$ game.



     3, 2     Theseplans nesd th$ wholehearted backing of the police

and the       clubs. The polios, h. C, P, 0. , have already endorsed the

 partial home,     100%    away" membership scheme,   although it will

esquire rigorous policing in tha early stages          (and, incidentally,

■sariy ciltaring and exchange of information about travelling

•peoplej to prevent away non-members gaining access to home
    .-sxaaxa uo c^cosaa saier,          mors vnqxas©ms aranas.        -L'lisy snQOV

    sj-srmanent bases o£ support and ancillary aotlTttiss and flo uot in

     gsneral, need to considor moving or sharing,



            2. 4   To supplement these existing stadia we need, however,

    asw multi - p u r p o s e grounds,     on gxeen field sites,       ready and

     filling to host major international tournaments,                  such as the

    sM.F.A,         World Cup, which requires a number of &ll~seater

    •Stadia.



         2.                 5   There are many clubs that would welcome tbs opportunity

3   of moving to areas that provide better communications-, better

    parking, perhaps shared use of facilities,                    Many spring to stiad

    as candidates:          The Bristol clubs, one of whom has no currant

    hom©/     Fulham and Brentford,        Blackburn and Preston,        Bolton and

    Bury,, Rochdale and Oldham,           Leeds and Bradford,        Chester and

    ■fesshara, Stoke City and Port Vale, Huddersfield Town and

    Halifax,       Watford and Luton Town/ Enfield and Barnet,



         2-             6       As a first phase.    The Football Association should look

^   again at the feasibility study carried out in 198 3 based on a

    ground sharing proposal,             Tha briaf;    to -provide a modal

    multi-purpose,          two-club stadium,   on a green fielfl aits.          The

    finance would not necessarily be out of the question,                    given

    billing partners from tha areas of contruotion,                   property

    development,        local authority and finance.             Public money might be

    aada available to the consortium,               both U. K.   and E. S. C. fco support

    this private invitiativs,



        2,          7   To provide the necessary stimulus cor these improvements

    '-.here is a strong case for the rsduotion in the pool betting tax
           in view of ths intense speculation about football' g

    rasponae to last Saturday's incidents at Crystal Palaca and

    slsswhera,    Ths Football Association is today making public %

    diaousaion. document tft&t will be put before tha F\ A. Council next

    Thursday,    25th May.



          It is anticipated that this paper will form the basis of

    Tha Football Association-' s evidence in rslation to part 2 of Lord

^   Justice Taylor's enquiry and the Mue*-print £or the laa.d the

    association m i l   take in dealing with th§ complex - sand oftsn

    contradictory - issues o t hooliganism and orowd safety.

                                                              .g anvironmant



      I,       6    Football needs a dynamic approach towards regenerating

 tts iaiage.       The game enjoys a vast fund of goodwill,      ■
                                                                 ’

linos 1986 has ssan mora people playing and watching the game.

An increase in the length of suspensions has led to a reduction

in player misconduct in The Football League.             Wa must o&oitalise

on this base in tha wake of Hillsborough.            Yet again wa have been

propalled into the national and international limelight and the

glare is uncomfortable,



2.     SEAT1M5 AMD PACT LI TIBS



      2, l    First*   we nee& to get aor® seats into our major     grounds,

■Phs First Division i s      38% .s-satsd..   Experience at Aberdeen and

Glasgow Rangsrs has shown-that,           If supporters are treated well,

they reaot wall.        -Seated customers are more 3 at sly controlled and

the    tandemoy to taunt and gesture is gradually isseenad.          Grounds
                                         f"
become batter places to visit.           spectators can stand and watch in

safety,      but the ratio of seats to standing accommodation siust toe

ai tared so that thers is a prsaponderanca of seats, }



      2.       2    -Second, we need to improve our facilities at grounds.

rher$ is little incentive for tha fan, particularly the

travelling supporter,       to rorago the pub unless the ground can

offer rsasonabiy-pricad,        wholasoxne refreshment.    -The football

Association cannut raaouroes Into a driva for bettsr amenities.

A number of our top grounds must bsjooms all -aeatsr ii >73 are <aver

again, to be abla to stage international events.
          Z, 3    T.hsse Is a need for tha football authorities to

  33tabllsii a common policy on delaying kiak-offs,             Perhaps tbs

  -safety and security of spectators is the only criterion* but I

  raise ths point because rfha Football League had,            until

  Hillsborough,        been adopting a harder lin© on late kick-offs,

  faarful not only of encouraging supporters to arrive later .but

  also,     in the 1 attar stages of the season., Of i3 Qiltrived endings.



       3,          4   Fencing will continue to be 'esquired for the foreseeable

  future,        given that thera is insufficient space for moats.           Ths

  id-^al pitch protection affords ready accass to the playing area

  in oases of ^mertgsnoy.         Tha Football Association is arranging a

  visit to Frano? to inspect tiis latest design, in eonjunction with

 representatives of the local authorities who, of oourss,                  are

 rssponsi bla tor 1icans ing,




 recommendations that havs not yat be©n implemented.                For

y n e t a n c 8 j .the polios* should b» giv^n ths unfsttsrad right to

      3.           5   Thar a ig a. ^ifivois common law which, wor&s axe 3.11ant ly in

 Scotland - breach of ths psac© - vhi o h in practice covers any act

 likely' to provoke dig order,          -Tha law thsr? is tlsxiijla,      but in

 Sngland and Walss >;he Qov^rrunsnt h.ava not aot$d Upon Popplswall' e

 r dmi raisl *> raaosmsndafeions,
      4, l   Th~s Football Association has a vary active Medical

Comsnitt®^, concerned primarily with ths safety and well-being of

players.      It would be possible,      through this Committee,   to draw

up a schedule of minimum medical facilities which should be

ii\corporatsd into the Guide to Safety at Sports Grounds.



3-   .SUPPORTER RELATIONS



     5. 1     There is undoubtedly a need for better communication

with those "who support our game,          The Football Assooiation is

consulting organisations with relevant exp&risnce in ths area of

a ustom&r relations.        The Association should consider employing a

customer relations liaison officer.



0,   OTHER RECOMMENDATIONS



     5. 1    Tha Football Association is looking to invest resources

in strengthening our activities across ths board and go th© next

phaee will be to conduct a major,          national survey,   of the leisure

nseds of our towns and cities.           Thar® ars plenty of people who

still want to play football.         Ths game is booming.     There are not

as many people intsrastsd in refereeing ths gams and so we need

Ko put say, £100, 000 p, a. into a programme for rsoruitiaent,
training and incentives for match officials.



     $> 2    But,   store importantly,   facilities and services ars being

.squeezed to ths extent that tha pitches will not be available

unless we take steps to ascertain and meet the likely demand.

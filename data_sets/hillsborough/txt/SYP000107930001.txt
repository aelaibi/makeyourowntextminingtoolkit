Police Sergeant 752




Woodseats Police Station




I    am   a Police           Sergeant     of        the South Yorkshire Police,              stationed at

Woodseats, Sheffield.                   Part of my duties are the arranging of personnel

in relation to manpower requests by Hammerton Road,                                    'F' Division.        The

request is on a normal pro-forma and directed to me as the Divisional

Football         Liaison          Officer.           The    manpower      is    then    raised     from        the

©ivision          as       near    as    possible          equally     divided.          A   total        of     6

Inspectors/14              Sergeants          and    125    PC's     were      requested,     of    these        3

Inspectors/6               Sergeants      and        58    PC's    were     obtained      from     'E2'        Sub

Division.

At   8.45        a.m.      Saturday      15    April       1989,    I commenced duty at Woodseats

Police      Station          and    ensured         that   all     officers     attending    duty    at        the

football match between Nottingham Forest and Liverpool,                                      were on duty

and that sufficient transport had Been provided.

Together with other officers we attended at the Hillsborough Football

Ground and prepared for the briefing in the North Stand at 10.00 a.m.

that      day.         A   pre-printed         duty       sheet had previously been              issued    and

together with previous                  knowledge of the ground,                 I was fully prepared

for the Cup Semi-Final.                       The duties allocated were in Sub Sector 3,

Serial 7, Spion Kop Terraces with Inspector Calvert being in charge of

the Spion Kop.                Other officers              in the detail were PC 815 Moghul,                    PC

1103 Edwards,              PC 1782 Temple,            PC 264 Hirst, PC 2748 Abrahams, PC 734
                                                                                                      C "

Thornton,   PC     1183 West,      PC 2080 Nettleship,                PC 841 Gillott,     PC 2321

Williamson.       After the briefing a meal was handed to all officers, we

were instructed to be on our appointed duties by 11.30 a.m.

Serial 7 was delegated to the Spion Kop entrances to carry out sporadic

checks for weapons,         etc,    carried by fans.                 Inspector Calvert carried

out his own briefing on the kop and instructed that we would not carry

out the duties appointed but would remain on the kop near to a sterile

area kept for Liverpool supporters.                       This area was taped off by red and

white    banded    tape    together    with       a       serial     of   officers   dividing   the

Nottingham Forest supporters            from the            ’sterile area’.          (In this area

there are no escape gates or footpaths away from the area other than

the one leading onto it.            The area is surrounded by spiked fencing and

raised above ground level at one end).

As time passed the crowd began increasing and at 2.10 p.m. I saw four

youths making their way along the kop and selected a viewpoint in front

of the Liverpool supporters.            This was a deliberate, intended, selected

position by the youths.            They immediately began chanting and jeering at

the Liverpool supporters.             Police Sergeant Marples was with a further

unit of officers cordoning off the sterile area.                             I appraised him of

the situation in relation to the youths concerned.                             I returned to my

unit    and decided       to prevent    further            trouble    and a serious      situation

developing, that the youths would have to be spoken to and removed from

the ground.       All four were arrested for being drunk at a sporting event

and taken to the police room.

On writing out the report for the eventual attendance at Court, I heard

a message     from an officer over the personal radio requesting for the

gates to be opened at the Leppings Lane end.                         A Second request was made
                                                                                                                    3^
                                                  -    3   -




and the order was given to open the gates.                                 I did not hear any radio

messages       after that for some time, until I returned to the kop.                                          On

entering         the   kop    at     the rear     from         the   large central        stairway I saw

numerous men openly urinating against fences all along this footpath,

in full view of women and others attending the match.                                     The youths were

too     numerous       to    warrant      any    action         being     taken       against    them    and    a

stream of urine was constantly flowing along this gangway.                                       The stench

of urine and alcohol was ever present.                           The crowd had increased to such

an    extent        that     we    had    to    force our        way     along    the    footpath       to   our

allotted position where the Liverpool fans were segregated.                                       There was

a strong smell of alcohol on the kop terraces.

On reaching the area mentioned we were directed by Inspector Calvert to

attend at the opposite end of the kop and remain there.                                         I could see

that all was quiet and that we would have been more gainfully employed

in assisting him with the sterile area.                                On arriving at the allocated

area,       Chief      Inspector         Beal    instructed             that     we    return    to     assist

Inspector Calvert with the sterile area.

It    was   at      this     point    I saw that Liverpool                were    attacking the Notts

Forest end          and the ballhit the cross                    bar.     It appeared at this point

that there          was a crowd problem atthe                    Liverpool end and that officers

were seating people around the running track behind the Liverpool goal

and along the perimeter fence.                        It appeared on the face of it no more

than the crowd overflowing.

We returned to the location with Inspector Calvert and I saw that the

players had left the field and the game had been stopped.

Nottingham Forest fans were not aware that an area had been allocated

to the Liverpool fans, and a large number were attempting to make their

way   into     what     they       considered     ample         standing       room.      This    obviously
caused     great      confusion v and                certainly          annoyance       to    a    number     of

spectators.         We strengthened the cordon between the separate factions

of fans.

At this point it still appeared to be a crowd overflow problem with the

odd injury from what appeared to be overcrowding.                                  I was not aware that

anything drastic had taken place.                               Only when I saw the odd              stretcher

with     what   appeared            to        be   a body        being         carried on it         that    the

seriousness        began       to       unfold,      and then       onlyslowly          as   the        picture

developed.         The mood of the crowd                    on the kop was antagonistic                 towards

the     Liverpool     fans.             It appeared         that    they       too were unaware         of the

seriousness of the incident.

It was apparent that large numbers of Nottingham Forest supporters were

the worse for drink.                Small pockets of supporters were obviously out to

cause trouble,        together with a faction in the centre front of the kop

that was unruly.           The mood of the crowd altered every ten minutes or so

from one of sheer aggression at the game being stopped to one of pure

sympathy     for    the    injured             and   the    admiration          of those     attempting      to

render aid.         Many applauded                 the      actions ofthose attempting to assist

the injured/dying, etc.                  One       fan      Was seen torun fromthe Liverpool end

of the stadium and paraded in front of the spion kop gesticulating and

antagonising the crowd.                   (He was arrested).

Several injured and dead were brought to the kop end of the ground in

front of us.        At this point the realisation that a serious incident had

taken place was developing, I instigated the release of fans from the

sterile     area    through             the    Nottingham         supporters. ,         This       action    was

successful      due       to        a    majority          of     the     supporters         accepting       the

opportunity to leave as stated.                                          ' „

Superintendent        Greenwood was                seen to be walking around the perimeter

track    speaking     into          a    megaphone         and    informing       the   crowd      as   to   the
situation.         The message was not heard by the majority of the crowd but

was    passed around by word of mouth.                         A tannoy message was given out

over the public address system but no words were heard.                                    This was not

due    to    any     noise    being    created      by    the     crowd      because      they were     all

stunned by the events taking place before them.

When    the    kop began           to clear I arranged            for a cordon of officers to

sweep       across    the    kop     terraces      and    clear    the       remaining     people     away.

Together with officers from the unit we then went into Penistone Road

North       to render       any assistance         required.           The situation was in hand

although all roads were blocked with vehicles.

An instruction was then heard over personal radio that all officers not

engaged       in actual duties were to return to the North Stand.                                This we

did.    After a short de-brief I saw Inspector Sewell and volunteered the

services of the unit for any duty required.                                All weekly leave men were

ordered       back     to    their     Divisions         and    the    remainder,         together    with

myself,      remained on what could be described as security on the gates

for the temporary mortuary in the gymnasium.                               We remained on that duty

until       5*15   a.m.      the    following      morning.           We    were   supplemented       with

officers from another Division during that period.

A continuous stream of relatives, social workers, ambulances, etc, were

seen    into-and       out     of    the   area.         Each person was           escorted into       the

building by          an officer       from   the gate          security mentioned.            They were

then    handed       over     to    officers    working         within       the   gymnasium.         This

temporary      mortuary        was    eventually         closed       at    5*15   a.m.    and   we   were

released from duty.

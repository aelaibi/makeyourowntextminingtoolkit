HILLSBOROUGH STADIUM DISASTER INQUIRY


Lord Justice Taylor has now drafted about half of his Final
Report, and hopes to finish it within the next three weeks.  If
you and colleagues would find it helpful, I could bring you up to
date in the next day or so on where he has got to. I should
quite like the opportunity myself to sound you and others out on
one or two subjects before drafting is completed (I should prefer
a discussion confined to the four of us).

                                   Secretary to the Inquiry

We a r r i v e d    in S h e f f i e l d at about 2 p.m.              <1400 hours),           we    parked

a r o u n d the t u rn st il es      but    not    that    congested.              I h eard    people asking

other     fans      if they had spare             tickets       but    no-one a sk ed me at all.                       We

got    to the ent ra nc es and we split                   up, ____________ |had a ticket                        for    the

N o r t h S tand and        the    other    two    had tickets          for    the    terraces.              I joined

a queue      of aboutNs4-5 people at a tur ns ti le                       for t h e West S t a n d .              I had

the    stub of the ticket             ripped off at             the    t urnstile      by the           g a t e m a n and

went    into the ground.              «.s I cleared the               t urnstiles      I was s ea rc h e d             then

allowed      to continue.            The WBst S ta nd was well                 signed and           T    found the

bo tt om of the stairs              had seen my ticket and                 ripped a         portion from the

top right hand             corner    from    it.       I soon     found my seat.                   My seat was

Row        seat              This    is centrally          s it ua te d    right      behind the goal and

   rows back         from the       front    of the stand.              Once     I had found my seat                    I

s tr o ll e d down to the           front    of the stand and              looked over             into     the area

b ehind the         goals    to see    if    I could see my friends.                       I saw them below

me and we          had a chat       for about         15 minutes.          I could see that                  it was

packed b elow but            neither me       nor my friends              thought a ny th in g             of    it.        I

took my seat a g ai n at about 2.40                     p.m.     <1440 hours).             F ro m where           I sat

I could see the whole                of the       pitch and       the top        couple       of feet           of the

pe rimeter         fencing       behind the goals.              I could not          see   the      fans        in that

area.

All    s eemed       normal as the          players     came    out and e ve nt u a l l y kicked

off.         A fter a couple         of minutes        of the m a t c h kicking         off    I saw    people

climbing        over the          perimeter     fence and sitting            behind the goal.             I

d i d n ’t     take       too muc h notice         of this as        I thought    the Police w o ul d

move     these       fans    into another          area of the ground.            I was w at ch in g

the m at ch and the               play m oved down to the end             1 was at.           I saw a

Policeman           run onto the          pitch and speak to the             referee.         I also    saw

a couple        of fans          on the    pitch.      One    spoke    t'iKChris N I C H O L , one of the

players,        and       I saw him point          to behind the        goal IX. '

goal.         I saw him speakingVto a P o l i c e m a n               behind    the goal and shortly

a f t e rw a rd s    I lost       sight    of trim.     At    this

the stand and as                 I looked o v e r \ fans were holding their arms up and

pleading to be lifted out.                      I staXj^edj lifting          these fans o u t , along

wi th other          fans    in the       stand.      I could see       that    there were       lifeless

bodies        lying       on the    pitch    in the goal m ou th area and P o l i c e m e n and

fans were           seeing       to them.      iSwas,    by this time,          pulling m an y      fans      into

the stand and to steady myself                        I >*gdged my      left    foot amon gs t      the

metalwork           of the       front    row of stand s ^ a t s .       Once    the a rea      below me was

clearing        I was aware          of bodies        lying    on \fcve terracing        below me,

but    .1 c o u l d n ’t describe          anyone     I saw there.        I was       pulling    people out

for about           20 minu te s     in all.



I then went           back       to my seat and sat           there    for a few minutes,           trying         to

take     it all       in.        I h a d n ’t seen my friends         since     before    kick     off so      I

d eci de d     to go       down and       try and     find them.       I got     to the bottom of the

stairs at the              back    of the     stand and was refused exit               by a     Policeman.

I remained           in    the    stand    for anot he r ten m i n u t e s     then    left     an d w al k e d

               down    into the          pens    behind      the   goal.      I c o u l d n ’t see my friends          so    I

               went    to the gate w h i c h            leads      onto the    pitch and asked           the P o l i c e m a n

               there     if I could be a l l ow ed onto                the    pitch.       I was   refused entry so              I

               climbed onto the                pitch through a hole            in the      fencing   on the        left side

               of the      terracing.            I c o u l d n ’t see my friends           so I went      back    to the

               coach.       My friends were a l r e a d y there.                 I w o u l d say that        I left      the

               g ro un d about          4.30    p.m.    <1630 hours).          On the day      I was aware          of a pain

               in my     left     foot,        the   foot    I had we dg ed          the    seat   but    it w a s n ’t too

               painful.         The      f ollowing day         I became      very   painful




              On refl ec ti on           I would       say that     the    problem w ou ld have          been    l es sened      if

              t hey had delayed kick                   off   for   13-30 m i n ut es and h a d n ’t set          up the

               panic     to get         into the ground.

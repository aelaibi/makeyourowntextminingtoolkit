THE FIRE BRIGADE.       THE POLICE OUTSIDE SEEMED VERY IGNORANT AS TO WHAT WAS

HAPPENING WITH THE CROWD,       THAT COULD HAVE BEEN CONTROLLED B E T T E R .           I

THINK OPENING THE GATE OUTSIDE WAS>R^GHT,             BUT    I DON'T THINK THEY REALISED

WHAT IT WAS LIKE OUTSIDE.         THERE SHOULD HAVE BEEN SIGNS OR PEOPLE,               TELLING

SUPPORTERS,   THAT THEY COULD GO TO THE SIDES, WHICH WERE ONLY HALF FULL.                       THE

SIGNS WOULD HELP WITH BETTER CONTROL OF THE CROWD.

IT SEEMED THAT THE POLICE, WHO WERE THE LOCAL POLICE WERE INSIDE THE GROUND

AND THE POLICE OUTSIDE,      HAD BEEN BROUGHT IN, BECAUSE ONE OF THEM TOLD ME.

! ® > N ‘T THINK THE TICKETS WERE ALLOCATED PROPERLY.                  I WOULD HAVE THOUGHT IT

WAS AN ADVANTAGE IF LORD JUSTICE TAYLOR HAD HAD SOMEONE LIKE MYSELF TO GO

AROUND WITH HIM TO SHOW HIM EXACTLY WHERE EVERYTHING WAS,                     IN ADDITION TO

THE CHIEF CONSTABLE (PETER WRIGHT)         WHO KNEW NOTHING ABOUT THE GROUND.

LAST YEARS GAME WAS CONGESTED AS WELL,          BUT    IT WAS HANDLED AND DIRECTED

FAR BETTER THAN THIS TINE.

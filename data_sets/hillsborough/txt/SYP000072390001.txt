              On Saturday,              15-4-89          <150489)       I travelled               to Hillsborough                to      see      the

              Liverpool           versus          Nottingham          Forest       gam e .        I am     not       a Liverpool

             Supporter            but    I did         travel     with       the    local         Supporters           Club      in a       coach

              organised           by    them.          I paid     twenty-five             pounds          which       included           the      cost

              of     the     entrance            fee   into     the    ground.



             We      stopped        on a n u m b e r       of    occasions          to    p i ck        people       up a n d    t h e n we

             stopped          at E x e t e r       Services.          From Exeter             we        then    travelled           to

             Sheffield            without          any    other       breaks       for    refreshments.


                                                                      ,o 4-T>o
             At     Sheffield           we       d r o p p e d L___________         Dff      at    the     ground        to     get      s om e

              tickets.            The    Police          moved    the    coach        on w h i l s t       we    were     waiting           for

When        we    did       find       him       he    told        us    that          the    majority            of     the       tickets       were

still        on    the       coach and                we    ha d    to       go    back       to    the       coach w h i c h            then

( 14 50 ).         There          wa s      a mass          of     people          at    the       entrance             to    th e    ground         and

we    found        ourselves                in    this       cru s h.             We    being                                and     myself.

There        was       no    orderly             queues.            There          was       a Mounted Police                      Officer       there

and    his        horse          stood       on       the    heel        of m y         trainers.                 The        c r o w d wa s     so

great        that       there          wasn't          a    lot     that          could       be     done        to     ease       the

situation.                  It    seemed          as       though        the       Pans       at     the      back       were        pushing         on

purpose,           as       if    it wa s         part       of     the       fu n      of    the       game.




J    ca n    remember             seeing          two       youths           go     over      the       g at e    and        into     the

■gr'o^nd.          There          were       probably a                 lot       m o re .        I'rn s u r e        I sa w       the P o l i c e

helping           them       over.           The       c r us'ta^at the                gates       got      quite        ba d a n d       lasted

impression              that          they       then       tried        to a g a i n         close         the       gate     which        would

have        separated             us.        However             with        the       number        of     people           there,       there       wa s

no    chance           of    the^ate              being          c lo s ed .           I seem       to      remember            it    being      both

a Steward              and a Police                   Officer           that       opened          t'Tre.., g a t e .

We    went        along          a tunnel             with       other        people          around          us.        As we        got     to,     or

at    the        terrace          there          was       some     congestion.

                 barrier           and            *?as to m y                left.            This       was       about       two m i n u t e s       before          the

                 start        of    play.         We          began       to      get      crushed            from       behind and             the    pressure

                 agreed        to    tr y a n d         get         o i K but        there          w as      nothing          we 'tspuld do.               Then       the

                 The     force       of    the       crowd            wa s     gradually                separating             us a n d        I was       trying          to

                 Eventually              I had       to         let    go      of               and      by th i s         time      we w e r e       getting

                 near     the       bottom,          although                we     actually             wanted          to    get    out       backwards.                 We

                 were     then       pushed          down a few                      more          steps         and     we c o u l d n ’t go a n y

                 further.            This       put me a b o u t                     6'     -      10'^£<om            the fence.           All       this time            I

             On Saturday             the    15 A p r i l      1 98 9   < 1 504 89 )     I drove            the    fo^ball         supporters

             We    left       Liverpool          at    app ro xi ametly         11 a m       ( 1 IQOj/'that m o r n i n g          with      f ou r

             that      m o rn ing .

            On     the    return          journey       there      were     eight       coaches            the    f ou r    coaches       from

             each       train       had    been       joined     together.

            Whilst        we       were    waiting       at    Sheffield          I wa s       informed           by the      guard       t h at

             the       back    four       coaches       were     locked      he    had       spoken         to a     policeman          on   the

             platform          of     the      Station         about         opening          the     last     four      co a c h e s .        The

             policeman           told       the    guard          t hat      he    hadn't          enough      policeman          to a c c o m p a n y

             the    f ans.          The     guard        said       t ha t    after        what       had    h a p p e n e d at     the        ground

             there       were       unlikely            to   be a n y        problems           on    the    train and          there          were

             fans    standing             up    in the         train.

             For    the       journey          b a ck    the      four       coaches          at     the    rear      remained         l oc k e d .     I

             do    not    k now who's             decision           it was            to k e e p     the    coaches        locked         but       many

             fans    remained             standing            for    the w h o l e         journey          which      t ook a p p r o x i m a t e l y

             two    and       a h alf       h ou r s .       We     were      late        starting          b a ck    by a l m o s t      an    hour

             leaving          S h e f f i e l d at       about       6.30         pm    (1800).

             I do    not       know       the     name       of     the      guard        but      I would       imagine        his       details

             could       be    obtained           from Liverpool,                      Lime     Street       R ai l    Station.

             The    reason          I phoned            is    that     I thought              g i v e n all      the     circumstances

             there       was     no    need       for        them     to s t a n d w h e n           there     were      vacant        coaches.

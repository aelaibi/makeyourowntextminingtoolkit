                C h a l l e n g e Cup Semi Final.               I went        to the m a t c h with three friends

                few traffic              jams on rout^e delay i n g us for a total                 of about        one h o u r .

                We also mi s s e d a turn             Vff      and that delayed us about a further                       half an

                hour.      We event u a l l y a r r i v e d        in S h e f f i e l d at 2pm    (1400)     parked the           car

in the area of Wads 1ey Lane and then went                      for a pint of beer             in a pub

nearby,        after w h i c h we wa l k e d to the ground.             Apart   from seeing

su pporters          drinking    in the    pub I did not see any           consumption of

alcohol.

O n route       to the ground         I saw no police direc t i o n s or escort.                   It

w a s n ’t n e c essary an y w a y due to the fact that                     and             had been

before.         I a r r i v e d at the Leppings Lane          entrance at 2 . 4 0       (1440).             It

was    total        chaos outside       the turnstiles.        There were       n o ^ u e u e s , just a

mass    of supporters wait i n g           to enter the ground.            My/ t i c k e t w h i c h    I

bought at Anfi e l d was           for the L e p p i n g s   lane Stai>dfing and        I had

difficulty           in seeing    the    correct    entry t u r nstile due to the             crowds.

         and             went    to the    tur

        and myself        joined the       crowds
                                           cro    at the terrace           turnstile.          I

e v e n t u a l l y entered t h r o u g h the turnstile at a p p r o x i m a t e l y 2 . 5 0 to 2.55

<1450 -        1455).      I handed my ticket         in to the t u r nstile operator.

Prior    to going        through the turnstile a policeman tried to                         pull me

                                                                                                            rd



to the        right of the t u r n s t i l e s        decided not        to join them a nd

d eci d e d    instead to go thro u g h the turnstile.

As    I entered the ground there was a mass                    of people moving quite

quickly.            At this   point     I d o n ’t remember what        happened.       4    presume

that    I must have been            catxght in the     crowd of        people and taken w ith

them t h r o u g h the t u n n e ^ and       into the standing          pens on the terrace.                     3

next    remember being at the back of                 pen      uir.     I was   looking at the

pitch and was           s l i g h t l y to the   left of the goal.         I think my location

in the        pen    (after   facing shown page 5 of the S upporters Questio n n a i r e )

w o u l d b e grid J 1./ I saw the players on the                     pitch but    I don't know              if

they had kicked off.               The    pressure from the           crowds around me was              very

bad but        I could still        breath normally.          I realised that          I was

                                                                                                             S1793

sep a r a t e d from             at this       point.     The    crowd    crush started to

intensify and           I next     felt myself         being    carried forward and to the                         left

across     the      pen.      I was    tripping      up and as the        crowd picked up I lifted

my feet       up.      The movement          then saopped and my position                   in the       pen

was    in the       cent re at LA or ty*.             I started to have diff i c u l t y                in
                                      ---
br e athin g     due    to the    pressure of           the    crowds.     I was      conscious at

this time but           cannot     remember the events ar o u n d              me.     The only

thought       going through my min d was to keep breathing.                                I took       shallow

b reaths      due to the         pressure      on my    chest.     I was       in this       position for

a bout 5 or 6 minutes.                 The    pressure    reduced     slightly whe n              I saw a

m a n fall     in front        of me.        I can only describe him as aged about 50

wit h grey hair.           People      tried to         push away from him            but    it was

impossible.             My feet were under              him and    I felt myself            falling

forward.         Someone grab b e d me from behind to help me keep my balance.

At this       point     the    crowd    pressure       started easing          off.        This must             have

been due to people               leaving the         pen by getting       onto       the    pitch or being

pulled up into the stand above.                        There was then a ldt space                   to move,            I

could see the same man that                    had    collapsed    in front of me on the floor.

He was     lying across           the steps.         There were     people trying             to sit him

up.     His    eyes were open and the                 colour of his face was grey.                       I bent

down and a t t e m p t e d to revive him by striking                     the    chest.        Wit h other

people we        lifted him up and             passed him through the front                   of the fence

w h i c h had been pulled open.

I was    in a daze and state                 of shock.        I w a l k e d back through the tunnel

but was       told to go back by the                 police and stewards.              I returned                to the

pen.     I saw a lot of            people on the         pitch an d bodies hand out.                         I

r emained      in the pen until a loud speaker a n n o u n c e m e n t                     that    the game

was    postponed and for              people to       leave the ground.              I left       the    pen by

going back through the tunnel and out of the ground                                   into L e p p i n g s

Lane.      I was       still     in a daze but         remember walk i n g       up the       lane wit h

other     people.       I then thought,         'Where am     I going*,       and went    back

                                          saw              running    towards me.        We then

w a i t e d a short while      before              and             joined us.

O n route    back to the       car we tried to telephone                home without      success.

We got to the       car and drove back to L i verpool                 stopping at a m o t o r w a y

service are a to phone.

We a r r i v e d back    in L i verpool   at about 9 .30           (21.30).    On the    route home

my foot     started to ache.         I knew something              was wrong wit h it,     by    the

time     I got home      I could hardly walk             or put    pressure on my    foot.       I

went     to bed that      night and when         I awoke     on Sunday




After     the match had stopped           I feel     that    the    police and amb u l a n c e w e re



standing around when they should have been/fielping in the same wa y the

fans were.

I think the a l l o c a t i o n of standing          tickets       for the Liverpool

s u pporters   should have        been the S p i o n Hop.

T here    should also      have   been more       control     of the     crowds   by the     police

outside     the ground.                         < sgd>

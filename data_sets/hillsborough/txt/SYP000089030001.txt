 people over the fence and then thought                           that maybe             there   had been some

 crowd trouble.             I jumped onto the              pitch wit h PC M AR SH AL L and                 ran

 towards        the Leppi ng s Ln end.             I could see two or three Liverpool

 a ge d about         14 years stagger         onto    the     pitch and              into the   penalty area.

 at this        time    I was    not aware what was             h ap pening           on the terraces.                The

stood up and turned ar ou nd and a man aged about 35 years and well

built w ith       long fair       hair     fell     into my arms,              he too was         soaking wet

w it h sweat and gasping              for breath.            Again      I a sked him            if he was

jelly arid he was having                d i ff ic ul ty standing              up.    As    I spoke     to

him    I could smell       intoxicants            on his b r e a t h .             I asked him      if he had

been drinking,         he said he had had a couple                           but w a s n ’t drunk and that

it was    hell      in there.         1 laid him on the                pitch        in the      recovery

position and told another St Johns A m b u l a n c e m a n to                             look after        him.           I

then made my way to the                 perimeter         fence      d ir ectly behind the goal and

lying    on his back,           his   complexion was a y el l o w l y grey and his eyes

were    half     closed and his          tongue       could be seen bulging forw ar d                       in his

mouth.      He had u ri nated           in his trousers and was                     not moving.            He    looked

dead.     There was a person knelt                    next to him hitting                  him on    wje        chest

about 50 years and he had gold                      pips     on his shoulder.                   I said to him,

I made rny way back to the fence and                       could see other         police

               coming           onto the terrace and          I was    stuck    up against    the    pile of bodies

               unable to move             or help.         I turned and saw a Police Sergeant               in a

               f l o ur es ce nt anorak at one of the gates and with his help                           I climbed

               back   oulfNnito the pitch and could see numerous bodies lying on the

               over       iNj   assist   her a nd tilted the m a n ’s head back and gave a couple                                  of

               breaths           iHlo his mouth.           I was   then given an oxygen mask w hich was

               placed over           his m outh and         nose.      I held    it in this position and kept

               his head back to keep his                    air    passage open.         There were three

               civilians           standing     next    to us who \i dent i f i ed themselves as          doctors and

               I asked them to tell me                  if this man w^s alive,             The doctor     felt the

               m a n ’s groin and said there was a pul seh-N^nd that he was                          breathing.                I
                                                                                     AW£<Cn<Si^<Sr-        H   o a       ££>//VCJ>
               then saw some youths with a section o f a d v e r ti si ng hoarding a nd a sked

               them to help us w h ic h they did.                     We    put this man on the board           in the

               recovery           position and then          ran the full       length of the       pitch w ith h i its

               to where           t h e gyrfrn^sium is      as that was where         the ambulances are.

               Whilst           running one of the          doctors with us held the m a n ’s Dead back                        and

               kept       the oxygen mask on and stopped him falling                       off the    board.

               Once       behind the N orth stand we                placed him down and m o n i to re d him until

               an a m b u l a n c e m a n arri ve d and       put a plastic ai rway down the m a n ’s throat

               to assist        in carrying       bodies       i n t t\>^ym na s i urn w hich had been set                     up as

               a tem po r a ry mortuary.              After    carrying     several          bodies    in I was

               direc te d away from this area and back                      onto       the    pitch.     1 went          back

               onto    the     pitch saw that a          line of     police          had formed across             the       pitch.

               I saw another member              of my serial        so    I went       to join him.           By this

               time    nearly all        the    bodies    had been moved from the Leppings                          Ln end.

               I could see           that a lt h o u g h nearly all        the       injured and dead had been

               m ov ed there were still               numerous    people at the Lappings Ln end and also

               all    over     the    pitch.     I saw a group of Liverpool                    fans arguing w ith one

               saying,       "ye d o n ’t learn do we           i t ’s just      like H e y s e l . ’1   The       others were

               d i s ag re eing with him saying               “ I t ’s not our fault           this    time    it"s those

               murdering        bastards."        This    I took to mean the                 police and       I had seen

               L iv er po ol    fans shouting m ur derers            into the          face of    police       officers

               whilst we were on the terrace.                     On the      pitch       I would say that man y of

               the Liverpool           fans    just wanted to help and work alongside                          the       police

               but many others           just wa nt ed        to vent     their anger          on us.        One    thing          I

               found annoying and very saddening were                         the      press    photographers                who

               were    taking        photographs       of dead and        injured       people and w ould do

               nothing       to help w hen there were             people      lying aro un d who             could have

               needed a ssis ta nc e          to save    their    lives.         I saw the       police       p ho to grapher

               who    I only know as           ’S p i k e ’ bettjg escorted           out of the       crowd at the

               L ep pings Ln end by the               police and                 a SWFC steward trying                   to    punch

               him.        I kept hearing messa ge s coming o^er the                         tannoy but       they were

               totally unreadable.               As    I had been s eparated from my serial an d not

               having a radio           I found       it was a 'b^se of just acting                   on your       own

            make    sure     they made       their way towards            the C i t y Centre.      After    the

            majority        of N o t t i n g h a m Forest    fans   had    left the ground and gone            on

             their way       I made my way back             to where my serial         had origi na ll y      been

             deplo ye d at the        corner of the WelN^ and S o ut h Stands.                  I met     there

             several       firemen and POL P S 1 0 8 4 H O D GE TT and several PCs                from

             the ground.              As far as       remember       this     c asually was        the first           person

             placed        in the        rear    of the ambulance.             A number of other               casualties

             were    then placed             into the same ambulance.

             Someone,           I d o n ’t know who,           instructed that the dead                  people be removed

            casualty that       1 had     placed^^h the am b u l a n c e was   r e m o v e d but   I don't

            had no further        dealings wit h him.

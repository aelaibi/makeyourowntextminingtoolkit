                15th April            1989.

                On S a t u r d a y     15th April              1989    I went       to the m at ch w ith a group of mates

                in a mini            bus w hi ch was           owned by a man who works at                                    I d o n ’t

                know his         name and          1    have     never       seen him before.                There were about             10

                of us,          The y are                                                            Liverpool,                     and

          who are        two brothers,             their   friend                                     who       live

3.n                                       who   lives                   and two other        lads but       I

d o n ’t know their               names,    I    have   just seen them from going to the match.

Those are             the    only ones          I can think     of at   the      moment.

We    left at about               10.30 am.        We did not      have any delays as such the

drivers         took    us over        the snake        pass.

We got      into S h e f f i e l d at a p p r o x i m a t e l y    1.30    pm,    the driver     d ropped us

off at a pub            i« a side          street about         10 minu te s     walk, awa y from the


3rc,und-                      \
Some    of the         lads w e n t \ g ) the       pub and      I w a lk e d with    some of the         lads to

near    the      railway station,               we w an te d to find some friends             and    someone

w a n t e d to        buy a L i ve rp oo l scarf or hat.

We w al k ed          back    to the       pub at about 2 pm. Whe n              I was walking a ro un d          I

saw a fair            number       of Police at the Road             junctions       but they did not

move me on or a ny th i ng .

Most    of the         people who          had trave 11ed down w ith me were                in the    stands.

I left      the       pub,    after       having    abouV^i- pints        of Bitter,     at about         twenty

to three         or    quarter       to    three.       I left\with                                 and

see    that      there was a           large group of fans mill in g               round outside

the gates.             There       were    no msde ri y queues,         there was      nothing,

           longer,          al m os t as       if someone     had    cut hiNs hair           under a pudding        bowl.

         Because        of this       I went    to the young           lad to      check his        pulse and

         respiration,           X found a slight             pulse     in the      neck,       then I checked that

         his airw a ys         were    free,     I felt      his    ribcage and arms and had a visual

         look at him to ensure                 that    there were          no breakages           in his    bones.        I

         tu r n e d him over and             put him       in the     r ec overy       position.

         I took my c ar di ga n off and                put       it over his       back and        chest.

         head and e n su re d that             he    did not swal lo w his              tongue.

         I stayed w i t h this           lad about          10    minutes, we           were   trying to get      a

         Do ct o r   or a m b u l a nc e ma n across             but we    could        not attract their

         atten ti on ,       they were        busy with other arrivals.

         I lost      the     pulse     on the       lad and       1 s ta rt ed    to    panic,     I thought     it was

         me who had just              lost   the     pulse,       1 remember       some      one with a unif or m on

         he then said           r e sc u ci ta te    him.        I.could   not     recognise this          man again.

FA/HILLSBOROUGH
Adrian Titcombe phoned. I had read his letter and the draft
that was sent to him. He said that the only major          in
direction was he was a little unhappy to refer to bits and
pieces from Popplewell. Rather he would supersede and put
Taylor's report in full. He did not think very much of
Popplewell's report and he had managed to convince Kelly and
Kirton that no reference to popplewell should be made.
I said my only concern with that approach was that there may
be some residual parts of Popplewell that were relevant
which were not covered by the new letter. I would g
through it and get back to him. He was anxious to get this
document out as quickly as possible. He as away for a few
days but wanted to get it out by Friday.
FIFA had apparently made some â€˜stupid comments as to the
proposals for crowd safety this season. They had
recommended strange things like two cordons and f^eryciub
being told to say that no fireworks ought to be brought into
crrounds. The FA could not always go along with what FIFA
recommended. However they would try and get FIFA s sanction
for the new letter.
He would send me the revised document with all the
attachments and I would phone him on Friday morning.

 NO

 G53

 DO YOU HAVE ANY VIEWS OR OBSERVATIONS ON THE WAY THE INCIDENT WAS HANDLED,

 AFTER THE MATCH WAS STOPPED?

 ON TRYING TO RE-ENTER TUNNEL, POLICE OFFICERS WERE PREVENTING ANYONE RE­

 ENTERING I FELT THAT THESE OFFICERS (4/5) AND STEWARDS COULD/OF BEING

 RENDERING ASSISTANCE TO SUPPORTERS.

 G54


 *     THERE ANYTHING THAT YOU WISH TO ADD WHICH YOU FEEL IS VITAL TO THIS

             INQUIRY?

 LAST YEAR ’S SEMI-FINAL THERE WERE POLICE PREVENTING ACCESS BY THE TUNNEL

 TO THE TERRACES IN WEST STAND OBVIOUSLY BECAUSE THEY $ERE FULL.      THIS YEARl

 THERE WAS NO CONTROL OVER SUPPORTERS ENTERING TUNNEL.     I FEEL THAT THIS WAS

 WHAT LED TO THE DISASTER NOT THE INITIAL OPENING OF THE GATES.

 THE GROUND.    ALSO A LACK OF COMMUNICATION BETWEEN THE POLICE INSIDE AND

 OUTSIDE THE GROUND.

 TO REVIVE BUT IT APPEARED THAT THEY WERE ALREADY DEAD.       BELIEVED THESE
 PERSONS HAD BEEN CARRIED OVER ON HOARDINGS.       1' WAS ALLOWED^J*^WALK STRAIGHT ON

 TO THE PITCH.


Q 17

 Q49.     DID YOU WITNESS ANYTHING THAT YOU CONSIDER WAS A FACTOR IN THE DEATHS,

 OR THE INJURIES TO ANY PERSON?

 THE QUEUES AT THE TURNSTILES HAD GENERATED INTO A MASS CROWD OUTSIDE,         I

 BELIEVE DIDN ’T HELP THE MATTER.
                                                                              PAGE

 G50.*    WHAT TIME DID YOU LEAVE THE FOOTBALL GROUND?

 5PM APPROX

 QS1.     DID YOU LEAVE ON THE DIRECTION OF EITHER A POLICE OFFICER, A STEWARD, A

 LOUD SPEAKER ANNOUNCEMENT OR OF YOUR OWN ACCORD?

 HEARD ON LOUDSPEAKER MATCH WAS ABANDONED AND LEFT THEN ON OWN ACCORD.


G18

 G52.     DID YOU WITNESS ANYTHING THAT YOU CONSIDER TO BE A CRIMINAL OFFENCE?

 NO

 G53.     DO YOU HAVE ANY VIEWS OR OBSERVATIONS ON THE WAY THE INCIDENT WAS

 HANDLED, AFTER THE MATCH WAS STOPPED?

         MY VIEW POINT I COULDN’T SEE TOO MUCH, BUT I DID SEE POLICE DOGS AND

OFFICERS POURING ONTO THE PITCH AND THREW A CORDON ACROSS THE GROUND,     IT

 APPEARED TO VERY CONFUSED.     THE OFFICERS IN THE CORDON WERE STANDING THEIR

 GROUND AND WERE LETTING FANS THROUGH WHO WERE CARRYING DEAD/INJURED PEOPLE ON

 HOARDINGS.

QS4.      IS THERE ANYTHING THAT YOU/WISH TO ADD WHICH YOU FEEL IS VITAL TO THIS

JUDICIAL INQUIRY?

 I WENT TO LAST
           •g*  YEAR’S SEMI-F/INAL
                         - /       AT HILLSBOROUGH AND I BELIEVE THE SAME COULD

HAVE HAPPENED LAST Y E ^ R ^ H E POLICING IN AND OUTSIDE THE GROUND APPEARED VERY

 ^j,     ALTHOUGH WHEN THE FANS SPILT ONTO THE PITCH THEY APPEARED FROM NOWHERE.

ALSO A LACK OF COMMUNICATIONS THERE WERE OFFICERS STANDING AROUND, NOT

 HELPING.     ALSO I THOUGHT THE ST. JOHNS AMBULANCE PEOPLE WERE VERY YOUNG TO

 COPE WITH THAT SORT OF SITUATION THAT OCCURRED AT THE GROUND.

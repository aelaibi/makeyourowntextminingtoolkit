             On Saturday 15 A p r i 1 1989,    I came on duty at 9am at W o m b w e l 1 Police

             Station to travel to Sheffield Wednesday ground at H il l s b o r o u g h .


‘f i s t     Along with B2 officers travel led to Hillsborough in the B2 transit

             for the briefing at the ground at 10am.



             At 10am the briefing was commenced in the North Stand after whi eti a

             second briefing took place on Leppings Lane terraces by In§pe£t>or'

             White, with regards B1 and B2 serials working with the T^jrnptiles

             11 - 16 next to Gate       ’B ’ » Inspector White ir m t i o n e d that it he had

             two more serials he would have used them to pack people              In the

             terraces when it started to get full.



             Under   the supervision of PS 1757 Burns our serial took up position

             along turnstiles 11 to 16 at about 11am.            I was alongside Gate       ’B ’ at

             Turnstile 15 and 16 with PC 1543 A i t k i n .
                                                                                   PAGE
                                                                                   R2G

At 12 the turnstiles were opened and persons started to enter mainly

families,    carried out duties of searching them for cans of pop or

beer,   as a lot were carrying their packed meal        ie s a n d w i c h e s .



At lpm the flow through the turnstiles was still quiet,                no smell of

drink on the fans at this s t a g e .



About 1.45pm to 2pm spectators          increased outside turnstiles with a

greater flow through of p e o p l e .



Some time after 2pm I was aware that there was a mass of people

outside the turnstiles,     and through a glass-perspex viewing window in

Gate    ’B ' I saw people packed and crushed on to the outer side of Gate

'B' .



Also people began to get pushed through turnstiles             15 and 16 by the

mass behind them and people were getting their legs and lower                      tomach

area crushed against the bars of the tu rn s ti le s.



Some time later youths started to climb on top of the wall and roof

area of Turnstiles 15 and 16 and to my right the same over Turnstiles

13 and 14.    They were told to get down but would not due to the crush

outside the g r o u n d , and showed tickets to prove they had them.                 At

one stage I saw the coping stone off the wall          top become loose.              I

shouted to two fans to pass it down to me as I was fearful                  it might

fall on to myself or fans outside,          they did so and it was laid down

alongside the wall next to Gate          ’B'.



Eventually a Pol ice Inspector cl imbed on to the inner roof of our

tunrstile,    fans were helped down into the ground that way.                 From
                                                                                 PAGE      3

                                                                                           i
outside Gate       ‘B ' fans I heard shouting and screaming from the fans to               j
                                                                                           I
the effect "Some fuckers going to get k i 1 led” .           I noted      that     there   j

was a strong smell of alcohol from outside of Gate               ’B ’ .   The      gate wa

moving in its tracks         (it is a sliding concertina g a t e ),       due      to

pressure on it.         There were people still getting pushed            into     the

turnstiles and hurting their b o d i e s .      Looking through Turnstile 16

there were fans climbing on the steel wall            to the left side of No 16,

I could see a mounted officer          (with a white shirt not an Inspe ct or)              i

trying to get to the front of No 15 and 16 with great d i f f i c u l t y .



I was wary of Gate         'B ’ collapsing inwards so I kept to the side of it

next to turnstile 16.          PC Aitkin suddenly said to me "Watch out there

opening the g a t e ” which I had my back t o , I turned round and saw a PC

not from our serial open Gate          ’B ' with a yellow coated s t e w a r d .   I

did not know the P C .



A rush of fans came through the gate into the turnstile a r e a , some 5

to 6 hundred r o u g h t l y , I then saw fans throwing ful 1 tickets up to

fans on the roof and over the fence to those o u t s i d e .           There was a lot

of commotion in the general a r e a , inside the turnstiles and still a

lot of shoving still         in the turnstile crowd trying to push people

through.



A matter of minutes         later there was a loud banging on Gate          'B’ from

o u t s i d e , (I had closed the gate after    it went quiet after the fans

came th r o u g h ) .   On looking through the window in the gate I saw a                   j

group of Police Officers wanting to get in.              I opened the gate and

about 15 to 20 P C ’s rushed in saying they were wanted on the track                        ;

(pitch perimeter).          I closed the gate and carried on with turnstile                |

Eventually,     the terrace cleared a lot and through a space                 in the

crowd I could see a pile - mass of bodies at the bottom of Terrace

(no 3) to the right of c e n t r e , some 5 to 6 deep below the broken

rail.     I continued assisting to get people out through torn fence on

to pitch a r e a , male and f e m a l e s , some d e a d , some u n c o ns ci ou s.



Eventually the area c l e a r e d , went on to pitch a r e a , during 1 ifting

bodies I was verbally abused but not a t t a c k e d .           Fans   in seated area

above were direct ing verbal abuse at Police in terrace area.

 ^       7pm that day.



        When I entered the tunnel there was no crushing in the tunnel,              those

         being carried out had been passed over fence from the front of

         Terrace no 3.    I did not see Terrace no 4 until after it had cleared

         but something must have taken place in that terrace due to a lot of

         clothing,   shoes and property left trampled on in there.         After I had

        met up with my serial when the ground was cleared I noted at the

         turnstile area empty beer cans K E S T R E L , empty bottles of   ’P I L S '

         strong lager in and around turnstiles.

               I was on duty as           part of serial          14 under      the dir ec ti on of PS

              Crawford.        We   commenced duty at B a r n sl e y at 9. OOarri and                t r avelled to

               the ground for a briefing at                   10.00am,       Our    role was to      police      the

               turnstiles at the L e ppin gs Lane end of the ground an d the serial                                    was

               d e p loyed at turns t i le s A to G,             the^jUir nst i 1 es nearest        the    river.

              We were     in position from about                 10.4 5 a m , some turnstiles a l t h o u g h not

               all were open from about                  11.00am,    and fans       started a rr iv in g     in dribs

               and drabs       from that         time.     There was another serial               outside    the

               g round searching          fans     before     they   reached the turnstiles and we were

               searching them as they               came through the turnstiles.                   The    Inspector         in

               charge of our area,               Inspector White,         d ir ected us to search them a gain

               even    if we    could see         that they had been s ea rched outside,                  some     of the

               fans were       searched     two or three          times at the early             part of the day.

               I had been on duty           last y e a r , 9th April           1988,    on the L e p p i n g s Lane

               turnstiles when the               same two teams met at             the same      ground    ijr^the FA

               Cup Semi     Final     and knew that           things would get more              hectic as the kick

               off approached.            I knew that as the day wore on we should have                            to be

               more    selective      in whom we searched.                However      last year     the Liverpool

               fans who were        in that        part of the ground a rr iv ed more               spaced out         in
                                                                                                        PAGE
                                                                                                        R243

the hours         leading        up to the m at ch a nd we had no problems                    of the       crush

o utside      the       gates.     1 do not think           that more       came this year        but      that

they came         in a shorter           space of time,           due    to different     travel

a rr a n g e m e nt s    perhaps.

The    fans were          very good natured             in the whole and there was much good

h u m oured banter about                the searching        etc.        In this early       phase non© of

the    fans     could be d escribed as drunk.                      The    day was    bright and

pleasant and the duty was quite                         enjoyable.

The    influx       of fans       remained fairly steady until about 2.30pm.                            I had

been busy searching a steady stream of fans who were                                   now a rr iv in g and

had had       little       time    to look through           the turnstiles          to see what was

h appening        outside.         The fans had o b vi ou sl y been queueing                 for a while

but    now the moo d of them changed dramatically.                             Some    had    clearly

a r r i v e d without       tickets and had tried various                    ruses with the

t urnstile        operators.            Some    tried    protesting        that the man who          had

entered before             them had given the operator                    two tickets     one of which

had been for             them and others          tried more        s tr ai g ht f or w ar d bribery.

The    operators were             offered ten pound notes                 to admit    fans an d      I dealt

wit h four or five who                  had tried this an d             the operator     had been honest

e nough to alert            us to what had happened.                     It was by this time          too

crowded outside             the    turnstiles         for   persons without          tickets    to    reverse

and so they were a d m it t e d                into   the ground once one of us was                  present

a nd then ejected.                The    t empt at io n on the turnstile             operator must          have

been great          to accept at          least some        of this bribery and it may                be that

some were a d m i tt e d without                tickets     by this means.           We had a l re ad y

decided that             if it was       busy when we had to eject              persons      they would

not    be taken to the             police       room but ejected via the nearest gate.                         To

adhere to formal             procedures w ould have                greatly d ep leted the numbers

of police at the t urnstiles whilst                         two    escorted each ejectee             to the

far    corner       of the       ground along wit h the             possibility of the ejectee

being    freed from ones grasp en route.                      This has the u nf or tunate

effect    of    reducing       the   statistics a v ai la bl e        on such m ea su re s       but    is

the only way to act e xp ed it io us ly whe n                 things    are busy.        The

Inspector       was aware and        in approval       of     this.

At the m a t c h last year           some fans       rushed    the turnstiles a nd          came       over

the heads of their             fellow supporters and over the                  turnstile       since

there are       no bars above waist             height.       I did not see this ha pp en at

all   this year.        The     crush outside         probably    prevented them getting

e nough of a run at            the turnstiles         to do this.        The    s u p p o r t e r ’s mood

last year,       on the whole,         remained       pleasant    till     the end and did not

exhibit    the same       dramatic      change as this year.

It became obvious          to me some         time                     t-.that there was a great

c rush outside.         Our     searching       had drop pe d    to about one         in three and

we were    having       to become more selective.                The    police     outside,      when        I

could see them thro ug h the turnstiles,                      had a ba n do n ed any searching

and were       pressed up against          the turnstiles.             At times     I could see a

m o u n t e d officer    in a white       shirt      in the throng trying           to break up the

crowd.     I    did not       recognise     him as a S o u th Yorkshire m o un t ed and took

him to be       a foreign force         Inspector.

The mood of the          fans had      continued to deteriorate.                 They were        now

very aggressive,          no doubt      due     to having been pushed towards                  the

turnstiles       by the    force      of the     crowd.       Many fans we re demanding                that

we did something about               the s it uation outside and hurling a lot of

abuse at us as          they    came through.          Some    fans even got hold of some                    of

us and m a n ha n dl e d us as they made              their    point.      It almost       got    to the

point of scuffles          breaking       out    in our a re a with enraged fans                 blaming

us for the       crush.        People with young          children were         carrying       them on

their    shoulders       to avoid the         crush and several          children were           passed

through the turnstiles ahead of their                       fathers     in order      to a v o id

injury.        There was       then the a dd ed       problem of some families              being
                                                                                                          PAGE
                                                                                                          R243

split    up in the         crowd and getting              panicky.

The   t ^ u ^ n ^ ^ L e s ^ t h e m s e 1 ves are    rather a n t iq u at e d and are a rr an g ed          in

                               n parjyjy^on between the two turnstiles.                          This

partition has          large     blocks of wood on it in order                    to    prevent more

than one      person squeezing              through whe n the turnstile                 is in the open

position.        The     rotating       part of the          turnstile        only extends       from about

the height       of an adults           knees        to a few     inches      below his waist            thus

enabling      people      to    climb over           the top very easily.              In fact       on this

day a Police         officer         from outside         climbed over the turnstile where                          I

was   to escape        the     crush.

There    is a small          block of metal            f as tened to the outer           edge of the

rotating      part on m an y of the turnstiles.                        I cannot    say why this            is

there but       it is about           the size and shape              of a brake       block    from a pedal

cycle.      Several       times       I saw this getting              stuck    in the trouse rs           fly

opening     of fans who were              pressed by the           crowd up against            the

turnstile.         All    those       I saw stuck         in this manner were wear in g                  denim

jeans and were           in a turnstile which                rotated     clockwise w hen viewed

from above.            The     force of the           crowd from behind          prevented them

moving    backwards          the fraction of an              inch necessary to free              the

material      of their         trousers an d a l t h o u g h the         turnstile       operator

released the turnstile                 pedal        it w o ul d not    rotate due to being               he 1d on

the   p e r s o n ’s trousers.          The turnstile was thus blocked an d this

enraged the        people       trying      to get       in even more.         A couple        of times         I

was able      to force         the    person back enough to free his trousers                            but on

one occasion         it was      impossible and the man was stuck for                          several

minutes.        PC Grant,        from our serial,               offered to      cut the material

holding     this man wit h his              pocket       knife    in order to free him,              a

s ugge s t i o n that was        not well           received.

The   r a t ^ j T ^ ^ n ^ ^ T ^ ^ s m at times        be came                                            of the

the^fo^otj^dal ^ U ^ a J ^ o w          the turnstile        to rotate. ,

The    pair of turnstiles             next to the single one at the end neares                     the

river,     I believe         this    is E and F , was under         so muc h    pressure     that

several      times     the    central      partition was       pushed out of      line.      This had

the effect          of blocking       one or the other         of the t urnstiles and not

allowing      it to        rotate.      It was then n ec essary to go into the

t urnstile and force              the outer    end of the       partition back        into

alignment.           I did this a number            of times and        it required    considerable

force to move the stout                timbers,     an example      of the     immense    pressure

exerted by the             crowd w hi ch was     pushing      on the    partition     in a

h ap ha z a r d manner w hen         I was   pushing    on it directly and          in the

particular          d i re ct io n needed to     r eposition      it.

By this time we had been forced to a b an do n all                       searching and

concentrate          on keeping       the turnstiles working and eject                persons who

had entered w i th ou t           tickets.     They then started to            climb over the

wall    in which the          turnstiles are built and as they climbed down we

ejected them.

They were          no doubt       climbing either      to enter without a ticket             or    if

they had tickets             to escape the       crush outside.          The tempers      of the

fans    had d et er io r at e d further and           I am    certain from then on some             fans

came    in the worse          for drink.       These    escaped being a r r e s t e d since we

were more          concerned with the safety of the m aj or it y and keeping

things moving.              I was    not   in a position to        refer to my w a t ch and

became unaware             of the exact      time    but about     ten minutes      before    kick

off time      the gate        nearest      to the    river,    gate C , was     opened and fans

a l l o w e d to    pour    in.     This a p p e ar e d to have    been org an is ed from

outside,      whe n the gates opened             1 was a few feet away and             I saw the

Inspector who had been with the outside                        serials at the gate.           The

horses and officers               outside    had formed a cordon across             the   lane to

funnel     the fans         into the ground.

I was     caught    in a surge          of fans who       rushed through        pushing with no

concern for        safety as soon as the                gates were opened.            About a dozen

people were        pushed to the                     by impatient m ar auding           fans and

police and fans an d myself                  pulled these to their feet and tried to

slow down the sudden               influx.         I saw one or two fans,         who had,         like

us,    sensed the danger            of this headlong            charge,     hand out    some      summary

justice to their              fellow supporters          in a     creditable atte mp t           to stem

the t i d e .

As soon as        the    pressure eased on the              outside      the gates were again

closed and the fans              entered      in the    normal     manner.      The    crush

obv io us ly built           up a ga in because a few minutes               later the same gate

was    opened a ga in to         let    in another      batch of supporters.             These      came

in a little        better       ordered than the          first    rush but were        still

impatient        and a nn oy ed at having           had to wait.

In both the        influxes        of fans through the gates                there were     some who

w an te d to shelter away from the general                       rush.      They were    clearly

ter ri fi ed by what           they had a l r e a d y    ex pe ri en ce d   outside and what            they

were     seeing.

leads     into the       central       section of the terracing.               This    tunnel      is

m a r k e d with sector         letters      painted on the wall and there are other

ma rkings       d irecting      fans around either           end of the stand          into the other

a reas    of the terrace.              The   general     flow was     down this       tunnel      and    it

does     seem more       obvious and         logical     to head     in this    d i re ct io n    rather

than     round the       ends    of the stand.          However,      if the fans       had been         less

hasty and those wit h tickets                  had taken the time to            consult     the

ma rk in g s    on them and        followed the d irections              there w ould have         been a

better d i s t r i b ut i on of fans.

The    crowd was        so    large and      its    rush so mindless with the only

intention of getting               into the ground that there was no                   possibility of
                                                                                                  PAGE

a few stewards        or police        being able       to divert them to other areas                  of

the    ground.      Eve n    if the danger          had been    perceived       in advance at

ground     level    it w o ul d have been           impossible       to divert    this sudden

influx whatever         the manpower available.

I have seen more manpowe r              deployed       in that area          before,    but however

m any serials       there were        inside w ou ld     not have       prevented the         problems

outside w h i c h were        the    cause    of the gates          being opened.        If more

m an p o w e r was needed anywhere            it was    outside the t urnstiles              to break

up the body of the suppo rters                 into smaller more m an ag e ab l e            groups

w hilst    they wai t e d for the turnstiles.

Our    second     briefing     had taken place          on the terrace and we were aware

that     there were         railings    from the       front    of the stand down to the

perimeter       fence at the         rear of the       goal.        There was    only one transfer

gate     in each of         these    railings,       a narrow gate at the rear of the

terrace     in each         case.     PC W a sh i n g t o n and PC liaemanus were deputed              to

make     their way to these gates              in the    case of an e va cu at io n to try and

assist     people    thro u g h them.         Fro m the tone         of the    Inspector at the

briefing     he a p p r e ci a te d that      in the event          of this being       n ec essary    it

w ould be a very        "tall       order".

Although     I could see that           the m aj or i ty of fans were            making their way

into the     central        section and       I knew that       sideways m ov ement w ould            be

very slow due to t he small              transfer       gates       I never made       the   conne ct ion

b etween the two facts.               1 did not envisage             problems    on the scale that

were     to follow.

W here    I was    inside     the turnst i1es         I was    completely unaware            of the

start     of the match.         We were       fairly    confident that          the start w ould be

delayed     in order to allow the              latecoming       fans extra time to find

their way       into the ground.             This    I found out       later was not the          case.

1 heard two a n no u nc em en ts        on the g r o u n d ’s public address             system

whilst     I was    still    at the turnstiles.               The    first    I believe was asking

fans      coming    into the ground to slow down and not                   push,      the   second        I

h eard was asking Liverpool                 fans to    leave the     playing area.           I assu me d

that      there    had been a        pitch invasion from the         latter.

Suppo r t e rs     were   still a rr iving and making          there way       into the ground

whe n     I was    told that we were          needed on the      pitch.        Although      I did not

have a personal           radio      I assu me d that this message          had    come     to our

serial      sergeant who       did have       one and    then was     spread to us          all     by

w or d    of mouth.

As a serial         we made    our way a ro u nd the end of the stand and                    behind

the      police    control    room through a transfer            gate and down a passage                      in

the stand o c cupied by N o t ti n gh a m fans.             We turned       left down another

passage      in this      stand and made        our way out onto the            pitch.

O n arriving        onto the      pitch     I still    did not appre ci at e       that     there        had

been any play.            I was   under the      impre ss io n that      I was going         to stem a

pitch      invasion at the Leppings Lane                end and my att en ti on was            focussed

there,       I did not       see any      players     .leaving the    pitch.       There was a

growing      group of       people   behind the goal and we made               straight across

the      pitch towards       them.     As    1 ran over    to the     perimeter        fence the

'ans were         pouring    over the top and one of the gates                  into the       central

south section had been opened.

It was      immediately obvious             that this was     not a s t ra i g h t f o r w a r d    pitch

invasion      caused by ho ol ig an is m because           those     that were        on the       pitch

w ere     standing    in a group and not            runring across       the    pitch as w ou ld be

expected.

As soon as         I a rr i ve d at the fence         I could see the       real      reason for          the

fans      climbing    out.     The   fans at the front were            pushed up against                 the

railings w ith        incredible       force.       The stout mesh between the               posts was

bowed out behind the goal and the blue                     paint was being            rubbed off

onto      peoples*    clothing.        1 saw a few       people who were          being     held on

the fence with such force that                  the m esh was      leaving      its    pattern on
                                                                                               PAGE        9

their    faces.        I am of the opinion that               several were a l re ad y dead at

that    stage,    they had a characteristic, grey mottled a p p ea r an c e                   to

their    skin that       to me suggested more            than mere u nconsciousness.               I saw

a young    girl    u nc on scious with her head               pushed back at such an

unnatural    angle       that    I thought      it probable       that her neck was          broken.

M an y obviously were           u nc on scious and the whole mass of            people at the

front of the       terrace were          completely      immobile.        I had the sickening

realis at io n at that          point   that    people were dying me re ly           inches away

from me and the feeling             of o ve rw he l mi n g helplessnes whe n          1 realised

how    powerless       in real    terms we were         to quic kl y get to them or take the

pressure    off t h e m .

Pulling at       the    fences was      futile     since wit h the        immense    pressure

being a p pl ie d from the other            side they were         not about    to give way

wit h the meagre         force we       could muster.          For a few moments       I stood on

top of the       low wall       in front    of the      fence    of the    central    section and

shouted to the fans             to move    back.       I soon    realised that w ith the

noise that       they were       making    thems el ve s      shouting    in terror and some          in

a go ny any volume        1 could make was            lost.     We were    powerless    to

communicate with those at the                  back,    who    I think were    still    pushing

forward,    to make them move fast enough.                      The ones further       back did

not a pp re ci at e     the   problem in front          of them and did not          realise the

reason for       the    police action.

Whilst    I was doing         this I made       eye    contact with a man who was about a

third of the way back             up the terrace.             In front of him was a small

area where       the    pressure of people            seemed    slacker,    he was shouting         to

me that there was a man dead                in front       of him on the floor.          He was

o b vi ou sl y beside     himself and was tota ll y e x as pe ra te d with me for

being    unable to get up to him to help or to                     remove the       crowd.     I

w a n t ed to tell      him that    there more         people dead or dyi ng at the front

and that    X c o u l d n ’t free them but            there w a s n ’t the time.      X later
                                                                                                   PAGE

realised that he must have                   been near where          the   crush barrier      had

col lapsed.

Fro m shouting and signalling                  to move       back    I turned my efforts        to what

I hoped w ould y ie ld better                results.        I went    to the gate w hich was

open and tried to help get                   people    out.    There were a lr ea dy about           six

officers    there at this            gate,     one of w hich         1 r ecognised as Sergeant

Swift,   who were        pulling at          people    to get them through the g a t e .              Some

of these    people were a l re ad y u nc on sc io us and some were                     not but the

pressure    on this       narrow gate was             such that       it was    like a log jam.            So

many    people were       pressed       into the area aro un d the gate                that   it took

h er c ul e an efforts        to get just one out.                 One man we tried to        pull    out

was u nconcious and was w earing a ma ro on jumper.                            About   six men were

pulling on him to             pull him through the gate,                out of the mass        inside.

We must have       injured          people    in our haste          to get them out and        relieve

the    pressure    on the       rest.

Pr ogress at      that gate was so             painfully slow and there were many other

police ar ou nd     it so       I turned my a tt en t io n s          to a gate    into    the south

enclosure.        The    people       here had room to move around and                   I reasoned

that    if we    removed       plenty of people from here through the gate and

m o ve d the rest       over    to the edge then those from the                   central     south

section where all             the    casualties       lay,    could climb over         the dividing

fence and ease          the    pressure       in the    central       south area.       This had

a l re ad y started to happen n aturally and                       I tried to speed up this

process and once          the       crush s ub sided went           into the enclosure        to move

the    people about.

There was       every emotion          present    in those          people.     A lot of anger and

abuse was       d ir ected towards           us as we fought          to help their       fellow

supporters,       we were,          I suppose    the    nearest       target    for their

un de rs ta nd ab le anger.           M any were so shoc ke d as            to be almost      immobile

and some we re just            standi ng weeping.             As    the pressure       eas ed near me a

large    number of       people       climbed over      the dividing          fence,    where     I now

was,    and as they did we             could see more and more bodies                  lying on the

concrete where all             these    people    had been standing.

The mass    of bodies was             near    the front      fence and a pp ea re d       to be three

or four deep all          along      the front     of the      central       south section. , There

were more       bodies    further       back up the       terrace      but more     spaced       out and

not    in such great          concentration.

I was working with a number                   of fans and a few people             in this area

ferrying    the    injured from this section,                  lifting       them over     the

dividing    fence and          passing them one         by one to people           on the    pitch via

one of the gates.              The    injured seemed endless,            most were unconscious

the    others    had    injuries       to limbs and d if fi cu lt y breathing.               We

c on ce ntrated our       initial       efforts    on   removing       those wit h most          chance

of survival.           Those    obvi ously dead were           left    in situ until        later    to

hasten those alive             to ambu la nc es and       the doctors,         I hoped,     were    now

on hand.        I have    no possible way of            remembering          the desc ri pt io ns    of

any of those       I removed.

Du ri ng this     time    I was      totally     preocc up ie d with what          I was    doing,    I

have    no reco ll ec ti on of what was going                 on    in the    immediate     distance

from me or       indeed who          I was working      with.        I had felt so helpless

before and now          I was at       last    in a position to do something                positive,

I just had a feeling             that    it had been too           slow to save        so many.

There was       still    a lot of abuse and a g g re s si o n d ir ected towards                   us but

I totally d is r eg a rd e d this and            I am sure         I pushed aside,        rather

roughly,    anyone who          impeded me.

I stayed on the          terrace and          continued      removing    people.       Whe n the     live

had been    carried out we m oved the               dead and only whe n they were all

m ov ed out onto        the    pitch did I want         to    pause and       look around.         It was

then that       1 saw the       crush barrier       'that had given way bent               out of all

shape.     These       barriers a pp ea r ed so stout and solid                  it was    incredible

                                                                                                                        R243

                  that    the    pressure       of    people    had bent     it and forced            it over.     It was

                  then that        I made      the    connection between the man who had been shouting

                  to me at the          beginning and           the   collapse        of the   barrier.        1 feel

                  certain that          the deaths       he     had been trying          to tell me about          had been

                  caused by the           pressure      prior    to the    collapse.

                  I left the          terrace and went          onto the     pitch to see            if I could help

                  carry any        casualties         over to the ambulances.              I picked up an

                  a d ve rt is in g    hoarding       to use as a s tr etcher           but most       of the    people       had

                  a lr ea dy been moved.              I felt suddenly surplus             to    requirements.           All

                  the    casualties       had been m ov ed but we were                 now s ur ro un de d by a lot of

                  angry and a gg re ss iv e           fans.     I sensed that          if their anger and brief

                  tu rn ed towards        the Nott ing ham s upporters we w ould have some                        ser ious

                  problems       on our hands.

                  It was then that             I noticed that          police    had alre ad y set           up a cordon

                  across     the      pitch and since           there was       little    else for me to         do 1 went

                  an d joined that at             the end       where   it met        the stand      close to the

 Qx'fZ'3          directors        box.

                  I stayed there           in the      cordon w at ch in g      the    fans until       I noticed a

                  scuffle       breaking       out    nearer    the goal     line.       A photographer with dark

                  hair and beard wear in g a black                    leather    jacket was trying             to take

                  pictures.           It may    have been       insensitive       to do so but          he no doubt

^    ?I    }      thought       he had good          reasons.     I went with several                other    police    to his
          y ’:'
\y                aid as     I thought         that this might          be the spark of a major                problem that

                  w a nt e d nipping       in the      bud.     Two    police    escorted him from the             pitch or

                  at    least    behind the          cordon and the       rest of us stayed to try and

                  defuse     the      situation.

                  1 then saw the           rest of my serial            standing       in a group near          the goal

                  m outh and made my way over to them.                       We stood for some time               until       the

                  a nn ou nc e me nt    came    that    the m atch      had been abandoned.              As the fans

                  started       leaving     the      ground we went as a serial                out    into L ep p i n gs Lane
                                                                                                        PAGE      13
                                                                                                        R243

       and escorted the fans up towards                    their   transport.     The a g gr e s s i o n

       s eemed to be draining              out of them      leaving    those we were walk in g with

       very quiet and subdued.

       Outside      the Leppi ng s Lane          turnstiles    I noticed a g al va ni se d

       corrugated metal            partition between the t urnstiles              1 to    16 and A to

       G.     This was d i st or te d and showed m uch evidence                of the     pressure w hich

       must    have    been exer te d on it by the            crowd.

       We halted at the            roundabout at the         j un ction with Leppings         Lane and

       P e n i s t o n e Road    until    we   received a call       that there was       fighting         in

       the    park.     We made         our way back down Pen is to ne Road towards               the

       ground and shortly after a rr iv in g                there were     instructed to        sit     in the

       stand nearest            to the gym to await         further    deployment.       After we          had

       been a d d r e ss e d     I went with another         officer    to fetch some        "max     pax"

       drinks     for our        serial    since      none of us had eaten since about              10.30am

       and were at        least     in need' of a drink.

       We hung around drinking                 "max    pax" and talking.       There were       several

       officers young            in service      on our serial,       in particular       two young

       women,     one just        out of her       probation and       the other w ith about            one

       y e a r ’s experience.            They had only w or k ed       so far on town centre          foot       pat
ro 1

       and as far as            I know had not been to a serious              road accident.            They

       were    both very quiet and w it h dr a wn and              looked a s h e n .    I have more

       experience and            have    spent   the    last three years      in an area with m an y

       miles    of trunk         roads    notorious     for serious accidents.           1 have       been to

       many    fatals     but     there was      nothing    that   could have     prepared me for

       death and tragedy on such a scale.                     I knew how bad        I felt and thought

       they must       be feeling an awful              lot worse.

       Inspector Barker            came out of the gym which was being used as the

       m or t u a r y and took about           four of our    serial    to move    boards with

       e xc lusion orders          on before       relatives were allo we d       into     the g y m ,

       We thank fu ll y were            told that we      could stand down and went to try and
                                                                                               PAGE
                                                                                               R243

locate    our van w h ic h we had t ra velled               in but w hich was       being used for

other    things.        We were         unable    to find   it and walked up to C laywheels

Lane hoping         to arrange          some transport      from there.

At C l a y w h e e 1s lane we      spoke to some B ar ns l ey division m o to r cy cl is ts

who had been          involved     in amb ul an ce      escorts.     They   pointed us       in the

d i r ec t i o n of the mobile           canteen and a few of us were            hungry enough

to eat.        I went     looking for somewhere             to wash since       I had been in

contact with more             vomit,      spit,    blood and urine       than   I w a nt e d to think

about.        I fa il ed to find a free             sink and had to be          content with a

wipe    dawn before          having      something    to eat.

E v e n t u a l l y we were a l l o c a te d transport       back to B ar ns l ey and arri ve d

there at about 8 p m .            Once     there we made        it a priority to      check with

our    families       that    they had been         informed that we were all          safe    only

to find that they were                  completely     in the    dark.    My wife    had

r epeatedly         rung the     police station and the e me rgency number                  given out

on the t e le vi s io n without any success.

The whole       serial       then a dj o ur n ed to the      bar to take some        solace    in

alcohol       and    I must     thank S u p e r i nt e nd e nt Simp so n for     his offer    of

support and for           quietly        listening     to some    officers who were

e m o t i onally     drai n e d and      rapidly and d e te rm in ed ly getting       drunk.

In conclusion          1' must    say that        the fans a r ri ve d   in great    numbers       in a

short    space       of time,       I    did not see     such    pressure   on the    turnstiles

last year when the same m at ch was                    played and I was on the same duty.

However       if the     fans    had been better         behaved and e x er ci se d more

patience the ticket              holders would have all            got   in safely.        Eve n if

they    had m i s s ed some        of the start        of the game they should          resolve

that    next m atch and they should aim to be there                       in good time.        As     it

was    they    pushed wit h such force and without                  thinking      of their    fellow

men until       the gates        had to be opened to a void danger                outside.

Instead       of then being         satisfied that          they were    in the ground and
                                                                                                   PAGE   1
                                                                                                   R243

         finding a place         to stand,    they then d e mo ns tr at ed the      same mindless

         impatience without any thought             for    their   fellows and they      caused the

         deaths    of man y     people who    had planned a he ad and a rr i ve d      in good time.

         They may have been given            insufficient     tickets    but many had travelled

         without    tickets      hoping somehow to get        in and    if the     pushing    outside

         the turnstiles was a ploy to secure                their a d mi ss io n   it certainly

         worked.     There may be fewe r turnst i 1es at Hillsbo rough than othe r

         grounds    but   its    positio n hemmed    in by houses on one           side and a river

         on the other does         not help    in the     p rovision of more unless          the

         layout    of the ground      is re-arranged.

        I had been on duty                last      year,       9th     April      1988,    on      the       Leppings Lane

        approached.            I knew th at as the            day     wore      on   we   should          hav e to be mo re
        selective           in    whom      we searched. However               last year the L i v e r p o o l fans who
        w e r e in t h a t p a r t      of     the    ground         arrived       more   s p a c e d o u t in t h e h o u r s

        The fans were very good                  natured           in the       whole     and      there was m u c h good

        duty was quite enjoyable.

        of t h e m        changed       dramatically.           Some had         clearly arrived without tickets
        and had tried v a r i o u s           ruses        with      the     turnstile      operators.         Some tried
        p r o t e s t i n g that the ma n who had e n t e r e d b e f o r e them had given the o p e r a t o r
        two       tickets        one     of   which        had     been      for the m and       others      tried     more

At the m a t c h last         year      some        fans     rushed the t u r s t i l e s and came over               the

It b e c a m e o b v i o u s t o m e       some       time     past     2.30p.m.         that there was a great

T h e m o o d of t h e f a n s        had       continued         to      deteriorate.            They were now very

I have seen more manpower                   deployed         int h a t a r e a b e f o r e ,        but h ow ever many

Where I was inside the               turnstiles             I w a s c o m p l e t e l y u n a w a r e of t h r e s t a r t

ground. T h i s 1 f o u n d out later wa s not the case.

I h e a r d tw o a n n o u n c m e n t s on the g r o u n d ’s     public       address   system whilst 1
was still at the t u r n s t i l e s . The f i rst I b e l i e v e              was   asking  fans coming
into the g r o u n d to s l o w d o w n a n d n ot push, t he s e c o n d I             heard  was asking

S u p p o r t e r s w e r e still a r r i v i n g     and m a k i n g therewa y into the ground           when 1
was told that we we re                 needed           on the       pitch.      Although   1 did not have a

As a serial we m a d e our w a y a r o u n d            the end        of        the     s t a n d an d b e h i n d the

this s tand an d m a d e our wa y out o n t o the pitch.
On a r r i v i n g ont o the p i t c h I still did                not a p p r e c i a t e that there had been
an y play.         I was under the i m p r e s s i o n that I              was      going    to     stem      a pitch
invasion          at    the L e p p i n g s La ne end and my a t t e n t i o n was f o c u s s e d there,               I
did not see            and  players         l e a v i n g t h e p i t c h . T h e r e w a s a g r o w i n g g r o u p of
p e o p l e b e h i n d the goal a n d we m a d e s t r a i g h t a c r o s s the p i t c h t o w a r d s them.
As I r a n o v e r to       the       perimeter          fence the fans were pouring over the top
a n d o n e of t h e g a t e s i n t o t h e c e n t r a l s o u t h s e c t i o n h a d b e e n o p e n e d .

It  was        immediately        obvious that this was not                   a    straightforward            pitch
invasion       caused by hooliganism              because         those that were on the p itch we re
standing       in a g r o u p a n d n o t r u n n i n g a c r o s s t h e p i t c h a s w o u l d b e e x p e c t e d .

As s o o n as 1 a r r i v e d at t he f e n c e 1 c o u l d s ee the real r e a s o n for the fa n s

with        i n c r e d i b l e force. The stout m e s h b e t w e e n the                  posts     was    bowed       out
behind the              goal       and     the       blue      paint      was b e i ng r u b b e d off ont o p e o p l e s
clothing.           I saw a few people who were                         being     held      on the fence w i t h such
force that the                 m e s h w a s l e a v i n g its p a t t e r n on t h e i r faces.          I   a m of t h e
opinion           that        several        were      already          dead    at    that      stage,      they     had a
characteristic                 grey      m o t t l e d a p p e a r n c e to t h e i r s k i n t h a t to m e s u g g e s t e d

neck was broken.

Many obviously were unconcious and                              the     w h o l e m a s s of p e o p l e a t t h e f r o n t
of t h e t e r r a c e w e r e c o m p l e t e l y i m m o b i l e .    I     had     the s i c k e n i n g r e a l i s a t i o n
at that p o i n t that p e o p l e we r e d y in g m e r e l y inches w a y                     from       me     and       the

t e r m s w e w e r e to q u i c k l y g e t to t h e m or t a k e t h e p r e s s u r e off them.

P u l l i n g at the f e nc e s was             futile      since       with     the immense p r e s s u r e being
applied           from the other side they were not about                           to    give       way    with     the
meagre force              w e c o u l d m u s t e r . F o r a f e w m o m e n t s 1 s t o o d o n t o p of t h e l o w

think were still push i n g                   forward,      to m a k e t h e m m o v e f a s t e n o ug h. T h e o n e s

Whilst I was doing this               I     made        eye       contact       with a man who was about a

P r o g r e s s at that gate was            so     painfully          slow      and       there were many other

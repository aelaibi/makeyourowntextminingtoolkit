After      that          briefing           I was          stood       by    in       the   CID        office       at        Hammsrton             Road

On    Saturday             15 A p r i l         1989       I was       working           the      football           duty          as    a    CID

officer,            however,              I have       worked          many       football             games       at     the

Hillsborough                  Football           Ground          in    uniform and                in   particular                  at    the

Leppings            Lane        end.       When        it    first          became apparent                  to    me    what           had

happened            that        afternoon              I f o u n d it        h a r d to        believe            that    such           a    thing

could      have          happened           and        on       such a      large scale.

3.        M adam Speaker, a fte r th e Hillsborough disaster, a

nu m b er        of     inquiries     and       Investigations   to o k   place,

looking a t aspects o f th e tragedy.                    Perhaps th e m ost

th o ro u g h and w ide-ranging was th e Public inquiry led by

Lord Taylor.                 The term s o f reference o f th a t inquiry

encom passed not only inquiring into the disaster itse lf

b u t also making recom m endations about crow d control

and s a fe ty a t sports events.



4.        Lord Taylor's inquiry took oral evidence fro m over

170 w itnesses a t public hearings during May and June

1989 and considered many hours o f video evidence from

d iffe r e n t sources. In his in terim rep o rt in August 1989,

Lord Taylor found th a t                th e disaster had a num ber          of
causes.          He did n o t a ttrib u te all th e blame to a single

cause or person, b u t in paragraph 278 he m ade clear

th a t:

         “The m ain reason fo r th e disaster was th e fa ilu re o f

         police control"



5.       in       th a t   in te rim       rep o rt    Lord   Taylor    m ade     43

im m ediate recom m endations. His final re p o rt in January

1990          m ade        a    fu rth e r    76      recom m endations.        The

developm ents w hich have taken place since th e n                                 in

safety a t fo o tb a ll grounds and in th e policing o f fo o tb a ll

m atches              have          been      based       largely      on   th ose

recom m endations.                   Football in this country has been

tran sfo rm ed since th e Taylor Report. To a large e x te n t

th a t is due to                his w ide-ranging and soundly based

conclusions.



(ill    coroner's Inquest



6.      The deaths w hich occurred on 15 April 1989 w e re

also th e subject o f inquests conducted by th e coroner o f

7.   Madam speaker, as Hon Mem bers w ill know , an

Inquest is a fact-fin d in g inquiry, conducted by a Coroner

in fro n t o f a jury, and aim ed a t establishing th e answers

to fo u r im p o rta n t questions, namely:



     The id e n tity o f th e deceased



     The place o f death



     The tim e and th e d ate o f death and



     How th e deceased came by his or her death.



8.   The    Coroner's    rules    require     proceedings   and

evidence to be directed solely a t find ing answers to

th o se questions.



9.   The ju ry a t th e coroner's inquest, a fte r exam ining

th e evidence, found in March 1991 th a t th e cause o f
d eath o f those w ho died a t Hillsborough was accidental

d eath.

1 0 . a fu rth e r investigation was conducted by th e w e s t

M idlands Police, supervised by th e Police Complaints

A u th o rity , to establish w h eth er th e re w ere any grounds

fo r crim inal proceedings, and to consider w h e th e r any

police    o ffic e r   should   be   subject   to   disciplinary

proceedings.



11.   That investigation involved th e taking o f o ver 5000

statem en ts and th e scrutiny o f all th e m aterial which

had previously been exam ined by th e Taylor inquiry.

A fte r th a t investigation th e evidence was sent to th e

D irector o f Public Prosecutions, w ho concluded th a t no

person should be subject to crim inal proceedings.

to ill h ealth in advance o f a ruling by a disciplinary

trib u n a l under th e police discipline rules. A disciplinary

hearing cannot proceed w hen a police o ffic e r re tire s

b e fo re th e hearing takes place.           The Police com plaints

A u th o rity la te r decided th a t disciplinary proceedings

ag ain st   th e      su p erin ten d en t   should   be   w ith d ra w n

o f th e coroner's proceedings. During th e judicial review

proceedings, th e conduct o f th e inquest was subjected

to close and detailed exam ination,                             in Novem ber 1993

th e Divisional co u rt ruled th a t none o f th e m a tte rs

in te rv e n tio n by th a t court in th e verd ict o f th e inquest

ju ry .         The court also expressed strong doubts as to

w h e th e r an o th er inquest, if ordered, would result in

an yth in g fu rth e r being learned and observed th a t th e

process w ould be very harrow ing.



14.       The events surrounding th e disaster have th e re fo re

been subject to investigation on several occasions.                                But

concerns have rem ained about w h e th e r th e fu ll facts

have       yet        em erged.                I have    m et   relatives    of    th e

Hillsborough victim s whose su fferin g is exacerbated by

th e ir b e lie f th a t th e re are unresolved issues w hich

should be investigated fu rth e r.

15.      Representations w ere made to my predecessor and

have been m ade to               me, to th e A tto rn ey General and to

th e D irector o f Public Prosecutions. A Granada television

p rogram m e          in     December        last     year    dram atised    th e

d isaster and raised a num ber o f issues which, in th e

v ie w     of   th e       program m e       m akers,        represented    new

evidence.            since       th en   fu rth e r     m aterial   has     been

s u b m itte d on b e h a lf o f th e Hillsborough Family sup port

Group. Those representations have related in particular

to video evidence o f th e disaster and medical evidence

a b o u t th e tim e o f death o f th e victim s.



16.      Madam speaker, my D epartm ent, th e o ffice o f th e

A tto rn e y General and th e crow n Prosecution service

have considered very carefully all th e evidence w hich

has been p u t fo rw a rd in recent m onths.



17.      The D irector o f Public Prosecutions has taken th e

Central also took the view, again on the material
presented to him, th a t any application to th e High co u rt

fo r a new inquest would n o t have any realistic prospect

1 8 . Nonetheless,       I   am   acutely   conscious      th a t       th e

fam ilies o f those w ho died a t Hillsborough and many

e th e rs including Hon Mem bers o f this House are very

concerned       th a t   unresolved    issues   rem ain.            I   am

d e te rm in e d to go as fa r as I can to ensure th a t no

m a tte r o f significance is overlooked and th a t w e do n o t

reach a fin a l conclusion w ith o u t a full and independent

exam in atio n o f th e evidence.



1 9 . i can th e re fo re tell th e House today th a t th e

A tto rn e y General, th e D irector o f Public Prosecutions

and I have agreed th a t it is in th e public in te re s t th a t

21. Lord Justice Stuart-S m iths task w ill be tw o fo ld .

First to advise me w h eth er any evidence n o t previously

available is o f such significance as to ju s tify a fu rth e r

th e   A tto rn e y       General     and    th e   D irector   of   Public

prosecutions and th e chief constable o f south Yorkshire

police any evidence which m ig h t be relevan t to th e ir

22.    I hope th a t th is exam ination w ill enable us to

establish conclusively w h eth er or n o t m aterial evidence

ab o u t th e causes o f th e Hillsborough disaster has been

overlooked,         if it has I can assure th e House th a t I w ill

ta k e w h a te v e r action is needed. We ow e it to everyone

touched by th e trag ed y, but above all to th e fam ilies o f

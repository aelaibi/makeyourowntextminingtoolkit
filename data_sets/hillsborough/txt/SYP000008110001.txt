      As     I approached              the      Gymnasium              entrance,          I was         approached             by    Inspector

 ~S   could         see       that     the         perimeter              track       was    filled          with       spectators              and

 Police            Officers          and       a    number           of    casualties             were       being       attended           by S t .

  ihroughout              this       time          people        were        still      climbing             over       the    perimeter

  I returned              to     enclosure                No.    3 and          I saw       that     the      gate       was       s t i l l y not

 clear        and        the     officers             were       having          difficulty             in    lifting          a    powerfully

  pull       the     man       through             th e    gateway           rather         than     try      to    lift       him.         This       we

 eventually               did wth          a       number        of       officers          taking        hold      of       the    man     and

the     fence       at     t h at     point        was    of a n a r r o w e r           and    smaller          gauge         and    as       a

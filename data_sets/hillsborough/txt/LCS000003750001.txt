Dear

                           The Hillsborough Disaster

     I would like to confirm that commitment of the local authorities involved
in providing the service response to Hillsborough to the pressing need for a
systematic evaluative research project.   There is a requirement for this evaluation
to be conducted by an independent agency of high standing.   It is for these reasons
that the National Institute for Social Work was approached to undertake a study into
the effectiveness of the response.

     The approach taken by the Institute in formulating their outline is supported
by the Social Services Authorities and we would wish the study to begin as soon as
possible. I can also assure you that there is a high level of commitment to both
service delivery and evaluation, so there would be excellent co-operation at all
levels in Social Services Departments.

     I do hope that the Trust will feel able to support and finance this work which
it is believed could have a major impact on the responses to disasters in the
future.

                                 Yours sincerely,




                                 Director of Social Services

        FOOTBALL BILL

        The Secretary of State asked me to provide a short brief for
        use in press interviews which will take place after PM's
        Questions and the Business Statement this afternoon. This is
        attached, together with a copy of what the Prime Minister
        proposes to say during Questions.

        The Prime Minister will say that the timing of the end of the
        Session will be a matter for the House authorities. She will
        resist being drawn on precisely what this means, though it
        seems inevitable that the Lord President will be drawn during
        the Business Statement. On the question of the timing of
        implementation of the scheme, the Prime Minister will say that
        this will follow from the date of Royal Assent to the Bill.

        We will need to brief the Secretary of State further on what
        he can say about timing in the light of what emerges about
        timing during the course of the afternoon.

1.       Everyone is appalled at what happened at Hillsborough.
This \does      not     mean    the    need     for    action        against    football
violencej has gone away.


2-       In   spite     of     the   efforts    of     the      Government      and    the'
football      authorities       over   the     past    few    years    we   still     need
over   5,000 police officers on duty every Saturday to contain
the problem,       to protect the true supporters                    and those living
nearby grounds.


3.       The reputation of our football supporters abroad is as
low as    it can be.         The Bill will prevent              convicted      hooligans
from travelling to England matches                    abroad.    We must       have this
in place before the World Cup in Italy - remember the appall­
ing scenes in West Germany during the European Championships.


4.       It would be irresponsible to throw                   away the one measure
available     to   us   to   allow us     not only to deal with                the    long
standing problem of hooliganism but                    also     to   take   account     of
any relevant       measures      which   the    Taylor       Inquiry    might     recom­
mend .

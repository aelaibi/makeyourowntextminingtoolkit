             boarded the       coach at about             10.30 am                     (1030)   at D e e s i d e .   The trip to

             S h e f f i e l d was uneventful,           we did not make any stops and a r ri ve d                                  in

             S he f fi e ld at about       1.30     pm    (1330).                      The   coach was     parked      in a road

             near    the ground,        where all         the other                     coaches were       parked.       I d o n ’t

             remember any        coach being         stopped a nd searched.                             When we       parked the

           not given any          instructions about               how to get        to the ground,       but    I just

           followed the         crowd.

           the Police       I did not         see any fans          causing any trouble,           and    I did not

           see any fans drinking.                I do remember           there was       some singing       of

           football      songs     but    t h a t ’s all.                /

           I d o n ’t remember, what           time we got outside                 the Leppings Lane       turnstiles

           but    I was with my uncle                              W hen we got there         there was just a

           mass    of fans outside,            no queues /just a mass                of people.     We joined

           the man and tried to get                  to a Vt u rn s ti l e    but    in fact we never made          it

           I did not seem to move at all.                       I dp    remember       seeing    some moun t e d

    ,    the quickest way to the terraces                       that was          down the tunnel / n t o             pens 3/

         4*     I did not see any             police     or stewards          giving       fans    instructions

         w hich way to go.                It was quite        easy to get          down the t u / n s l .           At the

         end there was a fence and we went                          to the    pen on the /eft.                 We were
                                                                     M'
         able    to get       into the       pen but once           in you just          could not move ofyour

         own free will as                lots of fans were           just    coming       in    behind.

         I got jammed between fans and                       in fact       I was not       facing       the    pitch by

         facing    to the side.              I d o n ’t recall a ny th in g          that       went    on on the           pitch

         I did not see one kick                of the        ball.

         I d o n ’t recall,          a surge       it was     just    the    erush getting tighter                   and

         tighter,       as    I was      getting     carried nearer and              nearer       to the front              of

         the    pen.

         1 recall       fans shouting          f or/he 1 p‘-and things             like,       let us out but           I

         did not see a n y thing             bei/g done,        until       I got to the front                of the        pen,

         then    I saw fans          either / c o m b i n g    over       or being       pulled over          the    top of

         the    front    fence.

         I do    recall       seeing a couple of fans with a S t ew ar d and a police

         officer       pulling a V the front             fence,       e ve nt ua ll y the f e n c ^ w a s           pulled

                       <yyr~
         and so Was able to climb out through the broken fenrce.    1 got onto the

         p itch/and a l t h o u g h        I was   not   injured          I was    feeling      bruised and out of

irs/CT   breath so       I just went and sat on the                       pitch on the         left hand side               by

         -y/e 18 yard         box.

         I had    lost my uncle             in the    pen,     so    I just       stayed on the          pitch watching

         what was       going on till          I suppose about 4 :
                                                                 .’0Q               pm    <1600)       by w hic h time

         the    terrace       had almost       cleared so           I climbed back             in and got out of the

         g round via the tunnel               and the L ep pi ng s Lane Turnstiles.                       1 met my

         uncle at       the    coach.

         I did not have any                contact with any dead or                 injured fans.

         After    the m at c h had been stopped                 I feel       that    the    police       did not

             enough to help the -Fans,/!             remember a line of       police across      the    pitch

             an d   I think        they should have been helping         the fans.

             I w ould       like   to congratulate       the   supporters   for all   the effort       they

             put    in in trying        to save    people.      X am critical   of the   press       coverage

             after    the disaster,        when    it c riticised the Liverpool        fans.     I

             w o u ld say their        behaviour   was     immaculate.

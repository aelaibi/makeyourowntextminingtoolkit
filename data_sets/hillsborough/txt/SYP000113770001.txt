                       I became aware              that      closer to 3pm             (1500)    various     radio m es sa ge s about

continue on his way.                                                                             '      -

At 3 . 0 5 p m     < 1 5 0 5 > on the      outbreak    of trouble          I heard a r adio message

"All    o f f icers       to a ss em bl e    on pitch".        Wit h PC Roe at          this    stage and

a t t e m p t e d to    cut    thro ug h North s ta nd         from upper         concourse     to ground.

We    quic k l y    r ea li s ed this was        i mpossible as abuse and threats                     from

L iv e r p o ol    s u p po r te r s was    so fierce     we    had to      retreat to upper

concourse          level      from N or th stand.

We then a s s e m b l e d        on Kop end of N o r t h        stand on ground floor with

Police Dogs,            horses,        m an y other officers.           I thought we had a pitch

invasion at            this    time     on our hands.

An officer          in charge          then d ir ec te d my group onto the               pitch and we

were     told to        line     up facing N or th stand on the                pitch.        Whilst

s t a nding       facing      the N orth stand        I saw s om et hi ng s        being     th ro wn from

the    crowd       in our      direction,       possibly       coins.

At    this    stage       lots    of threats and a b us iv e         shouts        from the     crowd who

were     pointing         in d i re ct io n of L e p p in g s Lane         end.

I still       b el ie v ed we were          dealing w it h a      pitch      invasion at this

stage.        I could see many s up po rt er s who a p p e ar e d to have                      spilled onto

pitch.        Some      of them were         laying on the ground near                 to the goal mouth

and    penalty area.

Some     s u pp or t er s     ju mp ed from the N o r t h       stand      in front      of me and took

advertising            boards w hi ch they         carried towards           the are a where          the

trouble       se em ed to        be.

Almost       i m me d ia t el y one of these          groups     of s upporters          retu rned w ith a

s u pporter        laying      on the      stretcher     whose    body was twis te d and

appeared          to me     to be o b vi ou sl y dead.          It was      not    until     this    point   in
time    that     the     g ra v it y of the           incident          came     home   to me and I began to

realise       that we had a serious                    incident             on our hands.

I remember        t hi nk in g      there was,           for      some       reason,    little       radio

d i r e c t i o n from     control       and so as          I a p p e a r e d to be doi.ng nothing               m ore


than a g g r a v a t i n g    the' crowd by my              presence            wit h a few o th er officers

facing the N o r t h stand, .1 d ec i de d to move                              into the area where           people

were    lying     down       injured and o f fe re d a ssistance.

The first        person       I helped was a y o u t h a ge d about                       18 y ears who       said he

could not move             one    leg and one arm.                     As    I spoke wit h him a stretcher

appeared       beside        him and wit h the h elp of another                           officer      I a ss is t ed

the    injured ma n onto               the    stretcher.               With the help of some             s upporters

we    carried     this       person off the              pitch,         and     placed him down near to the

gym where a large                number       of c asualties                had now a p p e ar e d    to have been

put.

I returned to the                pitch and a s s i s t e d wit h the                  removal    of two other

injured s upporters.                   And was then d ir ec t ed by a s u p e r vi s or y officer

w i t h a g roup of other               officers         to go to the L ep pi ng s Lane                 end of the

outs i de of the           g round.

On arrival        at     that     point       I saw a p p r o x i m a t e l y       14 bodies        laid at the

side    of some        fencing,         a number         of Pol ic e          officers were a l r e a d y near

to these       bodies.           The    bodies were            s ec t io n ed off by a stre tc h of              crowd

control       barriers.

On    route    to this        locat ion        I saw 2 or 3 firemen with ox yg en equipment

work in g     a p p a r e n t l y without       success           to    revive a s upporter            laid near to

the    rear of the           control         hut,    but    outside           of the ground.

Whilst      s ta nd in g     near      to the       14 bodies,              I together w it h other officers

was    insulted by Liv er po ol                suppo rt er s           as they      left the     ground showing

open h o s t i li t y      towards       us.        S o me o ne    s h ou te d that was all we were               fit,

for,    standing around.

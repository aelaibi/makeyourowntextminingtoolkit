           I live at the above address and I am a supporter or Liverpool Football

           Club.     I am not season a ticket holder although I regularly attend

           matches both home and away.



           I wanted to see the serrij>sf^inal of the F .X^Cup, Liverpool versus

           NottirfCt-fc^m Forest but,    I was li-jnable to get a ^ i c k e t      for the match and
                                                  "                   ^
           it was for           s reason that myself and a friend,
              Z.tz.3
                                                                     travelled to^Sheffield early

           on the match day.          We had hoped to get a ticket by travelling early,



           Together with              we left Scarcliffe             in my Volkswagon Golf motor

           vehicle,    registered number                          at about 8.45 am (0845 hrs).     We

           arrived at about 9.30 am (0930 hrs) and parked in a side street off
                                                                                            PAGE       2
                                                                                            S1974

           the Leppings Lane I believe,            and it was about 5 minutes from the

           g ro u n d .



           We walked to the Lepping Lane End and we waited to see if anyone was

           selling tickets.



           At about         10 am (1000 hrs) we pu>Xhased a ticket each from a man Who

           was on the first cornfrt over the b r i d g e ^ o m         the ground.    We saw two

           men at this point selling tickets and both,                I N ^ u l d estimate had 30

           standing and 30 seat tickets each.                 They asked f o K £15.00 for a

           standing ticket to               Leppinqs Lane End and I purchased one.            I paid

           with a twenty pound note and the man pulled out a ’‘wad*                  of notes to

           give me my change.           I would think he had at least £500.00 in his

           ^iocket .



           The men iNjurchased the ticket off was about 5" "10, well built and 25
d ia^> ,   years old,         he\jnad fair hair and it was short       in len gth . He had about a

           2 day growth of \eard and was wearing jeans and a sweat top,                    brown in

Mo'        colour.         He had a l\verpool a c c e n t .    The other man was s lig htly

           younger a n d abo u t 5 " 6 \ ^ a l l . He had short ginger hair and had
                                                  I
 m - r     freckles, he was medium \uj/lt and was wearing jeans and a brown

           leather jacket as he does at all games                I ’ve seen him at, which is

           always the         'big gate"   games, Manchester United and such teams.           He

           also had a Liverpool accent.             I would call these men      'touts'.



           Having         purchased the tickets we went        into the town to make a phone

           call and we subsequently made our way to the ground and arrived at the

           L eppings Lane End a t ^ A o u t 11.45 am (1145 hrs). At this time few

           people were about and the turnstiles                I found to be open.     I saw Police

           Officers outside the turnstiles and they were searching the few
                                                                                       PAGE       3
                                                                                       SI 974

           supporters that were entering the ground.            I was infact drinking some

           orange juice in a carton and an officer smelt           it in case it was

           alcohol and tasted a bit on his finger.            At this time I had free

           access to the ground and very few people were about.               I did see the

           concertina gate opening and shutting to let officials              in and out.     I

           passed t h r o u g h H h e   turnstiles and handed my ticket in as normal.

                id a free passage in'fr^the tunnel        inside the ground and I made my

           way to pe<i_3 which is to the right of the tunnel and of the fence

           separating       pens 3 and 4.



           When I entered pen 3 with Marc I would say only about 12 people had

           entered the pen and infact we lay down to take in the sun.

           p o licemen at the end of the tunnel by the parting fence. Hlhen I had

           flfuj^chased my coffee I walked around the West stand and into Pens              1 A

           2.    I then entered pen 3 through a small gate under the seated area at

           tnfestop    of   pen   3.
                \ -------------


           I then noticed that the crowds at the far end,           the Spion Kop,    had

           build up and the forest fans were entering the ground earlier than the

           Li ver pooi>^fans.


                                    3 -
           From about 2.40 pta. \1440 hrs) onwards the crowd in pen 3 was build up

           and at about 3 or 4 minutes to three           (1457 - 1456 hrs)    it was becoming

           unbearable.       I was at this time I was standing virtually in the centre

           of the pen.        As the crowd build up I lost control     of where I was going

           and was swept from side to side with the crowd.            I was doing my utmost

           to keep on my feet and wasn't aware of what was happening on the pitch

         and in fact I remember only one pass of the ball from Hansen to Nicol.

          In front of me w a s \ m a n   of about my age and infront of him was a

         young   lad of about 12 tbyjfiS years of a g e , I c a n ’t recall anything else

         about him.



         I could hear him screaming over and over again obviously with pain as

         he was getting     crushed.     He was against a barrier and the force of the

         crowd was all against him.         The lad was facing the pitch and the

         people in front of the barrier had managed to turn around and were

         attempting to push people back to give relief to people and in

          particular this y^aung la d.      The whole situation was chaos with people

         shouting and screamingsa nd the crowd swaying forward with little

          backward movement.     This young lad after about two or three minutes

          got swept under the crowd and did not re appear and I assumed that he

          had died, as he had no chance of getting up.        The pressure of the

          crowd was incredible and I was dripping with sweat and felt hopeless

         as I had no control over where I was being carried by the crowd.



 ■"-s.   As the young lad was swept under I was two from the bar r ier , but I was

         \ o o n at the barrier as the crowd swept me alongside the man infront.

          I wasNonly there a few seconds as I managed to slip around and flipped

         over the terrier, al the pressure was relieved for a second.

         I ended ups ioik down land hit my head on the floor but only slightly.

         My legs were still tile other side of the barrier.    My first sensation

         of the incredible heat far in excess of a sauna.



         I could smell the heat and sweat and I was gasping for breath.            I was

         in this position for about 20 seconds as people around me managed to

         pull me up and release my legs one at a time.         I was now infront of

         the barrier and I joined in trying to push the crowd back to relieve

        the pr essure, ^f\then decided to try and get out and I lifted myself

        onto the Jbarrier ari^d using the shoulders of people to balance worked

        my way h o l d i n ^ ^ h e   side fence of pen 2.      I was then catapulted by

        people pushing me into Pen 2 and people the other side broke my fall.

        I then got up and was shocked and distressed and joined in helping

        people into Pen 2.            I helped for about ten minutes and Police arrived

        and took over the task.



        1' lost track of time but had met up with                     whilst     in pen 2 and we

        wandered around the stand to pens 6 & 7.                We eventually left the

        ground having seen numerous             people being treated all around.          I went

        back to the car but had lost tourx^with                      nhen he -went to phone and

        as far as I can remember             I drove back ^h'ajne.   I r^ce iv       uised ribs

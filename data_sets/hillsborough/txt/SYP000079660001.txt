t i cket        for       the    game .

We    both       left          Hull       at    about          1 pm       (1300)           that         afternoon          and       travelled

direct          to    Sheffield                city       centre.               We       parked          on       Penistone          Rd    just

outside          the       city       and       about          a    mile        before             the       ground,       it       was    about

2.15pm          (1415)          when       we    parked             the        car.           During          our    journey             from    Hull          to

Sheffield             we       experienced                no       delays           or     untoward               incidents          of    any       kind.

After       parking             the       car,       we    joined              the       general             flow    of    supporters

walking          to       the    ground          along             Penistone               Rd,         the    supporters             on    this       side

of    the       ground          were       mainly          Nottingham                    Forrest             fans.        Having          parked          on

the    wrong          side       of       the    ground             we        were       anxious             to    get    to       the    ground

quickly          and       we    moved          at    quite           a       pace       along          the       road.        I    saw    large

numbers          of       fans       walking          along           Penistone                   Rd,    in       general          their       behaviour

was    good          humoured             and    no       more        roudy           than         at    any       other       match       day.

It    took       about          15    minutes             to       walk        from        our         car    to    Leppings             Ln,    we

walked          around          to    the       left       of       the        ground             and    along       Parkside.                 Upon

entering             Leppings             Ln,    the       crowds              were        quite ^ / n s e           and       the       fans    filled

the    roadway.                 As    I'd       walked             around           the       abound          and    into          Leppings          Ln       I'd

been       approached                on    perhaps             a    couple            at      a    dozen          occasions          by    youths

asking          if    I    had       any       spare       tickets^^o                    sell.           I'd       ignored          these

requests,             but       they       became          rnore^Trequent                         as    I moved          into       Lappings          Ln

itself.              I'd       say    that       the       majority                 of     the         youths       making          these       requests

for    tickets             were       Liverpool/fans                          and     spoke            with       " s c ouseV accents.                    They

were       in    the       main       youths,             aged        between              18-25         years       of    age.

We    both       moved          with       the       crowds           along           Leppings               Ln    and    arrived          at    the

turnstiles                at    the       rear       of    the        West          Stand          at    about       2.30pm          (1430).

Whilst          walking          to       the    ground             as        I ’ve      already             said,       I saw       no    untoward

incidents             amongst             the    fans          and        although                nv^'early i m p r e s s i o n s              were       that

a    lot    of       the       fans       had    been          drinking               dyne        to    the i r m e r r y          behaviour,             I

didn't          see       anyone          drinking             from           caafs      on       route        to t h e    ground.

       father          on    the       opposite             side          of    Leppings             Ln       to    the       turnstile                 block,             we

       stood       about          for       a    few       minutes             and       then       separated?                my       father           had       a

       standing             ticket          for       the       North          Stand.           My       father          resides              in       Liver^pol

       and       had    travelled                to    the       game          in    a    coach          party.              My    father              is

       that       the       crowds          outside             were       very          dense       indeed.                 There        is       a    long          wall

       which       separates                the       large          block          from       the       small          block          of/tfurnsti les                     and

       I    think       their          aim       was       to    try       and       control             yfe       f l o w of       the       crowds

       all       anxious          to       get         inti      the       ground.              I d i d n ’t         see a n y          other           Police

       The       crowds          continued             to       flow       forward,             I w o u l d n ’t             say       that        I was          in       a

       to    have       very          little          effect          and       the       crowds          still          pushed           past          in       pockets

amongst          the       horses.                   I myself             was       pushed             through          in       a    pocket          of     people

between          two       horses.

I    have      attended                hundreds                of    matches                over       recent          years          whilst          following

Liverpool             and         on       every          occasion             where          Police          horses             have       been          used     to

control          crowds               they          have       been       very          effective             and       I       think       people           have

every       respect               for       the          ’m o u n t i e '.          This          game       appeared                quite       different

in    this       respect               because                the    crowds             seemed          to    have          a    total          disrespect

far    the       horses               and       were          pushing          through             the       line       in       an       attempt          to    get

to    the      turnstiles.

I    remember            going             through             the       line       of       horses          and       into          the    enclosure              in

front       of      the       turnstile                   block,          this          is    when          things          really          got

uncomfortable                     and       everyone                just       started             to       push       from          the    back,          it

was    obvious             that            there          was       no    movement                at    the       front          as       people          c o u l d n ’t

get    through             the         turnstiles                   quick       enough.                 I    then       became             sandwiched

between          people               in    a       crush       in       front          of    turnstiles,                   fans          were       packed

tightly          together                  and       I    found          that       I       couldn't          move          at       all,       my    arms       were

pinned         to     my      sides             from          the    pressure                of    people          around             me.        I was

possibly            20     feet            from          the    turnstile                   block       when       I    first             experienced

this       tight         crush.                 I    could          hear       people             shouting             in       front       of       me,     who

were       nearer          the         block,             I    could        tell            that       these       people             were       frantic           and

in    some       distress,                  there             were       screams./                I was       frightened                   at    this        time

be c a u s e     of      the          int en s e          crush          a n d Jt b e c a m e           conscious                of       being

physically               injured                by       the    weigjrfl        of          bodies          around          me.

At    this       time         I       noticed             a    solitary             mounted             Officer,                who       was    positioned

on    his      horse          against                the       small        block            of    turnstiles.                       He    was       totally

surrounded               by       a    sea          of    ®dies           and       people             were       tightly             packed          against

his    horse.              This            O f f i c/r         was       red    faced             and       was    screaming                hysterically

at    the      crowds.                 The          Officer          himself                was    in       some       dire          distress             and    I'd

go    so    far       as      to       say          that       he    was       in       a    frenzy.              It's          only       what       I    thought

at    the      time,          but          the       Officer             possibly             had       a    good       overall             impression               of

                                                                                                                                                            S2392

the    situation,                being       so       high       up    and       being          pinned                   in    the          crowd          himself.

He    was    helpless             to    assist          people             around          him.

I was       pinned          in    the       crowds          outside          the       turnstiles                         for       about             15

minutes,          there          was    a    constant             movement             forwards                      albeit             slow          and        I

remember          that       on    occasions                my    feet       were          lifted                off          the       floor,             t h a t ’s

how    packed          it    was!

Everyone          in    front          of    this       block          were       in       the          same             position                of    being

crushed       together             and       some       were          worse       off          than             I was,          particularly

women,       young          children          and       smaller             people.                 Everyone                   was          complaining

and    there       were          moans       and       screams             from    people                   who          c o u l d n ’t          get       their

breath.           My    time       in       the       crush       was       like       a       nightmare                      and       I    have          never

experienced             anything             like       it       before.           I was                surprised                   that          no       one        was

seriously          injured             or    died       outside             the    turnstiles                            as    they          had          done        in

the    ground          itself          later.

It    was    about          2.50pm          (14-50),         I squeezed                into             a       turnstile                   at    the       front

of    the    crush,          it    had       taken          me    the       15    minutes                   to       move       20          feet.            1       had

to    fight       to    get       into       the       door       of       the    turnstile                      because                of       the

continuing             pressure             from       the       back.           Once          in       I       handed          my          ticket          to        the

operator,          I was          also       so       angry       because          of          the          crush             outside             that           I    had

a    few    words       with       him.           I    c a n ’t       recall       what             I       said          and       I       now       appreciate

it    may    have       been       beyond             the    operator's                control,                      but       I had             to       say

something          to       someone          because             of    my    horrific                   experiences                         outside.

When       I moved          out    of       the       turnstile             and    into             the          enclosure                   at       the        back

of    the    stand,          there          was       lots       of    space.              I    just             stood          for          a    while              to

regain       my    senses.              I    then       decided             that       I       needed                a     drink            and       I made              my

way    along       the       enclosure                and    across          the       length                   of       the    stand             to       the

opposite          side.           At    this          end    of       the    stand             was          a    tea          shop          and       1


purchased          a    drink.

I    stood    for       a    time       at    the        rear         of    the    stand                to       think          about             what

happened          outside.              I    really          was       lucky       to          escape                without                injury           and          in
                                                                                                                                                               PAGE              6
                                                                                                                                                               S2392

          conclusion                I'd       say       that          it       was       the     fans          bloody        mindedness             to    get          into

          the    ground             and       people             were          just        pushing             into    the        enclosure             with       a

          total       disregard                   for       other          people's              safety.

          At    no    time          did       I    see       any       gates             opened           or    any    unauthorised                 access

          gained          into       the          ground.

          From       the       tea       shop          I made          my          way     around          the    side        of       the    stand       and          into

          pen    number             1,        1    took          up    a       position              at    the    rear        of       the    terrace          and          B

          below       the       seated             area,              (I'd          like        to    say       that     1    had       left

          outside          the       turnstile                   area,             we    had     agreed          to    separate              and    to    find          my

          own    way       into          the       ground).                    I    took        up    my       match     viewing             position          in       pen

          1 at       about          3pm       (1300)             and       just          before           kick    off,        the       players          were

          already          present                on    the       pitch.                                         y'

          I watched             the       first             few       minutes              of    play/until              realising                that       there

          were       some       problems                in       the       centre           peiy          of    the    terraces              in    the    West

          Stand.           I    could             only       see       the          headar of             the    crowd        in       the    centre          pens

          from       my    position                and       I    could             sal     that          the    crowds           in    there       were       tightly

          packed.              My       own       pen       was       70%          flCtl 1 a t       this       time.         I    realised             there          were

          problems             because             of ^ p e o p 1 e y e 1 i m b i n g                the       perimeter           fences          at    the       front
Off
          of    the       pens.           Some          of       th/f f i r s t            people          over        ran    onto       the       pitch       and
< X& £~   V -----------
          were       shouting             and          waving          to          players           and       officials           on    the       pitch.              One

          man    actually                took          ho   yd    of       a       Liverpool              player,        Steve          NICOL.           I

          immediately                   thought/it                was          a    pitch        invasion,             as     I    couldn't             see    any          of

          the    crush          in       the       pens,

          I    remained             in    my       position                in        pen    1 and          then       saw     increasing                numbers             of

          people          climbing                over       the       perimeter                 fences          onto        the       playing          area.           It

          soon       became             apparent             that          there           were       crowd           problems          in    the       centre          pens

          and    injured                people          were          being             taken        onto       the     ptich.           The       game       was

          called          off       and       the       players                returned              to    the    dressing              rooms.           Even          at

          this       stage          I    thought             that          the          game     would          shortly           restart          and       the       few

          casualties                would          be       dealt          with.

             At    about       3.15pm           (1315)            I    realised          that          the       scale        of    the       problem              in    the

             centre       pens       was        beyond            my    initial          thoughts.                    LAfatched              as    most        of       the

            West     Stand          half        of     the        playing       area             filled/feith                casualties                from        the

             centre       pens.            I    didn't            move       from       my       viewing             point       and     I    d i d n ’t      see

             P*s-t t ? w t ^ r f                                                  /

             followed          to    come         in       and        through       a    main          gate          next     to    the       turnstiles.

            In    conclusion              1 would           1 ike       to    say       that          of    my        experiences                outside            the

            that     they       could           in     t!ie       circumstances,                   but          were       totally           ineffective                 due

             to    the    large           numbe/s           arriving           together.                    I    think        that      the        Police

             presence          there           waft    totally           inadequate                anyway             and     more      Officers              should

             have    been       despatched                   to       assist.           I was              involved           in   the       c r u s h for          at

             least       20    minutfs           and         no        extra   Police              strength                was evident            to    ease        the

             situation          during            that        time.           Whilst             I was          in    the     crush          the       main        thing

    /^A l   going    through              my    mind        was        that    the       Police             would           arrive          in    strength              to

             relieve          the    situation,                   of    course          no       one       came and          everyone             had     to        look

^           after    their          own        well        being.

            My     main       recollections                   of       the    disaster             are          of    the     circumstances                   outside

             the    turnstiles                 and     I    saw        very    little             of       the       problems          in     the       centre

             I    have    marked           on    a     sketch           plan    of       Hillsborough                      Football           Ground          my

   Dear Sir

   A dlington -v- DukenfieStl and IMurrav

   Further to. your letter o f 23 December 1. am able to confirm that I have discussed this letter with the.
   Assistant Chief Constable and because o f the holiday period when both he and his iegal advisers are
   absent on holiday he will not be able to give any attention to this matter until after 4 January 1999
   which is his first day back in the office. We understand that you yourself are away until that date in
   any event: We are sure that you will appreciate that the Assistant Chief Constable has his norma!
   police workload to deal with and inevitably he will be very busy immediately upon his return. He
   will need to take advice in relation to these •matters both from .ourselves and from the Force
   Solicitor.

   It has been confirmed to us that the Defendants in these proceedings will be making an application
   for Judicial -Review. We understand that they will also make an application for the proceedings
   before the Leeds Stipendiary Magistrate to be stayed. W e understand that you are still awaiting
   guidance from London in relation to-whether or not CPS will give disclosure in any event but if: may
   be helpful to you to .know that the Assistant Chief Constable’s view is that any question o f voluntary
   disclosure should be postponed until the resolution o f the Judicial Review proceedings.

   N o doubt if you receive any further guidance from London before close o f business on Christmas
   Eve you will let us know and otherwise we. will be in contact with you again about'these matters
   during January.

   Kindly note that until 12.00 noon on Thursday 24 December this matter is being dealt with by Mr
   Shepherd at our Manchester Office. The office closes at 12.00 noon on 24 December and the matter

 Dear Sir

 Adlington -v- Dukenfield and Murray

 Further to your letter o f 23 December I am able to confirm that I have discussed this letter with the
 Assistant Chief Constable and because o f the holiday period when both he and his legal advisers are
 absent on holiday he will not be able to give any attention to this matter until after 4 January 1999
 which is his first day back in the office. We understand that you yourself are away until that date in
 any event. We are sure that you will appreciate that the Assistant Chief Constable has his normal
 police workload to deal with and inevitably he will be very busy immediately upon his return. He
 will need to take advice in relation to these matters both from ourselves and from the Force
 Solicitor.

 It has been confirmed to us that the Defendants in these proceedings will be making an application
 for Judicial Review. We understand that they will also make an application for the proceedings
 before the Leeds Stipendiary Magistrate to be stayed. We understand that you are still awaiting
 guidance from London in relation to whether or not CPS will give disclosure in any event but it may
 be helpful to you to know that the Assistant Chief Constable’s view is that any question o f voluntary
 disclosure should be postponed until the resolution o f the Judicial Review proceedings.

 N o doubt if you receive any further guidance from London before close o f business on Christmas
 Eve you will let us know and otherwise w e will be in contact with you again about these matters

 IS THERE ANYTHING THAT YOU WISH TO ADD WHICH YOU FEEL IS

 VITAL TO THIS JUDICIAL INQUIRY?

 ■1) BELIEVE THAT SHOULD THERE BE AN ID CARD SYSTEM INTRODUCED IT WOULD CAUSE

 MORE PROBLEMS,   AND IT FRIGHTENS ME    TO THINK THAT   IF IT   IS INTRODUCED THAT THIS

 SAME THING A DISASTER WOULD HAPPEN      AGAIN.

 2) SHOULD THE FENCES REMAIN THEN THE FENCES WHICH DIVIDE THE TERRACES INTO

 PENS SHOULD BE REMOVED.     HAD THEY NOT BEEN THERE THE FANS COULD HAVE SPREAD

 0 ®   ALONG THE TERRACES.

 3) CROWD CONTROL OUTSIDE THE FOOTBALL GROUND'S ,SHOULD BE BETTER WITH A SYSTEM

 OF FILTERING THE FANS TOWARDS THE TURNSTILE ARE#

 4) AT LAST Y E A R ’S SEMI-FINAL THE POLICING WAS FAR & g ^ T E R , BUT AT THIS YEAR'S

 GAME I C O U L D N ’T BELIEVE WHAT I SAW WHEN I REACHED THE LEPPINGS LN AREA. THERE

 WERE VERY FEW POLICE OFFICERS AND NO CROWD CONTROL.

 THERE APPEARED TO BE NO C O N T IN^uNCy PLANS FOR SUCH A DISASTER OCCURRING.

 THE POLICE DEALT WITH THE INCIDENT AS IF IT WAS A PUBLIC DISORDER                         V

 SITUATION,       WHEN CLEARLY TO ME AND THOSE AROUND ME,     IT WAS NOT.

 COMMUNICATIONS BETWEEN THE AUTHORITIES AND THE CROWD WERE ALMOST

 NON-EXISTENT,       NO STATEMENT WAS MADE THAT THE INCIDENT WAS AN EMERGENCY

 AND THAT FANS WERE INJURED AND THAT SPACE WAS NEEDED FOR RESCUE SERVICES.

 THE INFORMATION GIVEN WAS VAGUE,         PEOPLE WERE CALLED TO "GET OFF THE PITCH"

 BUT GIVEN NO DIRECTION WHERE TO GO, AND FENCING AROUND THE PERIMETER

 PREVENTED THEM LEAVING THE GROUND.

 IF THE POLICE AND/OR THE FOOTBALL ASSOC. WERE JOINTLY RESPONSIBLE FOR THE

PLANNING OF THE HATCH ON 13 APRIL 1989    (150489), AT HILLSBOROUGH,   THEN WHYs-

 1)   WAS THERE AN INAPPROPRIATE ALLOCATION OF TICKETS MADE?

2)    WHY WAS THE SMALLER END OF THE GROUND ALLOCATED TO LIVERPOOL F.C.

3)    I F , AS STATED, THE REASON TO 2 ABOVE WAS FOR ACCESS APPROACH TO THE

GROUND,   THEN WHY DID OUR COACH PARK BEYOND THE GROUND IN A COACH PARK IN

 NOTTS FORREST SUPPORTERS AND THE AGGREVATION IT CAUSED

 AMOUNTS THE LIVERPOOL SUPPORTED,     SO A LINE OF POLICE

 WOULD     NOT HAVE BEEN NEEDED ACROSS THE PITCH.

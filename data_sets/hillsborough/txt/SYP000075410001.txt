of that at other big games. At this              pub we couldn’t get one

so I left,      but the fans that were in the pub were having a drink and

were generally well-behaved.            Whilst there were quite a few in the

pub,y£t this point whilst            I was tryinsj^To get the tickets,             I was on my

       Then I went to the          'B f t e h i (1 think th a t ’s what   i t ’s

called), and although the ym b appeared to be shut there was a guy on

the door letting people in after looking them over first. This                         pub was

very crowded even at this time.             I asked if anyone had any spares and

virtually straight away a guy sold me               two standing tickets for £6

each, which was the face value. There               appeared      to be quite a             few

tickets going spare,            I mean about six    or seven      and     there was just the

odd one or two fans            looking for them,    but that      may     have been because

it was early.

Having got the tickets            I went back to                collect her,        then we

went down to the ground and it was now a b o u ^ T T l S p m         (

I^nust say I had brought a seat ticket for £20,                  off a man outside the

 round prior to going            into the   'Horse and Jockey',     the face value

was £14.     This guy was your average Jjj£ Bloggs just wishing to get rid

of a spare.       The touts of which L/saw three from around the g r o u n d ,

were asking £35,            one of whijff was a guy I have seen at Anfield outside

the Shaftjkley Gates,         God j m o w s where he gets the tickets from,           but

h e ’s alwaVs got t h e m / I      d o n ’t know him by name,   but his white about

Thi/ seat ticket I now had was spare so I sold it to a Liverpool                            fan

 utside the Leppings Ln turnstiles and he paid me £20 I paid for it.

I want to say that on the way to the ground and around the Leppings

Ln I was never stopped by the P o l i c e , where as a last y e a r ’s semi

finals,     1 was stopped prior to getting to the turnstiles and asked if

I had a ticket,         this year there was none of that.

We handed in our tickets and entered through the Leppings Ln

              aqain this year there was jno Police or Stewards on the

other side of the turnstiles directing you to the different areas,

last year there we\e s e v e r a ^ r o l i c e and Stewards ushering the fans to

       different pens, r n ^ m y Stewards,         but again not this year.

So we then moved around the rear of the W Stand and went and stood in

the terracing, which        is elevated between the W Stand and the N Stand

'and we took up our positions at about              1.30 (1330)     to 1.40pm (1340).

There was hardly anyone            in this area and people were sitting and lying

about taking      in the scene as it was a very pleasant day, > u t             even at

this stage we could see that there was a lot of peoa>e in Pen t h r e e ,

which is both to pass comment on it.

Even                “Call your       lot fans,    t h e r e ’s hardly any of them here."

I said,    "No,   look t h e ’re    all   in that pen there".

I mean this to say that there was a hell of a lot of                    people crammed

into these two pens even            at this time.

From then on while I was            in the ground there was constantly more and

more    people going    into pen threj»*^and it was obvious to us that it was

too f u l l , but the two     pens^Situated on either side pens           1 and 2 then_5_

and 6 and 7 w here we                were nearly empty,       there was   plenty of

room. Pen 6 was r j m l l y   empty hardly anyone          in there.

So getting t o u i^rd s 2pm    (1400) and        2.30pm   (1430)   it was clear tous and

I   would oj^^hought to the cameras or their operators that there was                        a

problenrin that centre section,             yet still there seemed to be no

        ter build up of supporters         in    the side pens,    this is where

I   thought the stewarding and link from the control                 room had broken

down.

As time went on 2.30pm         (143Q^<f we could see the situation in

these    pens was very ser            T as we were looking on it, there was

people    climbing over/rences to get out of the centre sections to get

                       into the side sections and this was getting more and more,                  I could

                       not understand why the side gates            in the centre stands were not open

                       to allow the fans move between the petiaflf^Some o i the fans who had

                       attempted to climb over t h e \ s i d e f e n c e s and the fence to t t c h            had

                        een stopped by the Police and made to stay                in the pen.

                       By this-time 2.35       (1435)    to 2.45   (1445)   the   people in the sfets      in t   e

                       W Stand started to pull          people up into the seats so they rea 1 isyetjj.

                       there was something very wrong by now in the centre pens

                       Then that led us up to                                 iore and more people were

                       really notice that they had in fact started playing,                due to us

                       wat chij* gf the crowd. Then there was this sudden surge, which I now know

                       as     eaction because BEARDSLEY hit the post. By this time people were

                             the pitch because they had come over the fe n c e , that was just an

                       odd one or two as the Police j 0 : re still stopping them and there was




M                      now a build up of Police framing round to the Leppings Ln stand.

                       Then obviously you could sea' Bruce GROBBELEAR              remonstrating with

                       Pol i ce to open the gate ir^the fence onto the pitch.              It became
    l/N/
                       obvious that the people             the front were dead or v e ry seriously

                       injured,    they were motionless,       you could see clearly from where we

were.

They then seemed to take an incredibly long time to start getting

the people out of that area. Some fans could be seen trying to kick

the fence down,     the Police appeared to be at first stopping them

 j'om doing this and there was a little bit of conflict between them,

it was general      confusion. Eventually you could see that people were

getting   out of that area and there were a lot of people lying on the

groiand with their heads     covered by coats, which I assume were dead,

tl/ese people were on the pitch around the penalty area,         there was also

various    individuals   being given the kiss of life and heart massage.            In

the main this was being done by other fans and eventually by Police

Officers,    there seemed to be a time lapse for this to happen,         I was

really angry at the time about this.

The/fans the started       to rip down the notice boards to make      makeshift

  retchers and there       seemed to be a conveyor belt effect of     people

being carried and taken to the far end of the N Stand.

The Ambulance arrived and went and parked behind the goal and was

there ^ v e r y   long time without nothing happening,      people were still

       g carried away on the stretchers by young teenage fans,

   this time there was a massive build up of Police at the stand a nd

across the pitch in a line. This      is when a lot of anger was vented at

them as there was so many of them stood doing nothing and the fans

stretchering      people away. There were Of fi cers dotted all over giving

 irst aid mouth to mouth,      heart massage but it just appeared a very

 trange scene.

Then the Fire Brigade turned up a long time after,          I d o n ’t know how

long but it was a long time       and cut the fences open.The Nottingham

Forest fans when the       people started to corne on the

pitch started to chant,      unaware of what was going on.

This    caused a small group of Liverpool    fans   ran towards the Forest

  end,   but       the chanting stopped and the group went back.

  Then the         was a general period of nothing happening,             no announcements

  and was very disturbing,            but I understand now they wanted to hold

  everyone         in/the ground to allow the emergency services to get                 there,

  but they         could of told us what to do, fortunately people just                 stood

J^$til/i not knowing what to do,
o\ /
  eventually Kenny DALGLjffH and also a Police Officer or official made

  an announcement o v a r t h e       tannoy a s king for people to keep calm,             but

  that was all and that was after 3.30pm                  (1530) and 4pm (1600),        it was

  late on anyway.

  Then t h e r e    was a n o t h e r anriouiy^iTient s a i d t h e game was o f f and to l e a v e

  slow ly.

  We waited till the ground was almost empty and made our way home to

          house.

  I saw lots of people queueing for telephones and people in houses were

  taking people in           to use their phones,       that was a nice gesture.

  I think that one           of the /najor causes was the allocation of four

  thousand tickets           to Liverpool and the smaller and the average gate                   of

  Liverpool        is double the average gate of Forest.              The reasoning given

  for this decision was the F A had taken advice off the Police                          re the

  not wishing the fans to             have to cross over        around. If that is       true,    it

  is totally ill-founded and th e re ’s two basic ways that could of been

  solved one is by leaving the approach to the ground as                       it was and by

  simply blocking off the entrance to two roads                    is one way.

  Or by changing direction of entry to the ground by swapping to exit

  points from the motorway round,               in other words taking the Forest fans

  further up the motorway,             bringing them into the N end of Hillsborough

  and allowing         Liverpool      to come into the S        side of Hillsborough by

  exiting from the S exit             of the motorway.

  In fact many Liverpool            fans travelled to Hillsborough via the Snake

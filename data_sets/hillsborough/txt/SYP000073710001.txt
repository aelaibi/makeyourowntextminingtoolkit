a ll    very         tightly          locked       together.

The     crowd was               moving       about       a    lot a n d y o u          j us t     had     to m o v e       with       them,

by t h i s       time       I had       lost       sight        of m y      friends.

Whilst         I w a s at         position          1 on the           grid        plan,         there       was a     sudden             c ru s h

because         the a r m         of    the m a n        next       to me        was     being       pushed         into        my    stomach,

As     s o o n as      this       man       had    dropped          tb^re        was a       terrific             surge     from          behind

I managed             just       before       the     gap       closed       up to          pick                      up off          the

I don't        thi nk        I can        really         describe            any    of    these          peo pie as             it all

happened           very      quickly.

th e    back.

W e we re s till             be i ng      c r u s h e d a n d we            managed       somehow            to    turn around and

When      we w e r e       at a b o u t      halfway          up the        terraces           the     pressure          eased

I c a n ’t sa y           that     I saw any          police          on the          terraces        as we w e r e           fighting

our      way    back       up the        terraces          towards          the       tunnel        not    even     in the a r e a

where         the    crowd       had     thinned          out.

We    ran s t r a i g h t        through        the       tunnel       with                         and    out     of   the     ground

Once      outside          there       was     one    ambularuz'e a n d a                lot    of     injured          people       l y in g

around         it.

We    lay                     [own by the             other          injured          people        a n d as     s o o n as we        did

t h is    a    policeman           came      over     and       started        doing         something           with




Just      as    we     had    laid                        down another                policeman           came     over       with a

flat      cap on a n d           told     us,    'On y o u r          way,     on y o u r       w a y.'

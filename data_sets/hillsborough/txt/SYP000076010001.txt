                 I am a single man and                 I live at

                 I am employed               by

                 I am a supporter                 of L iverpool       Football       Club and    I o bt ained a ticket

                for      the F .A . Cup semi-final                 tie between L iverpool and N o tt i ng h am

                Forest,          w hich was        to be    played a t H i l l s b o r o u g h , Sheffield,        on

                S at u r d a y    15th April         1989    <150489?.

                 I got     the ticket             from my father who            is a season ticket          holder»       The

                 ticket was            for    the W S t a nd terraces and             cost £6.00.

                 I left home            on the      day of the m atch at about               1300 hrs and drove

                towards S h e f f i el d           in my own motor          car via H ud dersfield.

                As    I came off             the P en i st o ne Rd and joined             the m ain   road toward;

                H il ls bo ro ug h,          I noticed      that    the traffic was          very heavy ancj/moving

                very slowly.                 It took about         half an hour          to travel    the   next    ten miles
                                                                                                                   PAGE        2
                                                                                                                   S2027

and     I even t u a l ly         parked    in a side       road off the Halifax Rd.                         It took

 about       twenty minutes            to walk      from where          I had      parked my         car to

Hills b o r o u g h .                                                                           '

 I a r r i v e d at the L ep pings Ln entrance                        to the Ground'” at about                1430

 hours.         I went          through the outer          gates and joined a large                    crowd of

. people who were                trying    to get       to the turnsti/Les.               There were          no

 d i s t i n g u i s h a bl e    queues,    jusjC   a mass       of    peffple.         More and more          people

 were     joining         the     crowd a jn d    it was a l m o s X impossible             to move. /

 A ma n      in the       crowd faiynted and             it was       just   possible to make/ enough

 room for         him to be helped               to the side of the               crowd.        I cytnnot      recall

 what     this man          looked     like,      but he was a white man,                  age/      between 4 0-60

 years.

 The     closer       I got       to the    turnstile^,          the worse         the sit ua ti on became.                    I

 saw two m o un te d Police O f f i c e r ^ trying                     to control         the    crowd,       but       they

 wer e hav i ng no ef f e c t .

 I e ve nt u al l y got           through the       turnstiles a few minutes                     before       1500 hrs.

 I had a c o nv er sa ti on with a Police Officer                            just       inside      the G ro u nd and

 e x p l a i n e d how bad         the s i t u at io n was outside.                He said he         co4ld not

 communicate with anyone                    else    because       he did not have a radio,

 I do     not     recall         seeing any signs          directing me to the |/erraces.                           I

 wa lk e d    down the tunnel              that was opposite             the turnstiles.               I had a free

 passage along              the    tunnel,       except    for the       last quarter,              w hich    is where
                                                                             /
 I joined the             crowd waiting           to go onto the tferraces.

 As    I slowly m ov ed            forward,       the    crowd bec/me            more    intense.

 I e ve nt u al l y took           up a po sition         in P e n / 4 a few yards              to the       left of

 the    tunnel        near       to the    back of the terraces.                   The    pressure       of the

 crowd m oved me to the                   left.     There was          no free do m of movement.                    It was

 like     being       in a vice w hich was               being    s qu eezed       tighter and tighter.                    I

 could see          people        climbing       over    the fences at            the front and being

 lifted       into      the seating are a above.

                About     ten feet        in front      of    me,    there a p p e ar e d to be a        man being       held

                up.     The     people a ro un d him          were s truggling          to keep him on       his       feet.        I

                could only see            the    back   of    his head. I lost         sight       of this man as the

                pressure        of the      crowd kept        moving me to the          left.      It was    vej^y hot and

                difficult        to breathe.

                After     about        tenyfni nutes    I reached the fence            between P e n / 4 and 5.                I

                tried to        pull/myself         over but       I was    exhausted.      Another       supporter

                pulled me o y e r .            I wa lk ed    down the steps          towards    the front.

^    'V b ^ L   £11 the bottom           corner     of Pen 4 at the very f r o n t,              I saw a man      lying        on

-W              his   back.       He was a white man,               age d between 45 - 6 5.          H? was       of

                He was

                                                            not    breathing.

                I then      climbed through the gate at the front                        of Pen 3 onto           the    pitch.

                I was      e xh austed and         laid down on the           pitch for a few minutes.I                 sat up

                and    looked around and             I could see a lot of              people     on the

                pitch,      sitting and standing around.                      I saw a line        of Police       Officers

                across      the h a 1f way       1 in e .

                A Police        Officer a sk ed me           to move       to the    side of the     pitch.

                I m ov ed to the edge             of the goal area and               I saw a man sitting           on an

                a d v e rt i si n g    board    in front      of the N Stand.           He was     crying and a pp ea re d

                in distress.             I went     over     to him to see          if he was alright.            He was       in

                deep shock and hysterical.                        He told me how he had trodden on a man on

                the    terraces and he            c o u l d n ’t get off him.

                I went      over       to a Police      Officer       to see    if he    could help.         I explained

                to him what            had h ap pe ne d and about          the dead man         in the    pen.     F rom the

                c on ve rs a ti o n     1 had w it h him he a pp ea re d            totally unaware        that any

                f atalities           had occurred.          I then saw a young          girl     of about       14 - 16 who

                was    in the St.         Johns Ambulance;            she told me       to take the man           in shock
                                                                                                         PAGE          4
                                                                                                         S2027

to the First Aid              room.

I took       the man to a tea              bar at   the     back of the N Stand.                I    thought a

cup of tea w ould             calm him down.

The w o m a n      refused to serve me.              She     stated       that       the Police      had asked

her    to    close.        After an argument           she e ve nt u al l y gaye me two               cups   of

tea w hich         I paid for.                                                   /

Lying       to t he left          of the tea bar was          the    bod>/of a man;           he was wearing

a white T-shirt,              blue    jeans and training             s hypes. He had a towel             over

his    face and was           not    breathing.

I then went          into the N Stand and              I saw that          the time was         1547 hrs.          I

could see          people     being str et ch ed across             the    pitch.

This    seemed       to upset        the man       I was with more,          so I. took       him outside

the Ground.           We     left at about          1555 hrs.

I. w ou ld describe           the man       in shock as about 25 - 32 years                     old,    slender

build,       brown hair and moustache,                 grey jacket,          blue jeans;            he was   from

                    Liverpool.         1    did not get his name.

I wa lk ed him back               to his    minibus w hich was a short distance                       from   the

Ground.

1' w ou ld    like    to add that whe n             I was    in the       crowd outside         the Ground,

there was a loudspeaker a n no un ce me nt at about                          1450 hrs.

I cannot          recall     the exact words          bat    it told us that there was                  plenty

of    room    inside       the G r o u n d .   I think       it also       told us to queue            in an

o r de r ly fashion.              In view of the       s ituation outside               this a nn ou nc e me n t

served       no    purpose.

I have       indicated on a ground                 plan the    positions             of where   I saw the two

dead men,         ma rk ed    (1) and       (2).    The     ground    plan       is marked

(Exhibit N o .               ).

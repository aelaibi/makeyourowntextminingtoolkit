           - FLEET ENGINEER



At approximately 1645 hours on 15th April 1989 I was contacted by phone by
Control and asked to attend a major incident at Hillsborough, Sheffield. I
was informed that we had many out of town vehicles attending the above
incident parked at Herries Road Bus Garage. I also checked if the duty
fitter had also been contacted.

Upon arrival at the bus garage I checked with the L/A in charge. He told
me that no vehicles required assistance. Vehicles parked at the garage
were from SYMAS, WYMAS, Notts, Derby. Soon after Station Officer
         arrived to stand down the out of town vehicles. All SYMAS
vehicles were to go to Hillsborough Football ground. As there was a
Renault vehicle without a driver I was asked to drive this to the football
ground by |

Upon arrival at the ground I parked the vehicle up and made contact with Mr
D Jones. Again no vehicles needed attention. I carried out small tasks
like locking the major incident vehicle, shunting vehicles etc. By this
time the Duty Mechanic was on scene,            [ Mr Page, CMAO arrived and
informed me that his two tone horns were not working. This was checked and
a new fuse fitted. This was the only work to be carried out by myself and
the duty fitter that day. I was then informed by Mr Page to stand down and
return home, this was approximately 1900 hours.

With hindsight I feel I should have been contacted at an earlier stage,
allowing myself and the Duty Fitter to make our way to Workshops, as the
time when workshops staff are more likely to be needed is when the vehicles
are running, not after the incident is over when the vehicles are no longer
required. This would also allow greater access to vehicles and equipment
in workshops.

On my arrival at the Football Ground at approx 1 .55p® I made my way to the Police Room /
gynwhere I mealed and remained on standby.
At approximately 2,55pm I was engaged on prisoner escort duties together with D C ____
and         , 3 prisoners were transported to Ecclesfield P/Stn, fromwhere we returned

to the ^eppings iJane end of the ground.

On arrival at Leppings Lane end the time was approximately 3«10pm and as I entered

the enclosure I saw injured people leaving via the exit tunnel. Supporters were
 carrying out bodies, obviously dead. I made my way into the tunnel and made efforts
 to clear a path through   irate Liverpool supprters to allow further injured people to
 be carried out from the terrace. I then made my way into the terrace again trying to

 disperse Liverpool fans who were hurling abuse at the Police and blocking the exit of

 injured and dead fans. As the rear of the terrace started to clear I mad my way to
 the perimeter   fence and assisted in carrying the dead to the Police Gym# On returning
 from the gym I was directed to join other officers in forming a cordon acjsrosgthe pitch.
 From this duty ^ went into ^enistone Road to direct Notts F0rrest *ans as they were

 allowed out of the ground.

  over fencing to officers sat on top of fence. Also carried at least one out through
   tunnel at rear. Was subjected to abuse by fans, can give evidence of drunkeness

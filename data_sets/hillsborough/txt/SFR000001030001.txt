Dear Sir,

HOME OFFICE CIRCULAR No. 5/1986 - SAFETY OF SPORTS GROUNDS

As requested in Home'Office Circular No. 5/1986, I have
enclosed the proformas Annex C.   These have been completed
in respect of all premises within South Yorkshire and cover
undesignated outdoor sports stadia and grounds with stands
with a capacity for over 500 persons and indoor sport3
premises used to accommodate more than 500 spectators.
                               •
In completing the profpnna for the outdoor premises listed,
it should be appreciated that many of them will rarely
ever accommodate that number in practice.

 Dear Sir

 SAFETY OF SPORTS GROUNDS ACT 1975

 I attach for your information a copy of a letter dated 7 February 1986 to
 Doncaster Rovers Football Club in respect of the Rossington end of the
 ground.

 The Assistant Chief Constable (Operations) Mr W Jackson, has also asked
 if you would think it appropriate to have a meeting to discuss the
 'Popplewell Final Recommendations', inviting the Fire Service and perhaps
 legal representatives of the district councils.

 Yours faithfully




 S up erintendent

Dear Sir

I refer to your letter dated 21 January 1986 in respect of the
Rossington end of the ground.

As indicated b y the Safety of Sports Grounds Act Officer Working
Party in the minutes of the meeting dated 2 August 1985, public order
problems wi ll certainly be created if visiting supporters have to be
accorrmodated in any other part of the ground.  It was therefore felt
necessary, in addition to other ground improvements, to construct two
new pens at the Rossington end capable of securely holding 2000
visiting spectators.

Having regard to present segregation problems within the ground, it
is not possible to acconmodate more than 1000 visiting supporters
unless the second pen is to be provided.

Whilst there m ay be few occasions on which you could anticipate more than
1000 visiting supporters attending at present, I would not be able to
exceed this figure unless these further improvements are made at the
ground, thereby ensuring spectator segregation and safety.

Yours faithfully

Dea r Sir

SAFETY OF SPORTS GROUNDS ACT 1975: LOCAL GOVERNMENT REORGANISATION

1.   The purpose of this letter is to inform you of the effects on the Safety of ^       _
Sports Grounds Act 1975 (SSGA) of Local Government reorganisation in the Metropolitan
counties and Greater London brought about by the Local Government Act 1985.

2.   With effect from 1 April 1986 responsibility for administering the SSGA 1975 will,
in the Metropolitan counties and Greater London, transfer to the appropriate
Metropolitan District Council (MDC) or London Borough (the "successor” authorities).
They will be responsible for, among other things, the issue of and amendments to sa ety
certificates   A consequential effect of Local Government reorganisation is that the
current certificating authorities in the Metropolitan counties and Greater London are
not in the meantime empowered to issue or amend safety certificates for any perio
commencing on or after 1 April 1986.  Such certificates or amendments will fall oO be
issued by the successor authorities.  It is therefore in the interests of applicants
in these areas to ensure that applications for special safety certificates, or amendmen
to existing certificates, which are to come into effect on or after 1 April 1986 are
copied to the appropriate successor authority who should be kept informed of development
and progress so as to be in a position to assume responsibility for the case in questi
 with the minimum of delay and inconvenience.

                                                                      Yours faithfully

    SAFETY OF SPORTS GROUNDS ACT 1975

    PROCEDURE REGARDING APPLICATIONS FOR SPECIAL SAFETY CERTIFICATE


    1.    The regulations provide that any application for a safety certificate snail
    be made in the form contained in the Schedule to the Regulations or a for* to the
    like effect.     Part II of the form and its frontispiece should be completecin the

    case of applications for special safety certificates.    In any case where an
    application for a special safety certificate is not made by the holder of the
    general safety certificate, it should be accompanied by evidence of the appli­
    cant's status.     Details of any planned changes to the normal standing and seating
    arrangements for spectators should'be provided, together with such further
    information in support of the application as is considered necessary to enable
^   the local authority to discharge its functions under the Act.     However, it is
    open to a local authority, under section 3(*»> of the Act, to require, by notice
    in writing, any further information of this kind which they may think it
    necessary to have to enable them to determine the terms and conditions to be

    included in the special safety certificate.


    2.    A major difference in the grant of general and special safety certificates
    is that, once the local authority has determined that an applicant is a quali­

     fied person, the issue of a general safety certificate becomes mandatory,
    whereas the issue of a special safety certificate remains at its discretion.

    But an applicant has a right of appeal to the Secretary of State against a

     refusal (see following paragraphs for details).


0    3.    An application   for a special safety certificate should normally be made at

     least 3 months before the date of the proposed event, but a local authority has
     discretion to permit an application within a lesser period if it is satisfied

     that the procedures (including appeals procedures) required under the Act and
     Regulations can, in the particular case, be carried out within that lesser period

     eg when the applicant is known to be a qualified person.     On receipt of an
     application for a special safety certificate, the local authority must first
     determine whether the applicant is a qualified person, ie a person likely to be
     in a position to prevent contravention of the terms and conditions to be imposed
     in the certificate.     The local authority is required by regulation 5 to make
     this determination within 14 days of receiving the application.     There is a
     right of appeal against a determination by a local authority that an applicant

     is not a qualified person (see paragraph 9), and, under regulation 5, the
     applicant must be furnished with the reasons for such a determination.
4.   It next requires to be considered whether the application should be refused

on grounds other than that the applicant is not a qualified person.     This

decision must,   in accordance with regulation 6, be made within 28 days of the

receipt of the application, not only in cases where the local authority has

determined that the applicant is a qualified person but also in those where

it has determined that he is not and an appeal has been lodged and remains to

be considered.    There is also a right of appeal against a refusal on grounds

other than a determination that the applicant is not a qualified person (see

paragraph 9).    In the event of such a refusal, therefore, the local authority is

again re quired, under regulation 6, to give the applicant the reasons for its

decision.


5.   When the first 2 stages have been completed, should it have been decided

that a special safety certificate should be issued, the local authority in

metropolitan counties and Greater London (from 1 April 1986) is required, by

section 3(3) of the Act, to send a copy of the application to the Chief Officer

of Police and to the fire authority and to consult them about the terms and

conditions to be included in the certificate.     Elsewhere in England and Wales

the local authority must send a copy to, and consult with,    the Chief Officer of

Police and the building authority.     The special safety certificate must,    in

accordance with regulation 6(2), then be issued not less than 28 days before

the proposed event is due to take place.


6.   The form and content of a special safety certificate is likely to vary

according to the circumstances of each individual case and a standard form of

certificate would not be appropriate.     (In suitable cases, however, regard may

be had to the guide lines set out in the Guide to Safety at Sports Grounds

 (Football) on the basis indicated in paragraph 3 of the paper relating to the

"Procedure Regarding Applications for General Safety Certificates".)     Any

special safety certificate must, however, contain full details of the terms

and conditions imposed,    including in particular the matters referred to in

section 2(2) of the Act, and as required by section 2(4) should be framed where

appropriate by reference to the plan attached to the general safety cartificate.



7.   Once a special safety certificate has been issued, subject to the deter­

mination of any appeal, the terms and conditions can be varied only by formal

amendment of the certificate.     This may be on the application of the holder of

the certificate or at the discretion of the local authority (see section 4(2)
of the Act).     This seems an unlikely eventuality in the case of a special safety
certificate, otherwise than in the exceptional case where the certificate has

been issued well in advance of the event to which it relates.     Any such amend­

ment must, however, be publicised as in paragraph 10 below.


8.     Considerations of time render the transfer of a special safety certificate

to another person an equally unlikely contingency.    Any possible difficulties

in this connection are likely to be obviated, -however, if the holder of the

general safety certificate applies for the special certificate.     Nevertheless,

should an application for transfer be made, the local authority must decide

within 14 days if the proposed transferee is a qualified person and, if it

decides to the contrary, the procedure laid down in the regulations relating

to giving notice of, and the reasons for, the determination will apply, as will

the appropriate appeals procedure, should the need arise.     In the case of an

application for transfer before a special safety certificate has actually been

issued, there is no reason why the local authority should not treat the applica­

tion in all respects as a new application in the terms of the original and pro­

cess it from the point already reached.


9.     Reference has already been made to the rights of appeal against a deter­

mination that the applicant is not a qualified person (paragraph 3) and against

the refusal of an application on other grounds   (paragraph 4).   In addition the

Act provides (in section 5(3))& right of appeal to any "interested party

against the inclusion of anything in or the omission of anything from a safety

certificate or against a refusal to amend or replace a safety certificate.

The regulations provide that, in the case of a special safety certificate, nouice

of any such appeal shall be given within 7 days following receipt of a notice

of the local authority's decision, or, in the case of persons who are not

notified, the publication by the local authority of the decision in a newspaper

circulating in the locality.


 10.   As in the case of a general safety certificate, regulation 7 requires a

local authority, on issuing or amending a safety certificate or refusing so

to amend it, to give notice to certain specified "interested parties" and also

 to advertise its action in the press.    A similar obligation falls on an appellant

 (under regulation 8(7)) to advertise his intention to appeal, and a person wish­

 ing to appear before a person appointed by the Secretary of State under section

 5(4) of the Act is required to give notice within 7 days of such advertisement.

 (The reasons underlying these requirements are set out in paragraph 11 of the
 paper relating to the   'Procedure Regarding Applications for General Safety

 Certificates'.)
11.    Any appellant is required      (by regulation 8(5)) to give the local authority

notice of a p p e a l ,   accompanied by the relevant documents appertaining to the

appeal.    It will then be for the local authority, in accordance with regulation

8(9), to inform the Secretary of State in writing within 7 days whether it

wishes to oppose the appeal.         With any such notice, the local authority is

required to submit its reasons and any relevant supporting documents and to

■state'Whether it wishes a hearing under section S(A) of the Act.        (The pro­

cedure governing the conduct of all such hearings is set out in regulation 10.)



 12.   It is also open to the Secretary of State, if he considers it necessary,

to order a public inquiry under section 5(6) of the Act in relation to any

appeal.     In such a case, the procedure to be followed is laid down in

 regulation 12.



 13.   It would be helpful if local authorities could continue the existing

 practice of copying to the Home Office any special safety certificates issued.

SAFETY OF SPORTS GROUNDS ACT 1975

PROCEDURE REGARDING APPLICATIONS FOR GENERAL SAFETY CERTIFICATES


1.   The Safety of Sports Grounds Regulations 1976 provide that any application

for a safety certificate shall be made in the form contained in the Schedule to

the Regulations or a form to the like effect.    An application should be accompanied

by detailed information as to the structure, capacity, etc of the stadium, includ­

ing plans of the stadium, certificates relating to the testing of crush barriers

and evidence of the applicant's status.     It is, however, open to a local authority,

under section 3(4) of the Act, to require, by notice in writing, such further

information of this kind as it may consider necessary to enable it to determine

the terms and conditions to be included in the certificate.


2.   On receipt of an application for a general safety certificate,    the local

authority must first determine whether the applicant is a qualified person, le a

person likely to be in a position to prevent contravention of the terms and con­

ditions to be imposed in the certificate.     If it considers him to be such a person

the authority is then under a duty to issue a general safety certificate to him.

In the case of a general safety certificate, where considerations of time are not

paramount, the regulations impose no specific time limit for such a determination.

In any event, it seems prima facie unlikely that an application for a general

safety certificate would be made by an unqualified person.     There is, however, a

right of appeal against a determination by a local authority that an applicant is

not a qualified person (see paragraph 10).


3.   In Metropolitan counties and Greater London (from 1 April 1986) the local

authority is required, by section 3(3) o f ;the Act, to send a copy of any appli­

cation for a safety certificate (general or special) to the appropriate Chief

Officer of Police and the fire authority, and must consult them about the terms

and conditions to be included in the certificate.     Elsewhere in England and Wales

 the local authority must send a copy to and consult with the Chief Officer oi

 Police and the building authority.    In framing such conditions, local authorities

 will no doubt wish to keep in mind the principles or guide lines set out in the

 Guide to Safety at Sports Grounds.    In this connection local authorities are

 reminded that, this non-statutory document is not a set of requirements to be

 rigidly applied regardless of individual circumstances.     The maximum flexibility

 should be maintained to take account of the different circumstances of individual

 grounds deriving from differences in such matters as age, size and mode of con­

 struction.   In this regard,   it should also be noted that the Act provides that the
terms and conditions should be such as "necessary or expedient to secure reason­

able safety" and it would be unreasonable, even if it were practicable,    to seek

the absolute safety of everyone attending the sports stadium.



4.   It is envisaged that there will be a good deal of consultation between the

local authority and the stadium representatives in the process of drawing up the

certificate conditions.    In this way, if evidence is advanced that a ground is

rarely filled to capacity,   tl-Si local authority may consider it proper to base its

requirements on actual levels of attendance over a given period rather than on

maximum capacity.    On the rare occasions on which a capacity crowd could be

expected, separate provision might be made for this contingency on the lines

indicated in paragraph 7 below.     Again, if a stand were found to be structurally

weak, the local authority might,    in consultation with the stadium representatives,

offer the choice of having any necessary remedial works carried out or of restrict­

ing admission to the stand until it had been strengthened.



5.   As will be apparent from the foregoing paragraphs,    the form and content of a

safety certificate is likely to vary according to the circumstances of the indivi­

dual case.    Accordingly, a standard form of certificate would not be appropriate.

It must however contain full details of the terms and conditions imposed including,

in particular,   the matters referred to in section 2(2) of the Act and have annexed

to it a plan of the stadium by reference to which the terms and conditions will be

framed.    The certificate when first issued may contain restrictive conditions which

can then be relaxed or deleted by amendment of the certificate.     The local

authority may find it convenient to list, in a covering letter to the certificate,

such modifications as will be subsequently permitted, eg in the form of a state­

ment of the increased spectator capacities.-■ to-be allowed for the separate sections

of the ground when the various stages of any future .works programme

agreed with the stadium authorities are''completed.    This arrangement , by

'excluding- from the certificate itself proposed conditions which would
apply only to future works, should serve to obviate confusion.     At the same time,

however, care must be taken not to exclude from the certificate any restriction

germane to current conditions,    since section 5(3) of the Act provides for an

interested party to appeal to the Secretary of State against the inclusion of

anything     in, or the omission of anything from, a safety certificate, and these

rights must not be prejudiced in any way in consequence of the form of the

c ertificate.
6.     As regards the scope of a general safety certificate, section 2(5) of the

Act provides that different terms and conditions may be included for different

activities.          Although, therefore, a stadium may be in regular use only as a foot­

ball ground,         in cases where it is also used from time to time to stage other

events it would be desirable, and in many cases obviate the need for special

safety certificates,         if the terms and conditions appropriate to those events were

to be included in the general certificate.          It is suggested that any such events

for which it is considered desirable to provide might conveniently be divided into

2 c l a s s e s :-


        1.      those sufficiently similar in character to the main purpose of the

        stadium for the normal terms and conditions to be equally applicable;



        2.      those of a fundamentally different character, eg boxing matches, pop

        c on c e r t s , etc which may involve all or part of the playing area being given

        over to       spectator accommodation and for which separate terms and conditions

        will have to be devised.       It is not, of course, necessary to provide for

        these contingencies in cases where no clear need is foreseen by the stadium

        authorities.


7.      There may also be circumstances in which the terms and conditions applicable

to the normal activity of the stadium may be found to be inappropriate, eg when a

special event, such as a cup tie or a "local Derby", is expected vo attract signi­

ficantly more than the usual attendance.          In the case especially of cup re plays

these special events may arise with only a few days' notice, within which it would

not be possible to accommodate the whole of the statutory procedure appropriate to

the grant of a special safety certificate.          In order to overcome this difficulty,

it would seem desirable for the local authorities and stadium authorities to seek

to work out in advance the modifications to the normal terms and conditions which

might be appropriate to such occasions, eg the admission of increased numbers to

certain areas on the condition that extra stewards and police are employed,            that

notice is given to the local authority, and so on, and to provide for their

 incorporation in the general safety certificate.


 8.      Once a general safety certificate has been issued, subject to the determina­

 tion of any appeal,         the terms and conditions can be varied only by formal amend­

 ment of the certificate, which may be at the initiative either of the holder of

 the certificate or of the local authority (see section 4(2) of the Act) and will

 presumably reflect changes in circumstances occurring since the grant of the
original certificate.    It will thus be to the mutual benefit of local authorities

and clubs/stadium authorities for a close liaison to be maintained after the

issue of the certificate and certainly while any further works of safety measures

are being carried out.    It is likely to be in the stadium operators'     financial

interest to get the safety certificate amended as soon as possible after work

has been completed, and they should accordingly ensure that the local authority

is kept informed of progress.      For    its part the local authority will no doubt

wish to co-operate by arranging matters s® that, following completion of the

work, the certificate can be amended without delay.



9.    After a certificate has been granted, an application may be made for the

transfer of the certificate to another person.        Similarly, while a local

authority is considering an application for a certificate and before the certifi­

cate has been granted, it may be asked to substitute some person other than the

original applicant as the person to whom the certificate should be granted.         These

are, however,   likely to be rare occurrences in the case of general safety certifi­

cates, where an application will normally be made on behalf of a club or a stadium

organisation by an authorised official of the club or representative of the

organisation.    However, if it does happen, the local authority will be required in

both cases to determine whether the substituted nominee is a qualified person.

Thereafter,   in the first case,   the procedure laid down in the regulations to

giving notice of, and the reasons for, the determination will.apply together with

any necessary appeals procedure.         In the second case, there is no reason why the

local authority should not treat the application in all respects as a new applica­

tion in the terms of the original one and process it from the point it had already

reached.


10.   In addition to the right of appeal by an applicant for a general safety

certificate against the determination that he is not a qualified person (see

paragraph 2 above), which, of course, applies also in the case of a proposed

transfer of a certificate,   the Act provides a further right of- appeal to any

"interested party"   (which term includes the holder of the safety certificate)

against the inclusion of anything in or the omission of anything from a safety

certificate or against a refusal to amend or replace a safety certificate.         The

regulations provide that, in the case of a general safety certificate, notice of

any such appeal shall be given within 28 days following receipt of a notice of

the local authority's decision, or, in the case of persons who are not notified,

the publication by the local authority of its decision in a newspaper circulating

in the locality.
11.    In this connection, Regulation 7 requires a local authority, on issuing or

amending a safety certificate or refusing to do so, to give notice to certain

specified "interested parties" and also to advertise their action in the press.

It is regretted that it has been necessary to incur the trouble and expense of

advertising, but, since Section 5(5) of the Act is not specific in the definition

which it provides of "interested p a r t y " , no other means could be found of ensuring

that all persons who might validly claim to be "interested parties" within the

meaning of the Act should be able to a c q u a i n t :themselves with the local authority's

decision, and failure to bring the decision to their notice could result in a

denial of their rights of appeal or of a hearing by the Secretary of State.         For

the same reason a similar obligation has been imposed on an appellant (by

Regulation 8(7)) to advertise his intention to appeal, and a person wishing to

appear before a person appointed by the Secretary of State under Section 5(4) of

the Act is required to give notice within 28 days of such advertisement.



12.    Any appellant is required (by Regulation 8(5)) to give the local authority

notice of appeal, accompanied by the relevant documents appertaining to the

appeal.    It will then be for the local authority,    in accordance with Regulation

8(9), to inform the Secretary of State in writing within 28 days whether it

wishes to oppose the appeal.     With any such notice, the local authority is

required to submit its reasons and any relevant supporting documents and to state

whether it wishes a hearing under Section 5        of the Act.   (The procedure govern­

ing the conduct of all such hearings is set out in Regulation 10.)



13.    It is also open to the Secretary of State, if he considers it necessary, to

order a public inquiry under Section 5(6) of the Act in relation to any appeal.

In such a case, the procedure to be followed is laid down in Regulation 12.

 14.   It would be helpful if local authorities could continue the existing

 practice of copying to'the Home Office newly issued or amended safety certificates
                                                                  ANNEX B




SAFETY OF SPORTS GROUNDS ACT 1975

Background

Wheatley Report

1.    The terms of the Inquiry extended to sports grounds generally but because the

immediate concern at the time related to soccer grounds, its Report concentrated

■on crowd safety in such grounds, and included Rugby Union and Rugby League grounds.

Lord Wheatley had no doubt, that the then existing controls over safety at

football grounds were inadequate.     He found that the voluntary system of certifi­

cation of grounds introduced by the Football Association some years previously laid

down no requirements as to the competence of persons who carried out the annual

inspections of grounds and there were no guidelines to assist those persons in

their assessment of safety standards.      Moreover, a review of the statutory provisions

relevant to the safety of spectators at football grounds convinced Lord Wheatley

that the law also fell short of providing proper and effective control over

football grounds as a whole.      The building regulations,   for example, provide for

the basic structural safety of new buildings within a football ground but they do
                                                                   not apply to existing

buildings, except where alterations are to be carried out, nor do they apply to a

ground as a whole.   In any case, most football grounds were built before national

building regulations were introduced.



2.    Lord Wheatley concluded that only a specially devised statutory scheme could

ensure comprehensive controls at football grounds in the interests of safety and he

recommended a statutory licensing system.      He proposed that these controls should

 be introduced by stages, the larger or more important grounds, broadly speaking,

 being dealt with first.   Lord Wheatley also recommended that there should be a

 right of appeal for the clubs concerned against any decision of the licensing

authority.   The Report showed Lord Wheatley's awareness of the need to reconcile

 the paramount aim of ensuring the safety of spectators with what would be reasonable

 and practicable for the clubs.



 3-   Lord Wheatley also provided, as a technical appendix to his report, guidelines

 to safety standards at football grounds designed to assist the local authorities

 in their task of enforcement.
Consultations on the Report

4.   When the Report was published, those bodies mainly concerned,     including the

local authority associations and the football authorities, were consulted about

Lord Wheatley's proposals.    The football authorities made it clear that they were

apprehensive at the financial implications for the clubs, but there was general

agreement with the proposals themselves.    Detailed consultations were held on the

guidelines contained in the technical appendix to the Report and these, duly

amended, were finally published by the Home Departments in November 1973 as a

special booklet,   "Guide to Safety at Sports Grounds".    It was revised in 1975

in the light of practical experience of its application and specifically targeted

on football grounds*



Guide to Safety at Sports Grounds   (Football)

5.   The Guide to Safety at Sports Grounds has no statutory force.       Its primary

purpose is to set out principles or guidelines which the local authorities will

no doubt wish to keep in mind in enforcing the Act.       The Guide therefore deals

with matters such as the provision of adequate entrances and exits, means of

escape, the slope of terracing, the strength and siting of crush barriers, the

construction of staircases, and measures to ensure the safe movement of spectators

both under normal and emergency conditions.      The Guide is not a set of requirements

to be rigidly applied, regardless of individual circumstances.       As Lord Wheatley

recognised, it is important to maintain the maximum flexibility in any system of

control so as to take account of the differing circumstances at individual grounds:

factors such as age, size and mode of construction differ widely from ground to

ground.



6.   While the basic principles set out in the Guide are relevant to all sports

stadia, modifications may well be necessary where sports other than football are

involved.



General Approach to the Act

7.   The main instrument of control under the Act is the safety certificate issued by

the local authority.    A safety certificate is needed in respect of every stadium

which is the subject of a designation order, made by the Secretary of State.          The

certificate enables the local authority to impose such terms and conditions as

are necessary to ensure a reasonable standard of safety at the stadium in question.
8.    The approach to designation was based on a phased programme so that the more

important grounds regularly attracting the largest attendances were dealt with

first.     The international stadia at which soccer and Rugby Union were played plus

stadia used by soccer clubs in Division 1 of the Football League were designated

in 1976.     This ;was followed in 1979 by designation of stadia of clubs in

Division 2 of the League and thereafter on promotion of a club to Division 2.

Following the     fire   at Bradford City FC in May 1935 all the remaining stadia

liable to designation used by clubs in Divisions 3 ana H ol the Football League,

and qualifying stadia of clubs in Division 1 and 2 of ths Rugby League were

designated.



Substance of the Act

9.    The first 5 sections establish the main system of control under the Act, that

is to say, the safety certificate,     issued by the local authority for the area in

which the stadium is situated, which is required for every sports stadium desig­

nated for that purpose by order of the Secretary of State.



10.   Section 1 empowers the Secretary of State by order to designate any sports

stadium having accommodation for more than 10,000 spectators as requiring a

safety certificate.      Safety certificates are of two kinds, general and special.

A general safety certificate is the main continuing form of control and is issued

for an indefinite period in respect of a specified activity or activities

regularly taking place at the stadium.      A special safety certificate may be issued

at the discretion of the local authority for a special event or other circumstances

not covered by the general safety certificate.      Such an event might be an evangel­

istic rally which might call for special arrangements if, for example, seating were

provided for the congregation on the playing area.      A special safety certificate

can be issued only in respect of a sports stadium for which a general safety

certificate is already in force.


11.      The contents of safety certificates are dealt with in section 2 .   The local

authority is empowered to include in the certificate such terms and conditions as

are necessary to secure, at the stadium in question, a reasonable degree of safety.

Without prejudice to this general power,     the section requires certificates to contain

terms and conditions relating to major matters such as entrances and exits, means of

escape in emergency, the number, strength and situation of crush barriers, and the

maximum number of spectators who may be admitted to the stadium or any part of it.

To remove any possibility of doubt, sub-section (3) makes it clear that a certificate

may include a condition relating to the keeping of records relating to attendance and

the maintenance of safety.
12.   An earlier Bill,   introduced in 1973, limited the terms and conditions

imposed under a safety certificate to what was necessary to secure a reasonable

degree for'taembers of the public."    There was some difficulty over this term

because it might have excluded,    for example, members of supporters' clubs.      This

particular problem was by the definition of "spectator" in section 17> that is,

any person occupying accommodation provided for spectators.       On the other hand,

it seemed    right that all the peole present on the occasion of a match or other

activity for which a ground has a certificate should be taken into account for the

purpose of the safety certificate,     for example, people using a squash court or

other facilities at the ground.      Accordingly, the general power of the local

authority under section 2 ( 1 ) to include in a safety certificate such terms or

conditions as are necessary omits any reference to people and speaks only of

securing "reasonable safety at the stadium",      (although the terms "safety", as

defined in section 17, does not include danger arising from participation in a

sport).     Certain provisions must, however,   be specifically linked with spectators

(who are, after all, the people the Act is mainly designed to protect and who will

be greatly in the ma jority).     Thus section 2 ( 2 ) requires the certificate to state

the maximum number of spectators who may be admitted.




13-   Section 3 sets out the broad procedure to be followed when a local authority

receives an application for a safety certificate.       It requires them to determine

whether an applicant is, in their opinion, a qualified person,       ie a person likely

to be in a position to prevent contravention of the terms and conditions imposed

in the certificate.      If so, they are then under a duty to issue a general safety

certificate to him.      In this respect, the general safety certificate is different

from the fire certificate issued under the Fire Precautions Act 1971:        the latter

is issued only after necessary safety works have been completed, whilst the

safety certificate under this Act can be issued almost from the outset, and is an

instrument of continuing control.      The issue of a special safety certificate,

however,    is left to the discretion of the local authority, as already explained,

because only they can judge .whether it is appropriate to issue it for the special

occasion in question.



14.   In Metropolitan Counties and Greater London (from 1 April 1986) the local

authority is required to send a copy of any application for a certificate to the

police and the Fire Authority, and must consult them about the terms and conditions
to be included in the certificate.     Elsewhere a copy must be sent to, and

consultation take place with,    the police and the Building Authority.    The need

for such consultation is self-evident:      there must be close co-ordination of the

interests of the different authorities directly concerned with different aspects

of safety at football grounds.



15.   Section 4 provides for the amendment, replacement,    transfer, surrender and

cancellation of safety Certificates.     It is of primary importance that a local

authority should have power to amend a safety certificate where it appears

appropriate for them to do so, for example,     if they find in the course of a

routine inspection that a part of a ground has become so dangerous as to demand an

immediate restriction on its use or some other necessary safeguard.       Again, they

must have power to relax a requirement where,     for example, certain improvements

have been carried out to make this possible.



16.   Section 5 provides for appeals by interested parties against decisions or

requirements of the local authority in connection with safety certificates.         Appeals

lie to the Secretary of State, who has power to set up a formal inquiry.



17.   Section 6 ( 2 ) empowers the Secretary of State to make regulations relating to

the safety of spectators at sports grounds.      This is in the nature of a reserve

power which could be used,   for example,   to give backing to requirements of the

local authorities which in the l'ght of experience had-been shown to be essential.

This section also empowers the Secretary of State to make regulations for various

other purposes connected with the Act.      To date no regulations have been made

under this sub-section.



18.   Section 7 provides for some supplementary matters on determinations and

appeals. Sub-sections (1) and (2) provide for the deemed withdrawal of an applica­

tion for, or the surrender of, a safety certificate when a local authority

determines that a person is not, or has ceased to be, qualified to hold it.         The

section also provides for the suspension of a condition in a certificate pending

determination of an appeal against the inclusion of that condition, although a

court, on the application of the local authority, may order that such a condition

remain in force pending the determination of the appeal.
19.   The holder of a general safety certificate is required by section 8 to
notify the local authority of any proposed alteration or extension of a stadium.

The purpose of the clause is to guard against any alterations being made, without

the local authority's knowledge, which might affect the safety of spectators.



20.   Section 9 provides for the harmonisation of the Act with other legislation

which may affect sports stadia.


21.   Section 10 is an important power which authorities should not feel inhibited

from using where the danger to spectators are such that use of the ground, or part

of it, should be prohibited or restricted.    Should a magistrates' court, on the

application of a local authority,   consider that the risk to spectators at any

sports ground is so great that their admission should be prohibited or restricted

until remedial action has been taken,    the court may make an order accordingly.

This power applies to any sports stadium or ground, whether or not it is designated

as requiring a safety certificate.    Where a general or special safety certificate

is in force, local authorities may prefer to remedy an unsatisfactory situation

by amending the certificate,    in cases where there is sufficient time to do so.

In respect of sports grounds and the smaller stadia, consultations between the

local authority and the club would usually be expected to secure, on a voluntary

basis, a reasonable standard of safety; however, where management appears to be

unwilling to undertake the necessary measures or is slow to act on advice,      this

additional power can be used.



22.   Section 11 confers rights of entry and inspection on persons appointed by the

local authority and others involved in the task of ensuring crowd safety at sports

grounds.   Section 12 deals with offences and penalties.



23-   Section 13 deals mainly with civil liability.     Its purpose is to make clear

that while nothing in the Act itself confers a right of action in respect of a

contravention of regulations or of conditions in a safety certificate,      the existing

rights of a spectator injured at a football stadium to bring an action for negli­

gence against the occupiers is entirely unaffected by anything in the Act.



24.   The Secretary of State is empowered by section 15 to extend to classes of

sports grounds other than sports stadia such provisions of the Act as are not

already expressed to apply to them.     For example,   it enables the Secretary of

State by order to extend the safety certificate procedure to such places as
race-courses.   Only a class of sports ground may be the subject of an extension

order under this clause:   an individual sports ground (other than a stadium)

cannot be designated until section 1 of the Act has been applied by an order

under section 15 to the class of sports ground to which it belongs.     To date,

the powers under this section have not been used.



25.   Section 16 applies the Act, subject to necessary modifications,   to the

Crown.   Section 17 deals with interpretation.


26.   Section 18 provides that orders and regulations, except commencement orders,

made under the Act are subject to the negative resolution procedure.     It also

imposes a duty on the Secretary of State,   before making any orders or regulations,

except commencement orders or orders relating to the Isles of Scilly, to consult

with such persons as appear to him requisite.

I nt ro duction

1.     HOC 54/85 and 5/1986 wer e copied to Chief E xecutives of
M e tr o po l it a n D is tr i ct Councils and London Boroughs in view of the
forthc om in g t ra nsfer to them of r es po ns i bi l it y in the M et ropolitan
c ou nties and G r ea te r London for the a dm i ni s tr a ti o n of the Safety of
Sports Grounds Act 1975 (SSGA).                    The purpose of this circular is to
advise successor a ut h or i ti e s of the changes to the SSGA brought
about by the Local G ov er n me n t Act 1985 (LGA) and to give guidance
on d is c ha r gi n g these r e s p o n s i b i l i t i e s . It is not intended to affect
any internal or locally agreed a r ra ng em en ts w hich may be in train to
ensure that all those who h ave an interest in s ec ur in g safety at
sports grounds are fully c o n s u l t e d .

    2.  The SSGA gave effect to the main r e co mm en da ti on s contained in
    the Report of the Inquiry into Crowd Safety at Sports Grounds which
    was prepared by Lord W h e a tl e y fol lo wi ng the serious accident at
    Ibrox Park Football Ground in 1971.

    3.     The main p ro vi s io n s             of the Act are:

           a.   A power, e x er ci sa bl e by the Secretary of State, to
           d esignate sports st ad ia w ith a c ap acity for more than
           10,000 s pe ct ators. Once designated, a stadium will require
           a safety c er t if i ca t e from the local authority.

           b.  An o b l ig a ti o n on the local a u th or it y                      to issue such
           certificates.
E.R.
                 c.   A d is cr e ti o n for the local aut ho ri ty to set terms
                 and cond it io ns under the c ertificate w it h the object
                 of s e c u ri n g a r easonable degree of safety for spectators.
                 Safety c er ti fi c at e s are of 2 kinds - firstly, the general
                 safety c e rt if ic at e (the main form of control) and,
                 secondly, the special safety certif ic at e (for occasions
                 or a c t iv i ti e s not covered by the general c er tificate).

                 d.      A right of appeal to the Secretary of State, in
                 r el at io n to the issue of safety cert if ic at es and their
                 contents, the procedure for which is set out in
                 r e g u l at i on s made under s.6(1) of the Act.

                 e.     Rights of various i nterested bodies (police, b ui ld in g
                 a ut h or i ti e s or, in the Met ro po li ta n county areas after
                 "abolition", fire a ut ho rities) to consultation, access to
                 g ro u nd s and inform at io n and to the appe al s procedure.

                 f.   An eme rg en cy pro ce du re for           r es t ri c ti n g the a d mi ss io n
                 of s p ec t a t o r s to a w ider range         of sports grounds than
                 those to w hi ch the de si gn at io n           p rovisions apply, if the
                 risk to s pe ct at or s is seen (by             the courts) as just if yi ng
                 this .

                 g.     Powers of entry and i nspection to sports grounds;
                 and    p r es c r i b e d penalties for offences under the Act.

       A sports ground is, broadly speaking, any p lace w here sports or
       other c o m p e t i t i v e a c ti vi ti es take place in the open air and where
       a c c o m m o d a t i o n has been provided for                spectators.         A sports sta d iu m is
       a sports gr o un d w h er e              a cc om m od a ti o n for s pe ct a to r s w ho ll y or
       s u b s t a n t i a l l y s ur r ou n ds the area used for the a c ti vi ti es taking
       place therein.

       of Schedule 8 of the LGA, is that in Metr op ol it an counties and
       Greater London, w he re the "building authority" and "local authority
       are synonymous, the local a u th or it y is not required to refer Safety
       certificate app li ca ti on s to the b u i l di n g au th or it y or consuls it
       about the terms and cond it io ns of a certificate.              Similarly the
       b u i ld i ng a uthority in these areas does not have the status of
       "interested party" and has no need of the right to a ut horise en-ry^
       and insp ec ti on of a sports ground because these powers are vested m
       it as the local authority.

       7     An a dditional change brought a bout by p ar agraph 7(1) affects the
       role and status of the Fire Aut ho ri ty in Greater London ana the
       Me tr op o li t an counties.       The converse of p aragraph 6„ applies in ^ ^
       respect of the Fire A uthor ity which, from 1 April 1986, has the s^a^us
       of "interested party" in M e t r o p ol i ta n counties and Greater London.
       In these areas the local au th or it y is required to refer safety           ^
       c e rt if ic at e app li ca ti on s to the Fire Authority and consult it abouo
       the terms and conditions of a safety certificate; and the Fire
       Aut ho ri ty will have the right to a uthorise entry and inspection o
       a sports ground.          The reas on for these changes is that the newly
       constituted fire a u t h o ri t ie s will not (as in the past) be the same
       as the local authority.

       Tr an sitional Arrangements

       8.     Under article 2 of the Local Gover nm en t R e or ga ni sa ti on (Transitional
       Provisions) Order 1985 (SI 1985 No 1781), London Borough Councils and
       M e tr o po l it a n District Councils will acquire certain anticipatory powers
       in c lu d in g powers in resp ec t of safety certificates for sports grounds.
       The p rovisions of SI 1985/1781 wer e explained in DOE circular LGA(L)
       (DOE) 13/LGA(MC)(D0E)16 of 26 N ov em be r 1985.           The Secretary of State
       takes the view that M e tr o p o l i t a n County Councils and the GLC are not
       empowered to issue new safety c er ti ficates or amend e xi sting safety
       c e rt if ic at es to take effect on or after 1 April 1986: SI 1985/1781
       therefore allows s u cc es so r au th or it ie s to consider, before 1 April,
       a pp li ca ti on s for c er ti fi c at e s to come into effect on or after 1 April.
       Su c ce s so r .a u th o ri t ie s will therefore wish to ensure that they are kept
       informed of the progress of safety certificate app li ca ti on s or a m e n d ­
       ments to exist in g c e rt if ic at es now under consid er at io n by the M e t ro ­
       poli ta n County Councils or GLC. Much of this i nf or mation will a u t o ­
       ma t ic a ll y h ave come to suc ce ss or authorities in their present role as
       b ui l d i n g author it ie s but they may nonetheless wis h to establish
       e arly contact with the current 'certificating' aut ho ri ty to ensure a
       smooth transfer of r es po ns i bi l it y from 1 April 1986 with ou t impairing
       the safety cover afforded by the c er ti fi ca ti on process. In this
       cont ex t s uccessor a u th o ri ti es will no doubt wish to bear in mind
       that app li ca ti on s for special sa fe ty certificates for events on or
       after 1 April 1986 may require adva nc e consi de ra ti on if a certificate
       is to be issued in time. Similarly, successor a ut ho ri ti es will doubtles
       w is h to be a cquainted wit h any other action or i nitiatives currently
       in hand by the pres en t c e r t i f i c at i ng authority in respect of sports
       grounds in their area.
G u i dance   to the SSGA proc ed ur es

9.     A copy of the SSGA and the Regulations (Statutory Instrument^
1263 1976) are enclosed with this circular.                  A detailed d es cr ip ti on
of the Act and its p r o vi s io n s is ccntained at Annex B.           The R e g u ­

safety ce r t i f ic at e a p p l i c at i on s and appeals.  These same r eg ul at io ns
also empower local a u t h o r i t i e s to d etermine fees in respect of
a pp l i c a t i o n s for the issue or ame nd me nt of safety c e r t i f i c a t e s . A
guide to the p ro c ed u re for the issue of a general safety ce rt if ic at e

10.      The f o llowing points are h i g h l i g h te d as b ei ng of p ar ti c ul a r
p ot e n t i a l interest to local authorities:

      a.     Procedure u nd e r s . 10.    Paragraph 21 of Annex B refers.
      A ut h o rities may w ish to note that this procedure can be
      a ppl i e d to all sports grounds wi th in the meaning of the Act,
      not just to stadia.            It is h oped that authorities w ill not
      feel inhibited from i n v o k in g the procedure, as necessary,
      w he r e they p e r c e i v e the risks to be such that urgent ac ti on
      is required to p r o v i de r ea so na bl e safety for spectators.

      b.      The Guide to Sa fe ty at Sports Grounds (Football) (The
      G reen Guide).           A t t e n t io n is drawn to paragraphs 5 and 6 of
      A nnex B and p a r a g r a p h 3 of Annex C.           Authorities will no
      d oubt bear in mind the c on tents of p aragraph 4 of HOC 54/1985
      d e a l i n g with a c t i on on the Interim Report of the Inquiry
      contains a d d i t i o n a l r ec om m en d at i on s on the content and

      as possible.            In the m ea nt im e the e x i s ti n g guide, a copy of

SAFETY OF SP O R T S GROUNDS: C OM M IT T EE OF INQUIRY INTO CROWD SAFETY
AND CONTROL AT SPO R T S GROUNDS: F INAL REPORT (CMND        9710   )

The Final Report of the Com mi tt ee of Inquiry set up by the Home
S e c r e t a r y and the S e cr et ar y of State for Scotland fol lo wi ng the
events of 1.1 May 1985 at B ra df or d City FC and B i r m i n g h a m City FC
has now been p ublished.             The p u r p o s e of this c ir cular is, first,
to inform r ec ip ie nt s of the r e c o m m e n da t io n s contained in the Final
Report and the G ov er n me n t ' s r e s p on s e to them; and, secondly, to
seek the a ss is t an c e and c o op e r a t i o n of local a ut ho ri ti es and chief
fire o ff ic er s with a view to i n t r o d u c i n g new safety m ea su r es in line
with the Report's r ec om me nd at io ns .

Final Report        of the C ommittee of Inquiry

2.    The Final Report amends and e x pa nd s upon the r e co m me nd at io ns
contained in the I nq uiry's I n t e r i m Report (Cmnd 9585) p ub lish ed last
July.      It s tr esses the need for i mp roved safety to be effected
u rg en tl y and draws a t te nt io n to the additional hazards posed by
crowd v i o l en c e at some s p o r ti n g events.  These qu es ti on s are subject
to s ep ar a te conside ra ti on : this c ir cu la r is concerned h ow e ve r with
safety m a t t er s only.
3.     Attached at             Annex A is a list of the r e co m me nd at io ns of the
Final Report.              They s up pl em en t those contained in the Interim
Report and s u p e r ce d e the p ro v is i on a l r ec om m en d at i on s it contained.
At Annex P is a copy of the Home S e cr e t a r y ' s oral s t at em en t to
P ar l i a m e n t r e s p o n d i n g to the Final Report.

4.      Of the 9 r e c o m m e n d a t i o n s on safety ( recommendation 6 refers to
S co tland only) r e co m m e n d a t i o n s 1, 7, 8 and 9 are longer term
p r o p o s a l s to amend either the Safety of Sports Grounds Act 1975
(SSGA) or the Fire P re c au t io n s Act 1971 (FPA).                     The latter,
r ec i p i e n t s wil l know, is a l re a dy the subj ec t of an uncomp le te d
review con t a i n e d in the c o n s u l t at i ve d oc um e nt issued in July 1985
and upon w h i c h comme n t s w er e invited by 31 Pecember 1985.                    The
G o v e r n m e n t a c c e p t s the aims behind the I nquiry's appro ac h to both
A cts and p r o p o s e s to issue as soon as p os si b le a c on su ltation
d oc u m e n t as to the best means of a c h i e v i n g them.              This docum en t will
o utl i n e s o l u t i o n s inter alia by tak in g account both of the further
factual i n f o r m a t i o n sought at p a ra g r a p h s 10 and 11 below which was
not a v a i l a b l e to the I n qu ir y and of the comments made on the proposals
on the FPA in the July c o n s u l t at i ve document.                   The upshot therefore
will be i n t e g r a t e d p r o p o s a ls for the m ost effective form of safety
p r o v i s i o n in a c c o r d a n c e w ith the p r i n c i p le s recommended by the
Inquiry.

5.     The o b j e c t i v e behind R e c o m m e n d a t i o n 4 is also a cc epted and c o n ­
s ul t a t i o n s w i l l be u n d e r t a k e n with H§£, .and DOE with the aiu. of
clarify.ing the i n t e r f a c e betw e e n the r e s p o n si b il i ti e s of the authorities
c oncerned.          R e c o m m e n d a t i o n 10 ( b u il d i n g regulations) is b ei ng
c ons i d e r e d by the D e p a r t m e n t of the E n v i r o n m e n t (DOE).

SSGA:     e x t en s i o n   of d e s i g n a t i o n

6.      As a result             of the G o v e r n m e n t ' s a c c e p t a n c e of R e co mm en d at i on 2 of
the Final Report, the Home S e c re t a r y now proposes gen er al ly to extend
d e s i g n a t i o n under the SSGA 1975 to s t a d i a and grounds w ith a c c o m m o d ­
a t i o n for over 10,000 s p e c t a t o r s at w h i c h soccer or rugby union or
r ug b y league or cricket is played.                          C o n s u l t a t i o n letters have been
sent to the s p o r t i n g bodies concerned s e e k i n g comments and i nformat ion
on the venues liable to be affected. D e t a i l s of these, as known to
the Home Office, are c o ntained at A nn e x B.                                With the e x ce pt io n of
r ugby union the i n f o r m a t i o n is based on responses received to HM
C hief I n s p e c t o r        of Fire Services' le t t e r to chief fire o ff ic er s of
21 August 1985 (No 11/1985).                         The i n f o r m a t i o n for rugby union includes
data p r o v i d e d by the Rugby Football U nion and the Welsh Rugby Union.
W h e r e i n f o r m a t i o n differs from that g iven by chief fire officers, the
la r g e r figure for s p e c t a t o r c a p a c i t y has been used.

7.      It is hoped that c o n s u l t a t i o n wit h the s p or ti ng a u th o r i t i e s will
help reso l v e any points w h i c h might a r i s e about the grounds and stadia
a f f e c t e d . Local a u t h o r i t i e s to who m this circular is add re ss ed are
asked to check if there are any sports st ad ia or sports grou nd s in
their area w i t h a c c o m m o d a t i o n for over 10,000 s pectators at w hi ch rugby
union or r ugby league or soccer or c r i c k e t is played but w h i c h have
been omitted from A nnex B. Details of any such stadia or grounds
should be passed to the Home Office as soon as possible, g i v i n g the
full name and a d d r e s s of the s ta d i u m or ground in question, name and
a d d r e s s of the p r i nc i p a l occupier, a p p r o x i m a t e s pectator c ap ac i ty and
the use to w h i c h the venue is put. This in fo rm at io n can be passed by
te l e p h o n e on 01 213 5566 if this is more convenient.

          8.      Timing of the further d es ig na t io n s as mentioned in p aragraphs 6
          and 7 a bo ve under the SSGA is subject to the consultation process which
          will include views e x pressed by the local authority associations.
          A phased p r o gr a m m e may be nec es sa ry but it is intended to complete
          d e s i g na t i o n by the summer of 1986.

          G uide     to Safety       at Sports G r o u n d s (Football)              (the    "Green Guide")

          9.   The Green Guide is b eing revised a l o n g the lines recommended by
          the Inquiry and it is hoped, after cons ul ta ti on with interested bodies,
          to have a new edition of the Guide p ublished before the 1986/87 seasons
          Until then the adv i ce in the e xi st in g Guide can continue to be followed
          as a p p r o p r i a t e for all s p ec ta to r sports. It is not intended to change
          the present status of the Green Guide.

          Further controls over safety in sports premises

          10.       The Gover n m e n t has also accepted the need for some further safety

        • controls to be applied to other sports stadia and grounds with stands
          h o l d i n g over 500; and to indoor sports premises when they are used to
          a c c o m m o d a t e more than 500 s pe c t a t or s (Final Report r e co mm en da ti on s 3
          and 5).           As a first step to c o n s i d e r i n g how best to proceed, further

.«?.•    ”.of i*th-e'“pr:em'is:  e s ^ i h v o l v e d . Some i n f o r m a t i o n has"'alre-ady'^beeri "p r o ^ i d e d ^ ' * ' ' ^ :V"i
           (or may be available) as a result of the surveys carried out in response
           to DCO letter 11/1985 (seeking i n f o rm at io n on sports stadia with an
          o verall c a p acity of over 5,000; sports grounds with constructed a c c o m ­
          m o d a t i o n for more than 5,000; and indoor arenas with a s pe ctator
           capacity of over 1,000).                      The i n fo rm at io n now sought overlaps with
           but is not i d entical to that p r ev i ou s ly given, so in an attempt to
          ease the a d m i n i s t r a t i v e burden and to ensure consis te nc y of response,
           those to w hom this c i rcular is a ddressed are asked to provide the
           in f o r m a t i o n on the p r o f o rm a at Annex 0.               Chief e xecutives will no doubt
          wish to discuss with c h i e f fire officers who is best placed to carry
          out this work.

        ^11.   For the purpose of this exercise indoor sports premi se s included
        : in the return should be confined to those premises whe^e,iyeither on
          a regular or infre q u e n t basis, sports events or ot'fPe'iP?activities take
          place for w hich a c c o m m o d a t i o n is provided for more than 500 spectators.


          12.       To ensure that the re is no short term gap i n safety cover chief
          fire offic e r s and, wher e appropriate, other memb ers of the local
          a u t ho r i t y safety team a re asked to inspect those outdoor sports
          venues c o m i n g wi t h i n th e scope of r e c o m m e n d a t io n 3 w hich   were not
          i nspected        as part    of the earl i e r  exercise, an          d those   indoor sports
          p r e m i s e s coming within the     scope    of recommenda tion            5 which have not
E.R
      been i n s pected in the last twelve mon ths whet he r or not they are
      subj ec t to e n t er t ai n me n ts l i c e n s i n g 1 egislation.          The purpose of
      these i n sp ec t io ns would be to adv is e             m a n ag e me n t on  a dd it i on a l
      m e a s u r e s n e c e s s a ry to secure s at isfac tory standards of safety, and
      to c o n s i d e r eme r g e nc y action where ne c es s a r y under section 10 of
      either the SSGA or FPA as a p p r op r ia t e                  Similarly, c h i e f e xecutives
      and c hief fire officers are asked to k eep under review the other
      outd o o r p r e mises p r e v io u sl y i ns pected w ith the' object of m a i n t ai n in g
      safety s t andards at those venues, eve n though they are not b eing
      desi gn at e d under the SSGA.

   So far, happily, the figures this season show an ■
improvement in the number of arrests and ejections from 1
football grounds. Our measures against hooliganism
should have ? cumulative effect, but it is too soon to be
satisfied. We have to deal not only with hooliganism, but
with safety; not only with football grounds, but with sports
grounds in general. Thanks in large part to Mr. Justice
Popplewell and his colleagues, I believe that we are on the
right track.

     thereby restoring confidence among those who attend sporting events.                              This
 means that effective steps should be taken quickly'.                               The report stresses
     the responsibilities of sports grounds management to ensure that their
     grounds are safe for spectators.

                    2. The   local authority team responsible f o r issuing s a f e ty certificates   in respect of designated grounds
                should, as heretofore, include police officers.

                bomb or similar device at sports grounds.

        ‘ •       6 Those managing spo rts grounds not g o ve rn ed b y sa fety certificates should give serious consideration, with
                the assistance o f f ir e authorities, to the p resen ce in a grou nd o f suitable fire fighting equipment. (N o w see
                A ppendix E, paragraph E 33 )

                 local authorities as to how best to co-ordinate and com m unicate their inspections and reports.

    '         10 Stew ards in all grounds should not only be trained in fire precautions and fire fighting (see

            16. Fire authorities should identify a n d visit all sp o rts stadia in their areas and should prohibit or restrict
         the use of any stands which, in their view, constitute a risk to spectators because of the inadequacy of the
         fire precautions.
            17. In order to ensure a com plete reco rd o f sp o rts grounds a local registration sy stem should be set up.

       B Provisional Recommendations in the Interim Report
           1.     I am minded to recommend that in England a n d W ales the police                                                                   should be given the u nfettered right
       o f search before en try to football grounds by statute. (N o w see paragraphs                                                                4.24 to 4.38 and Final Report
     " R ecom m endation 1 1 ) ......

           ’2, I am minded to recommend that Section 10 o f the Fire Precautions A c t 1971 shmitd be am ended with
         a view to giving the Fire Authority power in cases other than those which are regarded as wholly exceptional.
         (N o w amended. S ee paragraph s 3.62 to 3.64 and Final R eport Recom mendation 7)

             3.     Linked with the above, I am minded to recommend that consideration be given to introducing
          legislation aiving p o w e rs f o r the Fire A u th o rity to apply to the High Court f o r an injunction (o r to the Court
          o f Session f o r an interdict in S cotlan d ) under Section 10 o f the Fire Precautions A c t 1971. (N o w amended.
          See paragraph s 3.62 to 3.64 and Final R ep o rt R ecom m endation 7)

            4 I am minded to recommend that Section 10 o f the S a fe ty o f Sports Grounds A c t 1975 should be am ended
          in like manner to Section 10 of the Fire Precautions Act 1971 (see Provisional Recommendations 2 and 3)
          and an application to the High Court for an injunction (or the Court of Session for an interdict in Scotland)
          should be an alternative remedy, (N o w amended. S ee paragraph 3.65 and Final R eport Recom mendation 8)

            5, I am minded to recommend that the S ecreta ry o f S ta te should exercise his po w ers to designate all sports
          grounds, whatever their size, to include indoor as well as outdoor activities. (N o w amended. See paragraphs
          3.53 to 3.59 and Final R eport R ecom m endations 5 and 6)

                 6 I am minded to recommend im m ediate designation o f a n y ground capable o f holding over 5,000 spectators,
              to cover all sports grounds, not m erely f o o tb a ll grounds. (N o w amended. See paragraph 3.23 and Final Report
              Recom m endation 2 )

            7 I am minded to recommend that consideration should be given to providing the police with additional
          pow ers o f arrest under the Public O rder A c t 1936. (N o w see paragraph 4.76 and Final R eport Recom mendation
              13)

                                                                                                        63
        8     I am minded to recommend that consideration should be given to creating a specific offence o f chanting
      obscene or racialist abuse at a sports ground. (N o w see paragraphs 4.48 to 4.54, 4 .5 6 -4 .7 4 Final Report
      j^ecommenj atlon 12)


      C    Recommendations in the Final Report
          1.   The distinction m ade between sports ground'! and sp o rt sta d ia should b . abolished. (P aragraph 3 .1 4 )

        2. Further designation under the S a fe ty o f S p o rts Grounds A c t 1975 o f sports grounds and sports stadia

     cricket is p la y e d in England, Wales and Scotland. ( Paragraph 3 .2 3 )

       3 A ll sports grounds and sports stadia not already designated under the S a fe ty o f S po rts Grounds A c t 1975
     and having a capacity in a sta n d o f over 500 spectators should be designated under the Fire Precautions A c t
     1971 as premises requiring a fire certificate. (Parag ra p h 3 .3 4 )

  10 Stewards in all grounds should not only be trained in fire precautions and fire-fighting (see
nendation 7 above) but should also be trained in how best to help the police in evacuation (Paragraph 3.104)

  11 Paragraph 6 14.6 o f the Green Guide should be amended to read: "All exit gates should be manned
7taU times while the ground is used by the public and be capable o f being opened immediately from inside by
anyone in an emergency." (Paragraph 3.111)

    12. The Green Guide should be amended to contain a specific provision, in relation to stewards,
   (i) that they should be trained and instructed to deal with any emergency relating to fire or evacuation
        (see also Recommendations 7 and 10);
  (ii) that they should be given written instructions about the action to be taken in cases of emergency;
 ( i f ilb at they should receive practical instruction and training appropriate to their responsibi ity;
 v G a t no one should be employed as a steward unless they have been so instructed and trained; and

(Paragraph 6.57)

  23. Football clubs should review their arrangements fo r entry and the organisation o f their turnstiles.
(Paragraph 6.62)

  24. Consideration should be given to the design o f a standard, efficient perimeter fence, with proper exits.
(Paragraph 6.63)
      Provisional Recommendations ( To be reviewed in the Final Report) -
          1. I am minded to recommend that in England and Wales the police should be given the unfettered right
      o f search before entry to football grounds by statute. ( Paragraph 3 .4 1 )

         2. I am minded to recommend that Section 10 o f the Fire Precautions Act 1971 should be amended with
      a view to giving the Fire Authority power in cases other than those which are regarded as wholly exceptional.
      (Paragraph 3 .6 1 )

          3. Linked with the above, I am minded to recommend that consideration should be given to introducing
      legislation giving powers fo r the Fire Authority to apply to the High Court for an injunction (or to the Court
      o f Session fo r an interdict in Scotland) under Section 10 o f the Fire Precautions Act 1971. (Paragraph 3 .6 1 )

         4. I am minded to recommend that Section 10 o f the Safety at Sports Grounds Act 1975 should be
      amended in like manner to Section 10 o f the Fire Precautions Act 1971 (see Provisional Recommendations
      2 and 3) and an application to the High Court for an injunction (or to the Court o f Session for an interdict
      in Scotland) should be an alternative remedy. (Paragraph 3.7 6 )

        5. I am minded to recommend that the Secretary o f State should exercise his powers to designate all
      sports grounds, whatever their size, to include indoor as well as outdoor activities. (Paragraphs 3 .145 )

        6. I am minded to recommend immediate designation o f any ground capable o f holding over 5,000
      spectators, to cover all sports grounds, not merely football grounds. (Paragraph 3.146)
      A
 ',        I am minded to recommend that consideration should be given to providing the police with additional
      powers o f arrest under the Public Order Act 1936. ( Paragraph 6 .6 6 )

          8. I am minded to recommend that consideration should be given to creating a specific offence o f chanting

Chairman

WORKING GROUP ON THE GREEN GUIDE
   El Shortly after publication of your Interim Report you asked me to establish a Working Group of
approoriately qualified scientifical and technical persons who had practical experience of safety at sports
grounds to assist the Inquiry in its task of reviewing the Home Office Guide to Safety at Sports Grounds
(the “Green Guide”). As you know, and with the kind cooperation of the Home Office, Scottish Office,
Department of Environment, local authority associations and technical consultants to the Inquiry, I was
able to form such a group and this met for a full week (23-28 September) under my Chairmanship.

  E2. Our terms of reference were: “To review the Home Office Guide to Safety at Sports Grounds
(Football) - “the Green Guide” - and to make recommendations to the Committee of Inquiry on Crowd
Safety and Control at Sports Grounds as to amendments or additions considered necessary to the Green
Guide published in 1976.” A record of the membership of the Group appears later in this appendix.

   E3 I am pleased to be able to report that the Working Group completed its work satisfactorily and that
it was found possible on the final day of the Group’s week to reach general agreement on the various
recommendations for changes which we wished to see made to the Guide. I have since prepared a selt-
contained note of these points and have put the Group’s deliberations into the form of recommendations
for you. This note is set out below for your consideration. I support these recommendations.

  E4 Asyou will'See there are,Tri total, some 63 recommendations..1his sHo.uld ptit:’be taken in uiiy.way,
however, as an adverse judgment upon the current Guide. The substantive advice in the Guide stood up
remarkably well to a week of detailed scrutiny by experts and fully justifies the high esteem and confluence
in which it is generally - and internationally - held.

   E5 It remains only for me to record my gratitude to the members of the Group who gave up so much
of their valuable time to assist the Committee in its task; to my fellow Assessor, Mr Alan Goodson, for
his encouragement, support and practical advice throughout the week; and to Mr Mark de Pulford for his
excellent work as Secretary.
                                                                                        MARTIN KILLORAN
                                                                                    Fire Assessor to the Inquiry


                                        REPORT AND RECOMMENDATIONS

           STRUCTURE OF THE GREEN GUIDE
              E6 The Working Group was dissatisfied with the structure of the current Guide and recom-
 Rcc 1     mends that the Green Guide should be reorganised so as to reflect more closely the needs oj us
           target audience. (The Group agreed that the target audience of the Guide comprises: (a) sports
           eround management in designated and undesignated grounds; (b) engineers, designers and others
           engaged in the improvement, design appraisal or refurbishment o f s p o r t s stadia to certihcab e
           standards; and (c) local authorities responsible for enforcing the Safety of Sports Grounds c
           1975 ) The Group considered that, following a general introduction which describes the sc°Pe Q
           the Guide, sets the scene and briefly discusses the nature and extent of risks to the public at
           sports "rounds, the guidance should be re-arranged so as to deal first with general management
           responsibilities and major planning and design matters. (Guidance on these matters should, where
           practicable, include methods for assessing the general safety c o n d i t i o n o f a ground and the ncxd
           for detailed drawings and plans.) The succeeding categories of detailed guidance should each be
           preceded by a statement of the general functional requirement or aim and should include as m u c h
           appraisal, flow and other diagrams as may conveniently be arranged. The Group considered tha
           a possible scheme for the categories of advice m the Green Guide was: Fire (to include a che k
           and appraisal flow diagram and reference to the need for professional advice), Structural Appraisa
            (to include a method for appraising existing structures and reference to the need for professional
            advice). Ground Control and Ground Management (to identify responsibilities and duties), ana
            Inspections, Tests and Maintenance.
Rec 2      E7. The Group also recommends that consideration should be given to the production b y the
         Home Office, or other appropriate body, o f su m m a ry documents, training aids and seminars f o r
         sports g r o u n d m anagem ent explaining the provisions o f the Green Guide and their application.


         INTRODUCTION
           E8 . The current Guide is aimed at soccer and rugby grounds (‘J G (Green Guide. 1976 Edition,
         paragraph): 1:1).

           The Group decided that many of the recommendations in the Green Guide are relevant to
Rec 3   outdoor sports other than football and recommends that the Introduction should say that the
         Guide is applicable as a code o f g o o d p ra ctice f o r all sports grounds. The Green Guide should
Rec 4   make it clear, however, that it docs not cover m easures to ensure the sa fety o f spectators fr o m
         hazards presented by the sp ort itself.

           E9. The Group noted that the references in the Guide to the Building Regulations for England
         and Wales would need to be revised and brought up to date. It was further noted that in Scotland,
         the Building Standards (Scotland) Regulations gave requirements for the construction, alteration,
         extension and change of use of buildings, and included standards in respect of means of escape
         from fire including emergency lighting, access tor fire-fighters as well as structural fire precautions.
         The Group recommends that full account should be taken of national Building Regulations in
         the Green Guide.

         IDENTIFICATION OF PROBLEMS
            E10. The current Guide discerns three particular types of safety problem to be considered
 . . . . .within a -footbaU- gtauncLand its L w m d i p t e surroundings. (GG;.K?,,+,.N.Z.€.^.a^tbose
         hazards whicii may cause indi-v’duals to trip, slip or (all; (6 ) crowd pressures which may be b.l*i!t.
         up in normal circumstances (particularly on terraces and exit routes); and (c) crowd pressures
         which may be built up under abnormal conditions. The Group considered that this analysis was
         correct. However, it felt that the need to tackle these problems should be covered in a new self-
         contained section defining, in general terms, good safety design in sports stadia and enumerating
          other important needs such as managing and controlling crowds, maintaining effective fire
         precautions, making proper provision for the disabled and achieving a reasonable standard of
Rec 5    comfort and convenience for spectators. Accordingly, the Group recommends the incorporation
          o f a new self-contained section on g o o d s a fe ty design in sports stadia.

          GENERAL CONSTRUCTION
            Ell. The current Guide recommends that all components and installations should be designed,
          constructed, installed and maintained so as “to perform safely their required functions" and that
          they should be in accordance with good engineering and building practice, especially as set out
          in all revelant British Standards and Codes of Practice (GG: 3.1).
            The Group approved this recommendation but felt that the reference to British Standards
          might be improved so as to identify those parts of British Standards which are wholly applicable
Rec 6     in the circumstances of the case. The Group recommends that references in the Guide to British
          Standards should be im proved accordingly.

            E12. The current Guide recommends that all electrical installations should comply with the
          current edition of the regulations of the Institution of Electrical Engineers (GG: 3.2). The Group
Rec 7     considered that it would be reasonable in some circumstances for the enforcing authority to accept
          a certificate o f satisfaction f r o m a chartered electrical engineer in lieu o f fu ll compliance with current
          IE E Regulations and recommends that the Guide so advises. The Group also recommends a
Rec 8     reference to B S 5266: P t 1 in respect o f em ergency lighting.

            El3. The current Guide recommends that all parts of the ground used by the general public
          should have a minimum headroom of 2.4 metres (GG: 3.5).
             The Group could find no clear foundation for this advice and, accordingly, recommends that
Rec 9     in respect o f headroom the Guide should sim ply advise conform ity to appropriate building regulations .


                                                           78
         INSPECTIONS A N D TESTS
           E14. The current Guide recommends:
           (i) A detailed annual inspection to ensure compliance with the Green Guide (GG: 4.1);
           (ii) A general visual inspection following each event for damage which might create a potential
                hazard (GG: 4.2); and,
          (iii) Testing of crush barriers in accordance with the Guide on installation and subsequently,
                normally, at intervals of several years (GG: 4.3).
Rec 10      The Group recommends that the routine general visual inspection b y m anagem ent advised in the
          Guide should also cover fe a tu re s which m ight reduce the degree o f f ir e protection offered and that
Rec 11   there should also be a warning in the Guide against storing hazardous m aterials under or near stands.
Rcc 12   The Group also recommends that consideration should be given to the inclusion o f additional
          guidance to certifying authorities as to the freq u en cy and content oj inspections.

Rec 13     El5. The Group recommends that           regular em ergency evacuation drills f o r m em bers o f s ta j f
         should be reco m m en ded in the Guide.

            El 6 . On the testing of crush barriers (GG: 4.3 and Appendix C of the Guide) the Group had
         before it no evidence that the current guidance had permitted dangerous or defective crush
         barriers. However, it seemed to a minority of the Group that certain anomalies exist in the current
         recommendations in the Green Guide as to load factors and testing (for example the table of
         strengths for new crush barriers permitted a different design strength for the bars and posts than
         for the foundations); and there was some evidence that enforcing authorities were unclear as to
         the correct procedures. The Group recommends that representatives o f the local authorities, the

                                                        in more detail with a view to clarifying the guidance
         lions on the design and testing o f crush barriers                                                             .u
         in future editions of the Guide (see also paragraph 28 below).
Rec 15      E17. The Group further recommends that the Guide should advise that any automatic fir s
         protection equipment or em ergency lighting s y ste m should be tested regularly in accordance with
         relevant British S ta n d a rd codes o f practice.

         INGRESS TO THE GROUND
           El 8 . The Guide currently recommends thar the number and location of turnstiles should be
         planned to achieve the smallest crowd waiting for admission that is consistent with th>- rate at
         which spectators can be distributed inside the ground (GG: 5.1). The Group recommends that
Rec 16   more deta iled guidance to m anagem ent as to contingency planning in the event o f unusual pressures
         and fru stra tion s (including a reference to the value oj centralised com puter-based monitoring)
Rec 17   should be given. The Group further recommends that the Guide emphasise that turnstiles are not
         acceptable as a means o f escape f r o m a ground.

          El9. The Group considered it desirable that the Guide should specify a notional maximum
Rec 18 free flow rate past a turnstile. The Group recommends that further consideration he given to
         defining a m axim um notional f lo w rate p ast turnstiles f o r incorporation in a fu tu re edition o f the
          Green Guide.

            E20. The Guide currently recommends that fences forming the boundary to a ground should
          be of “appropriate height and strength” to avoid spectators gatecrashing (GG: 5.2). The Group
Rec 19    recommends that boundary walls and g a te s and any other structure form in g p a rt o f the boundary
          should also be o f appropriate height and strength to avo id gatecrashing.

         EGRESS FROM THE GROUND
            E21. Currently, Section 6 of the Guide makes a number of general recommendations as to
         eszress froni a sports grounds (GG: 6.1 to 6.13). The Group was generally content with these but
         recommends that the wording in paragraph 6.13 of the Guide should be revised to make it clear
Rec 20, that escape routes are not to be regarded as an alternative provision only f o r use in emergency. The
Rec 21 Group further recommends that guidance should be included to the effect that doors on exit


                                                         79

                to entrances.    —                                        —            ....          .....
    Rec '>'5        E22. The Group recommends that a stu d y should be undertaken o f the current use and effectiveness
                o f the exit route signposting and exit m arking sy ste m s recom m ended in the Green Guide ( GG: 6 .6 ),
               and that consideration should be given to commissioning further research in this area,

               TERRACES AND STANDS

               Safe capacity of terraces
                  E23. The Guide currently suggests that the exits from each areas of spectator accommodation
               should be so designed that the spectator can leave that area in eight minutes or less (GG: 6.5).
    Rec 24     The Group concluded that this so-called "eight minute ru le ” was concerned solely with the effect
               o f cro w d turbulence (arising from delays in evacuating specator accommodation) on the rate o f
               flow. It was not related to emergency evacuation time criteria (see paragraph 32 below) and the
               Group recommends that the Guide should m a k e this clear.


                 Terrace packing densities
                   E24. The Guide recommends packing densities between the limits of 27 and 54 persons per
,              . iOm: dependinc on the condition of the terrace or slope and on the extent to which crush barriers
                 conform to the Green Guide guidelines on spacing (GG: i5.4). Recommended flow rates from
                 the terraces are given at paragraph 16 of the Guide.
                  The Group concluded that the flow rates and permissible spectator densities in the Guide were
                satisfactory and reasonable when taken as a whole and that Jhey jiccorded with experience.

                an v)' with those criteria given in respect o f em ergency evacuation and crow d turbidences should be
                set o u tjin d explained m ore clearly in the Guide and that fu rth er advice should be given as to how
                interpolation between the wide limits su gg ested in respect o f terrace packing densities m a y properly
    Rec 26      be carried out. The Group further recommcnds that consideration be given to the possibility o f a
                separate detailed stu dy o f the possible casualties which might be attributable to high packing
                densities.

            Terrace steps and viewing slopes
              E25. The Group was content with the Guide’s iecommendations in respect cf terrace steps and
    Rec 27 viewing slopes (GG: 7.4). The Group recommends, however, that the surfaces o f terrace steps and
    Rec 28 viewing slopes should be even as well as non-slip and that the way in which the m axim um desirable
                gradient is specified in the Guide should be improved.

                Terrace gangways
                  E26. The Guide states that the aim in respect of terrace gangways should be to ensure that
                every spectator on a terrace is within 12 metres of a gangway or of an exit. (GG: 7.5). The Guide
                further indicates that gangways should be sunk.
                  The Group felt that although these recommendations were generally satisfactory, reasons
                should be given for the basic aim stated in paragraph 7.5 of the Guide. Furthermore, it would
    Rec 29      be preferable to sta te the sa fety objective behind the current recommendation to sink gan gw ays so
                that it could be m et in other ivaj-j. The Group recommends accordingly.

                Division of spectator accommodation
                  E27. The Guide currently recommends the division of a ground into sections to prevent major
                migrations by spectators, and into sub-sections to minimise the sway and surge of spectators
                (GG: 7.6). The Group recommends that the Guide should limit the application o f its guidance on
                segregation to terraces at f o o tb a ll grounds (See recommendation 57 below).

            Crush barriers and other physical restraints on movements
    Rec 30,   E28. The Group recommends that the Guide should should explain that brick                      walls and similar


                                                               80
         rather than to stipulate more stringent criteria in respect of notional values. However, represen­
         tatives of the Fire Research Station felt that the 2k minutes should be regarded as a maximum;
         they believed that although individual circumstances might conceivably justify increasing the
         figure, it was not currently possible to assign quantitative values to active or passive fire protection
         measures with sufficient precision to enable specific relaxations to be advocated in the Guide with
         any degree of confidence. A majority of the Group believed that the notional 8 minutes upper
         limit indicated in the Guide, although lacking any very clear or relevant technical rationale, was
         reasonable and should be retained. Nevertheless, it was the firm view of a minority including Mr
         Platt that 8 minutes is too long a period to allow for the evacuation ot any stand under emergency
         conditions and that, although relaxation of the 2 + minutes figure might be reasonable in individual
         circumstances, it would be misleading to specify an upper limit in the Green Guide.

           The consensus was that the enforcing authority should decide on relaxations in the light of
         professional experience and individual safety circumstances of a particular ground, but that the
Rec 41   Green Guide should offer m o re guidance as to what latitude was permissible on evacuation times
         and the circumstances to take into account. In particular, the Green Guide should emphasise that
         escape routes should be designed or chosen so that they provide progressive reduction in difficulty
         or danger to people using them and regard should be had to the likely accumulation o f sm o k e and
         combustion products in those routes. The Group recommends that consideration should be given
Rec 42
         to devising a more scientific m eth od f o r assessing the evacuation o f a sta n d under emergency
         conditions.

         Fire protection and fire-fighting equipment

Rec 43      E33. The Group considered that there was currently insufficient evidence as to the value f o r life
         sa fety o f autom atic fire protection equipment f o r the Green Guide to encourage trade-offs between
         su c h -e q u ip m e a i a n d ,.s tr u c to a U iK ,^ .te c U o p „ jr,e a :syje^^^
         were permissible should be'removed’from the current*"Guide,(eg G ^ .;i'0:l)^A majority-,. the
         Group rejected also the idea that the Green Guide should suggest similar relaxations where
         management expertise and vigilance were at a high level.

Rec 44     On fire detection and fire-fiehting equipment, the Group recommends that reference should be
         m ade to relevant British Standards such as B S 5839: P art 1, B S 5306: P arts 1 and 3 and B S j<4.23.
         The Group considered that it was an inefficient and undesirable use ot resources for manned fire
         appliances to attend all matches.

           E34. On roof venting, the Group felt that with some stand roof configurations, appropriate
         venting and curtaining arrangements might offer a means of reducing the spread of fire. It was
         agreed however that the science of fire and smoke venting was highly complex and that it was
         not appropriate for the Guide to offer more than a general reference to the issue. However the
Rec 45   Group felt that some advice on r o o f venting should be offered in the Green Guide along the lines
         of that proposed by the Fire Research Station in work commissioned by the-Inquiry. It was
         agreed that the priority in the Guide was to recommend effective fire precautions relating to the
         early stages of a fire.

         Access for emergency vehicles
           E35. The Group agreed that the Guide’s recommendations as to access for emergency vehicles
         (GG: 11.30) were soundly based. It was noted that the Interim Report recommendation that
         vehicular parking be banned within quarter of a mile of a sports ground (when it was in use) had
Rec 46   been made on a “where practicable” basis. The Group recommends that the qualification where
         necessary"’should be a dd ed to the current G u id e’s recommendations on access f o r em egency vehicles.

          Hazardous materials
             E36 The consensus was that it was not practicable for the Guide to offer detailed advice on
          fire spread hazards associated with particular materials. Nevertheless, the Group recommends
Rec 47    that consultation with expert f ir e advisers should be indicated in the Guide where substantial use
          of. f o r exam ple, po lym er sealing is co n tem p lated or o f artificial pitches where f o r w a r d escape onto
          the pitch might be necessary. (See also recommendation 35 above).


                                                                        82
          COMMUNICATIONS                                           ;
            E37 The Green Guide currently recommends that precise requirements for communications
          within a particular ground be determined alter consultation with the police (GG: 17). The Guide
          goes on to give examples of the arrangements likely to be needed at larger grounds. The Group
          considered that this advice-and the way in which, it was expressed was generally satisfactory
Rec 48    However the Group recommends that the advice as to centra! control points should not be confined
Rec 49’   to the largest grounds and that the Guide should emphasise the need f o r ground management and
Rec 50    responsibility to be centralised accordingly. The Group also believed that it would be desirable in
           larger grounds i f public address system s p e r m itte d m essages to be directed towards specific . ones
           o f the ground. The Group recommends accordingly.

          E38. On emergency audible alarms, the use of coded messages found little support in the
        Group. The need was rather to communicate essential information effectively to the crowd For
Rec 51 that purpose, a clear system o f communications covering all the various conceivable crises, including
        the facilitv to stop the even t , should be devised in consultation with the emergency services. 1he
        Group recommends that guidance to this-effect should be incorporated in the Green Guide.
        Further study was required before pre-set formulae messages could be recommended in the Guide.
        However, it was clear that such messages should be in the active mode, that they should be
        directed towards persons from whom a response is required, and that they should be delivered
Rec 52 authoritatively by trained controllers. The Group considered that there was a need for standard
          guidance covering the use o f public address sy ste m s f o r em ergency purposes. The Group recommends
           that consideration be given to this.

              E39. The Group considered that the development and operational experience of closed circuit
           television (CCTV) facilities was too little advanced to enable the Guide to be prescriptive a^s to

  vr: ^ prevention and■ detection'.aii'd that it had a considerable role t o p l a v ai n aiding^emerge,ncy:s
        evacuations, police management information and crowd control. The Group therefore recom-
Rec 53 mends that the provision o f C C T V system s should be encouraged in the Guide.

        CROWD BEHAVIOUR
          E40. Advice on crowd behaviour is currently set out in the Green Guide in the form of
        recommendations of an earlier working party on crowd behaviour (GG. 18). The Group recom-
Rec 54 mends that the advice f o r managem ent currently presented at paragraph 18 of the Gu'.ue slioulu
        be re-organised and e x p a n d e d -so as to explain more fully the major problems and prin-iples of
        crowd control and then go on to elaborate the various methods available which may be rc.eyant
        in certain situations at sports grounds and of the circumstances under which these might be
        appropriate (see also recommendation (1) above).
Rec 55       E41 The Group also recommends that the Guide should emphasise the value o f e f f e c t i v e planning
           before events, debriefing exercises and f u ll liaison with the police in order to predict and prevent
           trouble. In particular, the Guide should stress the desirability of identifying in advance, acainst
           the local historical background and known travel arrangements, the likely size and naoire ot the
           crowd.
 Rec 56     E42. The Group further recommends that the Guide makes it clear that the responsibility f o r
           pre-planning and liaison lies with club m anagem ent subject only to the point that the disposition
           of operational police resources is the sole responsibility of individual chief constables.
               E43. There was considerable discussion in the Group of the segregation issue^which, it was
            agreed had major implications for planning. The consensus was that clear difterentiation o
            opposing fans (with ancillary facilities) remained the only viable and prudent course so long as
            crowd violence remained at current levels; and that the best way to achieve such d.ilerentiat.on
            was by spatial separation and physical containment of opposing groups The Group was anxious,
            however that segregation should not be encouraged other than where local circumstances, made
 Rec 57     it absolu’tely necessary. In particular, at the present time segregation should not be advocated Jor
            sports other than soccer. The Group recommends accordingly. (See also paragraph _/ abo\e).

 Rec 58        E44. The Group agreed that         certain fire precautions measures,   for example plasterboard fire


                                                            83
                  separation and fire protection equipment, m ight be vulnerable to vandalism and that certificating
                  authorities should be advised to take this into account where appropriate. The Group recommends
                 _accordingly.
                     E45. On ticketing, the Group agreed that this was not an effective means of crowd control
      Rec 59      unless clubs ensured that their arrangem ents f o r the issue and allocation o f tickets were as efficient
                  a nd effective as possible. The Group recommends that this latter point be strongly emphasised in
                  the Green Guide.

       Rec 60       E46. On alcohol, the Group recom m ends that the guidance on alcohol ( GG: IS.4 ) should be
                  rew orded to make clear that an important objective was to reduce potential missiles and also that
                  the police should be consulted over arrangements for the sale of alcohol at grounds. A reference
                  to the Sporting Events (Control of Alcohol etc) Act 1985 was also needed.

                    E47. The Group were content with the material on police facilities given in the Green Guide
       Rec 61     (GG: 17.8) but considered that the Guide should advise adequate vehicular access f o r the unobrusive
                  rem oval o f detainees and secure detention ro o m s at appropriate grounds. The Group recommends
                  accordingly.
                  OTHER MANAGEMENT RESPONSIBILITIES
       Rec 62       E48. The Group was strongly in favour of the creation of a new section in the Green Guide on
                  managem ent responsibilities  and recommends that consideration should be given to this. The
                  Group considered that it would be helpful if such a section could incorporate a form of
                  checklist of necessary tasks organised under broad headings such as: Pre-planning for Emergency
                  Procedures, Training of Stewards and First-aid Facilities/Other Medical Provisions. A reference
                  to the need for management structure to reflect such responsibilities, preferably including the
                  designation of a named individual to take responsibility for the proper execution of such duties,
                  was also highly desirable.,^       ......*                ...
                    E49. On the question of the relative responsibilities of the police and stewards, the Group felt
     ...Rec 63    that the Guide ought to make it plain that it was the club's responsibility to control a n d manage
                  specta to rs in normal circumstances and that the police presence (if there was one) was to deal with
                  the law and order problems and provide support and leadership in emergencies. The Group
                  recommends accordingly. It was noted that there now existed considerable material on the training
                  and deployment of stewards and staff likely to be involved in emergency situations.

                                                                         8TH JANUARY 1976



                  SAFETY OF SPORTS GROUNDS ACT, 1975


With r e fe ren ce to my report to this C om m ittee on the 6th N ovem ber, 1975, further
con sid eration has been given to the detailed arrangem ents which it w ill be n e c e s s a r y
to im plem ent once the S ecre ta ry of State has begun to designate sports stadia as
requiring s a fe ty c e r tific a te s under Section 1 of the A ct. D iscu ssio n s have taken
p lace betw een rep re se n ta tiv es of the A dm inistration Department, the P o lic e , and
the F ir e S e r v ic e , when it was agreed that b ecau se of the considerable amount of
lia iso n work which w ill be n e c e s s a r y betw een the resp ectiv e s p e c ia lis t departm ents,
i . e . , P o lic e , F ir e , and Building Insp ectors of D istrict C ouncils, it is d esirab le
that the w ork of co-ord ination should be undertaken by the A dm inistration
D epartm ent.

F rom in itial consultations which have taken p la ce, it would appear that the S ecretary of
State, in h is fir s t designation order, w ill not, apart from certain international
grounds pgo^eyonS Its? a n d ^ t f ^ l K v I s i b a ; r d V t t d s ^ a^a^ESf®&rerihe^oBTy^
 one with which the County Council w ill be concerned in the fir s t instance w ill be the
 Sheffield United ground. P resu m ab ly it is intended, at a la te r date, to designate
 the grounds of clubs in low er D iv isio n s, and there would appear to be no reason
 why the County Council should not, in due co u rse, if they think it d esira b le, ask the
 S ecre ta ry of State to include other sports stadia in subsequent O rd ers.

 B ecau se of the County C ouncil's lim ited initial involvement, it is s till my opinion
 that no in c r e a s e in sta ff w ill be required, but this must be qualified by the proviso
 that the situation w ill need to be kept under observation, and a further report w ill
 be made if it is n e c e s s a r y to r e v is e this opinion as a resu lt of the designation of
 further sp o rts stadia by the S ecreta ry o f State.

 It has b ecom e obvious from initial d is c u s sio n s , that safety ce r tific a te s w ill n e c e s s a r ily
 be lengthy and com plex docum ents, containing many conditions, and it is accordingly
 p roposed to s e t up working p arties of o ffic e r s from the A dm inistration Department,
 P o lic e , F ir e S e r v ic e , and the D istr ic t Council, in each D istr ic t, to m eet when the
 various • d iscip lin es concerned have c a rr ied out their inspections and formulated
 their recom m en dations, in ord er to s e ttle the form of the safety certifica te to be
 subm itted to C om m ittee.

 The A ct p rovid es that the County Council have a duty, when an application for a sa fety
 c e r tific a te is re c e iv e d to determ ine w hether the applicant is a p erson lik ely to be in
 a p o sition to prevent contraventions of the term s and conditions of the cer tific a te.
 Your o ffic e r s are of the opinion that, certa in ly so far as football grounds are
 con cerned, applications should be subm itted by the p erson in b eneficial occupation
 of the p r e m is e s concerned.
A fter a s a fe ty c e r tific a te has b een is s u e d , it w ill be n e c e s s a r y , from tim e to tim e,
to c a rr y out in sp ection s to en sure that the conditions a re being com plied with.
The frequency of th ese in sp ection s w ill ob viously have a bearing on the staffing
situation, but it is su g gested that a detailed check should be made at the end of each
sea so n , follow ed by another about a month b efore the sta rt of the next sea so n
to en sure that any departures from the req u irem en ts of the certifica te found on the
fo rm er in sp ection have b een rec tifie d . Apart from th is, it is felt that a couple
of m ore g en era l checks during the s e a s o n should be adequate.

The County Council, the appropriate D is tr ic t Council and the Chief Constable are
em pow ered to authorise entry of th eir o ffice rs to sports stadia for the purpose
of making in sp ectio n s. A further rep ort on this and on the question of fixing fees
(if any) to b e charged for applications w ill be submitted at a la te r date.

In an em er g en cy situation, where there is a r isk to sp e cta to rs, the County Council
has the power to apply to a M a g istr a te s’ Court for an O rder prohibiting or restrictin g
the a d m issio n of sp ecta to rs until step s have b een taken to reduce the r isk to a
reasonable le v e l. E ven with v e r y carefu l m onitoring of a ll sporting a ctiv ities
taking p la ce in the County, it w ill not be p o ssib le to p redict e v e r y potentially
dangerous situation, which m ay b ecom e apparent at short n o tic e , and too late to
p erm it the making o f an application to the M agistrates to lim it the gate ( e . g . , if
B a rn sley played on a Saturday at L eeds in the F . A . Cup and drew, and the rep lay
*was on the following Tuesday): "'It w ill be nfettessary, th e r e fo r e ( fbryolr officers'a
 to exam ine the situation in an endeavour to identify a ll potentially dangerous
 sp o rts grounds, and if n e c e s s a r y , make applications in re sp e c t o f them as they are
 identified.

 To su m m a r is e , th erefo r e, the C om m ittee a re asked to adopt the following
 re co m m endations: -


 1.      That the work of co-ord ination be undertaken by the A dm inistration
         D epartm ent.

 2.      That working p a rtie s of o ffice rs be constituted for each D istrict, as
         outlined in this rep ort.

 3.      That the su gg ested frequency o f in sp ection s be approved.

POPPLEWELL INQUIRY - SPORTS GROUNDS/FOOTBALL GROUNDS

You will recall that at the Police Panel meeting in Eastbourne on 9 September
Councillor Moores mentioned procedures being taken in South Yorkshire to
ensure closure of unsafe grounds. It was agreed that this information be
circulated to all member authorities.

I wonder if you would be kind enough to let me have a copy of what he was
referring to.

Yours sincerely

I have sant to you under separate cover, a copy of the Interim Report
of the Popplewell Committee of Inquiry and a copy of Home Office
Circular No. 54/1935 xalating to both the Interim Report and the
earlier Chief Fire Officer Reports requested by the Home Office.

Naturally, the Fire Service Committee will be expecting a report at
their next meeting (on 5th September, 1935) on the Interim Report,
and I would suggest that it might be mutually advantageous if your
Assistant Chief Officer (Fire Prevention) were initially to discuss
the matter informally with Mr. D. Vaughan of my staff (in his
capacity as Co-ordinator of the Officer Working Parties on Safety of
Spt'E-t-s..Grounds.-Act matters)     - • ,■.              —

Friend the Minister responsible for spon will be looking
further ai the financial implications with the interests

Local authorities and local fire authorities have sufficient
statutory powers to ensure that essential fire safety
requirements are complied with. These will in no way be
affected by the separate proposals directed towards
 streamlining the present law on fire precautions published
yesterday in a consultative document and which I am
 inviting the inquiry also to consider in the context of its
 work.

INTERIM REPORT JULY 1985 ( CMND 95&5 )




GOVERNMENT RESPONSE TO RECOMMENDATIONS




GROUND MANAGEMENT


RECOMMENDATIONS


1•       Evacuation procedures should be a matter of police braining-
and form part of the briefing by police officers before a football
match.    (Paragraph 3-9).

certificates in respect of designated grounds should, as heretofore,
include police officers.     (Paragraph 3-15)



Certificating authorities and chief officers of police will be
invited to act upon these recommendations (see also Recommendation 10).




RECOMMENDATIONS


6.       Those maraging sports grounds not governed by safety certificates
should give serious consideration, with the assistance of fire authorities,
to the presence in a ground of suitable fire fighting equipment.
(Paragraph 3-5*0


7-       Stewards at all sports grounds should be trained in fire fighting.
(Paragraph 3-55)


8.       In designated grounds it should be a term of the safety certificate
that an adequate first-aid room should be provided.         (Paragraph 3.99)




                                        1
 10.    Stewards in all grounds should not only be trained in fire
 precaut ions and fire-fighting (see Recommendation 7 above) but should
 also be trained in how best to help the po 1ice in evacuation.
 (Paragraph 3 .10*0
                                             :



 1^•    Suitable and adequate exits should be provided in all sports
 grounds.   (Paragraph 3-138)

15.     No smoking should take place in combustible stands, that this
should be a condition of entry to the ground that signs tc that effect
should be prominently displayed ana this should be a condition of
entry to the ground.     (Paragraph 3-1^1/


The relevant sports authorities will be invited to draw the attention
of sports grounds managers tc these recommendations, ana certificating
authorities will be asked to consider reflecting the recommendations
in new or amended safety certificates as appropriate in the case of


ready to advise on equipment and assist with training as appropriate.




RECOMMENDATION


9.     There should be urgent consultation between the Health and Safety
Executive and the fire authorities and local authorities as to how best
to co-ordinate and communicate their inspections and reports.
(Paragraph 3-95)


The HSE has appointed a member of its Executive to review liaison
arrangements between its inspectors and the fire authorities.     He will
consult Government Departments and others in this review, the results of
which will be made public.




RECOMMENDATION


16.    Fire Authorities should identify and visit all sports stadia in their
areas and should prohibit or restrict the use of any stands which, in their
view, constitute a risk to spectators because c-f the inadequacy of the fire '
precautions.     (Paragraph 3-1^2)
  Chief Fire Officers in England and Wales were invited by the Home Secretary
  on 16 Msy to inspect all sports grounds and were reminded of the powers
 available to them to take emergency action if, in their view, fire hazards
 constituting a risk to spectators are revealed.    The Secretary of' State
 for Scotland similarly asked Firemasters to inspect sports grounds in Scotland.
 Reports received show that fire brl^cfes have not hesitated to recorcrnend
 emergency action where necessary, including in a number of cases a prohibition
 on the use of stands or a restriction on the number of spectators allowed
 into them.




RECOMMENDATION


17 -    In order to ensure a complete record of sports grounds a




Consultation will take place with the local authority associations to
establish how such records may best be compiled and maintained.     The
recent visits of the fire brigades ''see Recommendation 16) should have
in practice marshalled much of the relevant data already.




STRUCTURES


RECOMMENDATION


13-    Building of new permanent stands of combustible materials
should be prohibited as a general rule.    (Paragraph 3-132)


This recommendation will be given speedy and urgent consideration
by the Departments who are responsible for building regulations.

    GREEN GUIDE


    RECOMMENDATIONS


    *J-    The Green Guide should be amended to include in Paragraph 11 a
 provision that, wherever practicable, roads within a quarter of a
 Pile of a sports ground should be kept entirely free of parked vehicles.
 (Paragraph 3-35)


           Paragraph 6.I*>‘.5 of the   Greer Guid~- s/iould De amended to read:
 "All exit gates should be manned at all times while the ground is usec
 by the public and be capable of be inf. opened immediately frcn insic-.
 by anyone in an emergency.”      (Paragraph 3 -HI)


           The Green Guide         be amended to contain a specific provision,
ir. relation to stewards,


           (i)     that they should be trallied and instructed to
           deal with any emergency relating, to fire or evacuation
           (see also Recommendations 7 and 10 ) ;


          (ii)     that they should be given written instructions
          about the action to be taken in cases of emergency;


          (iii)    that they should receive practical instruction
r         and training appropriate to their responsibility;


          (iv)     that no one should be employed as a steward
          unless they have been so instructed and trained; and


          (v)      that they should be adequate in number, physically
          and mentally capable of performing their duties, effectively
          deployed, effectively supervised and readily identifiable.
          (Paragraph 3-117)


19.       The next edition cf tne Green Guide should ruake it clear
that it applies to all sports grounds.        (Paragraph 3-15*0




                                       K
 These points will be noted for inclusion in the next edition of the Green
 Guide which will be needed after the Inquiry's final report is received.
 Action will not however depend upon the availability of a fresh edition and
 certificating authorities and chief officers of police (Recommendation *0
 will be invited to take such steps as are open to them now.




 CROWD MANAGEMENT


 RECOMMENDATIONS


 5.    Consideration should be given to making it a-criminal offence
 in England and Wales to have a smoke bomb or similar device at sports
grounds.    (Paragraph 3-^2)


22.    There should be a specific offence of throwing a mis'sile at
sports grounds. (Paragraph 6.57)


The case for inviting Parliament to create new criminal offences on
these lines will be studied urgently in connection with the Government's
■intention of introducing legislation in the next session of Parliament
following its review of the law relating to public order.




RECOmENDATIONS


20.    Urgent consideration should be given by football clubs in
England and Wales to introducing membership system so as to exclude
visiting fans.     (Paragraph 6 .*48)


23•    Football clubs should review their arrangements for entry and
the organisation of their turnstiles.    (Paragraph 6.62)


Both these recommendations are for football authorities and clubs, but the
Government hopes that they will be given serious consideration.    The
Government has been encouraging the Football Association and the Football
League to introduce a scheme of membership cards and the options are currently
     being considered in a Footb?jl League working group:                                that prr>upr3
     attention will therefore be drawn to the Inquiry's Fecc-rrnendation 20.
     The governing bodies' attention will E i r e be draw;- to Recommendation 23
     which might be influenced by decisions upon Recommendation 20 .

MISCELLANEOUS


RECOMMENDATIONTS



3-         Early attention should be giver, by t.l.-: Horne Office Fir~ector=t‘
of Tel ecommu ni ca hie nr- to consider the practicality of rrodueing a norg
suitable personal radio for the police.                            (Farecrarh


18.       Consideration should be given as hov best to deal with temporary
stands and marquees                  (Paragraph 3.151)


2^-       Consideration should be given to the design of a standard,
efficient perimeter fence, with proper e;:lts.                               (Paragraph 6 .63 )


Each of these will be studied as the Inquiry advises.                                    Recommendations
18 and 2^ may best be taken forward in the context of the Inquiry's next
stage and when it turns to examine the Green Guide as a whole.
    PROVISIONAL RECOMMENDATIONS


    (To be reviewed in the Final Report)


    1.         I am minded to recommend that in England and Wales the police should
    be given the unfettered right of search before entry to football grounds by
    Statute.'      (Paragraph 3-^1)


    2.        I am m i n d e d   to recommend that Section 10 of the Fire Precautions Act 1371
    should be amended with a view to giving the Fire Authority power in cases other
    that', those which are regarded as wholly exceptional               (Paragraph 3-61)


    3-        Linked with the above, I am           rr-inccd to recommend that consideration
    should be given to introducing legislation giving powers for the Fire Authority
    to apply to the High Court for an injunction (or to the Court of Session for
an interdict in Scotland) under Section ]0 of the Fire Precautions Act 1971.
 (Paragraph 3-61)


■        _    I      minded      to iecouLfiervd tftair Sec-ti-on 10 ;-T "cue oafeffi at’-Sports 'Grounds :'
Act 1975 should be amended in like manner to Section 10 of the Fire Precautions
Act 1971 (see Provisional Recommendations 2 and 3) and an application to the
High Court for an injunction (cr to the Court of Session for an interdict in
Scotland) should be an alternative remedy.                   (Paragraph 3-76)


5.            I am m i n d e d to recommend that the Secretary of State shou11 exercise his
powers to designate all sports grounds, whatever their size to include indoor
as well as outdoor activities.                (Paragraph 3-1^5)


6.           I am minded to recommend immediate designation of any ground
capable of holding over 5,000 spectators, to cover all sports grounds,
not merely football grounds.                 (Paragraph 3-1^6)


7.           I am minded to      recommend that consideration should         be given to
providing the police with additional powers of arrest under the
Public Order Act, 1936.              (Paragraph 6.66)


8.           I am minded to recommend that consideration should              be given to
creating a specific offence of chanting obscene or racialist abuse
at a sports ground. (Paragraph 6.67)


These are noted and the Government will stand by to assist the
Inquiry in its further consideration of the matters.

           These minutes were f o r 1inform a t i o n only as they had
           p reviously been c irculated and corrected.

    3.     Reports

           Mr.        asked members if they had any ^problems
                                                          _   which
           they wished to raise or items w hich they thought might
           interest the Committee.

           Mr.                     [indicated that his Authority was
           unhappy wit h the way in w h i c h one of the designated clubs
           in his area was letting things slide.        He informed the
™          Committee that a meeting had b e e n arranged with a view to
           limiting the capacity of the ground.

           General d i s c u s s i o n took place regarding testing,      inspections

t        - tests 'have been main t a i n e d a n n u a l l y o n ■-ar-percentage ,basi.s   -
           Most clubs are required to furnish structural and electrical
           certificates.   Grounds are inspected at least annually by
           the Fire Service, Police and Engineers, either together or
           individually.

           A number of members were concerned about Stewarding of the
           ground and consi d e r e d the steward system- tended to break
           down for a variety o f reasons.       It w a s ‘generally felt that
           properly trained stewards possibly with certificates of
           competence were necessary.       W here training was given by the
           local A u t hority this was mainly carried out by the Fire
           Service.

^          Discu s s i o n took place on the value of electrically controlled
           gates, Mr.|              I                I said that the system
           installed at the N e w castle ground had now been abandoned
           after failures.        Mr .1                    stated that the system
           installed at the Ipswich ground was very successful and was
           operated from the police control b ox.           The cost was around
           £7,000 . Mr. |    _________________________ said that his Authority
           had bee n quoted £1,000 per gate plus cost of external wiring
           and equipment.

           It was raised that the de s i g n of electrically operated doors
           should consider such items as power, power failure, alarm
           system and also the p o s s i b i l i t y that if 25 people pushed
           against the gate it would open even if electrically locked.
           This final item was objected to on the same grounds as that
           of installing panic bolts.          That is, that any form of door
           opening device w hich could be operated by spectators could
           lead to them opening the doors to allow other people into
           the ground thus causing even more problems.
It was agreed that for the bene f i t of Authorities new to
the Safety of Sports Grounds Act, a list of Authorities
who already had desig n a t e d grounds would be circulated to
enable the new A uthorities to contact others who may have
d ealt with similar problems in the past and would be able
to give advice on the form of the Certificate .

R oller shutter and sliding doors were discussed and although
these were frowned upon in the Act some Authorities accepted
them until they could be replaced.

D i scussion took place on the p oint made by Mr.
                   that some club directors felt they were not
gett i n g the same consi d e r a t i o n as other clubs. It was
gen e r a l l y agreed that A uthorities used the same basic guide
lines but although there were similarities in grounds, the
conditions with respe ct to the features of the grounds,
p a r t i cularly in respect of timber stands, were not the same,
and therefore each case had to be treated on its merits.

"Post Bradford"


commenced,-;          -summary by M r . __________________________ |-of^ithe
situation in his Aut h o r i t y since the fire at Bradford City
F.C.     Bradford City was non-des i g n a t e d ground.     In order
that the club could apply for a grant to assist with the
rebui l d i n g of the timber stand roof, the County Council had
inspected the ground and sent a letter to the club.                A number
of items were included in the letter including reference to
the litter beneath the stand.           The Authority has since been
•criticised for not taking action but the application of-
Section 10 implies the action should be reasonable.                It is
easy to be wise after the event but prior to the fire it was
not felt to be reasonable to apply for a Section 10 Order
w ith only one game to be played that season.             The work to
r e f urbish the stand was to commence in the week following
the final game.

W e s t Yorkshire have made about 16 recommendations to the
Popplewell enquiry.     The main recommendations are as follows

1)   All ground should be designated.

2)   All timber floored stands       should be phased out.

3)   All exits should be colour coded with alternative routes
          indicated on tickets.

4)   All stewards to be trained by the Fire Service and be
      issued with a certificate of competence.

5)   Before a game is played a nominated Director should
      certify to the referee that the terms of the certificate
     have been complied with.
6)   Counties should continue to be responsible not the
      District Councils.

Mr.|      |felt that the events at Bradford have raised
the following questions

1)      W ould Authorities use Section 10 ?

2)      How many Authoriti es have used Section 10 ?

3)      How r igorously will the code be used?    Here Mr.
        cited the case at Keighley RLFC, who have a timber stand
        w ith rooms beneath.   It is possible by means of the
        removal of the front pallisade to make easy egress from
        the stand to the pitch.    However, there is no fire
        resistance in the rooms beneath the seating area and the
        cost to provide adequate fire protection would be high.
        This raises the problem.    Should the club be forced to
        provide the fire   p rotection or have the stand closed
        or, is the easy means of escape considered to be adequate'
        This type of problem will face Authorities in the future.

  Following the Report by I                                                                                  I
                                                                                                             ) was
  invited to speak on "Clause 1.5".                                        He raised the point that
  since Bradford, his A u thority had checked the Norwich City
  ground which had been p r eviously designated.                                             .He reported^..
. t h a t ; l i i f f ^ A u t h o r i t y " h a d 1 ' o r i g i n a l ly A c c e p t e d ' a    t a n d : •'    .^
  corr u g a t e d ' i r o n external boundary fence, parts of which h a v e
  since been rebu i l t to an acceptable standard.                                             Would it be
  reasonable to allow r eplacement over a period of time as was
  at first envisaged?                           On this particular inspection it was
  found that there were problems with stewarding but probably
  lack of commu n i c a t i o n was to blame.

With regard to the perimeter fence Mr,
said that his Aut h o r i t y included a clause in the Certificate
reg a r d i n g the renewal over a period of the external perimeter
fence.

A q u e s t i o n was then asked about the loading used for a perimete
fence or wall.         General a g r eement was that this should be the
5 KN/M load.         Mr.            [indicated that crush barriers have
been erected adjacent to exit gates to keep the crowd away
from the perimeter wall.

D i scussion then took place regarding inspections and problems
w ith implications on n o n -designated grounds.

 Mr.                    repo rted that the Greater Manchester Council
 had'de c i d e d that 48 grounds should be inspected.    These were
 for a variety of sports including cricket, greyhound racing,
 speedway etc.        Mr.                       stated that his
 Aut h o r i t y were carrying out similar inspections but expressed
 his concern about liability for non-designated grounds such
 as T rent Bridge.        Mr.                  said his Authority
 had r ecommended to the Popplewell enquiry that the limit per
 de s i g nation should be reduced from 10,000 to 3,000.     GLC
 have inspected 3 0 grounds so far with a further 100 or so to
 go.      They have produced a form of letter w hich indicates work
 to be done immediately, work to be done over a period and work
 which is recommended.
                               - 5 -


     Mr.                           indicated that his legal section
     were saying that the Guide    to Safety at Sports Grounds
     (Football) only applied to football grounds and other grounds
     should be subject t o •the previous Guide.   Also the legal
     section were looking for a    statement that the ground is "safe'
     whereas the inspectors of the ground are only willing to
     state that the ground does or does not comply wit h the Code.
     This is a source of conflict.

     Most Authorities appear to be using the football guide and
     Mr. |                  (commented that his Authority were a
     little wary of involvement with non-designated clubs at the
     moment as again the question "is the ground safe?" was raised
     and this is impossible to answer categorically.   Some
     Authorities have a manpower problem with regard to structural
     inspections while others like Kent have inspected a large
     number of grounds.

      Mr.                        w o n d e r e d if rather than await problems
      Authorities should search out grounds which could fall into
      the Section 10 category.         He also wonde r e d if non-designated
      grounds should be inspected as his Authority has pulled back
     .from inspecting _so far. although the Fire Service are
      inspecting11 urider Fire ■oervice R e g u l a t i o n s ’"in accordance
      the Home Office letter.        D i scussion revealed that many
      Authorities are inspecting n o n -designated grounds which lead
      to the feeling that, where clubs with n o n -designated grounds
      e xpected a large crowd i.e. cup matches or similar, the
      match should be played on the nearest desi g n a t e d ground.
      Mr.|                               gave the example that at Walsall
      some 2 years ago a wall c o llapsed when there were 20,000
      spectators on the ground.          Since then any matches with over
      10,00 0 spectators are played on nearby grounds.                  Newport
      County were hoping to achieve an 18,000 limit on their
      ground but the crowd at B o u r n emouth was fixed at a low level.
      It was considered to be vital that maximum capacity crowds
      were all ticket,     Mr.                                       pointed out
      that even with all ticket matches there could be some
      spectators left outside the ground without tickets who could
      cause a problem.     Watf o r d hold back 2 to 3,000 tickets in
      case of such an emergency.

      It was agreed that each Aut h o r i t y should send the Secretary
      a summary of its method of deal i n g with non-designated
      grounds for d i s t r i b u t i o n to all members.

7)    Stability of Brick Walls

      Mr.                          cited the case at Birmingham
      where there was a riot at the match.    The ground was not
      cleared until an hour after the game and during that time
      the police charged some Leeds supporters who retreated into
      an area not normally used and put pressure on a wall which
      collapsed.   This raised the point that should any wall,
      regardless of its location, be able to support crowd pressure?
      The wall w hich collap sed was 9 inches thick but it was pointed
      out that even a wall 18 inches thick was suspect at 6 feet
      high.
                                     -   6   -



      Disc u s s i o n raised the point of reasonableness and a suggestion
      made was that barriers would possibly be a more economical
      way of keeping spectators away from support walls.        It was
      agreed that walls should be checked for the corresponding
      forces parallel and at right angles to the flow depending
      upon location.

      Test i n g of H andrailing

      T e s t i n g of handra i l i n g appeared to have more practical
      difficulties than the testing of barriers but discussion
      re v ealed that h a n d r a i l i n g should be tested where v e r possible.

9.    Implications of N o n - D e s i g n a t e d Grounds

      This matter had been d ealt w ith during the earlier discussion.

10)   L i c e n s i n g fees

      ^
      Mr.                              said his Authority charged the actual
      costs for the certificate but expressed his concern regarding
      no n - d e s i g n a t e d grounds w hich did not require a certificate
      and also the annual cost after the issue of a Certificate.

      Mr.                                   explained t h a t - h i s :A u t hority
      charged the economic rate for the certificate and also
      charged the costs thereafter.           Mr.|
      agreed that his A u t hority made the same charges but was not
      re a l l y sure what to do about non-designated grounds. General
      d i s c u s s i o n revealed the feeling that at this stage there was
      no method of recov e r i n g costs from non-designated grounds
      while many other Authorities such as Lancashire, GMC and GLC
      did not make annual charges.           Some like Nott i n g h a m s h i r e and
      South Yorkshire did not charge at all.

11)   Any Other Business

      a)    Mr ___________________________ informed the Committee that his
            A u thority were at pres e n t studying preliminary plans for
            acovered "Super Bowl" type stadium at Blackpool which
            w ould not only house the football club but would be a
            multipurpose centre.

      b)    Respons i b i l i t y for Test i n g

            M r .|                         |raised the point that his
            Authority, in common w ith others, accept a certificate
            from Consultants that barriers have been tested.          In
            spite of this he w o n d e r e d who was responsible for the
            results.      It emerged from discussion that it was believed
            to be the Authorities' responsibility to ensure the
            competence of the Consultant.         Mr.|
            said one of his clubs had bought a testing machine and
            the Aut h o r i t y required a Chartered Engineer to carry out
            the tests.

     c)   Stewarding

          Mr.                          informed the Working Party
          that his Authority were in the process of producing a
          training schedule for stewards and pointed out that the
          Guide to Pop Concerts was useful in this respect.

     d)   N e x t Meeting

          It was agreed that a further meeting should be called
          after the implications of the Popplewell enquiry become
          known.

object of d e t e r m i n i n g how best local registration of sports grcrnds
might be achieved ( R e c o m m endation 17).        As for the nature of
materials used in c o n s t r u c t i o n of new stands (Recommendation ’ 3),
it is s u gg ested that b u i l d i n g and p l a nning authorities continue;
their present p r actices unless and until further advice is received.

B.     CHIEF      FIRE OFFICERS            REPORTS     ON SPORTS      GROUNDS

8 . The Home S e c r e t a r y has expressed his gratitude to chief fire
officers for the prompt and efficient manner in which the survey
of sports g rounds has been carried out - see Annex A.                     Work on
a n a l y s i n g the reports is c o n t i n u i n g in the Home Office and a digest
of them will be s u b mitted to the Inquiry.                The Home S e c r e t a r y ’s
s t atements indicate the important results of the surveys on which
i mmediate ac t i o n has been taken by brigades.

9-      It is a p p r e c i a t e d that, in r e s p o n d i n g to Her Majesty's Chief
I n s pector of Fire Services' letter of 16 May to chief fire officers^,
some b r i g a d e s were only able to co n c e n t r a t e inspections on
u n c e r t i f i c a t e d sports stadia with a c c o m m o d a t i o n for more than 10,000
spect a t o r s (i.e. which could be d e signated under the Safety of Sports
Grounds Act 1975).                However, a large number of brigades in whose

exte.nd t-heir- in s p e c t i o n s to sports gpo'SCn-cTs with " A c c o m m o d a t i o n !for ■ <
far fewer than 10,000 spectators.                 Section 10 of the 1975 Act is
a p p l i c a b l e to sports grounds i r r e s p e c t i v e of the number of spectators
a c c o m m o d a t e d and it is important that those brigades which have not
so far inspected sports grounds with a c c o mmodation for less than
10,000 s p e c t a t o r s should do so as prior i t i e s and resources permit
so that stands which r e prese nt a serious fire hazard can be
i d entified and remedial action taken (Recommendation 1 6 ).

10.       An extra copy of this                   circular and Annexes is attached for chief
fire officers.             In view of             the p r o v i s i o n s of s . 16 of the Local
G overnment Act 1985 copies                       are being sent also to the Chief
E x e c u t i v e s of m e t r o p o l i t a n    district councils and London boroughs.

11.     Any     enq u i r i e s    should        be directed   to -                                    ^

   Secondly, all uncertificated grounds o f the third and

Friend the Minister responsible for sport will be looking
further at the financial implications with the interests
concerned in his working group on the financing of safety
improvements. Managements have responded in a co­
operative way and have either set necessary work in har.d
or are considering how to comply with the requirements -
Local authorities and local fire authorities have sufficient
statutory powers to ensure that essential fire safety
requirements are complied with. These will in no way be
affected by the separate proposals directed towards
streamlining the present law on fire precautions published
yesterday in a consultative document and which I am
inviting the inquiry also to consider in the context of its
work.
    My right hon. Friend the Secretary of State for Scotland
and I are grateful to chief fire officers and firemasters for
the prompt, efficient and careful manner in which this
 survey has been carried out. A digest of the reports will
be submitted to the inquiry.
    Thirdly, the House will, of course, be aware of the
rapid passage through both Houses of the Sporting Events
 (Control of Alcohol Etc.) Bill. It will be in force by the
 beginning of the football season.
    Fourthly, steps have also been taken to enhance police
 effectiveness next season. In England and Wales the
 Association of Chief Police Officers has introduced a new
 system for exchanging information about the conduct of
 fans, which should assist in anticipating and preventing
 trouble. Three o f the Home Office photographic vehicles
 will be available to be deployed at football matches,
 together with two experimental high-definition tripod-
 mounted cameras. This is in addition to the £500,000
 worth of closed circuit television equipment purchased
 through funds provided by the Football Trust.

PROVISIONAL RECOMMENDATIONS

(To be reviewed in the Final Report)


1.        I am minded to recommend that in England and Wales the police should
be given the unfettered right, of search before            entry to football grounds by
statute.'     (Paragraph 3-41)


2.        I am m i n d e d   to recommend that Section     10 of the Fire Precautions Act. ±971
should be amended with a view to giving the Fire Authority power m                 esses ocher
than those which are regarded as wholly exceptional               (Paragraph 3-61)


3-          Linked with the above, I am          ninded to recommend that consideration
should be given to introducing legislation giving powers for the Fire Authority
to apply to the High Court for an injunction (or to the Court of Session for
an interdict in Scotland) under Section 3.0 of the Fire Precautions Act 197i.
(Paragraph 3-61)

                                                                               v~.porto Groiiiiu;>
Act 1975 should be amended in            like manner to Section 10 of the Fire Precautions
Act 1971 (see Provisional Recommendations             2 and 3)    and   an application tothe
High Court for an injunction (cr to the Court of Session for an interdict in
Scotland) should be an alternative remedy.              (F^ragraph 3-76)


5.       I am m i n d e d to recommend that the Secretary of State should exercise his
powers to designate all sports grounds, whatever their size to include indoor
as well as outdoor activities.            (Paragraph 3-145)


6.       I am minded to recommend immediate designation of any ground
capable of holding over 5,000            spectators, to cover     all    sports grounds,
not merely football grounds.              (Paragraph 3.146)


7.       I am minded to recommend that consideration should             be given to
providing the police with additional powers of arrest under the
Public      Order Act, 1936.       (Paragraph 6 .66 ) _


8.       I am minded to recommend that consideration should             be given to
creating a specific offence of chanting obscene or racialist abuse
at a sports ground. (Paragraph 6.67)


These are noted and the Government will stand by to assist the
Inquiry in its further consideration of the matters.

Dear Sir

SAFETY OF SPORTS GROUNDS ACT 1975: DESIGNATION ORDER 1985
3RD AND 4TH DIVISIONS OF THE FOOTBALL LEAGUE

 1 .    You will no doubt already be aware that the Home Secretary in his statement
..of 13 May to the House of Commons -about, the inpident? at B e d f o r d City. FC and
.Birmingham C i t ^ F C ' e i p l a ^ e d ; that f?e intended' to ^extend .aesignatiori und?r      .
 Act to the remaining grounds of clubs in Divisions 3 and 4 of the Football
 League; and that in a subsequent statement in the House of Commons on 6 June, m
 reply to a Question by Mr                   Alton MP, the       Home Secretary announced that designation
 would also be extended to comparable grounds of clubs in Divisions I and II of
the Rugby League.

2.   The Designation Order covering all the remaining undesignated grounds of
clubs in the 3rd and 4th Divisons of the Footbal?.League that qualify .for
designation under the Safety of Sports Grounds Act 1975 has now been laid before
Parliament and this letter is concerned only with the effect of that Order.
(A separate Order covering the relevant Division I and II Rugby League grounds
has also been made and separate letters are being sent to the Chief Executives
of those authorities affected by this second stage of the designation programme.;

3.   I enclose accordingly a copy of the Order (SI 1063/85) which comes into
effect on 9 August 1985, after which date it will be an offence for
responsible for the ground to admit spectators unless an application has previously
been made for a general safety certificate under the Act.  As you will see, the
 ground of the following club in your area has been designated:

       Doncaster

 4.   The explanatory notes on the procedures to be followed in dealing with
 applications for general safety certificates and special safety certificates
 provided in Horae Office Circulars Nos. 130/76 of 25 August 1976 and 1^7/7
 8 December 1976 respectively, remain generally applicable except for    e as
 sentence of paragraph 7 of Home Office Circular No. 130/76. This gave some
 indication of the man/days ordinarily likely to be                     now been in
 safety certificate.   Experience over the years m which the Act has now ^ e n in
 operation indicates, however, that the amount of work involved for an au ^ r i t y
 before the issue of a safety certificate can in practice v a r y so widely dePending
 on the local circumstances that it is considered unrealistic to attempt any
 general guidance on this point.
5.    On the question of timing, the object in bringing the Order into effect at
this early date (as compared with the more leisurely timetable under previous
designation orders) is to ensure that the certification authorities will have
power to impose interim restrictions on spectator ceilings or other safety
measures before the start of the next football season, if this is considered
necessary in the interests of safety.      In such circumstances, the appropriate
spectator ceiling included in the certificate could sensibly be seen as essentially
an interim measure to meet immediate perceived risks and as thus reflecting what
could reasonably be allowed on the basis of existing facilities and resources at
the ground.      This would leave for further consideration at a later stage the
nature and scope of any remedial work needed in order to allow appropriate
upward revision of the ceiling and/or modification of other interim restrictions
(possibly in stages) by way of the issue of amended certificates as and when the
work is d o n e .

6.   Guidance on certification procedures generally, including possible ways and
means of dealing with the sort of staged approach suggested above, special
occasions and special safety certificates, is given in the explanatory Annexes
to HO Circulars Nos. 130 and 187 of 1976 - copies of which are enclosed for your
convenience, together with a copy of the Guide to Safety at Sports Grounds
(Football) to which reference is made in the first of these circulars.

7.    Also enclosed for your information, are copies of the letters which have
been sent to the football clubs about their responsibilities in this connexion.
"A copy o f "Appendices’ A and B" ■referred to in .these: leii-yrs la .»ot enolooed
because they'are the same as the Annexes to Home Office Circulars N o s . ‘130/76
 and 187/76.

                                                    Yours sincerely

Dear Sir

SAFETY OF SPORTS GROUNDS ACT 1975: DESIGNATION ORDER 1985
3RD AND 4TH DIVISIONS OF THE FOOTBALL LEAGUE

1.   The Safety of Sports Grounds Act 1975 (a copy of which is enclosed) gave
effect to the main recommendations contained in the Report of the Inquiry into
             ■H t’-'S ptrrtB : ^ ro u n tis.v ^ n i'c sh . 'Z jrrd    s a x tl’oy"’     't'hST   " T '

serious accident at Ibrox Park Football Ground in 1971-            The mairs instrument of
control under the Act is the general safety certificate which is required for
any sports stadium that is the subject of a designation order; and the relevant
county council has power to impose such terms and conditions under the safety
certificate as are considered necessary to ensure a reasonable standard of
safety at the ground, having regard to all the circumstances.

2.   In this connexion, you will be aware that since 1976, designation has been
extended, firstly to the grounds of clubs playing in the 1st Division of the
Football League and to certain so-called international grounds; then to the
grounds of clubs in the 2nd Division; and that more recently, following the
tragic incidents at Bradford City FC and Birmingham City FC grounds of 11 May,
the Home Secretary announced, in a statement to the House of Commons on 13 May
1985, that designation under the Act would now be extended to all the remaining
(as yet undesignated) grounds of clubs in the 3rd and 4th Divisions of the
Football League.

3.   The Designation Order (SI No. 1063/1985), a copy of which is enclosed,
has now been laid before Parliament.  The Order comes into effect on 9 August
1985, after which date it will be an offence under s .12(1) of the Act for those
responsible for the ground to admit spectators unless an application has been
made for a general safety certificate under the Act.

4.   As you will see, your ground is one of those included in the Order, and
this means that after 9 August no spectators can be admitted to fixtures at
your ground unless an application for a general safety certificate has already
been lodged with the county council.

General Safety Certificates

5.   For this purpose, one of the enclosed application forms should be completed
and sent with the supporting documents (as indicated in paragraph 1 of Appendix
A to this letter), to the County Council.   The application then falls to be
dealt with in accordance with the.,Act and the Safety of Sports Grounds (Regulations)
1976 (copy enclosed).
6.   Once application has been made, and pending the issue of a general safety
certificate, spectators may continue to be admitted to your ground as at present;
the timing of the issue of a certificate is entirely a matter for the local
authority to decide.  But you will appreciate that the object in bringing the
Order into effect at this early date (as compared with the more leisurely
timetable under previous designation orders) is to ensure that the certification
authorities will have power to impose interim restrictions on spectator ceilings
or other safety measures before the start of the next football season, if this
is considered necessary in the interests of safety.  In such circumstances, it
has been suggested to authorities that the appropriate spectator ceiling included
in the certificate would be seen as essentially an interim measure to meet
immediate perceived risks and as thus reflecting what could reasonably be
allowed on the basis of existing facilities and resources of the ground.   This
would leave for further consideration at a later stage the nature and scope of
any remedial work that might be needed in order to allow appropriate upward
revision of the ceiling and/or modification of other interim restrictions
(possibly in stages) by way of the issue of amended certificates as and when the
work was done.  It is suggested accordingly that you may find it sensible as a
first step to approach the authority with a view to establishing what interim
spectator ceiling might be acceptable on the basis of existing facilities and
resources, if it is not practicable for the time being to achieve the standards
of facilities or resources considered necesary in the interests of spectator
safety in order to permit maximum capacity usage of the stadium.



application -for -a general safety,,certificate.-is .set out in Appendix a to this ’ -
letter: paragraphs 3 to 7 will be of particular interest in relation to the sort
of staged approach suggested above, with particular reference to the problems of
special occasions or special circumstances.

Special Safety Certificates

8.   Appendix B covers the procedures for special safety certificates.  After a
general safety certificate has been issued, the need could arise for an event
which is not covered by the terms and conditions in that certificate either
because the activity itself is not named therein or because the terms and
conditions normally applicable to that activity are considered inappropriate for
the special occasion in question.  The Act provides for special safety certificates
for this purpose and guidance on the procedural matters concerning them is
contained in Appendix B of this letter.

9.   It should be borne in mind that, except with the permission of the local
authority, an application for a special safety certificate must be made at least
3 months before the event.  This period is necessary to ensure that no person
will be deprived of his rights of appeal under the Act, in cases where the full
procedure, for which the Act and Regulations provide, requires to be accommodated.
The period can therefore be relaxed only in cases where it is apparent that
individual stages of the procedure will not be required, e.g. where the applicant
has already been accepted as a qualified person.  It has also been necessary, in
order to keep the length of the required notice down to an acceptable level, to
apply a strict limit to the time available for each stage of an application for
a special safety certificate.

10.  In the light of the foregoing considerations, clubs and local authorities
will no doubt consider that the needs for special safety certificates should as
far as possible be reduced by widening the scope of the general safety certificate
on the basis suggested in paragraphs 6 and 7 of Appendix A but that, where they
continue to be required, applications should normally be made by the holder of
the general safety certificate (rather than the independent promoter of the
special event), giving as much notice as possible.
Special events: desirability of provision being made in the general safety
certificate                                                 —   —

11.  Once a general safety certificate is in being, all the requirements relating
to a special safety certificate, including the requirement of at least 3 months'
notice, automatically have effect.  Clubs will wish to bear in mind the possible
difficulties that could arise if a special event were scheduled to be held at
the ground within 3 months of the grant of the general certificate.  Local
authorities should therefore be made aware of any such event which has already
been arranged or which is arranged within the next 6 months or so, so that they
may as far as possible provide for the requirements for the event to be covered
in the general safety certificate.  Otherwise, there could be insufficient time
remaining for a special certificate to be considered.

Fees

12.  Section 6 (1)(b) of the Act provides for regulations to be made as regards
the fees to be charged in respect of applications for safety certificates, and
in accordance with the general policy that local authorities should be able to
charge economic fees for the work undertaken.   Regulation 14 provides accordingly.

certificates. In any case where an application for a special safety certificate
is not S d e by t£eb o l d e r of the general safety certificate, it should be
accompanied by ^ d e n c e of the applicant's status. Details of any planned changes

considered necessary to enable the local authority to discharge its ^ t i o n .
the Act. However, it is open to a local authority, under section 3 U ,
to require, by notice in writing, any further information of .his
may think it necessary to have to enable them to determine the terms and conditions
to be included in the special safety certificate.

Dear Sir

HOKE OFFICE CIRCULAR NO. 130/76

SAFETY 0? SPORTS GKOTTITDS ACT 1975 =
FIH3T DESIGNATION 0RDE3 AND ACCOMPANYING REGULATIONS

- .       intention was expressed in Home Office Circular No. 150/1975 of .ssuing, in
{ j ^ :ourso, further ruidance on the procedure to be followed when a ground is aesignated
'vxStr tholafety of Sports Grounds Act 1975      requiring a safety certificate. As
will be seen from the enclosed copy, an order has now been cade U i i?/o ..o.^o-+; _    _
designating under the Act, with effect fron 1 January^1977,^the^inte._at^cnai association
"     a     j         i   t   k   i   i   i   o       s       s        .ef-jtaa-vAubs-, m   •tilts..^ire*. -a.**.   ~

    2. It is an offence under section 12(1) of the Act to adnit spectators to a designated
    stadiun after the date cn which the designation order relating to it ccr.es into
    operation, unless an application for a general safety certificate has been nade and net
    subsecuently withdrawn or deemed to have been withdrawn. In consecuer.ee, >.here*o_e,
    of this order, the local authorities for the areas in which the grounds ar« situated
    may expect to receive by the date of operation applications for the grant of general
    safety certificates under the Act, which will thereupon fall to be dealt with in
    accordance with the Act and the regulations, also enclosed cade under section b(1) of
    the Act (SI 1976 No. 12b3)*

        Guidance as to the trocedurs to be followed, in conformity with the regulat-Lons,
    ; ^Mealing with acplications for general safety certificates is set out m the annex
    ic^^his circular.

    it. It is not pronosed at this stage to issue guidance as to the procedure to be
    followed in connection with the grant of special safety certificates, since, under
    section 5(2) cf the Act, such certificates are not required until general safety
    certificates are in operation. Further guidance for this purpose will accordingly ce
    deferred until nearer the date when a need for special safety certificates ray arise.
    There is, however, one ractcr regarding the issue of such certificates v m c h rr.av bave^
    a bearing on the date of the introduction of a general safety certificate and to winch
    regard snould accordingly be paid. Once a general s a f e t y certificate has been issued,
    a person wishing to conduct an activity calling for the issue of-a special safety
    certificate must comply v.lth all the requirements relating to such certificates laid
    dovr in the regulations. Where, therefore, such an event has already oeen arranged,
    local*authorities may vish to consider, where appropriate, the cesiracility o: not
     issuing a general certificate until after the event has taken place.

    5. The regulations provide specific time lirrdts for the determination of applications
    for special safety certificates, but tnis 13 not the case as regards genera^. s«— etv>
    certificates. Although local authorities and the clubs and other organisations operating
    stadia will no doubt have done as much pre-planning as possiDle, it is assumea tnat t..e

Undesignated Ground

Doncaster Hovers F.C. - A phased programme of redevelopment of this R a d i u m
had been revealed to the County Council in February this year with a view to
implementing sane, starting in the close season prior to commencement o f the
1985/36 season.

The aim is to complete certain improvements which will be in accordance with
the !,G.reen Guide” prior to the start of the new season and will allow a much
reduced crowd capacity of approximately 8,000.                                     Thi3 work will incorporate

Further work, as completed will increase the crowd capacity to a mar.imua of
approximately 16,000*

Since 1979, irrespective of whether they were designated or not, the five
grounds referred to above have been inspected twice per year* on a routine basis
by the Joint Officer Working Party set up by the County Council and consisting
of representatives from the County Council, Police, Local Authority - Building
Control Section and the Fire Service.

With undesignated grounds, the visits were done on a goodwill basis by agreem:,;:t
with the clubs concerned.   All clubs were made aware as to how their grounds
fell below the "Green Guide" standard and reduced crowd capacities were agreed.
These capacity figures have been subject to continual re-assessment to compensate
x’or either completion of work necessary to comply with the "Greer. Guide" or
games (e.g. cup games and local derbies) where large crowds were anticipated.

Sacn individual discipline of the Joint Officer Working Party has been in close
contact with the club:; concerned throughout this period to monitor progress of
any works carried out.

Since the fire at Bradford, all sports stadia and grounds in South Yorkshire
have been inspected by Fire Prevention Officers.  These include horse and
greyhound racing, speedway, cricket, rugby and football grounds, whether
subject to designation under the Act or not.

     Barnsley Football Ground,      ( Oakwell         )
     Grove Street,
     BARKSIJT.

     Your are cordially invited to a demonstration at Barnfley Football
     Ground.

     B a r and Re freshments will be provided.

     rt.S.V.P.         Please let us know if you will not be able to attend.
                                                               Thankyou.


                                 THE HYDRO-REMOTE FIREMAN                                    lJune 1985

       mtRO    tBe ’aufcilatic' Yeradte 'controlled hydrant^ \ a unique' device;
       to put out fires completely automatically in unmanned buildings or
       by remote control in crowded areas.

2.    The HYDRO is ideally suited for use on oil and gas riggs, in pumping
       stations, hotels, warehouses and most public and commercial buildings.

3.     The Hydro is particularly suitable for sports grounds where its
       links to close circuit TV monitors enables one man to control the device
       remotely and accurately and direct water to the point where
       a fire has started.   No need to wait for a Fire Brigade to arrive -
       fires can be tackled quickly and safely.

4.    The Hydro has a diffuser jet which can spread water over a wide
       area, equally the jet can be directed onto one person
       or small group of troublemakers, without affecting innocent bystanders.

       The soaking wet hooligans could be identified easily by the public
       authorities.

5.     With the benefit of hindsight it is apparent that both the Bradford City
       fire AND the Liverpool/Juventus disasters could have been avoided by the
       use of the HYDRO. Both disasters happened’, too quickly for conventional
       equipment to be used.

6.     Fire and hooligans can be controlled remotely and safely within seconds
       by use of the HYDRO.

T h i s method of Eoolipar.is~ control is well established, by using a

De f u s e r Jet      can be very accurate ie: to One person.



Indeed this would also serve a dual purpose from a Police point cf

view they would know e x a c t l y who the trouble makers were                                          I stress             .

the Jet can be accurately controlled remotely so £0 D a n g e r to

inrccent or otherwise people, but simply a method of control and

i dentification of trouble makers.                              ( as they would be soaking w et                          ;.



W i t h benefit of Hindsight I am sure y ou will agree that both the

B rad f o r d Fire and Liverpool/Italy Disasters could have been nim-,e j

in the rnr? by the use of THE H Y T E C , in view cf the fact tnat cotn

disasters were over very ouickly before conventional                                             fire control

amaratus        portable cf otherwise could be brought to bear.



On the snot reconisation of the situation both Fire and Eooliranism

can be controlled remotely within Seconds                                      plus the fact that

Additional Activities at Football Grounds

a)    General

      (i)         Mr. |
                      ________ asked the opinion of the committee
                  regarding a new stand which had been constructed
                  at Brighton A.F.C. which contained boxes, restaurant
                  etc.   He wished to know if activities such as parties
                  etc. held on days other than match days should be
                  covered by the Safety of Sports Grounds Act.

                  After discussion it was agreed that unless the
                  function was connected with an approved activity
                  using the field of play it need not necessarily
                  be considered under the Act.

      (ii)      Mr.      has received from one of his clubs a long
                list of activities which they consider should be
                covered by the Act and he asked if anyone else had
                received a similar request.  The only other Authority
                to have received such a request was the G.L.C.   Other
                Authorities received requests for each event in turn.

b)    Floodlit Cricket


     -cricket.'

     Mr.     described his association with Bristol City F.C.
     who have allowed floodlit cricket to be played on their
     ground for two years.  No problems have occurred with the
     crowd as the ground capacity was in excess of the attendance.
     An interesting point was that netting was erected at critical
     points in the ground where the cricket pitch was rather close
     to one of the stands.  To the question of who decides that
     netting should be erected Mr.     (answered that the club usually
     instigated the proposals due to their concern about any damage
     which may occur.   General points with regard to floodlit
     cricket were:-

      (i)       that any sport has hazards and this is understood
                 by spectators.

      (ii)      could be more danger to spectators due to darkness
                 beneath stands but dangerous areas could be protected
                 by netting if possible.

      (iii)       Ice hockey does not take any special precautions to
                  protect spectators.

     With regard to certification it was agreed that the special
     certificate would be in the same form as the General Certificate
     and would not need any special conditions, Mr.|__________paid
     his Authority had added cricket to the certificate without any
     changes.

     A short discussion took place regarding responsibility for
     sporting events.  Two examples were given. A spectator had
     tried without success to sue Watford F.C. after his son was
     hit in the mouth by a football.  Mr.|_________ quoted the
     example of people who were injured when they stood by a known
     bad bend on the motor racing circuit.   It was ruled that they
     knew the risks when they stood there.
e)   Tennis

     No difficulties were forseen with this activity,

a)   baseball

     Mr.I      quoted that baseball had been held at Grimsby F.C.
     and considered that it was the clubs responsibility to ensure
     the game was safe. A discussion then took place on the
     general point of whether other activities should be considered
     or not.  It was agreed that the clubs needed all the help they
     can get particularly as Mr.I_________ (pointed out that his
     International ground was only used four times a year. Mr.
     felt that a disclaimer regarding the Authorities responsibility
     for the safety aspects of other activities could be introduced.

e)   Athletics

     It was considered that field events would cause problems but
     that the rules of the Athletics Association would cover this.

f)   Rugby and Hockey

     These sports were considered to.be similar to football from
     the aspect of the Act.

g)   Pop Concerts

     Mr.          referred to the report of a Rolling Stones Concert
     held atSt. James * Park, Newcastle and pointed       out that the
     problems which arose were in general due to drunkenness.
     The capacity allowed at St. James' Park for the pop concert
     was t.hp   .game as that for a football match while Mr.[         1
     and Mr.|_________ |found that capacities in their grounds were
     less.

     Mr.     kave an example of a Rolling Stones concert held at
     the Bristol City F.C. Ground.     The capacity was assessed on
     exits and this was more than for a normal football match.
     For the greater part of the day there were only a relatively
     small number of spectators with capacity only being reached
     when the Stones appeared.   There were no crowd problems.    One
     problem which did occur was with the safety barrier around the
     pitch perimeter.  This barrier had to be crossed and a 7 metre
     long ramp was proposed ending in steps down to the terracing.
     As the steps were in line with the ramp this produced hesitation
     at the top of the steps and it was felt that there could be
     problems if an emergency occurred.    A solution would be to
     put a barrier across the top of the ramp and run the steps both
     right and left of the ramp.   Details of the proposed structures
     were only given three days before the concert and the calcula­
     tions arrived after the staging.    It should be pointed out to
     the organisers of the concert that the calculations and details
     of proposed structures should be submitted at an early date.
     A firework display was proposed to end the concert.     This was
     not allowed inside the ground but was held in a nearby park.
     The Local Authority is now prosecuting the organisers for
     excessive noise.  M r .1      1 pointed out that a special
     certificate requires three months notice.    Mr.     |said the
     original intention was to assist the Clubs but now they ask.
     for 4 months notice.

                              -   3 -
continued.

hr                a n d Mr.  both adhere to the G.L.t
" u, .^      11 ., i i ■ ^ .i,.
                                 pointed out that a
Music Licence only requires 28 days notice.

Mr.          ana ur,         have a lower density 011 tne
terracing for a pop concert alchough Mr.          said
that the police are so far objecting to spectators using the
pitch.

During discussion concerning the use of the pitch by
spectators at Pop concerts the following points emerged

(i)        Crowding onto the pitch adjacent to the stage was
           and accepted part of pop concert behaviour.

(ii)       Wide exit routes on each side of the stage as
            recommended in tne"Pop Code” are vital in case
            of emergency.

(iii)       It was admitted that the police would have difficulty
             in entering a crowd in front of the stage but the
             spectators at a pop concert are in general reasonably
             well behaved unless incited by groups or they become
       v:.r           f    ':r*3 l'?i .givo\7p-..i:s-late» Cun 2 1 dci"at'Ib:

             intended should perform with a view to not approving
             some groups who incite the crowd.

(iv)       From experience it was felt that a low police profile
            is the best with order administered by the Clubs
            stewards and the organisers stewards.

           Mr.         told of a proposed pop concert at
           Manchester Uniteds1 Ground for the weekend of the
           visit of the Pope to England which was cancelled
           because the District Council would not approve the
           noise levels which would occur at nearby houses.

Boxing and Wrestling

Mr,         gave examples of boxing matches held at Arsenal
F.C's Ground.  There was no problem with capacity as seating
was on the pitch and this seating governed the capacity.

Discussion then took place regarding the Miscellaneous
Provisions Act which comes into effect in January 1983
and takes licencing functions away from the Counties and
gives them to the Districts.  Concern was expressed regarding
the operation of this Act and the Sports Grounds Act with
separate Authorities involved. Mr.        H pointed out that
this situation had always applied in G.M.C. and after
initial problems a system of communication was devised which
seemed to be working.

Religeous Meetings

These meeting had been held on various grounds and capacity
is no problem.  Provided that any temporary structures are
checked and approved there would appear to be no objection
to this type of activity.
      j)      Markets

              Some clubs have had markets at weekends usually on the
              land adjacent to the ground.  It was pointed out that
              during such a market the stand at Bristol Rovers F.C.
              Ground burned down and the fire engines were delayed
              by the market.  It would appear that where a market or
              other activity is proposed access for emergency vehicles
              should be provided.

     k)       Dog Racing

              There is usually no problem with this activity as crowds are
              low although it was fou^d. that the Clubs do not want to open
              up all the ground and so it is necessary to ensure that
              sufficient Exits are provided.

     l)       Fireworks

             A firework display was held at Watford last year. Approval
             has been given provided certain conditions are complied with
             to hold a display at Bolton Wanderers ^'.C. Ground on 7th
-            November.  Notts. County F.C, have made a similar request
             but the Authority are concerned about the timber stands on
             the ground and have imposed the condition that no one
             should use these stands.

     •it)    Model      A i r c r a f t ".                     :

             A request for an exhibition of model aircraft to be held
             prior to a match by Manchester United was approved provided
             controlled line aircraft only were used.

4.   Any    O th e r   B u s in e s s

     a)      Periodic Testing of Barriers

                 _________ Raised the point that some of his Clubs felt that
             Mr. |
             a 5 year test cycle was too short and should possibly be
             extended to 10. Although most Authorities adhered to the 5
             year cycle it was felt that provided the Authority was satisfied
             there would appear to be no reason why the cycle should not be
             increased. With regard to the testing of each barrier three
             times M r . I       Isaid he did not feel that this should be
             reduced as his experience was that the first test tended to be
             sometimes unrepresentative due to the "tightening up" of all
             the parts of the barrier.     The second test appeared to be the
             real test with the third test as a confirmation,

     b)      Inspection of Structures

             Due to difficulties in providing inspectors Authorities appear
             to be asking clubs to provide them with a certificate signed
             by a qualified structural engineer.  G.M.C., South Yorkshire,
             Staffordshire and G.L.C. followed this method,

     c)     Wind Speed Gauges

              Where clubs had wind speed gauges installed the Authority
              had powers to prevent a match taking place over a certain ^>eed
                 So far these powers had not been used and doubt was expressed
            ’ that, at excessive wind speeds, it would be possible to play
              football anyhow.

                                             -   5   -
4.   d)   Pitch Perimeter Fencing

          The types of fencing in use v/ere discussed to see if any one
          type was used but it would appear that various types of fence
          are used with a mesh or bar infill.   There would appear to be
          no uniformity.

     e)   Electric Scoreboard at Overton F.C. Ground

          Mr „_______ of Merseyside C.C. asked the Secretary to raise the
          matter regarding the Electric Scoreboard at Everton F.C.
          Ground.    This scoreboard is in need of repair and the Club
          have requested Merseyside C.C. to assist them m obtaining
          funds from the Football League.    The League have said that
          unless the Scoreboard is a requirement of the Safety Certifi­
          cate they will not assist . Mr.I ^ 1 said he is not minded
          to impose such a requirement at this stage and asked the
          opinion of the Working Party.    After discussion the working
          party tended to agree with Mr.          and felt that the
          Authority could only make demands if the Scoreboard was dangerous

     f)   Non-designated Grounds

          Mr.I   n asked if Authorities had carried out inspections on
          grounds which are not designated. Many authorities had
          carried out limited inspections and given advice on a
          ;g a o d v r i i i   b a s i s ; / ' 5' '~v        ' " .    ■   /'%V   «'   ■'

          At     th e      c lo s e   Mr.
                                       of       informed the Working
                                             th e       m e e tin g
          Party that it would be his last meeting as Chairman as he
          was taking early retirement in the n ear future.    The Working
          Party expressed its thanks to Mr.,______ —for his work over the
          years and wished him a long healthy and happy retirement.

          Mr.I    H then undertook the task of seeking a sucessor from
          the County ‘Surveyors Society if it is necessary to continue
          with the Working Party.

     FIRE PREVENTION - SAFETY OF SPORTS GROUNDS ACT 1975

1.   Following the Bradford Football Club disaster an urgent review of the
     sports grounds and stadia within the County was immediately commenced.
     The terms of reference of this review were:-

      (a)   to   examine all sports grounds of whatever size or sporting activity;

      (b)   to  particularly  examine                   stands   and     accommodation         provided       for

 To all           Chief Fire O f f icers


 Dear Chief Officer


 SAFETY AT SPORTS STADIA

 In the statement which the Home Secretary made to the House of
 Commons on Monday, 13 May about the fire tragedy at,. Bradford City
 football ground, he said that he was asking chief fire office rs
 i m m e d iately to visit un c e r t i f i c a t e d sports stadia in their areas
 to advise manag e m e n t on the steps they should take to secure proper
 standards of crowd safety in their particular circumstances.




 2.      I know that fol l o w i n g the Bradford fire, many chief fire officers
 will have already begun to review fire safety at football stadia
 in their areas, and that others will have this matter in hand. The
 purpose of this letter is to ask you, in accordance with the Home
 S e c r e tary's request, to arrange for visits to be made to all
 u n c e r t i f i c a t e d sports stadia in your area to discuss fire safety
 a r r a n g e m e n t s with management. For this purpose you will wish to b^ve
 regard to th-e d e f i n i t i o n of a "sports stadium" for the purposes of
 the Safety of Sports Grounds Act 1975.                This  is provided in section
 17 read in c o n j u nction with section           1 of the Act.  But since the
 combined effect of the relevant definitions is a little complicated
 you may find it helpful to have 'the               attached synthesis (see Annex)
 w hich sets out what the d efinitions              together comprise.   You will wish
 to note that the d e f i n i t i o n embraces stadia used for purposes other
 than football, eg athletics, cricket, tennis.                In his statement,
 the Home Secretary indicated that one of the matters which would no
 doubt be discussed was the o p e n i n g and locking of gates, and more
 gen e r a l l y chief fire officers will wish to bear in mind the advice
 contained in the Home Depart m e n t s Guide to Safety at Sports Grounds
 (Football) which was published in 1976 and is obtainable from HMSO.

 3.  In c a r r y i n g out these visits and discussions, chief officers
 will wish to have regard to the Home Secretary's a n n o u ncement that
 he intends to d e signate all grounds in the Third and Fourth Divisions
 of the Football League so that they become subject to the system of
 safety c e r t i f i c a t i o n under the Safety of Sports Grounds Act 1975.
 You will note from-the s t atement that the timing of i m p lementation is
be i n g urgently discussed with the football authorities) but in^
v i s i t i n g such grounds fire a u t h o r i t i e s will want to consider, in
the light of the Home D e p a r t m e n t s Guide to Safety at Sports Grounds
(Football) what m e a sures they will be recommending when d esignation
takes e f f e c t .

  . Although there are no i m m ediate plans to designate ^other sports
 stadia under the 1975 Act, p e n d i n g the results of the inquiry into
■the op e r a t i o n of the Act by Mr Justice Popplewell, which was aiso
 announced by the Home Secretary, chief fire officers will wish to
 bear in mind the p r o v i s i o n s of section 10 of that Act.         If in the
 course of visits to these stadia it becomes apparent that^there would
 be a serious risk to s p e c t a t o r s in the event of fire and that
 ap p r o p r i a t e remedial m e a s u r e s are not being taken, chief fire ofiicers
 will wish to c o n s i d e r i n v i t i n g their Council to take action under
 section 10 of the 1975 Act.

  5.      In his statement, the Home S e cretary recognised that the visits
  to sports stadia would be the more comprehensive if chief fire_
  officers were a c c o m p a n i e d by other members of the local a u t hority
  safety teams, but to avoid any d e l ay-he considered that the duty
  fell best i n i t i a l l y on c hief fire officers.      No doubt you will be
  l i a ising with the c hief exe c u t i v e on this matter, and for this _
'■"•pir’"f'frgi#vi-s'errd-rts'g-
  l e t t e r ‘is als©- :b s i n g sent 'to-chief-officers of- poll-ce. - --

 6.     Mr Justice Poppl e w e l l has already indicated that he would find
 it helpful to his inquiry, and par t i c u l a r l y in the context of making
 an interim report or r e c o m m e n d a t i o n s as suggested in the Home
 Secretary's statement, to have an early indication of the outc~\ne of
 the programme of visits to u n c e r t i f i c a t e d sports stadia.   I should
 therefore be grateful if you would let me have reports on the number
 and types of u n c e r t i f i c a t e d stadia in your area giving a brief o u t ­
 line of the results of your visits and discussions with management^
 and taking acco u n t of any views of other parts of the local authority
 safety team and the police.               This should include the extent to which
 the crowd safety a r r a n g e m e n t s of each stadium are regarded as
 s at i s f a c t o r y and, if not, the steps which are being taken to make
 them s a t i sfactory.        (Priority should of course be given to those
 Third and Fourth D i v ision grounds in your areas as yet undesignated
 under the 1975 Act.)             It would be helpful if these reports could be
 sent to me p r o g r e s s i v e l y in stages as parts of the task are completed
 and copied to the Chief Executive, co-ordinator of the safety teams
 and the c hie f o f f i c e r of police.        All reports should reach me not
 later than 12 July.            In the light of these preliminary reports,
 Mr Justice P o pplewell may wish to seek further information.

 7.    I re c o g n i s e that this task will represent an additional burden
 for your fire preve n t i o n department, and that it will probably be
 necessary to make short-term' a d j u s t m e n t s to your priorities.
 However, I know that I can rely on your cooperation to ensure that
 the fire service does all that it possibly can to prevent a
 r e petition of the kind of tragedy which occurred in Bradford.

 8.   The Home Office will,      of course,    keep local authorities       informed
E.R.




       of deve l o p m e n t s conce r n i n g the future designations which are to
       made under the Safety of Sports Grounds Act 1975.

SAFETY   AT SPORTS GROUNDS ACT            1975


The effe ct of section 1 read with section                   17 is that a sports

   purpose; and

   that a c c o m m o d a t i o n w h o l l y or subst a n t i a l l y surrounds   the

1.   The       purpose of        the Act       is to make provisions for safety at sports stadia
     and other sports grounds.

2 . power  is given   to the Secretary of State,     under Section i of the Act,
     to make Designating Orders which would       require sports stadia vi ih
     capacities of acre that    10,000  spectators to be covered     by a safety
     certificate.    Under Section 6(2) he may     make regulations for securing
     safety in sports grounds.   No such regula ti ons have been nade to date.

     Note:              Sports  Stadium  and Sports Ground are defined in Section 17.
                        They are different types of premises and are treated separately
                        by the varying provisions of the Act.

3.   The   Secretary of State has    made De signating Orders in respect of all
              isiur,

      to the 3rd Division, as is the case with Rotherham, the requirements
     of the Act are              still    imposed.

     The         Safety      Certificate,       which     is   the       principal      document     of   enforcement
     of the Act, must              co nt a i n : -

      if)           the number,    strength and situation of crush barriers.

      Applications for certificates are made to the County Council.   Terms
      and conditions imposed by the certificate are determined by a joint
      officers working party.   Such terms and conditions are drawn from an
      approved code of practice                      - The Green Code.



                                                           -   1   -
       There is an appeals procedure against                       any decision of the County Council.

       Section 10 gives the County Council power to complain to a Magistrates'
       Court in any case wh ere dangerous conditions exist.    The Court may
       prohibit the use of the whole or any part of a "Sports G r o u nd "*unti l
       work is carried out to reduce the danger.

       The   Co unty    Council       may     appoint        inspecto rs         to    enforce       the     provisions
       of the Act.

       Pines of up to £400 may be imposed for                           an offence if a person is found
       guilty on summary convict ion or to a                            fine or imprisonment up to two
       years on conviction on indictment.

 Dear Chief Officer


 SAFETY AT SPORTS STADIA

 In the s t atement w hich the Home S e cretary made to the House of_
 Commons on Monday, 13 May about the fire tragedy at Bradford City
 football ground, he said that he was asking chief fire officers
 im m e d i a t e l y to visit u n c e r t i f i c a t e d sports stadia in their areas
 to advise m a n a g e m e n t on the steps they should take to secure proper
 standards of crowd safety in their particular circumstances.
 Although the s t atement has been w i d e l y reported in the media, I
 ericl'oseY”1!’Q^'ycyur^tnfffi'          i< n / -a--',cc'F y 'of'- a n extract f p a m - ^ l c m s a - r c l : - 1■■-n-;*5--';r'
’which also covers the exchange foTl'Owing the s t a t e m e n t -■*

 2.      I know that fol l o w i n g the Bradf o r d fire, many chief fire officers
 will have already begun to review fire safety at football stadia
 in their areas, and that others will have this matter in hand. The
 purpose of this letter is to ask you, in a c cordance with the Home
 S e c r e t a r y ' s request, to arrange for visits to be made to all
 u n c e r t i f i c a t e d sports stadia in your area to discuss fire safety
 a r r a n g e m e n t s with management. For this purpose you will wish to have
 regard to the defin i t i o n of a "sports stadium" for the purposes of
 the Safety of Sports Grounds Act 1975.               This is p r o v i d e d i n section
 17 read in c o n j u n c t i o n with section 1 of the Act.        But since the
 combined effect of the r e l evant d e f i n itions is a little complicated
 you may find it helpful to have the attached syn t h e s i s (see Annex)
 which sets out w hat the d e f i n i t i o n s together comprise.           You will wish
 to note that the defin i t i o n e m b r a c e s stadia used for purposes other
 than football, eg athletics, cricket, tennis.               In his statement,
 the Home Sec r e t a r y indicated that one of the matters which would no
 doubt be discussed was the o p e n i n g and locking of gates, and more
 g e n e r a l l y chief fire officers will wish to bear in mind the advice
 c o ntained in the Home D e p a r t m e n t s Guide to Safety at Sports Grounds
 .(Football) w hich was p u b lished in 1976 and is o btainable from HMSO.

 3.  In c a r r y i n g out these visits and discussions, chief officers
 will wis h to have regard to the Home Secretary's a n n o u n c e m e n t that
 he intends to designate all grou n d s in the Third and Fourth Divisions
 of the Football League so that they become subject to the system of
 safety c e r t i f i c a t i o n under the Safety of Sports Grounds Act 1975.
 You will note from the s t atement that the timing of i m p lementation is
 b e i n g u r g ently dis c u s s e d w i t h the football authorities, but in
 v i s i t i n g such grounds fire a u t h o r i t i e s w ill want to consider, in
 the light of the Horae D e p a r t m e n t s Guide to Safety at Sports Grounds
 (Football) w hat m e a s u r e s they will be r e c r m m e n d i n g when design a t i o n
 takes effect.

 4.     A l t hough there are no imm e d i a t e plans to designate other sports
 stadia under the 1975 Act, p e n d i n g the results of the inquiry into
 the o p e r a t i o n of the Act by Mr Justice Popplewell, w h i c h was also
 an n ounced by the Home Secretary, c h i e f fire officers will wish to
 bear in mind the p r o v i s i o n s of s e c t i o n 10 of that Act.              If in the
 course of vi s i t s to these stadia it beco m e s apparent that there would
 be a serious risk to s p e c t a t o r s in the event of fire and that
 ap p r o p r i a t e r e m e d i a l m e a s u r e s are not b e i n g taken, chief fire officers
 will wis h to c o n s i d e r i n v i t i n g their Council to take ac t i o n under
 sect i o n 10 of the 1975 Act.

  5.     In his statement, the Home S e c r e t a r y r e cognised that the visits
  to sports st a d i a w o u l d be the more c o m p r e h e n s i v e if c hief fire
  officers wer e a c c o m p a n i e d by other memb e r s of the local aut h o r i t y
  safety teams, but to avoid any d elay he considered that the duty
  fell best i n i t i a l l y on chief fire officers.                    No doubt you will be
  l i a ising with the c h i e f e x e c u t i v e on this matter, and for this
^ u F p a s e ■ S ‘ end-Tfiff“:'ar-copy'       t f f f & i e t t e r ' Co h ± i ar ^ t:copy' Tjf this   •
  l etter is also b e i n g 'sent to c hief:'lffficers of'police .

  6.      Mr Justice P o p p l e w e l l has a l r e a d y i n dicated that he would find
  it helpful to his inquiry, and p a r t i c u l a r l y in the context of making
  an inte r i m report or r e c o m m e n d a t i o n s as s u ggested in the Home
  S ecretary's statement, to have an e arly i n d i c a t i o n of the outcome of
  the programme of vi s i t s to u n c e r t i f i c a t e d sports stadia.       I should
  t h erefore be. graceful-,if you w o u l d .let me have reports .on the number
  and types of u n c e r t i f i c a t e d stadia in your area giving a b r i e f o u t ­
  line of the resu l t s of your visits and d i s c u s s i o n s wit h manag e m e n t
  and taking a c c o u n t of any views of other parts of the local aut h o r i t y
  safety team and the police.                 This should include the extent to which
  the crowd sa f e t y a r r a n g e m e n t s of each s t a d i u m are regarded as
  s a t i s f a c t o r y and, if not, the steps w h i c h are being taken to make
  them s a t i s f a c t o r y . (Priority should of course be given to those
  Third and Fourth D iv i s i o n grou nds in your areas as yet und e s i g n a t e d
  under the 1975 Act.)             It w ould be h e l p f u l if these reports could be
  sent to me p r o g r e s s i v e l y in stages as parts of the task are completed
  and copied to the C h i e f Executive, c o - o r d i n a t o r of the safety teams
  and the c h i e f o f f i c e r of police.         All reports should reach me not
  later than 12 July.             In the light of t hese p r e l i m i n a r y reports,
  Mr Justice P o p p l e w e l l may w ish to seek further information.

  7.     I r e c o g n i s e that this task w ill r e p r e s e n t an addi t i o n a l bu r d e n
  for your fire p r e v e n t i o n department, and that it will p r o bably be
  n e cessary to make s h o r t - t e r m a d j u s t m e n t s to your priorities.
  However, I kno w that I can rely on your c o o p e r a t i o n to ensure that

          I made a few notes at this mornings meeting. Could you put something
          together for the Police C ommittee on the following lines please.

          Information to be supplied to Committee - the Act, Green Guide, FA/
          League Regs, legal powers of County Council (or extract summarising
          whe re appropriate), a specific question on legal powers - can we lay
          down the time/day of the match? Please ask Anne to help you out.

          Issues for the C ommittee to c onsider -

              Ticketing arrangements
              Fencing/Penning of spectators including safety of those
              penned in eg in the event of a crush or other incident

              Better facilities for away supporters eg more efficient means

               involvement of Prime Minister

          T h e se are obviously in random order and need knocking into shape.

          Another point to check on is the availability of professional advice
          eg architect or structural engineer. Can this be checked out before the
          Police Committee meeting and any necessary recommendations regarding
          consultations picked up.

SAFETY AT SPORTS GROUNDS AC T                1975
- PROGRESS REPO R T

Mr Vaughan, the Se c r e t a r y of the w o r k i n g group examining and a d m i n i s t e r i n g the
provisions of the Act, gave a brief h i s t o ry of what had been achi e v e d in South
Yorkshire.

He drew at t e n t i o n to the c o n d i ti o n c o n t a i n e d w i t h i n the general safety
certificate that 21 days notice mu s t be given to the County Council of any
pro p o s e d a l t e r at i o n s to the grounds.     He was aware that this was not h a p p ening
and asked Club Secr e t a r i e s to be mindful- of the fact that to fail to comply
with a c o n d i ti o n of the c e r t if i c a t e was an offence under the Act.

Chief S u p e r i n t e n d e n t C a r l i n asked if there was still in existence a v o l u ntary
code of safety adop t e d by Clubs not fall i n g w i thin the bounds of the Act, as
he was most d i s t u r b e d at the co n d i ti o n of Doncaster Rovers ground.  He was
worr i e d that s h ould dis t u r b a n c e s occur in the ground there was a surfeit of
large pieces of concrete and other p o t ential mis s i l e s w hich could be us e d by
unruly elements.

Mr Holloway a g r e e d with Chief S u p e r i n t e n d e n t Carlin that parts' of Belle Vuc
were in need of immediate and e x t e nsive renov a t i o n and said that he was to have
a meet i n g w i t h the C h a i r m a n of the Football Grounds Improvements Trust in order
to ascertain if there were m o nies a v a i l a b l e to Doncaster R o vers to improve their
ground.
C h i e f S u p e r i n t e n d e n t Carlin q u e s t i o n e d the d e t e r m i n a t i o n of the Directors at
the Club, as i m p r o vements had been spoken of for a number of years and noth i n g
h ad be e n done.             He reiter a t e d ' h is concern for the safety of police officers
on duty in the stadium, and e n q u i r e d of Mr V a u g h a n whether the County Council
co u l d assist.

M r V a u g h a n stated that as D on c a s t e r Rovers did not qualify u n d e r the Act, the
only way the County Council could help w o u l d be at the invitation of the Club,
and any changes r e c o m m e n d e d w o u ld have to be u n d e r t a k e n at the Club's expense,
but he did offer to visit Belle Vue, together wi t h the other memb e r s of the
w o r k i n g group s h o u l d the Club so wish.     Mr H o l l o w a y thanked Mr V a u g h a n for the
offer, w h i c h If e felt w o u l d be accepted.                                      ■ *

SE G R E GA T IO N OF SP E C T A T O R S


C h i e f S u p e r i n t e n d e n t M o s e l e y i n t r o d u c e d this item, outlining a prob l e m o c c u rring
in the Lep p i n g s Lane s tand at H i ilsborough.                          Traditionally, the t e r r acing at
the L eppings Lane end had been a l l o c a t e d to 'away' supporters, but from
t i m e - t o - t i m e 'away' suppo r t e r s h ad also been allowed in the stand.      He was most
c o n c e r n e d at the c o nt i n u i n g sale of season tickets in the stand to S h e ff i e l d
W e d n e s d a y supporters i n c r e a s i n g the likelihood of confrontation.      He asked for
g u i d a n c e as to i n t e r p r e t a t i o n of the Safety at Sports Grounds A ct 1975 > 011 this
point.

’Mr V a u g h a n r e p l i e d that the c o n d i t i o n s for segr e g a t i o n of s upporters c o n tained
 in the Safety at S p orts G r o u n d s A ct had been interpreted as a p p l y i n g to s tanding
 areas and he was of the o p i n i o n that it did not apply to seated parts of grounds.

Mr Ches t e r stated that S h e f f i e l d W e d n e s d a y were aware of the prob l e m of home
supporters in the West Stand and h a d tried to reduce the numbers of season ticket
h o l d e r s from over 200 last s e a s o n to under 40 this f o r thcoming season.          He
p o in t e d out the pro b l e m s a s s o c i a t e d with this policy, as some of the season
ticket hold e r s ha d been u s i n g that stand since it was built for the 1966 W o r ld
Cup.

The C h a i r m a n point e d out that as s e a s o n tickets had already been sold to
S h e f f i e l d W e d n es d a y s u pp o r t e r s for the West Stand, the potential for
c o n f r o n t a t i o n w o u l d have to be b o r n e in mind wh e n arrangements for po l i c i n g
m a t c h e s were made'.                                                               '

 stated that with effect from 1 S e p t e m b e r 1984, it was expected that there would
 be an appr o xi m a t e increase in c h a r g e s of k . 8 % to reflect a similar increase
 in police pay.

 There was no d i s s e n si o n from this p r o p o s e d course of action and Mr W a t s o n further
 i n d i cated that in r e s p e c t of each game Clubs would be allowed 21 days to meet

 commenced.
Mr Ches te r s t ated that Clubs w o u l d ha v e a p p reciated advance notice of the
increased cha r g e s before sett i n g their a d m i ssion fees.             Mr W a t s o n replied that
the r e v i e w of p o lice pay was based on a w ages index (May to May figures) and
these we r e not r e l e a s e d u ntil late July each year.              To e stimate the proposed
increase w o u l d be d a n g e r o u s as e v i d e n c e d by the N U K dispute w h i c h had reduced

               The next        thing        I can r e m e m b e r    is the m a t c h b e i n g c a l l e d off a n d

                people      l e a v i n g the grou n d .       W h e n the a r e a h a d bee n c l e a r e d I the

                  attended a t      th. g y m n a . i u m u n d e r n e a t h the N o r t h S t a n d w h e r e       I was
                                                                                                                    194
                                                                            PACE      6
                                                                            R362      7
    told to accompany other officers whom I do not know in a transit van

    and we did a patrol     around the immediate        area of the outskirts of the

    ground.   In my opinion    this was    a complete waste of time as the only

    thing we did was get held up in traffic             and were no use whatsoever.

    Upon returning to Claywheels Lane at about 6.30pm we boarded a coach
                                                                0
    and returned to Rotherham, where I was stood down from duty at 7 pm.

    I was on duty at the same Semi-Final          last year and although I was not

    present at the Leppings        Lane end of the ground, I was on the         streets

    leading up that section        of the stadium.        I can r em ember that the

    Liverpool supporters     then were    heav ily drinking,      a l t hough no mention

    of any spare tickets was made        then.

    From where I was p o s i t io n e d outside   the    ground I have   to say that      I

    have never seen so many suppor ters arriving at             a match as late as the

    vast majority did that day, w hi c h in my mind i% the most             significant

    factor that caused the tragedy.

              Further           to m y         statement          of 4 M a y     1989       (040589),           after    th e     trouble        in

              the        pens       3 and       4 ha d      happened,         I started         to w a l k       with my        brother,

                                               and my       friend                                 from Pen        1 around           the    s i de

              of     the S o u t h S t a n d              and    out   into    the     area     at    the       rear    of     the    West

              Stand.            As       we    approached          the   turnstiles           near      to G a t e      ’C %      it w o u l d     be

              about        3.40          pm    (1340),          I saw a f a n     from Liverpool,                 I did        not    know    his

               name       then       but       I no w      know    it as                                    shouting         at      a Police

              Officer.               He w a s        obviously         upset     at    what     had     taken      place        and    he    was

              shouting              at    the       officer       thi ngs     like,       " Y o u -are a m u r d e r s r 11.          I can't

               remember             some       of    the    other      things,        but    the     c o n v e r s a t i o n was      a bit

              heated        and          both       had    raised      voices.         There       were     a    lot    of     people       about

              at     this       time          and    bodies       of   dead and        injured        people       were        being

                                                                                                                                      S600A

             brought       out     the       tunnel       and    placed along            the    fence     near      the       river,

             opposite          Gate     ’C ' .

             Things       then     started          to    escalate        at      this   point     and    1 got         the     impression

             there       was    going        to    be a bit        of a s c u f f l e     between        them,      so     I intervened

              and    grabbet                       and    just     sort      of    dragged      him away.                         and

                         were    both        there       when    this     was      happening       although         they        did    not

             1 did       not    s ee    the       start    of    th i s   incident,        so    I cannot          comment        on w h a t

             led    up    to    it.

             I would       describe           the    police        officer         who   was    in u n i f o r m    as     6*    to 6 * 3

             tall    and       I think        he w a s     a Sergeant,             although      I cannot          be    sure     about

             that    when       I was        more    interested           in      preventing                 getting            into

             bother       and    I cannot           describe        him a ny        further,        Certainly            I would        not

             recognise          him     if    I saw       hi m a g a i n .        R Thomas.

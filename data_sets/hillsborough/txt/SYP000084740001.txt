            I am a single man and I live with my parents at

                                                  I am employed as a



           As a part time job I also wor/ for Sheffield Wednesday Football Club

           as a turnstile op er a to r,             ry h\o<$1 1y on Saturdays but I also work-

            on some week days as well           if 1 can get away from work early enough,

            usually get paid about £12.00 per match.

           On Saturday       15th April    1989 I went to the football              qround at bout          10,

           30 am.       I was sitting outside the players entrance to the football

            ground on a wall together with                                                        and

                                                I d o n ’t know their full address but they do

            live     in Sheffield and they all work as             turnstile operators.

           As we sat on the wall a white man aged between 20 ap€ 2 y v a a rs about

                                                                            S290D

5*9" to 6 g tall, with b^ack hair and was wearing a light brown leather

coat approached us a/fa ask^d if we wanted any t ic ket s.           He spoke with

a Liverpool act^rj^r I saw/that pe hj^dr'about 50 tickets in

his h a n d .   I can *t r e m w o e r whi ch hand he had them in.

We just told him we worked in the ground and he just walked off.

Shortly after we went       into the ground and I was told to work

turnstile number

I could not see that well        outside the ground whilst      I was in the

turnstile but I did see the odd one or two people             handing tickets over

to others.       I did not see any money exchanged between t h e m .Between     'I

pm and 2.45 pm that day I had a number of people approached

me in the turnstile and they would either offer us some money usually

it was a £5 or £10 note.         I would tell them no ticket no entry a nd

they would just walk away others would say that they had friends

inside and they would give us £10.           As time went on they began to

offer us more and more money to let them in.

The most one offered me was £30.00.           One even offered me some tickets

to some foreign football matches         but I don't know where they were for.

He sounded as if he came from the North of Europe.             There was one with

a Liverpool accent which offered me money all           the   others were

from England but I could not say by their accents             where they came

from.   At no time did I allow any of them into the           ground.

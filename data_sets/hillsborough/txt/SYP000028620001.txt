Please find enclosed two copy letters written to his mother
by                  a Sheffield student, who was a witness
to the Hillsborough tragedy.

I should explain at the outset that the lad is my God-son
and the points raised in the second letter were bought to my
attention by his mother, an old family friend, who is
naturally concerned about the implications of her so n 1s
comments and his future attitude to police.   I know
well and he is neither a "left-wing student agitator    nor a
"criminal with a grudge against the police".

Clearly, if one accepts the truth of
account of his interview with police, and I have no reason
to doubt it, there is one officer engaged in the enquiry
whose over-zealous method of testing the veracity of a
witness has had an adverse effect upon police/public
confidence.  Of even greater concern, if this reflects more
than an isolated incident, the integrity of the enquiry
itself could be tjought into question.

I bring this matter to your attention, not to initiate a
formal complaint, but through my abiding concern for the
police service and police/public relations.  Your comments
could assist a fence-mending operation with mother and son.

Dear


As a result of your letter of 18 May 1989 the Chief Constable, Mr Dear, asked
me to look into the matters you raised.

I have spoken to the two Police Officers who interviewed                                             with a
view to establishing the way in which the interview was conducted.

May I say that these officers have seen numerous other supporters and as a
whole the inquiry team has interviewed in the region of 4,000 other supporters
and this is the only instance where criticism has been levelled at the officers
completing this task.

I did attempt to telephone you to discuss this but you are ex-directory.
However if you would like to speak further on this issue I can be contacted on
021-359-5555 extension

I do not intend to take this matter further unless you desire.
Can I thank you for raising this matter which is always of value to us in
assessing our working methods.

Yours




M J FOSTER

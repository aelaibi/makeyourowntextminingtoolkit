 <354

 IS THERE ANYTHING THAT YOU WISH TO ADD WHICH YOU FEEL IS VITAL TO THIS

 £ ) I C I A L INQUIRY?

 WE WENT TO THE SAME MATCH, SAME TEAMS WE MIGHT HAVE BEEN LATER GETTING TO THE

 GROUND LAST YE AR , BUT WE WERE ABLE TO GET TO THE MATCH WITHOUT ANY CRUSH.

 IT WAS FAR MORE OGANISED WITH A GREATER POLICE PRESENCE INSIDE AND OUTSIDE

 THE GROUND.      I DON'T THINK THE POLICE REALISED WHAT WAS GOING ON AND WERE VERY

 SLOW TO REACT WHERE I THINK THEY SHOULD HAVE REACTED TO THE SITUATION FAR

 SOONER THAN THEY DID AND SO WERE OTHER EMERGENCY SERVICES SLOW TO REACT.

 THERE SHOULD ALSO BE FAR MORE MEANS OF ESCAPE FROM TERRACES OTHER THAN SMALL

 GATES PROVIDED AT PRESENT.

 NO.

 DO YOU HAVE ANY VIEWS OR OBSERVATIONS ON THE WAY THE INCIDENT WAS HANDLED,

AFTER THE MATCH WAS STOPPED?

THE ANNOUNCEMENT SHOULD HAVE BEEN MADE EARLIER IN ORDER TO QUIETEN THE FANS AT

BOTH ENDS, THEREFORE THIS WOULD HAVE ENABLED THE POLICE TO BE DEPLOYED IN

ASSISTING THE INJURED FANS,    IT WAS JUST CHAOS.

<*
 IS THERE ANYTHING THAT YOU WISH TO ADD WHICH YOU FEEL IS VITAL TO THIS

JUDICIAL INQUIRY?

LIVERPOOL SUPPORTERS SHOULD HAVE BEEN ALLOCATED        THE SPION HOP AREA OF THE

GROUND DUE TO THEIR LARGER FOLLOWING OF SUPPORTERS.

THE ORGANISATION OF THE LIVERPOOL POLICE IN POLICING         THEFOOTBALL GAMES IS FAR

SUPERIOR TO THAT OF THE SHEFFIELD POLICE, AND IT APPEARED AS THOUGH THE POLICE

 IN SHEFFIELD WERE NOT USED TO DEALING WITH A LARGE NUMBER OF SUPPORTERS.

 HAD THE POLICE BEEN NEAR TO THE ENTRANCE TO THE TUNNEL, THEY COULD HAVE

j^)SED OFF THIS SECTION THUS AVERTING THE DISASTER.

 THE KICK OFF SHOULD HAVE BEEN DELAYED       IN ORDER THAT   THE SUPPORTERS WHO WERE

STILL OUTSIDE COULD HAVE BEEN ALLOWED IN.

 Q53

 DO YOU HAVE ANY VIEWS OR OBSERVATIONS ON THE WAY THE INCIDENT WAS HANDLED,

 AFTER THE MATCH WAS STOPPED?

 THERE DIDN ’T APPEAR TO BE ANY ORGANISATION AT A L L , ONE THING I DO REMEMBER

 IS A LINE OF POLICE FORMING A CORDON ACROSS THE PITCH TO STOP SOME LIVERPOOL

 FANS RUNNING TOWARD THE FOREST END, AFTER THE FOREST FANS HAD BEEN CHANTING,

 DIRECTING TO THE LIVERPOOL FANS.    THERE WAS NO ORDER AT ALL, EVEN AN

 ONE AND A HALF HOURS LATER.

 I DON'T THINK ANYBODY KNEW WHAT WAS HAPPENING,      BY   THAT I MEAN THEY DIDN'T

<®k_ISE THE SEVERITY OF THE INCIDENT.


G 18

 G54

 IS THERE ANYTHING THAT YOU WISH TO ADD WHICH YOU FEEL IS VITAL TO THIS

 JUDICIAL INQUIRY?

 FIRSTLY I THINK THE SECTIONAL FENCING COULD HAVE BEEN REMOVED, AS ALL THE

 SUPPORTERS WERE LIVERPOOL AT THAT END.    AND ALSO I THINK SOMEBODY SOMEWHERE

 MUST HAVE SEEN THE PENS WERE OVER CAPACITY    &   THEREFORE POLICE OR STEWARDS

 SHOULD HAVE BEEN AT THE ENTRANCE TO THE TUNNEL TO DIRECT FANS TO THE SIDES.

    THERE SHOULD HAVE BEEN/POLICE CORDONS NEAR TO THE GROUND TO PREVENT NON

 3. IT IS WELL KNOWN IN SOCCER CIRCLES THAT THOSE WPlO HAVE NO TICKETS ARE

 BEST ADVISED TO ARRIVE AT 2.30 PM TO TAKE ADVANTAGE OF ANY PREVAILING

 CIRCUMSTANCES THAT WOULD ALLOW THEM ACCESS TO THE GROUND.

 4. THE CHOICE OF HILLSBOROUGH OVER OLD TRAFFORD WAS A BAD CHOICE LAST YEAR AS

 IT WAS THIS YEAR.      THE ALLOCATION OF THE MAJORITY TICKETS TO THE TEAM NOT SO

 WELL SUPPORTED WAS WRONG.      IN 1980 LIVERPOOL WERE ALLOCATED THE "HOP" AT

 HILLSBOROUGH DESPITE THE FACT THAT OPPOSITION WAS ARSENAL. 7 A SOUTHERN TEAM »


Q18

 5. I FEEL THAT THE TUBULAR CRUSH BARRIERS AT HILLSBOROUGH ARE INFERIOR AND

 MORE DANGEROUS THAN THE HEAVY RECTANGULAR BARRIERS USED AT ANFIELD.

 6. I DO NOT FEEL THE NEED FOR THE MAKING OF FOUR PENS ON A SMALL TERRACE

 ESPECIALLY WHEN ALL OF THE FANS WERE OF ONE TEAM.

 ONE VERY SMALL GATE AT THE FRONT THROUGH WHICH ONLY ONE PERSON AT A TIME

 COULD PASS THROUGH.

^pHIND WHEREAS THE OTHER CRUSH BARRIERS HAD ONLY 10 gfTEPS BETWEEN EACH

 BARRIER.

 9. IN 1981 WHEN TOTTENHAM PLAY A SEfll FINAL AT HJlXsBOROUG H , THE TOTTENHAM

 FANS HAD TO BE RELEASED FROM THE LEPPINGS LANE END TERRACING ONTO THE PITCH

 TO RELIEVE THE CROWD CRUSH.

Q18

 053

£      YOU HAVE ANY VIEWS OR OBSERVATIONS ON THE WAY THE INCIDENT WAS HANDLED ?

 AFTER THE MATCH WAS STOPPED?

 THE POLICE COULD HAVE BEEN PUT TO BETTER USE AS IT WAS SOME WERE USED TO

 DIVIDE THE PITCH TO PREVENT OPPOSING FANS CLASHING BUT I FEEL THEY SHOULD

 HAVE BEEN HELPING OUT WITH THE INJURED AND DEAD WHICH WAS FAR MORE SERIOUS

 AND APPARENT

 <354

 IS THERE ANYTHING THAT YOU WISH TO ADD WHICH YOU FEEL IS VITAL TO THIS

 JUDICIAL INQUIRY?

DEFINATE LACK OF POLICE STRENGTH BOTH INSIDE AND OUTSIDE THE GROUND AND THE

 FENCING SHOULD BE REMOVED WHEN IT WAS APPARENT THAT THERE WAS STILL LARGE

 NUMBERS OF FANS OUTSIDE TRYING TO GET IN THEY SHOULD HAVE DELAYED THE KICK

 OFF TO ALLOW EVERYONE PLENTY OF TIME TO GET IN.

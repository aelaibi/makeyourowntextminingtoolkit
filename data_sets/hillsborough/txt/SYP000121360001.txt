                      At Oii-5 hrs on Saturday the 15th of April 19S$, I psxaded at Doncaster, and
                      was then transported to Hillsborough where a further briefing took place.                         I
                      was a mezber of Sgt Hodgetts serial, nurr.ber 22, and after this second briefing
                      we commenced duties on Kiddiewood Road.

                       In company with PC Long, we carried out a foot patrol between Crofton Avenue
                      and Cater. Bar Lane.         All of the off Licences within this stretch of Hoad were
!                     closed.      Throughout the day, we had continuous enquiries with regard                  to locations
                      of public houses or off licences from Liverpool sujjporters.


                      At 1^30 hrs we took up a position towards the Catch Bar Lane end, where a streajr.
                      of Buppoters came down the hill               and headed towards the ground.          This continued
                      until 15CC hrs, and it was obvious that the majority of the Liverpool fans were
                      drunk.


                      All of the serials in the area were then instructed to return to the Leppings
                      Lane end of the ground, where there was trouble with fans.                       Upon arriving there
                      the majority of fans had entered the ground and there was a large contingent
                      of Police officers.          I remained at the gate for approximately ten minutes,
                      before entering and giving first aid and resusitation to fans at the rear of the
                      West Stand.      I was then moved with ofher officers to the areaat the rear of
                      the Police Control room, where we kept an open passage for all emergency vehicles.

                      I remained there until the debriefing, and return journey to Doncaster, where I
                      stood down at 15^+5 hrs.

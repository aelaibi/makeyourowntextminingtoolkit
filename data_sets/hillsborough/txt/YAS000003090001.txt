    Dear John

    Hillsborough - Inquests

    I attended the first day of the Hillsborough Inquests and about
    an hour of the second morning.

    Most of the first day was spent by the Coroner explaining how he
    intended to deal with the inquests, and evidence from the police,
    the blood analyst and a pathologist of a general nature.      The
    Coroner confirmed that no evidence would be called, no questions
    allowed, which related to how the deaths had occurred (other than
    the medical cause of deaths) or which involved criticism of any
    individual or organisation.

    The Coroner said that, despite what he had said at the "pre­
    inquest review" he did not intend to circulate the case summaries
    other than to the solicitors representing the families.

    I, and a number of other lawyers, had informed the Coroner that
    we intended to be present for the first day and then to attend
    only the inquests where it appeared that something might arise
    which was relevant to our clients.    I explained that, if I did
    not have access to the summaries, it would be difficult to be
    selective about which, if any, inquests to attend, and the
    Coroner decided to make the summaries available after all but
    stated that the evidence actually given may not correspond
    exactly with the contents of the summaries.

    Because of the preliminaries and the general evidence there was
    only time for one inquest on the first day so I attended the
    first three on the following morning (the Coroner intends to deal
    with eight each day).
      2

23 April 1990


In the ca s e of eac h of the    inquests which   I attended     the
following evidence was called;

1.   The pathologist who carried out the post mortem gave the
     medical cause of death.

2.   The police officer who had been assigned to the particular
      fatality gave details of the information w h i c h he had
      obtained from witnesses, so far as it was available, of the
      deceased's movements from leaving home on 15th April 1989 to
     being received at the temporary mortuary at the gymnasium at
      Hillsborough;  this was all hearsay evidence.
                                                        V

3.   The police officer who had examined photographs and video
      recordings gave details of each of the sightings of the
     deceased.

The Coroner confirmed that each of the inquests would follow this
pattern.  Each of the inquests was adjourned.

I have read the 95 case summaries and in each case where SYMAS
personnel are mentioned I have compared the contents of the
summary against our statements and the two are consistent.  In
fact the references to SYMAS personnel appear to be based upon
the statements which we took.

The solicitor representing the families of the deceased has
informed me that he has no questions to put which relate to SYMAS
involvement.

In the circumstances, unless something new arises,          I do not
intend to attend any more of the inquests.

I am sending a copy of this letter to Don Page.

Yours sincerely

             Dear Don

             Hillsborough Disaster - Resumed Inquests

             The Coroner has still not been able to inform me whether he
             wishes to call any witnesses from SYMAS, but he has said that if
             he does wish any of your personnel to attend to give evidence we
             will be given advance details of who will be called, and the
             dates on which they are likely to be asked to give evidence.  He
             has also indicated that he will do what he can to minimise the
             inconvenience to SYMAS.

             At present I do not know precisely which points the Coroner would
             propose to go into in any detail but I imagine we will have a
             better idea of that when we know who (if anybody) he wants to
             give evidence.

             Best wishes.

             Yours sincerely

 Dear Si

                                    Hillsborough Inquests

 I am actively considering the names of the people who I may wish to
 attend to give evidence at the resumed Inquests which are scheduled t
 commence on the 19th November 1990 and to continue thereafter until
 about 20th December 1990. If the hearings are not completed by then
 there will be a break for Christmas and New Year and I am planning to
 resume on about 7th January 1991.

 It is my normal practice not to issue subpoenas or summonses to
 witness who I wish to attend at Inquests as I find that most people
 are perfectly willing to come to Inquests by invitation.

You will appreciate that with Inquests of the size and complexity
associated with the Hillsborough Disaster it is very important that
the attendance of witnesses should go as smoothly as it is possible t.
arrange. I therefore would like to have your confirmation that, if I
were to request you to attend as a witness you will in fact do so
without a subpoena or summons being served upon you.

 When replying, would you please- also let me have certain other
 information which I have set out on the attached pro-forma. Please
 return this immediately to my coroner's officer (listing) in the
 envelope provided.

 If you have any questions regarding this matter please contact my
 coroner's officer (listing):

     Det. Sgt. M.J. Tredgold,  c/o West Midland Police,
     Hillsborough Inquiry, Nechells Police Station, Birmingham B7 5DA.

 His telephone number is \                                        [ Please do not phone him unless
 it is really absolutely necessary.

You will of course be contacted again with further details if your
attendance is going to be required.

                                    I am writing to let you know that I am moving to this firm's
                                    Sheffield office with effect from 1st November.

                                    I have written to The Secretary to the Hillsborough Inquiry to
                                    notify Lord Justice Taylor that we have nothing to add to our
                                    earlier submissions save that he should consider extending his
                                    recommendations relating to emergency services and first aid to
                                    any major sporting occasion and large public gatherings.

In 'Lay-Mans' terms, a description of the items of equipment specified in
your Fax dated 10th July 1989 are as follows

Ferno Ked - a device used in the removal of patients with a suspected
spinal cord injury, from a road traffic accident or works incident.

Geudal Airway - an airway inserted into the mouth to assist during
ventilation of a patient using a bag and mask, and to assist in the
maintaining of an airway in a unconscious patient.

Laerdal - A battery powered suction unit used for the removal of
secretions, ie, vomit, foreign objects from the airway.

Adaptors (feaale) - Used to join endotrachael tubes to catheter mounts.

Sphygmoaanone ter - a guage attached to an inflatable cuff used for the
measurement of a patient's blood pressure.

Vecafix - a sterile pre-packed dressing used to secure a drip in a
patient's arm.

Cannula - a small length of medical plastic into which intravenous fluids
are delivered into a patient. A cannula is inserted by using a sharp
needle which cuts into the vein. The cannula is then pushed and secured
into position in the vein,

Hartmann's Fluid - a sterile solution containing salts used in patients who
have been vomiting and are de-hydrated.

Haemaccel Fluid - a volume used for patients with severe injuries, ie,
burns, fractures.

NB:   Used extensively by the Marines in the Falklands.


The numbers following Oxygen and Entonox correspond to the check which is
carried out at the commencement of duty. This check is carried out by each
crew as they are assigned to their vehicle. Each Oxygen and Entonox set is
checked firstly for contents and then for function. The level of gases
within the set are then recorded on the form which you have a copy of.

May I add that during Lord Justice Taylor's visit to the Health and Safety
laboratories, he spent some time looking at various items of Ambulance
equipment and asked informed questions regarding the use and operation.

       Recently members of your staff were contacted by mine, with your
       permission, for the purpose of assisting us in identification evidence
       for Her Majesty's Coroner in Sheffield.

       Feedback from my officers indicates that your members of staff were
       extremely helpful to our investigation. Whilst having to view the
       evidence is not easy, especially for those who were there, your people
       were most professional in their outlook.

       May I take this opportunity, through you, to thank them for the
       assistance they have given to us. Whilst they are two numerous to list
       by name, nevertheless, our appreciation of their help must not be
       diminished.

Dear Sir

Further to my telephone conversation of 10 October 1989, with your Deputy Chief
Metropolitan Ambulance Officer, Mr Hopkins, concerning the re-interviewing/showing
of video and photographic evidence to selected ambulance crews for the purpose of
trying to establish continuity between Sheffield Wednesday Football Club and
Hospitals in respect of a number of those that died in the Hillsborough Disaster on
15 April 1989. Enclosed please find a list of those Ambulance Officers that we
would like to see, together with their Ambulance Stations according to our records.

Subject to your agreement I would propose that my Inspector Layton, who is in charge
of the Video and Photographic Unit dealing with the Hillsborough Disaster, contacts
one of your staff who could act as a Liaison Officer, with a view to arranging
mutually’convenient times and dates for your ambulance officers to be seen.

Given their present level of commitments, I do not anticipate Inspector Layton and
his team will be in a position to start this aspect of our enquiry until some time
in the week commencing Monday, 23 October 1989, if this is convenient to you.

May I take this opportunity of thanking you for your co-operation and assistance in
this matter. If you have any queries please do not hesitate to contact me at
Nechells Green Police Station.

Yours faithfully

Dear Mr Fozard

                 USE OF ERC CHANNEL - HILLSBOROUGH DISASTER

I write in reply to your letter of 17 July on this subject.

After all localised checks had failed to find the source of the problem,
which included extensive checks with the BBC who were covering another
sporting event in South Yorkshire, the DTI were contacted and asked to
investigate.

They reported firstly that the WYMAS site at Cookridge had been
definitely confirmed as one source of interference but that there was a
second,  much   stronger  source.  This second  source was   ultimately
identified as being your Weedley site.

The following is irrefutable.

Interference on ERC, with a blank carrier and long squelch tail following
each mobile transmission was continuous from the time of the Hillsborough
disaster until remedial action had been taken at the WYMAS site at
Cookridge and at your site at Weedley.

In view of this, I think that it             is a reasonable assumption that, as the
interference was continual until             these sites were identified, and ceased
immediately the faulty equipment              had been rectified that the two were
connected and were the sources of             the continuous problem.

I do not refute that you carry out regular checks on the functionality of
ERC equipment on a regular basis, as all Services should. I would however
be interested to know whether your checks on the Weedley site on the
weekend 6/7 May 1989 revealed any problem. One of my Officers who was in




                                                                                                   O P 6 5 /3 2 5 8 R
your area on Saturday 6 May reported to the DTI on Monday 8 May that
strong interference was    present  in the vicinity of  the Weedley
transmitter. It was not known, however, at that time, that the site was
operating on an Ambulance Service frequency nor, that  the equipment was
yours.

It might well be prudent to extend the recommendation to test dynamic two
way communications to include testing of whether base stations are on
talkthro’. This would not necessarily be apparent unless multiple
vehicles or fixed mobiles in the coverage area of each base station are
in use on the ERC frequency at the time the checks are performed.

I share your view that some form         of "Timeout Timer" should      be
incorporated in all future specifications and have indicated this to Mr
      recently.

If your Service experience is that "ERC is rarely free of interference
and is frequently used by certain services for day to day operational
control purposes", I would have thought that your own ability to
effectively control a large incident would be seriously impaired. I am,
therefore, surprised that remedial action has not taken place to cure
what is, obviously, a known situation contrary to all current guidelines
for ERC usage.

Regarding Lord Chief Justice Taylor's enquiry, I did not identify any
Service by name. I factually pointed out that this Service experienced an
interference problem which impaired our response and which had been
subsequently identified as being caused through other NHS users. I can,
therefore, state categorically that no evidence was given that could, in
any way, be misinterpreted nor be directed at any particular Service.

Yours sincerely

               Dear Mr Page

               Re: Pse of ERC Channel - Hillsborough Disaster

               I acknowledge receipt of your letter dated 11 July 1989- I was somewhat
               surprised at its content which I would have hoped would have been preceded by
               a telephone   call. I was even more surprised with the generalised statements
               and assumptions upon which you had reached conclusions which you had
               circulated widely in ambulance circles and to Lord Justice Taylor's Enquiry.
               My reply is more factually based and reflects the tone of your letter to me.
               I am aware that you sent a similar letter to W.Y.M.A.S.

               1.    Our standard procedures provide for only one Humberside ERC base station
                     to monitor the ERC channel on a continuous basis. This is our Caistor
                     (N Lines) base station controlled from our Scunthorpe Control. Our other
                     two base stations at Weedley and Staxton are controlled from our Anlaby
                     Control and are only 'switched in'when the need arises other than for
                     systems cheeks which are laid down in control instructions.

                     All three systems provide at the control consoles a visual indication of
                     transmitters in use and whether they are in talk-through mode or not.

               2.    On Saturday 15 April 1989 our Scunthorpe Control were monitoring ERC.
                     They were not in talk through mode. The controller received on his ERC RX
                     S.Y.M.A.S. mobile calls to their control. He did not switch his system to
                     T/T he switched in a fixed mobile and monitored base calls via his fixed
                     mobile set and mobile calls via his ERC base station receiver.

                         Our Anlaby Copntrol did not activate the ERC base stations at Weedley or
                         Staxton both stations were switched off. There was no question of the
                         stations being switched on and they were certainly not in T/T mode.

                     The controller at Anlaby was not even aware there had been a disaster
                     until 2000 hours that evening.
2.17 July 1989
Mr A Page


3.   Attached for your information, a photocopy of a control occurrence book
     entry at Anlaby showing an entry at 1317 hours on Sunday 16 April 1989
     indicating a radio check involving our major disaster vehicle and the ERC
     channel. That records a standard check procedure and, with no faults
     noted, indicated all equipment functioning correctly. The tests involved
     mobiles and mobiles in talk through mode.


4.   My investigation into the claims made in your letter have involved
     discussions with Philips depot managers at Sheffield and Leeds, and
     through them D.T.I. at Leeds. The information provided to me was as
     follows:-

     4.1 Philips, Sheffield They received an enquiry from SYMAS on 17 April
     1989 re ERC problems described as "mobiles having problems due to a second
     carrier". Philips carried out a detailed and lengthy check into all Trent
     RHA ambulance systems and no defects were found. They had no further
     involvement and believed that you pursued the matter further with D.T.I.

     4.2 Philips, Leeds and D.T.I. Leeds
     D.T.I. Leeds received an enquiry from a Mr Trueman of S.Y.M.A.S. on
     8 May 1989 ie 23 days after Hillsborough re interference on E.R.C.

     Philips were involved with D.T.I. on 11 May 1989-

     On 11 May 1989 the joint investigation found that the Humberside ERC base
     station at Weedley and the W.Y.M.A.S. ERC base station at Cookridge, Leeds
     were both in talk-through mode ie They were in talk through mode when
     checked on 11 May 1989 but this does not indicate they were in T/T mode 26
     days earlier. The Humberside Weedley station, as indicated above, was
     checked and found to be functioning correctly on 16 April 1989 and on
     subsequent standard checks in the interim period.

     The Philips engineer when checking on 11 May 1989 found, during his visit
     to the site, the Weedley transmitter to be switched on in talk through
     mode but found the control equipment showing the transmitter switched off
     and not in T/T.

     The fault has not occurred before or since and simulated testing and
     repeated switching could not reproduce the fault. I am advised by Philips
     that control of the station and talk through switching is fully
     functional. They cannot explain the malfunction on or about 11 May 1989.

I am satisfied, therefore, that:-

1.   Our Weedley ERC base station was not  switched on on 15 April 1989 nor
     was there any visible indication in our Anlaby Control of itbeing on or
     in talk through mode.

     functioning correctly at Anlaby, Weedley and Staxton.

    Mr A Page


    3-   Systems and operational instructions operating in Humberside cover
         adequately the operation of the E.R.C. system, within the context of the
         systems, D.T.I. licensing and the spirit of national advice on the use of
         ERC. Other than that our systems do not include an auto disabling timer
         circuit. This will be provided in our replacement system due to be
         commissioned in December 1989.

    I find no facts to support your general assumptions and I should be grateful
    if you could correct any misleading evidence which may have been given to
    Lord Justice Taylor's Enquiry at least as it concerns the Humberside
    Ambulance Service. I have copied this letter to M/s Handy, Turnbull and Caple
    and the Yorkshire RHA.

    Finally whilst I normally avoid giving advice to other Chief Ambulance
    Officers, should your control officers experience similar difficulty in the
    future and suffer "operational anxiety and concern" they could consider
    switching control to one of your domestic channels particularly when the
    incident occurs on a Saturday afternoon. Our experience is that ERC is rarely
    free from interference and is frequently used by certain services adjacent to
    us for day to day operational control purposes due to their lack of provision
    of standby equipment. We try to act more responsibly and our operational
    procedures reflect this.

    Yours sincerely

                                                  SYMAS' Interim Recommendations


                    l.          At any match where the attendance is expected to exceed
                                25,000 and/or the past history and/or other circumstances
                                indicate that ambulance service presence is desirable (a
                                "critical match"), the holder of the safety certificate
                                should invite the appropriate ambulance authority to attend
                                with such personnel, vehicles and equipment as shall be
                                agreed between them but in any event not less than an
                                officer with one vehicle and crew, the appropriate payment
                                being made by the holder of the safety certificate.


                    2.          Each club being the holder of a safety certificate, should
                                maintain a first aid room, equipped to a basic standard. We
                                attach hereto a suggested minimum*


                    3.          The Football League, Football Association and the relevant
                                licensing authority should require clubs holding safety
                                certificates and intending to stage a critical match to
                                arrange that the doctor in attendance:

                                a.    is trained to advanced first aid standard (ie NHS TA
                                      Paramedic) with annual recertification;

                                b.    is available to treat injured spectators and to attend
                                      the first aid room, when called upon to do so.


                    4,          For all designated grounds there should be a joint and
                                common emergency plan drawn up by the relevant po li c e
                                authority, fire service, ambulance service and the holder of
                                the safety certificate, The emergency plan should detail:

                                a.    The r e l e v a n t   function          of        each         se r v i c e   during        an

                                c.   The agreed rendezvous points for each service and the
                                     (named) police officer who is responsible for collating
                                     and i ssui ng i n f o r m a t i o n to, and coordinating the

                                     12 shows that the medical team left Northern General
                                     Hospital at 1544; it would therefore have been at the
                                     ground by 1550 at the very latest.

                               b.    a casualty team did not attend at Leppings Lane and

                               a.   We b e l i e v e that it is accepted that the use of
                                    defibrillators on the pitch in the circumstances of
                                    this t r a g e d y wo u l d have been professionally
                                    irresponsible (day 24 page 1G3F).

                               b.   In case anybody has any doubts about it we list the
                                    difficulties!

                                             - the patient
                                             - the operator
                                             - any third party coming into contact with the
                                               patient.
                                     ii,     B e f o r e b eing us e d national guidelines for
                                             ambulancemen lay down that an ECG r e a ding
                                             should be obtained from the machine.            In order
                                             for this to be accurate the patient and the
                                             defibrillator must be completely isolated from
                                             any movement and the surrounding environment
                                             must be s u f f i c i e n t l y st a b l e to permit an
                                             accurate assessment of the ECG recorded -

                                    lil,     in the circumstances of this tragedy when the
                                             injured were hypoxic (lack of oxygen), the
                                             usual heart pattern is asystole (continuous
                                             line) and not ventricular fibrillation.                    The
                                             p u r p o s e of a d e f i b r i l l a t o r is to jolt a
                                             fibrillating heart rhythm back into a normal
                                             pattern,       In extreme circumstances the use of a
                                             defibrillator on a patient in asystole might
                                             produce ventricular fibrillation which can then
                                             be further treated with a defibrillator to
                                             p r o d u c e a normal pattern.              The s t a n d a r d
                                             treatment for asystole is CPR,               Successful CPR
                                             would normally produce a regular heart pattern
                                             rather than ventricular fibrillation.

                                     iv.     However given the length of time during which
                                             most of the patients had been d e p r i v e d of
                                             oxygen even the extreme use of a defibrillator

                                                                4

                                    would not have made any practical difference
                                    (see Dr P's statement to the police, page 7 rtmy
                                    thoughts that in view of the length of time he
                                    was pulseless it would probably be kinder if he
                                    died.   I am sure he must have been severely
                                    brain damaged by that time" and at the bottom
                                    of the page "I looked desperately for somebody
                                    not dead but seriously ill whoneeded help,     I
                                    could not find anybody in that category in the
                                    goal area.   They were either all dead or okay
                                    with nothing in between."

          B,          Ambulance Equipment
                      A list of equipment carried by all SYMAS frontline ambulances
                      is appended hereto.   This equipment is Intended for use by
                      SYMAS personnel   and not by third parties.    Much    of the
                      equipment has to be kept with the ambulance    Cor use on the
                      journey to hospital.  The primary purpose of the ambulance is
                      to give immediate treatment to casualties and convey them to
                      hospital. On 15 April 1989 many SYMAS ambulancemen rendered
                      first aid (CPR and resuscitation) as well as conveying 172
                      injured to hospital.   Any criticism of lack of equipment cn
                      SYMAR vehicles is ill-informed.

                                12 shows that the medical team left Northern General
                                Hospital at 1544; it would therefore have been at the
                                ground by 1550 at the very latest.

                         b.     A casualty team did not attend at Leppings Lane and
                                all casualties had been removed from that end of the

                           FACTS;

                           a.     We b e l i e v e that it is accepted that the use of
                                  defibrillators on the pitch in the circumstances of
                                  this t r a g e d y w o u l d h a v e been professionally
                                  irresponsible (day 24 page 103F).

                           b.     In case anybody has any doubts about it we list the
                                  difficulties;

                                    i.   If wrongly used it can kill;

                                         - the patient
                                         - the operator
                                         - any third party coming into contact with the
                                           patient.

                                   ii.   B e f o r e b e i n g used national guidelines for
                                         ambulancemen lay down that an ECG r e a d i n g
                                         should be obtained from the machine.              In order
                                         for this to be accurate the patient and the
                                         defibrillator must be completely isolated from
                                         any movement and the surrounding environment
                                         mu s t be s u f f i c i e n t l y st a b l e to permit an
                                         accurate assessment of the ECG recorded.

                                  iii.   In the circumstances of this tragedy when the
                                         injured were hypoxic (lack of oxygen), the
                                         usual heart pattern is asystole (continuous
                                         line) and not ventricular fibrillation.                 The
                                         p u r p o s e of a d e f i b r i l l a t o r is to jolt a
                                         fibrillating heart rhythm back into a normal
                                         pattern,      in extreme circumstances the use of a
                                         defibrillator on a patient in asystole might
                                         produce ventricular fibrillation which can then
                                         be further treated with a defibrillator to
                                         p r o d u c e a normal pattern.              The s t andard
                                         treatment for asystole is CPR.               Successful CPR
                                         would normally produce a regular heart pattern
                                         rather than ventricular fibrillation.

                                  iv.    However given the length of time during which
                                         most of the patients had been d e p r i v e d of

                                   goal area.   They were either all dead or okay

             B.      Ambulance Equipment

                     A list of equipment carried by all SYMAS frontline ambulances
                     is appended hereto.   This equipment is intended for use by
                     SYMAS personnel and not by third parties.        Much of the
                     equipment has to be kept with the ambulance for use on the
                     journey to hospital. The primary purpose of the ambulance is
                     to give immediate treatment to casualties and convey them to
                     hospital. On 15 April 1989 many SYMAS ambulancemen rendered
                     first aid (CPR and resuscitation) as well as conveying 172
                     injured to hospital.   Any criticism of lack of equipment on
                     SYMAS vehicles is ill-informed.

      Part III - Conclusions


                                                            C H A P T E R 21

                                         FIRST A ID A N D EM ER G ENC Y SER VICES

    No Fault by the Emergency Services
       296. I say at th e o u tse t o f th is c h a p te r th a t no valid criticism can be m a d e o f th e response by the St Jo h n
    A m b u la n ce Brigade, by SYM AS o r by the fire brigade o n 15 April, in deed , no represented party v en tu red any
    criticism o f th em . T he only attac k o n SYM AS cam e from tw o Liverpool doctors. O n e claim ed th a t am b ulan ces
    d id n o t arriv e swiftly o r w ith sufficient e q u ip m e n t a n d th a t there was a lack o f triage. He was proved to be
    w rong in all th ree respects. U n fo rtu n a tely he h ad seen fit to go on television o n 15 April w hen he said m ore
    lives could have been saved if staff a n d e q u ip m e n t h ad arriv ed earlier. A p art from being proved w rong in fact
    as to th e tim e s o f arrival o f am b u lan ces, he co nceded in evidence th a t it was no t possible to say w h ether lives
    could have been saved. H is co m m en ts o n television were irresponsible. T h e o th e r d o cto r co m plained o f the
    absence o f defibrillators. I am satisfied o n overw helm ing evidence th a t to a tte m p t to use a d efib rillator o n the
    p itch w ith people m illing ab o u t w ould have been highly dan g ero u s owing to th e risk o f injury from the electric
    charge.

      297. I find th a t all three o f th e em ergency services n a m e d above resp on d ed pro m p tly w hen alerted, th a t
    they b rou g ht a p p ro p ria te e q u ip m e n t a n d th a t th e ir personnel o p era ted efficiently.

        298. It w ould be u n rea so n ab le to expect, at any sp o rts sta d iu m , m edical facilities capable o f dealing with a
    m a jo r disa ste r such as occurred. To have in ad v a n ce at th e ground, oxygen, resuscitators, stretchers, o th e r
    e q u ip m e n t a n d m edical staff sufficient to deal w ith over 100 casualties is not practicable.

       299. W h a t is req u ired is a basic level o f provision for first aid, for professional m edical a tten tio n a n d for
    a m b u la n c e a tte n d a n c e , together w ith a system o f co -o rd in atio n w ith the em ergency services w hich will bring
    th e m to th e scene swiftly in w hatever n u m b e rs are required. W h a t will a m o u n t to an a p p ro p riate basic
    p ro v isio n for th e fu tu re f g th e e q u ip m e n t in a first aid room , requires expert ev alu atio n a n d advice.

       300. O n th e day, th e re was no clear u n d e rsta n d in g betw een th e C lub a n d D r Purcell as to his role. He
    believed he was p rim a rily there to a tte n d to th e players. T he C lub regarded h im also as th e “ physician av ailab le
    to a tte n d at th e first aid ro o m if re q u ire d ” , as laid dow n in th e Safety Certificate.

        301. T h ere was insufficiently close co -o peratio n betw een th e police a n d th e em ergency services. It is clear
     th a t SY M A S a n d th e fire brigade should have been called earlier th a n they were. However, in view o f th e natu re
     a n d ex ten t o f th e cru sh in g , th e tim e w hen police rescue began a n d the pathetically short p erio d for w hich those
     u n ab le to b rea th e co u ld survive, it is im p ro b a b le th a t q u ick er recourse to th e em ergency services w ould have
     saved m o re lives.

        302. Finally, th e re was evid ence th a t an ad v ertisin g b o a rd h ad to be kno ck ed dow n at th e no rth -east corner
     o f Ihe grou n d to allow a n a m b u la n c e o n to th e p itch a n d th a t at th e to p o t th e ra m p leading to th e p itch the
     access for a m b u la n c e s was in a d eq u a te. T h ere was also evidence th a t th e p re-m atch arran g e m en t for
     am b u lan c es to use th e tw o gates from P em sto ne R o a d a t the no rth-east e n d o f th e ground as in a n d o u t routes
     was fru stra ted by th e ^ r e s e n c e o f vehicles ju s t inside th e ground. In th e event, n on e o f these m a tte rs affected
     o p era tio n s. T h e h o a x i n g was quickly knock ed dow n. T h e difficult access to th e ra m p was n egotiated an d
     am b u lan c es used o n e en tra n ce satisfactorily by back ing o u t w hen loaded.




                                                                        53
Part IV - Interim Recommendations

Safety- Certificates
       13. There should be an immediate review of each Safety Certificate by the responsible local authority,
    which should consult the club in respect of which the Certificate is issued, the police, the fire service, the
    ambulance service and the building authority. Such a review should include an inspection of the stadium. Its
    object should be to ensure that the operative conditions of the Certificate are complied with and to add or
    substitute any condition shown to be necessary as a matter of urgency following the findings and
    recommendations in this report.

      14. Any local authority w ithin whose area there exists a sports stadium designated under the 1975 Act for
    which no Safety Certificate has yet been issued should proceed forthwith to remedy the situation.

      15. Every Safety Certificate should be reviewed by the local authority at least once annually and each
    Certificate should require to be renewed annually.


       16. Each local authority should review its arrangements for issuing, monitoring, enforcing, reviewing,
    amending and renewing Safety Certificates. Such review should require that there exists or is provided an
    accountable administrative structure whereby the functions of the local authority are regularly and
    effectively supervised by senior officers and elected members and decisions are properly taken in accordance
    with the lodnauthority's rules.

       17. To assist the local authority in exercising its functions, it should set up an Advisory Group consisting
    of appropriate members of its own staff, representatives of the police, of the fire and ambulance services, of
    the building authority, of the club and of a recognised supporters' club. The Advisory Group's terms of
    reference should encompass all matters concerned with crowd safety and should require regular visits to the
    ground and attendance at matches. The Advisory Group should have a chairman from the local authority,
    and an effective procedure. Its resolutions should be recorded and it should be required to produce regular
    written reports for consideration by the local authority.



Co-ordination of Emergency Services
★      35. The police, fire and ambulance services should maintain through senior nominated officers regular
    liaison concerning crowd safety at each stadium.

★     36. Before each match at a designated stadium, the police should ensure that the fire service and
    ambulance service are given full details about the event, including its venue, its timing, the number of
    spectators expected, their likely routes of entry and exit, and any anticipated or potential difficulties
    concerning the control or movement of the crowd. Such details should be readily available in the control
    rooms of each of the emergency services.

★     37. Contingency plans for the arrival at each designated stadium of emergency vehicles from all three
    services should be reviewed. They should include routes of access, rendezvous points, and accessibility
    within the ground itself.

★     38. Police officers posted at the entrances to the ground should be briefed as to the contingency plans for
    the arrival of emergency services and should be informed when such services are called as to where and why
    they are required.


First Aid, M edical Facilities and Ambulances
★     39. There should be at each stadium at each match at least one trained first aider per 1,000 spectators. The
    club should have the responsibility for securing such attendance.

      40. There should be at each stadium one or more first aid rooms. The number o f such rooms and the
    equipment to be maintained within them should be specified by the local authority after taking professional
    medical advice and should be made a requirement of any Safety Certificate.

★     41. The club should eiat>iu> a nieuical practitioner to be present at each match and available to deal with
    any medical exigency at the ground. H e should be trained and competent in advanced first aid. H e should be
    present at the ground at least an hour before kick-off and should remain until half an hour after the end o f the
    match. H is whereabouts should be known to those in the police control room and he should be immediately
    contactable.
                 f c-

★     42. At least one fully equipped ambulance from the appropriate ambulance authority should be in
    attendance at all matches with an expected crowd of 5,000 or more.

      43. The number of ambulances to be in attendance for matches where larger crowds are expected should
    be specified by the local authority after consultation with the ambulance service and should be made a
    requirement o f the Safety Certificate.

PRESS RELEASE - FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE




The publication of the interim report by the Right Honourable Lord Justice
Taylor into the Hillsborough disaster has reinforced the recommendations
made by South Yorkshire Metropolitan Ambulance Service "that professional
ambulance officers and crews should be on standby at league football and
large sporting events".


Mr. A. Page, Chief Metropolitan Ambulance Officer, took immediate action
following the Bradford Fire disaster and prepared contingency plans in the
event of a large scale incident at a local football match, consequently, on
the day of the Hillsborough tragedy SYMAS officers were in a position to
respond immediately.


Throughout the judicial enquiry, senior and operational officers gave oral
and written evidence to Lord Justice Taylor.      A comprehensive and detailed
list of recommendations from SYMAS have been included in the report and
were welcomed and supported by Mr. Page.


The general public can now be assured that resulting from the efforts of
the South Yorkshire Metropolitan Ambulance Service, which is now recognised
as the leading authority on the planning and response to large scale
incidents, the provision of emergency care will be of the highest order.

Refi    AP/                                 Date:   23rd August 1989

From:   Mr. A. Page,                       To:      All members of staff




HILLSBOROUGH DISASTER - INTERIM REPORT


I circulate for your interest the relevant chapter of the report
associated to SYMAS. You will see that Lord Justice Taylor has confirmed
that SYMAS conducted themselves efficiently and no blame or fault can be
associated to this service.

I also enclose chapter 24 of the interim report which gives details of
the recommendations made by Lord Justice Taylor.

As a service we should be extremely proud and pleased to see that within
the recommendations, the Ambulance Service has been given far more
responsibility and input in terms of service provision and liaison
committees. It is only because of the actions of the South Yorkshire
Metropolitan Ambulance Service on the day and the effective way in which
we made our representation to the enquiry, that these recommendations
have materialised.

SYMAS has many things to be proud of and we have once again been
extremely successful in ensuring that the Ambulance Service nationally,
as well as locally is taking up a position of importance in the future.

I would like to once again thank and congratulate all of my staff for
their efforts on the day and since, in order to ensure that the service
has returned as quickly as possible to normal.

THE RT HON LORD JUSTICE TAYLOR

    resp on sib ilities for crowd safety and control and in particular for the fillin g o f each self-contained pen or

    variation o f th e agreem ent in respect o f an individual m atch should be agreed in w riting in advance.

★     5. A t each m atch, there sh ould be on the perim eter track, for each self-contained pen or other terraced
    area, a stew ard ( iilh e club is m onitoring that area) or a police officer (if the police are m onitoring it) w hose
    so le duty is to ch eck crowd con d itions in that area for p ossib le overcrowding or d istress throughout the
    period the area is occupied by spectators. W hoever is so appointed should be in addition to any other steward

    d uties under R ecom m endation 5 above, should be fully briefed and trained with regard to the recognition o f
    crowd d en sities, to the recognition o f sig n s o f d istress and to crowd dynam ics. Training should include
    dem onstrations a t the ground and photographs, d esign ed to enable stew ards and officers to recognise
    different crowd d en sities.

*    8. W here there are perimeter fences, all gates to the pitch should be kept fully open during the period
    when spectators are on the terrace.

*     9. There should be in respect of each gate in a perimeter fence (or group of gates if they are close together)
    a Police officer authorised to decide whether or not to allow spectators through a gate to relieve overcrowding.
    I he officer so authorised in respect of each gate should be identified for each match and known to be so by all
    stewards and police officers in that vicinity. He should be able to make radio contact with the control room
    either him self or via an officer close at hand.

*     10. Suitable and sufficient cutting equipment should be provided by the club at each ground where there
    are perim eter fences to permit the immediate removal of enough fencing to release numbers of spectators if
    necessary. Agreement should be reached as to whether the equipment should be used by police, the fire
    brigade or stewards. W hoever is to use it should be trained to do so. W hether to use it should be a decision of a
    nominated senior police officer at the ground.


Crush Barriers
*      11. All crush barriers should be visually inspected immediately for signs of corrosion. Any barrier found
    to be affected by a significant degree of corrosion should be repaired or replaced.

*      12. The layout of barriers in each pen or terraced area should be reviewed immediately to ensure th at it
    complies with the criteria contained in C hapter 9 of the Green Guide. If it does not, the assessm ent of the
    maximum capacity figure for that pen or terraced area, in accordance with Recommendation 2 above, should
    reflect the fact.


Safety C ertificates
      13. There should be an immediate review of each Safety Certificate by the responsible local authority,
    which should consult the club in respect of which the Certificate is issued, the police, the fire service, the
    ambulance service and the building authority. Such a review should include an inspection of the stadium. Its
    object should be to ensure that the operative conditions of the Certificate are complied with and to add or
    substitute any condition shown to be necessary as a m atter of urgency following the findings and
    recommendations in this report.

      14. Any local authority within whose area there exists a sports stadium designated under the 1975 Act for
    which no Safety Certificate has yet been issued should proceed forthwith to remedy the situation.

      15. Every Safety Certificate should be reviewed by the local authority at least once annually and each
    Certificate should require to be renewed annually.


       16. Each local authority should review its arrangements for issuing, monitoring, enforcing, reviewing,
    amending and renewing Safety Certificates. Such review should require that there exists or is provided an
    accountable administrative structure whereby the functions of the local authority are regularly and
    effectively sipervised by senior officers and elected members and decisions are properly taken in accordance
    with the locaTauthority's rules.

       17. To assist the local authority in exercising its functions, it should set up an Advisory Group consisting
    of appropriate members of its own staff, representatives of the police, of the fire and ambulance services, of
    the building authority, of the club and of a recognised supporters' club. The Advisory Group's terms of
    reference should encompass all m atters concerned with crowd safety and should require regular visits to the
    ground and attendance at matches. The Advisory Group should have a chairm an from the local authority,
    and an effective procedure. Its resolutions should be recorded and it should be required to produce regular
    written reports for consideration by the local authority .


D uties of each Football Club
*      18. Each turnstile should be inspected and its potential rate of flow measured. Thereafter, regular
    inspections should be made to ensure that each turnstile remains capable of admitting spectators at the rate
    anticipated.


                                                          58

        and clear and should be d esign ed to ensure the rapid m ovem ent o f spectators to their appropriate viewing


    ★    _ 23. Information on tickets should be unambiguous, simple and clear and should correlate absolutely with
        the information provided in respect of each match both outside and inside the ground. Retained ticket stubs
        should contain information necessary to guide spectators once inside the ground.

    ★   k 21‘ .Informat.ion °!1tickets " j e s t i n g spectators to be in position by a particular time should be reviewed
        by clubs in conjunction with the police to ensure that it corresponds with the planned arrangements for
        adm itting spectators to the ground.

          25. Each club should consult with a recognised supporters' club as to the provision of pre-match
        entertainm ent aimed at attracting spectators to the ground in good time.


    P olice Planning
    ★    .    The 9 hief Constable of each police force in whose area there is one designated stadium or more
        should nominate a chief officer to liaise with the management of each football club and local authority
        concerned in respect o f the safety and control o f crowds.

    ★     27. The O perational O rder for each match at a designated stadium and the pre-match briefing of all
        officers on duty there should alert such officers to the importance of preventing any overcrowding and, if any
        is detected, of taking appropriate steps to remedy it.

    ★     28. The O perational O rder for each match at a designated stadium should enable the police to cope with
        any foreseeable pattern in the arrival of spectators at a match and in their departure. It should provide for
        sufficient reserves to enable rapid deployment of officers to be made at any point inside or outside the ground.

    ★    29. T he option to postpone kick-off should be in the discretion of the officer in command at the ground.
        Crowd safety should be the paramount consideration in deciding whether to exercise it.

           30.     There should be available in the police control room the results of all closed circuit television
        monitoring outside and inside the ground and the record of any electronic or mechanical counting of numbers
        at turnstiles or of numbers admitted to any area of the ground. Officers in the control room should be skilled
        in the interpretation and use of these data.


    Com m unications
          31.      There should be sufficient operators in the police control room to enable all radio transmissions to be
        received, evaluated and answered. The radio system should be such as to give operators in the control room
        priority over, and the capacity to override, others using the same channel. Additional channels should be
        used, where necessary, to prevent overcrowding of the airwaves. Consideration should be given to
        sound-proofing the control room against excessive crowd noise.




                                                             59

    C onsideration should a lso be given to the u se by p olice officers o f a sim p le code o f hand sig n a ls to indicate to
    tne control room the existence of certain emergencies or requirements.

Co-ordination of Emergency Services
★      ?5- The P«lice, fire and ambulance services should maintain through senior nominated officers regular
    liaison concerning crowd safety at each stadium.

★     36. Before each m atch at a designated stadium, the police should ensure that the fire service and
    ambulance service are given foil details about the event, including its venue, its timing, the number of
    spectators expected, their likely routes of entry and exit, and any anticipated or potential difficulties
    concerning the control or movement of the crowd. Such details should be readily available in the control
    rooms of each of the emergency services.

★     37. Contingency plans for the arrival at each designated stadium of emergency vehicles from all three
    services should be reviewed. They should include routes of access, rendezvous points, and accessibility
    within the ground itself.

★     38. Police officers posted at the entrances to the ground should be briefed as to the contingency plans for
    the arrival of emergency services and should be informed when such services are called as to where and why
    they are required.


First Aid, Medical Facilities and Ambulances
★      39, T here should be at each stadium at each match at least one trained first aider per 1,000 spectators. The
    club should have the responsibility for securing such attendance.

      40. T here should be at each stadium one or more first aid rooms. The number of such rooms and the
    equipment to be maintained within them should be specified by the local authority after taking professional
    medical advice and should be made a requirement of any Safety Certificate.

★     41. The club should employ a medical practitioner to be present at each match and available to deal with
    any medical exigency at the ground. H e should be trained and competent in advanced first aid. He should be
    present at the ground at least an hour before kick-off and should remain until half an hour after the end of the
    match. H is whereabouts should be known to those in the police control room and he should be immediately
    contactable.^-

★      42. At least one fully equipped ambulance from the appropriate ambulance authority should be in
    attendance at all matches with an expected crowd of 5,000 or more.

      43. The number of ambulances to be in attendance for matches where larger crowds are expected should
    be specified by the local authority after consultation with the ambulance service and should be made a
    requirement of the Safety Certificate.

                                FIRST AID AND EMERGENCY SERVICES

No Fault by the Emergency Services
   296. I say at the outset o f this chapter that no valid criticism can be m ade o f the response by the St John
Ambulance Brigade, by SYMAS or by the fire brigade on 15 April. Indeed, no represented party ventured any
criticism o f them . The only attack on SYMAS came from two Liverpool doctors. O neclaim ed that ambulances
did not arrive swiftly or with sufficient equipm ent and that there was a lack o f triage. He was proved to be
wrong in all three respects. U nfortunately he had seen fit to go on television on 15 April when he said more
lives could have been saved if staff and equipm ent had arrived earlier. Apart from being proved wrong in fact
as to the times o f arrival o f ambulances, he conceded in evidence that it was not possible to say whether lives
could have been saved. His com m ents on television were irresponsible. The other doctor complained o f the
absence o f defibrillators. I am satisfied on overwhelming evidence that to attem pt to use a defibrillator on the
pitch with people milling about would have been highly dangerous owing to the risk o f injury from the electric
charge.

  297. I find that all three o f the emergency services nam ed above responded prom ptly when alerted, that
they brought appropriate equipm ent and that their personnel operated efficiently.

  298. It would be unreasonable to expect, at any sports stadium , medical facilities capable o f dealing with a
m ajor disaster such as occurred. To have in advance at the ground, oxygen, resuscitators, stretchers, other
equipm ent and medical staff sufficient to deal with over 100 casualties is not practicable.

  299. W hat is required is a basic level o f provision for first aid, for professional medical attention and for
am bulance attendance, together with a system o f co-ordination with the emergency services which will bring
them to the scene swiftly in whatever num bers are required. W hat will am ount to an appropriate basic
provision for the future eg the equipm ent in a first aid room, requires expert evaluation and advice.

   300. On the day, there was no clear understanding between the Club and D r Purcell as to his role. He
believed he was prim arily there to attend to the players. The Club regarded him also as the “physician available
to attend at the first aid room if required”, as laid down in the Safety Certificate.

  301. There was insufficiently close co-operation between the police and the emergency services. It is d e a r
that SYMAS and the fire brigade should have been called earlier than they were. However, in view o f the nature
and extent o f the crushing, the tim e when police rescue began and the pathetically short period for which those
unable to breathe could survive, it is im probable that quicker recourse to the emergency services would have
saved m ore lives.

   302. Finally, there was evidence that an advertising board had to be knocked down at the north-east corner
o f the ground to allow an am bulance onto the pitch and that at the top o f the ram p leading to the pitch the
access for am bulances was inadequate. There was also evidence that the pre-match arrangement for
am bulances to use the two gates from Penistone Road at the north-east end o f the ground as in and out routes
was frustrated by theipresence o f vehicles just inside the ground. In the event, none o f these m atters affected
operations. The hoarding was quickly knocked down. The difficult access to the ram p was negotiated and
am bulances used one entrance satisfactorily by backing out when loaded.

PRESS RELEASE - FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE


HILLSBOROUGH ENQUIRY - VIGTORY FOR AMBULANCE SERVIGE

Don Page, Chief Metropolitan Ambulance Officer for the South Yorkshire
Metropolitan Ambulance Service who appeared before Lord Justice Taylor to
give evidence to the public enquiry concerning the Hillsborough Football
Stadium Disaster has now voiced publicly his feelings for the first time
about the initial recommendations made       by Lord Justice Taylor.


Mr. Page has said that he is extremely       pleased that his service and staff
have been publicly cleared of any accusations over poor response.               This
comment was particularly important because of what the enquiry identified
as irresponsible and factually incorrect comments made by one Liverpool
Doctor on television and to the media.


During the Judicial hearing the South Yorkshire Metropolitan Ambulance
Service gave evidence concerning their role during the disaster.               It came
to light that Mr, Page had ordered his       service to provide specialambulance
cover for the Hillsborough Ground for the past         four years as a
precautionary measure.       This follows the Bradford Football Club fire,


Mr, Page's actions in doing this showed foresight and was in fact one of
the major reasons for the successful ambulance service operation on the
15th April this year.     Not only were ambulances and officers in the ground
and surrounding area, there was also a well prepared plan of action in the
Ambulance Control to cater specifically for the stadium disaster.




                                                                                           C P65/32586
17th August 1989,




These actions allowed the South Yorkshire Ambulance Service to have 42
ambulances at Hillsborough within a short period of time.     Thirty one of
those ambulances belonging to South Yorkshire,     Some 172 casualties were
removed to hospital within 70 minutes and the prompt action of the South
Yorkshire Ambulance Service undoubtedly reassured the injured supporters
and reduced suffering.


Of the recommendations contained in the report, Mr, Page is cautiously
optimistic that other Ambulance Services and Football Clubs will develop
the relationship which is evident within South Yorkshire, which has five
Football Clubs to provide ambulance services to.


The recommendations made by Lord Justice Taylor were submitted largely by
Mr, Page and have been accepted as a victory for the Ambulance Services of
the United Kingdom.


For the first time ever, ambulance services have been given the opportunity
to be members of Safety Advisors Groups and provide advice on safety
matters at Sports Grounds and other Stadiums licensed by Local Authorities,
Professional Ambulance Service cover should be provided to clubs where
5,000 or more people are in attendance.


Although very proud of the efforts of his staff and pleased that because of
their actions and the foresight within his service, the disaster was
efficiently handled, Mr. Page warns that he would like to see the
recommendations made law because he fears that after the initial wave of
involvement, organisations may decide to withdraw their interest, leaving
the matter of crowd safety in jeopardy once again.
17th August 1989,




Mr, Page said "any Ambulance Service or sporting organisation which decides
to be lax about their approach to these recommendations are putting the
lives of the general public at risk.   That would be the biggest insult to
the memory of the unfortunate 95 people who died so tragically.   At least
it can be said that their deaths have assisted in opening closed minds to
the professional role of the Ambulance Service in the United Kingdom and
increasing awareness for the needs of safety of spectators at sporting
events.


He admits that he and every one of his staff have suffered greatly from the
tragedy they faced.   The South Yorkshire Ambulance Service will never
forget the feeling of devastation that day and will always have sympathy
for the victims and their families.

     REVIEW OF ARRANGEMENTS


FOR DEALING WITH CIVIL EMERGENCIES


            IN THE UK




          HOME OFFICE


           June 1989
REVIEW of ARRANGEMENTS FOR DEALING WITH CIVIL KMER6ENCIES IN
SEE T O

INTRODUCTION


Over the last few years the UK has faced an unprecedented
number of major civil emergencies - both natural and Ban Bade.
Bradford, Zeebrugge, Piper Alpha, King's Cross, Clapham
Junction, Lockerbie, Kegworth, Purley, Hillsborough have
become inextricably linked with events involving major loss of
life, injury and trauma. These events, together with other
problems such as the storms which hit Southern England in
October 1987, have tested in extreme conditions our ability to
respond to major disasters. The first~line response of the
emergency services has been widely praised but the scale of
these and other disasters has nonetheless focussed attention
on how effectively the present - largely decentralised -
response can meet the needs of major incidents and whether
anything could be done to improve it.

2.      During the course of 1987 and early 1988 many
individuals and organisations were considering the
implications of recent incidents. Seminars were held at
Bradford University and the Royal Military College of Science,
Cranfield, involving participants from a wide range of
disciplines and interests. The views and recommendations
arising from these were considered by the Borne Office together
with a large number of opinions expressed by individuals
anxious to register their views. Detailed submissions were
produced by many with an active professional interest in
emergency planning, and many were also received from
interested members of the public.
3.      The ideas and proposals put forward vara variad and
wide ranging. Soma auggastad only minor rafinamanta or
additions to axiating atructuras, while othara proposad a
radical ahift from the local rasponaa to a naw cantralisad
control ovar tha planning for, and rasponsa to, amargancias in
tha UK.


4.    it was claar that thara was a wida divaraity of opinion
not only about tha marits of axiating arrangamants but also
about tha naad, or methods, to improva tham. It was also
apparant that most of tha mora far-reaching suggastions had
not baan axplorad in datail with the emergency sarvices and
local authoritias who currantly hava tha oparational
responsibilitias for dealing with any disastar and whose views
and practical judgments would be essential. There were also
questions of finance and existing statutory responsibilities
which had not been addressed.


5.     Accordingly, in April 1988 the Home Secretary asked
officials to conduct a thorough review of the current
arrangements for dealing with civil emergencies. He asked
that all the suggestions and criticisms which had been
received should be explored fully and discussed formally with
fck* «mergency services and others, with a view to seeing what
practical improvements could be made to the existing systems.

CONDUCT OF THE REVIEW

6.     The review was carried out in two distinct phases: the
first was a wide consultative exercise, the second a senior
level seminar at the Civil Defence Collage.

Consultative Exercise
 7.     In June 1988 the Home Office produced a discussion
 document which sought to bring together many of these
 disparate strands (copias of th is vare placed in the L ib raries
 of both Houses). The document identified seven main areas for
 discussion. These covered:


              1.   the ro le o f c e n tra l government;

              2.   statutory requirements for civil contingency
                   planning;

              3.   national co-ordination;


              4.   public information/casualty bureaux;

              5.   the collation of technical and operational
                   information;

              6.   the role of voluntary bodies;

              7.   provision for aftercare.

8.     in each case the document set out the existing
procedures, identified the gaps which some contributors felt
existed, detailed the general thrust of the varied suggestions
made, and drew out some of the implications, it was made
clea^ that the suggestions discussed were without prejudice,
and were offered for open discussion to ensure a full debate
     ***• issues; the document did not c o n s titu te Government
p o lic y proposals.

9.     The discussion document was widely circulated.
Initially it was sent to the associations representing police,
fire and ambulance services, emergency planners, local
authorities, and voluntary bodies; central government
departments were also asked to consider the implication* for
them. This initial distribution involved some 130
organisations and associations. Additionally the document vas
sent to many others who had carried out substantial work on
the subject, or were involved in a less Immediate way (eg.
professional training colleges). The document vas freely
available and vas sent to anyone requesting a copy.

10.    I9hen the consultative exercise vas formally concluded
in August 1988 about 70 full responses had been received.
Officials analysed the responses, and the information obtained
served as a basis for the second phase of the review.

11.    In producing both the discussion document and papers
for the seminar officials took account not only of the
individual contributions made but of some larger issues. The
experience of all recent disasters vas taken into account as
far as possible. The position in other countries vas
considered to see vhether their experience could be of help,
or vhether their different systems, infrastructures, and,
indeed, the nature of risks faced, meant that their
arrangements for responding to an emergency vere necessarily
different. Particular attention vas paid to Belgian systems
in viev of their able handling of the Berald of Free
Enterprise disaster at Zeebrugge.

Civil Emergencies Seminar

12.    The analysis of the responses to the discussion
document identified four main areas for thorough discussion.
These vere:
            1.   the collation of information and access to
                 expertise (Including tha rola of computer data
                 bases);

            2.   tha local authority dimension (involving
                 planning responsibilities and tha longar tana
                 naads of thosa affactad in a disastar);

            3.   casualty buraaux (both Banning and tachnical
                 cosununications issuas);

            4.   administrative structures nacassary to achiava
                 an effective fully co-ordinated response (both
                 cantrally and locally) to any incident.

13.    A aaminar vas hald at the Civil Defence College
Easingwold from 23-25 November 1988 to discuss these issues in
detail vith those with operational responsibilities. Nearly
80 individuals took part, representing - at a senior level -
the police, fire and ambulance services; EM Coastguard;
various local authority associations; emergency planners;
voluntary bodies and government departments.

CONCLUSIONS OF THE SEMINAR

14.    There vas a vide-ranging and open discussion about the
issues under consideration. While there vere naturally
differences of emphasis the broad conclusions of the seminar
vere as follow*:


       1.   the operational response to a disaster should
            remain at the local level; there vas no support
            for an interventionist "national disastar squad";
         2.   more could be done to encourage and develop co­
              ordination at local level between the various
              services and authorities involved, especially in
              t e n s of joint planning;


        3.    although the case for legislation imposing a duty
              on local authorities to plan for peacetime
              disasters was strongly argued by a number of the
              local authority representatives present, the
              prevailing view was that on balance there was no
              immediate need for such legislation and the
              general view was that there was room for
              improvements in co-ordinated local planning which
              should be explored fully before reaching a view on
              th® need for legislation;

        4.    in terms of central government co-ordination the
              "lead Department" concept remained valid although
              it was not well understood outside Government and
              should be more clearly explained;

        5.    there was considerable support for (and no dissent
              from) propositions that arrangements to give a
              flfltlgnal oversight of the progress of co-ordinated
              planning could lead to improvements in our
              response to emergencies.
    %
CONCLUSIONS OF THE REVIEW

15.   Taking account of all the views expressed at the
seminar, the ideas put forward in the course of the review,
    the experience of recent incidents, the Home Secretary hflg
reached the following conclusions.
16.    The basis of the response to particular disasters
should ramain at tha local level: it is here that axpertise
and knowledge exists, that tha bast information is available,
and it is at this laval that co-ordination between tha various
agendas or individuals involved can provida tha most
effective rasponsa. There had bean no support from the
practitioners for a 'national disaster squad*: it was felt
that a dedicated unit of this type would not assist in making
the existing response more affective and could in fact cause
problems in co-ordination and control. Such a squad would of
necessity be inactive for most of the time and in many
instances not be able to arrive on scene until the immediate
response was well underway. As the UK has emergency services
with considerable resources dispersed throughout the country,
able to call on colleagues for general or specialist
assistance, there is no operational need for an additional
body.

17.    Although some local authority representatives had
argued for a statutory duty to plan for peacetime emergencies,
the Home Secretary is not convinced of the need for it at
present. Local authorities are able to plan for peacetime
emergencies using their own resources under s.138 of the Local
Government Act 1972 (and the equivalent legislation for
Scotland and Northern Ireland) and there was no avidence to
suggest that local authorities were not generally already
undertaking a planning function (in former metropolitan
countries it is the boroughs/districts which have the
necessary s. 138 powers, and can either plan individually or
arrange for the joint Fire and Civil Defence Authority to
carry out such planning collectively as their agent). While
this position will be kept under review it is claar that much
can be done without legislation and this should be pursued as
far as possible as the immediate priority.
18.    A clear need has been identified for new arrangements
to give national oversight to the development of co-ordinated
emergency planning, and to addrass specific practical issues
raised by recent disasters. Additionally more needs to be
done to encourage and develop co-ordination between the
various services at the local level.

19.    Co-ordination of the central Government response can
most effectively be carried out by the lead department,
supported where necessary by arrangements for collective
discussion organised under Cabinet Office auspices in the
normal way. But the linkages between this machinery, the
various inspectorates and the operational emergency services
are not well understood and need to be more clearly explained.

20.    To meet these needs the Home Secretary has decided to
appoint a Civil Emergencies Adviser, to work closely with
senior representatives of all the groups which have
operational or administrative responsibilities in this field.
In addition there will be an enhanced role for the Civil
Defence College (to be renamed the Emergency Planning
College).

CIVIL EMERGENCIES ADVISER


21. ' The Civil Emergencies Adviser will be charged with the
oversight of the whole area and will be reporting directly to
the Home Secretary. Be will draw together the wide range of
administrative, operational and inspectorate interests
involved with major disasters, and encourage and promote co­
ordinated planning both locally and centrally. Be will be
likely to travel widely to assess the state of civil emergency
planning on the ground and to recommend changes where this
will lead to increased effectiveness of the response as a
whole. He will not have operational responsibilities in the
event of a major emergency, but would be closely involved in
scrutinising the lessons to be learnt and ensuring they are
disseminated and applied.


22.     He will work closely with senior representatives of
the emergency services, local authorities, voluntary bodies,
safety inspectorates, Government Departments and others
directly concerned, and will be assisted by a Secretariat
within the Home Office working in association with the Cabinet
Office. His task will be:


     To consider matters of current concern in the field of
     civil emergency planning in peacetime, with a view to
     helping those with operational responsibilities achieve
     the highest standards of co-ordination and compatibility
     between their contingency arrangements.

23.    The Adviser will not be empowered to override existing
statutory or other formal responsibilities, but will explore
relevant issues with all those concerned, to establish the
most effective way of resolving problems. His particular
concerns will be with:


     1.    the development and dissemination of good practice
    '      and information, in particular about local co­
            ordination;

     2.    ensuring that the lessons of recent and past
            experience are learnt and applied;

     3.    assistance with exercises and training;
      4.     liaison with all inspectorates concerned with
             public safety;

     5.      liaison across central Government Department*,
              local government, tha emergency services, tha
             voluntary bodiaa and others with a diract
              intarast;

     6.      devalopment of tachnical arrangement* in
             conjunction with usars and suppliers.

24.    A number of specific issues hava baan idantifiad in tha
coursa of tha raviav to vhich ha will ba asked to giva
priority. Thasa includa tha handling of casualty anguirias,
psychological damage to survivors and relatives, assistanca
for foraign disasters, and training and exercises. In a
numbar of casas work on particular issuas is alraady taking
placa and this will continua. Tha Advisar may wish to consult
tha bodias concamad and draw on tha rasults of thair work to
ansura that tha maximum banafit can ba drawn from currant
studias. In other casas ha may wish to convana groups of
axparts to assist him in tha examination of datailad
quastions.


Eggrgsngy.,.-Planning Cplltgf


25. * To support tha Advisar's work tha Civil Defanca Collage
at Easingvold vill ba givan a wider remit and will ba axpactad
to address quastions of peacetime emergency planning,
irrespective of any wartime connections. This vill be
reflected in a change of name to "Emergency Planning Collage".
Tha Collage vill particularly focus on intar-disciplinary
needs and vill vork in conjunction vith tha Police Staff
Collage at Bramshill and tha Fire Service Collage at Moreton-
in-Karsh. It vill act as a centre for studies, exercises and
seminars, and as a focus for tha development of an
understanding of tha vide issuas involvad. Further seminars,
such as tha ona held in tha course of tha review, vill ba
arranged to provide sanior personnel vith an opportunity to
focus on tha major issuas collactivaly. In soma raspacts tha
College vill act as a study facility for issuas idantifiad by
tha Civil Emergencies Advisar. Tha necessary skills and
expertise to develop this additional role for the Collaga vill
have to ba davalopad ovar a pariod of tima.

OVERALL STRUCTURE


26.    Undar tha proposed nav arrangements this country's
rasponsa to major emergencies vill continua to hava two main
alaments, aach vith distinct responsibilities. Thasa ara:

     Tha emergency services, local authorities and others with
     operational responsibilities at local level.

     The "lead" Government department, supported through
     Cabinet Office machinery vhere necessary.

Both vill be assisted and supported by the Civil Emergencies
Adviser.


27. * The emergency services and others at the scene of a
disaster are responsible for dealing vith the immediate
effects, deciding on the need for additional resources and
asking for them, and keeping relevant Government departments
and the public in the surrounding area informed about progress
in dealing vith the effects of the emergency and any measures
necessary for public safety.
28.    The "lead” Government department is, whenever possible,
identified in advance and is responsible for coordinating
both the necessary central contingency planning and the
implementation of the plan should a disaster occur. The
"lead" department is also responsible for keeping Parliament,
other departments and the general public fully informed on
measures for dealing vith the effects of the disaster. Any
problems vhich cannot be resolved under "lead" department
auspices are referred to the Cabinet Office. Should a
disaster occur for vhich no "lead" department has been
nominated the Prime Minister, as Chairman of the Cabinet, can
decide quickly vhich department should take up this role.

29.     The Cabinet Office is responsible for supporting the
Cabinet and Cabinet Committees in the conduct of Government
business. Arrangements for dealing vith civil emergencies
are, like any other business, organised vithin this framework.
Specifically the Cabinet Office provides the machinery vithin
vhich Ministers can collectively discuss and reach decisions
on issues that need to be settled, eg the priority for
allocation of resources or matters that have not been resolved
by the "lead" department.


30.    The Civil Emergencies Adviser vill review the
effectiveness of the co-ordinated local response. Be vill
consider any practical or inter-disciplinary problems raised
and arrange further study or research as necessary. Be vill
reviev the broad lessons to be learnt from incidents at home
and overseas and will help in the development and
dissemination of guidance on best practice in association vith
the Departments or services concerned.

22nd June 1989.


Mr. P. Goodman,
News Editor,
Sheffield Newspapers Limited,
York Street,
Sheffield.


Dear Sir,

With reference to our telephone conversation today, I wish to object at the
misrepresentation of fact contained in the article written by Donna Saul
and Nigel Morris in your newspaper on Wednesday 21st June 1989. The errors
occurred in the following points

1     The BBC were asked by the South Yorkshire Metropolitan Ambulance
      Service during the week following the inquiry if they would assist us
      in order to eliminate interference of our radio system which we
      believed may be arising from their transmissions of the World Snooker
      Championships at the Crucible Theatre, Sheffield. The BBC agreed to
      switch off in turn each of their three transmitters. Following that
      exercise it was established that the Ambulance Service radio system
      had not been affected by the BBC transmissions.

2    The wording in the article suggests that two emergency channels were
      left on within the ambulance control which caused interference. That
      is not what I said, I clearly told the inquiry that we had identified
      that another Ambulance Service had left open a radio channel when
      they had released vehicles to assist SYMAS that had caused the
      interference. I understand that the wording in your article
      basically suggests facts but clearly indicates that the problem was
      associated to the South Yorkshire Ambulance Service. That is not the
      case and that was clearly emphasised to the inquiry.

3    The article also shows that I criticised the police radio system. I
      did not criticise the police radio system. I was asked to comment on
      talk through which is a method in which radio systems generally can
      be utilised. My comments related to experiences within the Ambulance
      Service and the complications which I believe from an Ambulance
      Service point of view talk through can create. I never gave an
      opinion about the operation of talk through from a police point of
      view, nor was I asked to do so. Had I been asked to comment I would
      have restricted my comment purely to the Ambulance Service as I am
      not responsible for any of the police operations.

4    I would ask you to clarify the large headline which indicates "999
      channels interfered with urgent messages". That was never said, nor
      did it happen and is clear misrepresentation as the 999 channel is a
      totally different channel than the one being utilised for the
      disaster.
                                                                                       CP65/32586
22nd June 1989.


Mr. P. Goodman.

I should now like to refer to the article with regard to Mr. Hopkins.

5    Mr. Hopkins did not say that the control room at the South Yorkshire
     Ambulance Service had misdirected ambulance crews, nor did he say
      that that had hampered the rescue. He did say that he heard
      ambulances being directed to the Leppings Lane end over his radio and
     he knew from our plan that the only access to the ground was through
      the entrance at the Penistone Road North side. As it turned out
      there were two incidents that SYMAS had to deal with, one outside the
     Leppings Lane entrance and the second one on the pitch behind the
     goal at the Leppings Lane end. The comments contained in your
     article with regard the control room are inaccurate and create
     professional embarrassment for this service as well as a
     misrepresentation of fact to the general public.

6    In the same section of your article concerning Mr* Hopkins1
     appearance before the inquiry it clearly states that Station Officer
     P. Eason went to the Liverpool end of the ground with a fireman
     colleague                    [.                  is a Qualified
     Ambulanceman employed by this service and he accompanied Mr. Eason.

These points appear to be the major concern of myself and my officers. I
would point out that we experience a very good rapport with the Sheffield
Star and the points raised in this letter are aimed merely at ensuring the
factual information concerning this service is passed on to the general
public.

I should be grateful for your assistance in ensuring that the matter is
speedily resolved in terms of submitting a factual report to the general
public contained in a prominent position as this has caused embarrassment
within the service and may cause embarrassment between this service and the
South Yorkshire Police.

If you require any further information, please do not hesitate to contact


Yours sincere

For the immediate attention of Mr. A. Callaghan.




Dear Andrew,

Please find attached a copy of a letter which has been sent to Lord Justice
Taylor from NUPE regarding the Hillsborough disaster.

I obviously do not agree with all of the comments in this letter and it
would appear that some one else wants to jump on the band wagon.

If you have any comments that you feel you would like to make on this
document, please give me a ring.

Yours sincerely.

                           Stress Debriefing

    A course for Chief Ambulance Officers and their Senior Staff.

The aim of the course is to provide officers with a thorough
grounding in Post-Traumatic-Stress-Disorder, its effects within
the personal and occupational spheres, and Critical Incident
Stress Debriefing.

  "A CISD has several functions. Through the process people are
helped to ventilate their impressions and reactions, and at the
same time they have   a chance to learn that their reactions are
not unique or abnormal. The debriefing decreases tension, leads
to cognitive organisation and helps in mobilising resources witin
and outside the group."

  proceedure  most people find* hel pfu l, allowing us the chance to
  •hare some of the thoughts and -feelings about the experience, and
  find out that they are shared by others and are very much normal,
  which helps prevent any long term problems".
■':                                                  ■
  Rules

 (i) No one has to say anything at all if they don't want, only to
 start  with their name and connection with the  incident.    "You
 are, however, requested to listen".

 (ii)  Everything   that is said is confidential,  to us and  group
 members  - no -management person will take anything that  is said
 outside, no notes will be made.

 (iii.) The       meeting is not -a critique,   nor is it    a   proceedural
 debriefing.

 (iv) We only talk for ourselves and our own reactions,            not those
 of others.

 (v) We may feel worse during tfte session,        but this is n o r m a l , as
 we are getting in touch with pain.

 (vi ) There will be no breaks, so have a pee now...

 (vij,,) People  do,  of course,  have the opportunity to  leave              -
 "please^ hiowever, leave quietly, but come back if possible".

 (ix) Give-brief outline of what will happen.

 (x)    "Any questions?"

 1 *. FACI PHASE

 "What   happerted?"  Each person briefly describes what  happened.
 How did they come upon the event?    What was the time sequence of
 events?    Foster brief factual cross-questions.

 AIM    - Clear     correct picture of facts of event is available         for
 all.

 El ItiQUBHI PHASE                                                             i

 Focus on decisions and thought processes.     "What were your first
 thoughts?"     "What did you do?"   "Why did „you decide  on  doing
 what you did?" (often related to protecting o t h ers ). "What were
 your  impressions of what was going on around you as events took
 their course?"    "What did you hear/smel1 /see?".

 Questions about thoughts very often lead into feeling answers.
D R E A C T I O N PHASE

This is o-ften the longest part o-f the debriefing.

NBs Allow feelings!

When   people   describe reasons behind decisions they     will  often
talk   about fear and helplessness     (loneliness),  self   reproach,
frustration    etc.     It is this that establishes similarities and,
normality.        Other     past    events    may    surface      (work
rela ted /personal) - facilitator must separate & give     suggestions
about working through of earlier reactions.

"How did the events make you react?"
"What was the worst of what happened for you?"
"Have  you ever ex peri en£fe<iy^nythi ng in your life before that has
made you so upset/frustrated/frightened?"
"How did you feel when X h a p p e n M ^ l ^ ® ^ , , ^

NB:  Facilitator  must allow eyeryone the chance to participate -
must  intervene  if  ground rules are   broken,    or  if there   is/
destructive  criticism.      Remember - you are modelling for them
how to deal with it with each' other/fami 1 ies/friends in the weeks
to come.

 If someone breaks down,  mobilize peer support - signal neighbour
 to put an arm round,  verbalize support etc.    If person leaves,
 co-leader to follow to encourage re-entry. ^

 Watch  for      who  seem to suffer  a  lot/are   silent/have  extreme
 symptoms.         Approach  individually at end, and offer individual
 support.

 E a. SYMPIQM PHASE

 Describe symptoms during event
                          on return home
                          the following day
                          now

 "What    unusual    things    are        you     experiencing      now?"
 EMQTIONAL/COGNITIVE/PHYSICAL.

 "What is different from usual?"
 "Was it difficult to return to work?"
 "Has this had an impact on you and your family?"
 "Do people   at home understand what you've been       through?"    (NB:
 lack of acknowledgement).

 One person describes symptoms - "Have you felt like him .... ?"

 REMEMBER  THE  THREE ELEMENTS OF PTSS  - REEXPERIENCE       PHENOMENA,
 AVOIDANCE/NUMBING, AND INCREASED AROUSAL.
E*.   teaching   phase


Identify  normality by reference to research/material       from   other
debriefings.

Tell  people  what   reactions  to expect.      Emphasise  "Normal
reactions to abnormal events".     Don't suggest that they HAVE to
react in such a way,   but that the following feelings are normal
(see attached).    Emphasise individuality as well.

§5. BiziNIRY PHASE

Sum up.
Hand round written material.
"Any. questions?"

"How can personnel help each •othfr?^
NBs   Acceptance  of  reactions   as<''ttor*mal ,   and   importance   of
understanding each other.

"When do you need further help?"
If symptoms don't decrease, ’s^fy, after h weeks,  or if symptoms
increase over time, or if they handicap work and/or family-life.

"Do we need a follow-up debrief?"
Whole or part group?    Is there an issue that needs to.be         dealt
with^in specific depth?

"What are'Tuture contact points?"
How to contact team/occupational health etc.

 topics discussed were fairly similar, differences both in the interviewer and the presenting complaint
 o f the subject led to some variation in the protocol o f the interview.
    The elapsed time between the serious life-event and the date o f the interview was uncontrolled for
 the two sets o f 16 patients, resulting in 32 o f the 48 initial evaluations showing a wide range o f
 variation on this variable.

 O th e r m e a su res
 After their interviews, subjects completed a battery o f self-report instruments. Among them were the
 Symptom Checklist-90 (SCL-90; Derogatis et at., 1973) and the Impact o f Event Scale (IES;
 Horowitz et at., 1979; Zilberg et a!.. 1982). The SCL-90 is scored for nine dimensions o f
 psychopathology such as anxiety, depression and somatization, as well as a total pathology score.
        — INTRODUCTION —




People and organisations react very differently to traumatic
 events, while most, in time, will cope with the emotional
  upheaval. Many will have great difficulty readjusting to
                 normal life after a crisis.
The Centre for Crisis Psychology exists to help people and
   organisations in this critical readjustment period. We
    encourage self evaluation and self awareness of the
psychological affects of traumatic experience. Emphasising
 and supporting the individual's natural resilience is often
crucial to the successful management of the psychological
             after affects of such an experience.

Dear Peter,

I write to confirm the content of my telephone conversation with you on
Monday 17th April 1989, in that I am now making a very strong request to
you and to other organisations to take what ever action is necessary to
have Chief Ambulance Officers given statutory powers to monitor andprovide
ambulance service advice and cover within sports stadiums which would
include football grounds. These statutory powers should not just be for
football matches but for any large gathering of people.

I should be grateful for any comments you would like to make.

Dear

I am writing to personally Thank You for the way in which you responded to
the incident at Hillsborough on Saturday 15th April 1989. I know that for
those of you who were on the ground and saw the trauma at first hand, it
will have created many bad memories which I am sure none of you will
forget. For those who were in the control ensuring that assistance and
back up was being supplied I know that the pressure and the content of the
messages which were being received both by telephone and over the radio
from the ground shocked everyone.

It has become more and more obvious over the last few days whilst having to
debrief everyone, just how professional you were and although there were
many fatalities, no one must blame themselves. These fatalities were not
created under any circumstances by any member of this service and I know
just how frustrated we all were as the death toll increased.  Unfortunately
that is what the Ambulance Service has to be ready to respond to at
anytime.

I can only express how proud I was at the way in which all of you performed
your duties and I would like to Thank You all for your efforts. If you
require any help or assistance over the next few weeks or months you must
not hesitate to contact any officer of this service. We must all do what
we can to assist one another to come to terms with and get over as many of
the memories as we can.

Once again, many thanks for the very professional way in which you
responded.

Dear

I am writing to personally Thank You for the way in which you responded to
the incident at Hillsborough on Saturday 15th April 1989. I know that for
those of you who were on the ground and saw the trauma at first hand, it
will have created many bad memories which I am sure none of you will
forget. For those who were in the control ensuring that assistance and
back up was being supplied I know that the pressure and the content of the
messages which were being received both by telephone and over the radio
from the ground shocked everyone.

It has become more and more obvious over the last few days whilst having to
debrief everyone, just how professional you were and although there were
many fatalities, no one must blame themselves. These fatalities were not
created under any circumstances by anymember of this service and I know
just how frustrated we all were as the death toll increased.  Unfortunately
that is what the Ambulance Service has to be ready to respond to at
anytime.

I can only express how proud I was at the way in which all of you performed
your duties and I would like to Thank You all for your efforts. If you
require any help or assistance over the next few weeks or months you must
not hesitate to contact any officer of this service. We must all do what
we can to assist one another to come to terms with and get over as many of
the memories as we can.

Once again, many thanks for the very professional way in which you
responded.

Yours sincerely,

MAJOR INCIDENT - HILLSBOROUGH FOOTBALL GROUND - 15TH APRIL 1989

I wish to place on record my gratitude for the way in which all
personnel, irrespective of rank or position dealt with the situation at
Hillsborough on Saturday. The South Yorkshire Metropolitan Ambulance
Service conducted themselves in a very professional and efficient manner,
in what can only be described as a devastating event.

I know everyone who was involved both at Hillsborough and within the
Control Unit suffered drastically from the effects of what happened and
what was seen. I can only say that this service performed its duties in
such a way and in very difficult circumstances both physically and
emotionally which brings credit to everyone of us. It is now up to each
one of us to help one another to come to terms with the trauma and build
the service up again to where it was before this sad event took place.
We must do all we can to assist anyone within the service who suffers in
any way from being involved with this disaster and if anyone requires any
form of support through physcology counselling etc they must not hesitate
to contact any officer from this service who will make the necessary
arrangements.

The matter is now a part of the judicial enquiry being conducted by Lord
Justice Taylor and this necessitates me debriefing everyone concerned
with the incident and hopefully this will be finalised over the next week
or so. Because of this enquiry, I must reiterate my instructionto all
personnel that no comment must be made to the press.   The matter has to
be treated by this service to be of an extremely confidential nature,
with me as the only service spokesman.

I know many people telephoned the service, many of whom were actually
asked to attend stations, others whose names were taken to be called upon
if they were required at a later stage of the incident. To those people,
I would also like to say Thank You as I can confirm that from a control
officer point of view in charge of the incident it was extremely
reassuring to know that more man power and help was available should the
incident be prolonged or in any way become more severe.

I can only express once again my sincere thanks and gratitude for the way
in which all of you responded and conducted yourselves, you are yet again
a total credit to SYMAS and myself.
                                                                    t

Dear Mr. Jukes,

I should be extremely grateful if you can pass on my sincere thanks and
gratitude to the members of your service both control and operations who
assisted us in dealing with the very distressing events which took place at
Hillsborough last Saturday.

I am sure that it has affected all of them and if there is anything at all
that this service can do to assist them in coming to terms with the trauma
that they experienced I should be grateful if you would let me know.

We do have stress counsellors available and if you or your staff think that
they would like to be involved with that, then you only have to ask.

From the Ambulance Service point of view it is clear that the response to
the incident was very good. Obviously I cannot go into too much detail at
this moment in time because of the judicial enquiry, but the assistance of
your personnel was a bonus which was greatly appreciated.

Yours si

desperate urgency to call in firemen

FIRE SERVICE RESPONSE TO THE HILLSBOROUGH DISASTER

The South Yorkshire County Fire Service today (Wednesday, 19th April,
1989) decided to put the record straight about its involvement in the
Hillsborough disaster.

Mr. Harry Wright, the South Yorkshire Chief Fire Officer, said:      "The
South Yorkshire Fire Service is mindful of Lord Justice Taylor's concern
about uninformed speculation about events at Hillsborough football ground
on   Saturday,   15th April, 1989.     Unfortunately an inaccurate and
misleading account of the Service's response to the Hillsborough disaster
is emerging in the press.

To avoid this, I can confirm that the initial call for assistance from
Hillsborough was received by the Fire Service Headquarters Control Room
at just before 3.14 p.m. The call informed the Service that there was a
major incident at Hillsborough football ground.    It also informed the
Service that there was a specific requirement for cutting gear. The
Service's standard attendance to such an incident - 6 (six) pumps, one
emergency tender and a control unit - was mobilised from County fire
stations at 3.16 p.m. Each pump appliance carries cutting gear and the
emergency tenders carry heavier duty cutting gear.

The first appliance reached Hillsborough at about 3.22 p.m. along with
two others, well within the call-out standard for the distance they had
to travel (2 to 3 miles). The officer in charge of the first unit on the
scene assessed the situation and immediately requested the attendance of
a further four pump appliances and stressed that it was the additional
resuscitation (oxygen) equipment they carried that was required.     All
pump appliances carry oxygen equipment.

The pumps required and an additional emergency tender were mobilised and
additional supplies of oxygen were released from Fire Service Stores.

At the ground the firefighters were faced with a large number of
seriously injured persons who required emergency first aid treatment.
Using their skills they undertook to assist other emergency services in
providing essential life saving functions.

The firefighters worked with and alongside the police, ambulance and St.
John Ambulance Brigade, ground stewards and officials and many hundreds
of spectators.

The South Yorkshire County Fire Service will be co-operating fully with
the inquiry into the Hillsborough disaster being headed by Lord Justice
Taylor.

The Service will be preparing a detailed statement of its involvement in
the tragedy for submission to the inquiry.

The Service will not publish its inquiry statement until Lord Justice
Taylor authorises that this can be done. The Service has no wish to pre­
empt the findings of the inquiry nor to fuel further speculation about
the Hillsborough disaster."

            Further to our telephone conversation of Monday 18th April 1989 concerning
            the tragic events at Hillsborough. I confirm that should you find it
            necessary to transfer back to Merseyside a large number of patients and
            require assistance our Staff and Officers have offered their services
            whether on duty or off.

            This kind of response from the Merseyside Ambulance Staff reflects our
            appreciation of South Yorkshire Metropolitan Ambulance Service Staff for
            the professional manner in which a very distressing situation was dealt
            with.

            I understand many of your Staff have requested stress counselling following
            the incident and I wish them to know that their fellow professionals in
            Merseyside are thinking of them at this very sad time for your Service and
            our County.

            Kind regards.


            Yours sincerely

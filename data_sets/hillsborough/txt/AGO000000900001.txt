HILLSBOROUGH

We spoke last week, and I mentioned that we had now received a full report from the
South Yorkshire police. I am now enclosing copies of the Chief Constable’s letter to
me (and for completeness, my reply); the documentary material which they have
provided; and the accompanying video tapes. I am sorry that it has taken us a few
days to get the tapes copied.

I suggest that we should aim for a discussion of the next steps, including what advice
we should now offer to Ministers, at the beginning of March. If you agree, I will ask
my secretary to arrange a provisional date.

As you requested, I am sending this material separately to Mr Peter Pearson in CPS
Headquarters at York. I assume that he will want to attend our discussion.

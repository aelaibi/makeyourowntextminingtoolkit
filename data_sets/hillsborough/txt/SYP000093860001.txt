                I can say the following                      in relation to my e xperiences at Hi 1 1 s b o r o u g h .

                              we went into the central/tunneI which runs under n e a t h the West

                to a position about half way along                             the    length of the tunnel and                    found

we    could go no farther             because      the tunnel             was    f u<0    of    people,      the     time

w o u l d have been then about              three       o ’clock         o 4 # O 0 ) or just       shortly before,.



W hilst    stuck     in the tunnel          I heard what             I can only describe as a

stampede      of feet behind me and then                      I was       pushed down the             length of

the tunnel        onto    the terraces           into what          I now know to be               pen number

three.



I got     into a position towards                 the       rear    of    pen number           three at-a time

that    I believe was          just shortly after                  the kick off at three                  o'clock

I had not been           in t h i ^ f i r s t    position for             very    long when there was a

strong     surge    fru^pe          area of the tunnel                   as    I suspect more and more

people were        entering         the terracing            from the          central        tunnel,     this     surge

pushed me forward            down the terracing                a distance          of about          ten steps          to

an area a p p r o x i m a t e l y    central      of    pen number             three.



When    I got to this          position         roughly       in the          centre     of    pen number         three

I was able        to see     the game and having                   been       in this     position for a

the    terraces     towards         the front      perimeter             fence



As    I got wi t h i n about         ten or fift e e n feet away from the front

face     back up the      terraces and towards          the West Stand.              Having    been

spun around        I s t u mbled backwards        down the terracing              continuing    towards

the front       perimeter      fence and towards        the dividing          fence     between      pen

■number three and         pen number      four.



W hen    1 finally      came to a halt        1 found myself       in an area of empty

feet away from the front               perimeter    fence and with the              dividing    fence

between     pens number        three and four       to my    left hand side as             I looked

towards     the    pitch.



I hadn*t       been    in the small area of empty terracing                   for very       long when

of     pen number      three   I had    looked across       the front        of    pen number     three

and     I had seen a huge mass           of bodies all       intertwined up against               the

wall at the front           of the     pen,   this mass     of bodies        str e t c h e d along    the

front     of the      pen for a distance        of about     fourteen feet and about                 five

feet     back from the wall          below the front        perimeter        fence.      1 could see

a mongst    this mass       of bodies     some who were moving and others                    that were

not,     there was      such a huge      pile of bodies       I w ould guess about             eighty

or more     that      I c o u l d n ’t describe any of them        in detail,         the whole

thing was just          like   something you w ould see           in a horror movie.



H aving    seen this awful        sight,      I set about     pulling        the    bodies    out of

the     pile w hich were       closest    to me,    some were      people which were alive

a nd    injured,      others were dead,        I was   joined by what             1 think was a

                We    continued         to   pull more and more            of the    bodies out of this       pile and

                were     passing        them to people            behind us to pass      the dead and      injured

                back     up the     terracing       towards        the    tunnel.



                Of all     the    people      I saw       in this mass       of bodies    the only one       I can

I think we        passed about         twenty bodies         out through the fence             but    I

c a n ’t be exact.          We just     continued to pass out the               bodies and the

injured until         they had all        gone from         pen number     three.

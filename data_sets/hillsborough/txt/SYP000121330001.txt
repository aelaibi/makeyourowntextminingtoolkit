    THE RULES OF PATIENT AND DOCTOR CONFIDENTIALITY,BUT,IN GENERAL
    TERMS,HE IS DISCRIBED AS SUFFERING FROM DEPRESSION AND POST

    PLANNED DISCIPLINARY TRIBUNAL FOR WHICH SOUTH YORKSHIRE POLICE
    HAVE BEOs! PREPARING FOR SOME MONTHS, DAVID DUCKENF IEL.D HAS BECOME
    THE SYMBOLIC FOCUS OF MUCH OF THE ANGUISH FELT BY THOSE WHO WERE
    SO HURT BY THE TRAGEDY BUT I MUST DEAL WITH THE MAN NOT THE SYMBOL
    THE FACT IS, DAVID DUCKENF IELD IS NOW TOO Hi. TO SERVE.
    A DECISION LIKE THIS IS NOT LIGHTL.Y MADE, THE MORE ESPECIALLY IN A
    CASE OF SUCH COMPLEXITY AND PUBLIC INTEREST.THE FACT THAT DAVID
    DUCKEMFIEL.D IS SO UNWEL.L HAS SIMPLIFIED THE DECISION. THERE HAS
    BEEN ENOUGH SUFFERING ALREADY AND I CAN ONLY HOPE THAT TIME WILL.
    SOFTEN THE TERRIBLE PAIN FELT BY THE FAMILIES OF THE HILLSBOROUGH
    VICTIMS, AND WILL HELP HEAL DAVID DUCKENFIELD AS WELL.
I   THE POLICEirCQHPLAiNTS AUTHORITY AND THE HIL.LSBOROUGH FAMILY
!   SUPPORT GROUP HAVE BEEN NOTIFIED OF MY DECISION.

234.     PC SMITH

Statement was read.   He confirms that he was a track officer, that
he had lots of experience, he policed the 1988 match, that people
had come out onto the track, confirms he went for a meal, came
back about 14.50, centre pens were full. He recollects the gate
opening once, nobody came out and he shut it. It then burst open
again, people tried to get out, other serial officers (? Sgt
Swift's serial) assisted with sorting it out. He describes
three surges, second surge there was some shouting, after the
third surge the screaming sounded different, he then tried to
radio for permission to open the gates. His evidence in many
respects ties in quite well with that of Mr Case and also other
officers. It is difficult to reconcile Sgt Green's evidence with
his and indeed everybody else who was around that gate.
233.   DR   SLATER                            PATHOLOGIST

Dr Slater gave the short cause of death in the case of Nichol
Joynes and McCarthy. He also dealt with a query relating to
Philip Hammond.


Mrs McBrien asked a number of questions, most of which were
too broad, too clinical or not relevant.
 15 MARCH 1991

 232.   T BICHARD                              VHF/CAMERA OPERATOR

Mr Bichard was VHF and camera operator. Described the cameras,
insisted that the zoom facilities coupled with the screen size
would not enable identification of individuals and that time lapse
                                                                  .
and enlargement on our screen gave a proper representation of what
they could see. Apparently the Jury saw the zoom demonstrated to
them at the ground.
His evidence was confusing as to when the camera was trained on
the Leppings Lane terrace but he confirmed that once it was fixed
it stayed.   He agreed that he had also recorded scenes from outside
from 2.30 onward.   The other camera had been trained on the Kop
but the film unfortunately ran out at 15.00. It had been retrained
onto Leppings Lane but not recorded. At some time, probably around
operation support request, he started concentrating on the radio
only. He confirmed that Mr Marshall made a request, that the gate
then opened, it was his view that it had burst open or been forced
and he said so it was audible. Position was retrieved by mounted
officer. Subsequently that gate was opened again.
He recollected request for Gate A and thinks that he trained his
camera immediately after the request. His attention was fixed
exclusively on Leppings Lane.   He had not noticed any problems
in the terrace, he had not been briefed to monitor the crowd but
if he had seen something he would have mentioned it.   First view
of problems were people climbing over, his reaction was pitch
invasion, looked exactly the same as 1988 except that the time was
different. He did not think that the camera would give a good view
of overcrowding, it would not be sound to base judgement on it.
Cameras had either to be repositioned or replaced if system was
to be improved. The camera did not show tunnel end of concourse.
He did not make any connection between people coming in the tunnel.
Had he done so he would have mentioned it.
When cross-examined about this by MR KING he said that this was a
hindsight observation and in any event he had not connected it.

       232.     T BICHARD (continued...2)

      He confirmed that he had not been given instructions to monitor
      the terraces. He would not accept that it was not in his mind.
      What was in his mind was what was happening at Leppings Lane.
      When the gates were opened he thought the problem had been resolved.
      He also said that if he had seen that crowd outside and the ground
      had been full then he would have applied his mind. The fact was
      that there was space within the ground. He confirmed that he had
      heard a conversation in the control box, time unknown, in which
      the policy of postponing kick-off was discussed.


      He was questioned about the conversation between Mr Kelly and Mr
      Duckenfield. The only thing he could remember was that there was
      a reference to the gates being forced and that fans had poured in.


      When re-examined by MR ISAACS he told him that the conversation did
      not concern him, there was a lot going on, it was only a snippet
     that he remembered and other things might well have been added and
     said at that time.      He agreed with Mr King that at some point, on
     Mr Duckenfield's request, serials were sent round to the North
     stand. He explained that problems could arise if fans without
     proper tickets entered the sitting area.     He also agreed with Mr
     Isaacs that whereas the entry to Gate C let to the concourse, that
     to Gate B led to a narrow path. He also confirmed that immediately
     after that he saw what appeared to be signs of a pitch invasion.
     He confirmed that he thought the problem had been resolved when       '
     Gate C opened.


    MRS MCBRIEN XE

    The only point of substance which was covered was that Mr Bichard
    said he had reviewed the video and the time interval between the
    opening of Gate C and the request to open Gate A was one minute
    and 40 seconds, based on the fact that he panned across as soon
    as the request was made by Sgt Higgins. We had a look at the
    compilation tape and it is correct that at about 14.54 he does
    pan over to Gate A.     He said that that was when the request was
    made.     He re-pans at 14.58 or thereabouts, which fs when the
    gate is actually open and a line of officers can be seen.
 231.   D GODDARD                                  POLICE SERGEANT

 Four years' experience.     Radio operator,   didn't attend briefing
 but knew his job.    Murray briefed him personally.   Not examined
 re events prior to about 2.00 pm. Murray left to see the referee,
 returned with Duckenfield and Jackson at 2.15. Noticed comparative
 emptiness of Liverpool end compared with Nottingham, no consequence.
 At 2.30 build up at Leppings Lane, several thousand, big crowd,
 big match, no concern, sure they would get in. 2.30 activated
 request to close Leppings Lane. No need for intervention.
 Described radio problems, disruption, very marked, finished up
with hand-sets.      Three requests from Marshall, first two thought
 partly resolved when gate opened and shut.     Third request was a
 demand, someone would be killed, Duckenfield jogged by Murray,
opened gates, subsequent request re Gate A. Goddard said he
associated opening, request re kick-off postponement, Buxton sure
team was coming onto pitch, turned it down (see Murray's support
for him), heard no discussion in control room re delayed kick-off
but knew in general terms that kick-off would be delayed for
incidents, not events around the ground.


Agreed with Mr Isaacs that if safety aspects arose thervdifferent
considerations would apply. No request to divert fans, had not
considered it necessary, expected them to distribute themselves.
Had he thought there was an obvious risk or that something needed
to be done, he would have said it. Confirmed good relationship
within control room, would not have been frightened to voice
opinion (Murray). Had not noticed anything unusual about pens,
there was some space in Pen 1 but had noticed nothing unusual.
Some swaying but no surging seen. Attention first drawn to pen
when people climbing out and gate open, attention diverted to
Leppings Lane and Gate C and Gate A (request to open gates but
he thought it would be Gate C only), saw Supt Greenwood trying to
radio, message came through to stop the match, ran onto pitch.
He didn't put out a call for ambulances. No discussion re diversion
of fans, not aware of closure of tunnel in 1988.
 231.   D GODDARD (continued   2)

MR ISAACS XE (Some of his XE included above)

Control box very full.  Had heard Murray say he thought the crowd
would get in. This was in line with his thinking. Radio disruption
in fact longer than two minutes. If he had thought diversion was
necessary he would have mentioned it and if he thought there was
any risk he would have done something about it. Did not connect
access to the tunnel and Gate C, even though he knew the ground,
expected crowd to go where there were spaces.


MR MANNING XE

Established community spirit and regularity of officers. Recognised
operational order as Mr Mole's plan. His job was communications,
co-ordination of experienced officers. Would have disagreed with
Mr Murray when he said the crowd could get in, if he had thought
it was a mistake.


Confirmed 1988 Kop problems and therefore camera trained on it.
Confirmed talk-through, normal method of communication, advantages
illustrated by PC Buxton, radio engineer, Insp Sewell responding,
breakdown of radio calamitous, most disruptive, knock-on effect.
After repair no priority.


2.15 nil of note in pens, 2.30 PC Bichard drew their attention,
nothing unusual noticed until about 15.00 when people were climbing
out. Did see beach ball and swaying. View of the front apparently
obscured by overhang. Agreed that C490 (1988) was the sort of view,
could not see much difference between that and C449 as far as Pen 6
was concerned. It was part of his duty to monitor the crowd as a
whole, which includes Leppings lane. He caused mounted officers
and reserve serial to be sent round. Mr Murray arranged for tannoy,
he could see no alternative to opening the gate, intent on saving
lives, nothing else obvious other than that. Did not think of any
risk or link between gate and tunnel. Would have taken steps if
it was necessary.

 XE BY MR KING

 First message of Mr Marshall's followed by opening, he thought
 that probably had sufficiently resolved the situation.       Then
 second message, some discussion, then demand, he realised there
 were many people outside.       He was aware of the geography, he wasn't
 asked about it, could have supplied information regarding that area
 if he had been asked where they would be going to, if his mind had
 been directed that way.
 N.B. This is a risk from hypothetical argument, we do not actually
 know what he would have said.
Had he considered any risk he would have (a) delayed the opening
of Gate C and (b) put manpower to seal the tunnel and divert people.
He thought it could have been done (Mrs McBrien). A long discussion
regarding opening of Gate A and what the time interval between that
and the opening of Gate C was. His original thought was that there
was a gap between these events and subsequently changed his mind.
Mr Bichard, although not remembering the times, felt that he had
trained his camera onto Gate A as soon as the request was made
(which would time it at about 14.58, i.e. in line with Mr Goddard's
initial recollection).
He did not accept that the tunnel was the only route.       They could
go there, they could go down the south side and through the gap in
the wall, particularly those supporters who knew the ground and had
been there before.
N.B. Compilation video which does seem toshow quite a few people
using that gap. Also query the filling of NW terrace which was
supposed to have been happening at the same time as central pens.


Although he was not asked about the tunnel, had he thought about it
he would undoubtedly have acted. He confirmed that it is easier
to assess the difference between Pen 1 and the centre rather than
Pen 6 . He did not accept that when the gate was opened there was
no room in the centre pens. He confirmed that there had been
access to the Club statistics on entry although he himself had
not requested them.

     231.     D GODDARD (continued...4)

     He confirmed that he had said it was too late to postpone kick-off,
     based on his understanding that simple delay was not a ground on
     the one hand and on the other hand that to delay kick-off when the
     players had come out was an unprecedented act as far as he was
     concerned     (N.B. Mr Murray explicitly accepted responsibility
                     for this remark and supported Mr Goddard.)
     His view was that the decisions were inevitable.


^   The view of the terrace from the control room is limited to a
     certain extent.    He did not agree with Mrs McBrien that signalling
    the coded message would have been the right thing to do.      His
    explanation was that it would convey nothing to the fans and
    would simply disperse everyone to every gate within the ground,
    whereas one had a local problem at Leppings Lane, (contrast Sgt.
    Crawford's serial who; if that message had been published, some
    would have gone down onto the terracing to man the radial gates).

    He confirmed to Mr Russell that C534 showed Mr McGroby, timed at
    15.00. He described Mr Greenwood signalling and trying to radio,
    his recollection is that he was not where shown on C529 (perimeter
    fencing) but near the goal (Mr Bichard also remembered him on the
    field).     Same comments apply to C530 (use of radio).   He confirmed
    that Insp Charles radiod in with manpower 5 x 50 and was told       to
    go to the rear of the tunnel to clear the terraces. He seemed to
    think this was close to Operation Support. When he saw officers
    in the terrace his first thought was that these were Insp Charles'
    men. He also confirmed that there was one other radio message from
    the field from a track officer but the message was unintelligible.

    MR PAYNE XE

    He agreed that this was the most dire emergency ever.


    Re the request to open the gates, he thought the request referred
    to Gate C only, (also Bichard).
223 J. NICHOLL                                   STATISTICIAN

Mr Nicholl presented his statistical analysis. In a nutshell, he
was able to say that there was a difference in age distribution
between people who had arrived before 2.30 compared to people who
had arrived after that, that comparing the pre-2.30 with the post-
2.30, even after allowing for women and youths, showed a greater
chance of alcohol ingestion. He agreed that in effect statistical
figures can be presented in different ways, that within the groups,
in particular the post-2.30 entry group, 43% had taken no alcohol,
21 % had a level of above 80, that the remainder had under 80.


N.B.
The overall import of his figures is that there is a substantial
minority, 20 %, who would have been unfit to drive and that this fits
entirely with Mr Marshall's evidence and indeed Mr McKay who had
estimated about 20%. The other side of the coin is that 80% or so
had either taken no alcohol or only amounts which would not have
prevented them driving.


What effect the alcohol level on behaviour is a matter he could not
comment on. See Dr Forrest's views. The behaviour effects of
alcohol are difficult. It is for you judge what weight you put on
the evidence of people like Mr Marshall.


It was Mr Nicholl's view that on the assumption that the alcohol
had not played a part in the deaths, which seems to be the case in
view of the pathologist's evidence) the sample could be taken as
representative of the crowd as a whole.


Other interesting points:- there was an age distinction between the
people who entered after 2.30 and those who entered before; finally,
a substantial number of people who died had entered after 2.30. In
fact only 19 proved entry before then, plus or minus     at least
some of the 13 unknowns.

           J. P. Nicholl, Medical Care Research Unit, University of Sheffield.

Summary

This note discusses the evidence for associations between time of entry to Hillsborough
football ground, age, and alcohol consumption amongst spectators who died. There is
some statistical evidence that those victims who entered late were more likely to have
raised blood alcohol levels than those who entered early. This association is in part due
to the fact that the women and youths who died had little blood alcohol and also tended
to have entered the ground early. However, the association between time of entry and
alcohol levels persisted in men aged 18 or more.

The Data

Data was provided by HM Coroner on the probable time of entry to the ground and
route of entry, the place of death, blood alcohol level, and the age and sex of each of the
95 victims of the Hillsborough football disaster.




Results

1. Time of entry

The time of entry and route of entry were classified as shown in table 1, which also
shows the age, sex, and blood alcohol levels of those spectators who died. Nothing was
known about the entry times of 13 spectators. For a further 22 spectators the time of
entry was assessed as being after 2.30 pm. but it was not known whether they entered via
gate "C", and hence after 2.48 when the gate was opened, or via a turnstile.           The
remaining victims have been divided into two groups according to whether or not they
entered before 2.48 (via a turnstile), or at or after 2.48 (when gate C was opened).
There are associations between both the age and sex of the victims and when they
entered the ground.    More than half (53%) of the victims who are known to have
entered before 2.48 were under 20, whilst less than a third (31%) of those known to
have entered after 2.48 were youths (table 2). Similarly, all 5 of the women whose entry
times were certainly known entered before 2.30 (table 3). One woman was known to
have entered either through gate "C" or after 2.30, and nothing was known about the
entrance of the other woman who died.

The age distribution of those who were known only to have entered either through gate
"C" or through a turnstile after 2.30 was the same as the age distribution of those known
to have entered after 2.48; and quite different from that of those known to have entered
before 2.48 (table 2). Furthermore, of the 7 victims known to have died in pen 4, three
were known to have entered after 2.48 (via gate "C") and the other four were assessed as
having either entered through gate C or through a turnstile after 2.30. This evidence
suggests that those victims who were known only to have entered via gate C or after 2.30
may form part of the group who entered after 2.48; and they have been combined with
this group in the main analysis below to form a group of 48 victims termed "later
entrants". The remainder are termed "earlier entrants" (34 victims), or "not known" (13
victims).




Blood alcohol levels

The blood alcohol levels have been divided into three categories: no blood alcohol or
negligible traces (< 10 mg/dl); between 10 and 70 mg/dl, and 80 mg/dl or more. The
latter value is the legal limit for drinking and driving and merely provides a convenient,
though arbitrary, divide. It certainly does not imply that persons over this value were
inebriated.

Over half (54%) of the 95 victims had no blood alcohol or negligible traces (< lOmg/dl).
Only 15 (16%) had more than 80 mg/dl (the legal limit for drinking and driving). Blood
alcohol was also associated with age and sex. Nearly three quarters (71%) of the victims
under 20 years old had negligible blood alcohol, compared to under a half (42%) of
those 20 or over (table 4). None of the women had any blood alcohol recorded (table
5).



Time of entry and blood alcohol level

Approximately one-third (35%) of the "earlier entrants" had raised blood alcohol levels
(> lOmg/dl), compared to nearly two-thirds (63%) of the "later entrants". The odds of
having a raised blood alcohol level for "later entrants" were 3»1 (95% Confidence

Interval: 1 • 2, 7 • 6) times as great as the odds for "earlier entrants". Thus there is strong
statistical evidence that "later entrants" were more likely to have raised blood alcohol
levels than "earlier entrants".

This association could have arisen merely because the young victims and the women
tended both to be earlier entrants and to have negative or negligible blood alcohol
levels. However, after excluding both women and young men from the analysis, the
association between alcohol and entry time persisted. For men over 18, 45% of "earlier
entrants" had blood alcohols in excess of 10 mg/dl (and 15% in excess of 80mg/dl),
whilst 71% of the "later entrants" had blood alcohol in excess of 10 m g/dl (and 29% in
excess of 80mg/dl) (table 7). Amongst men over 18, the odds of having a raised blood
alcohol level for "later entrants" were 3*0 (95% Cl: 1*0, 9*3) times as great as for
"earlier entrants", exactly as before.

This analysis is complicated by the fact that there were 13 victims whose entrance to the
ground is unrecorded, and a further 22 who can be assessed only to have entered either
through gate C (after 2.48 pm.) or through a turnstile after 2.30. The latter group have
been included with the "later entrants" after 2.48 on the basis of the similarity of their
age distribution and the disposition of their places of death. This may be wrong. If,
instead, the victims are split into two groups according to whether or not they entered
before or after 2.30 pm, then these 22 victims certainly form part of the group of later
entrants defined in this way.

The association between blood alcohol and entrance before or after 2.30 is shown in
table 8, and, again, there is some evidence that later entrants after 2.30 were more likely
to have raised alcohol levels than earlier entrants before 2.30. The odds of having
raised alcohol levels for these later entrants were 2 • 9 (95 % Cl: 1 • 0, 8 • 6) times as great
as those for earlier entrants defined in this way.




Discussion

Whether the alcohol levels and times of entrance of these 95 victims bear any relation to
those in the general body of spectators is difficult to assess. However, if the alcohol
levels of the victims were related to their deaths, in the sense of having increased their
chances of dying, then plainly their alcohol levels might bear no relation to those in the
rest of the spectators who entered at the same time. If, on the other hand, the alcohol
levels in these victims played no part in their deaths and were not a factor in the chance
that they died, then it is at least possible that the victims’ alcohol levels reflect those that
were generally prevalent amongst the spectators who entered at the same times via the
same routes.

Since these are generally small levels of alcohol, it is perhaps unlikely that the level of
alcohol was a contributing factor in the deaths of any individual spectator. That is to
say, it is unlikely that the reason why one spectator died rather than another can be
explained to any extent at all by the victim’s blood alcohol level. (However, this does
not, of course, preclude the possibility that alcohol played some part in the deaths. It
would still be possible, to argue, for example, that the general level of alcohol
consumption amongst the spectators raised the general chance of there being some
victims without being relevant to the deaths of any individuals).

If the level of alcohol was not a contributory factor in the death of any individual then it
is possible that the alcohol levels in the victims entering at different times is a
representative sample of the alcohol levels in the spectators as a whole entering at the
same times. If this is the case, then there is some statistical evidence that amongst
spectators who entered later there was a greater proportion who had been drinking
before the game than amongst spectators who entered earlier..

     Limited experience of policing at Hillsborough (1979/80). His
     position was a generalist rather than a specialist. Relatively
     little discussion with Mr Mole (22 March and another meeting).
     He did understand the operational plan was a tried and tested
     one, well served by subordinates and nothing was drawn to his
     attention to make him think of difficulties.                               36
     Operational order accepted except for very minor amendments.
     Knew ground had safety certificate, unsure of his recollection
     as to discussions re "find you own level".                                 37
     Limited knowledge of ground, Mr Sewell, hand-picked officers, no
     intelligence of public order matters, briefing general but stressed
     safety.                                              41,42,43 *
     Kick-off postponement discussed twice, both with Mr Murray, second
     time in the control room. Generally postponement only if delay
     was due to something significant delaying arrival (says policy is
     flexible, no previous experience). On the day, beautiful, nothing
     to give him cause for concern, went with Mr Murray, met Mr Jackson
    in control room, stayed there, closure of Leppings Lane he thinks
    14.30 (see Marshall and Murray). Decision responsibility of
    Superintendent, no intervention necessary, limited view. Discussed
    crowd getting in, reassured, (kick-off discussed).                          49
    Radio down about 14.40, caused tremendous disruption.   View of
    role, major decisions eg. evacuation, delay kick-off, sort out
    disputes at senior level. Seems to recollect mentioning in passing
    some comment about tannoy messages for people to spread. After
    the radio came on the situation outside became very difficult.
    Next recollection is gate bursting open and simultaneous request
    to open gates (Bichard). • Felt situation had been resolved when
    gate closed. Further request, only one remembered, "if you do
    not open the gates someone is going to get killed".                         5 3 , 54   *
    Unprecedented decision, breaching order etc, chivvied by Mr Murray,
    decided to authorise if it would save life. Around this time did
    consider postponing kick-off but noticed what appeared to him to       —p
    be players on the field, balanced problems within ground, diversion
    of effort if problems occurred. Communication difficult to sort
    out, hindsight, option not taken up.
DAYS 68/69



222.   D G DUCKENFIELD (continued...2)

Heard further message that if Gate A wasn't opened it would go,
responded to by staff.
When he opened the gate he said that his recollection was there
was space in the concourse and that he was aiming to save life.
Did not fully appreciate the geography, fully consumed by the
position.
Agreed that action was taken to alert serials to go to the North
stand and perimeter track to cope with non-ticket-holders.    Thinks
he had picked up the point from conversation in the control box.
Had a partially obscured view of the terraces but could see them.
Did not see any disparity on the terraces after the gate was
opened, did not notice any increase in crowd density. First
noticed something when fans came through perimeter gates.
Uncertain what was happening. Ongoing situation, noticed WPC and
McGroby went down to sort it out.
N.B. I put it to himthat he had sent McGroby but his response was
that he could not remember whether he did or whether McGroby
volunteered. (Exhibit shown at 15.00).
No recollection of whether he instructed Mr Murray to stop the
match or did it on his own. Thinks he returned but has no real
recollection. Remembers Mr Jackson coming, difficult to locate
time. Does not recollect seeing people on the terrace from his
position, view obscured.   Recollects message for fleet of
ambulances.   Says he initiated operational support/major incident.
(Bichard thought it was Jackson but it is rather strange that the
control room asked for confirmation from ACC if he gave the first
instruction.')
Remembers giving request for tannoy messages (see evidence from
Mackrell). Does not recollect giving instructions for people to
go round to the back, did not initiate emergency evacuation message,
concerned about getting people back to hospital, in the heat of
the moment did not think of it.
Did not find out about fatalities until he came back from the
d i re c t o rs ’ box.

 XE BY MR PAYNE
Mr Duckenfield was aware of the safety certificate but not its detail,
 its significance was that the ground had been examined by experts
and was therefore safe to operate. He believed that it was safe
up to its capacity and that he was neither indifferent to the risk
of injury nor had it been obvious to him that people would be-be+d
in the pens when the gates were opened.


XE BY MR KING

He agreed with Mr King that people had died because of overcrowding.
He agreed that he did not have detailed knowledge of the safety
certificate, geography or signs. He had seen and read the ACPO
and standing instructions, the Green Guide was available but he may
well not have read it. Was not aware of any pre-planning schedules
i.e. stewards, he did not know the details of the stewards but
then he did not know them for the rest of the ground either. He
had been been appointed to run a Division. He was a generalist,
he did not have the experience of Chief Supt Mole but had the
support of a good team and as Chief Supt he did have a role to play,
he did not accept that he was hopelessly incompetant and that
realistically one could only absorb so much in 21 days.   He was
aware of the pens, of the gates at the back and that there was an
entry point centrally. He did not have detailed knowledge of the
turnstiles, he knew the tunnel but not its geographic relationship
to the turnstiles or the gate. He was not aware of the ticketing
but this was a matter for the Club. He d i d ^ t know they were colour   7"
coded. He was conceded with safety and he was aware that the system
would be that the fans would find their own level, i.e. enter in
an orderly fashion, distribute themselves as they wished. With
regard to overcrowding he would expect the officers on the track
and the West stand to keep an eye open.
In final analysis the ground had been examined and passed by experts
and, provided the capacity was not exceeded, overcrowding should
not occur.

 Police intervention should not be needed at all except in extreme
 situations. He would expect intervention if there were signs of
 distress or discomfort, that there was a partnership between fans
 and officials in communication and responding. He would expect
 officers with experience to react and observe ongoing situations.
 His briefing had been general with regard to safety, he did not
 give specific instructions re monitoring for overcrowding but the
 officers were well versed and knew the situation.


 Mr King put it that no track officer had said he had received a
 briefing (Mr Illingworth (210) who said he knew his job and didn't
 need it). As far as he was concerned the system was safe and had
 worked in the past. His attention had not been drawn to any
 specific problem with Leppings Lane or that there was any risk
 to safety because of the radial fences. A lot of time had been
 spent on the inclusion of the word "overcrowding".     Mr Creaser (48)
 seemed to indicate that there may have been some personal briefing
 to that effect (but is the case that is being made that, had the
 order or brief included that one word, would all suggestions of
inadequacy thereby fall away and, more particularly, would it have
made any difference. Compare evidence of Sgt Swift f'z-O

                                          Green
not to mention Illingworth (210), Smith (57) and Bull as (192).


It was not obvious to him or indeed anybody else that it would be
difficult to move once in the pen, he would expect the person to
retrace his steps and then look around, as any intelligent person
would do. Mere disparity, at 14.45, would not alarm him, it would
only become significant if other factors occurred, details of this
rather sparse.   He did not accept the premise that the Police Service
were uncaring and that they would take action and would take whatever
option was appropriate in the light of the circumstances.
 DAY 68
 12.3.91

 222 D G DUCKENFIELD (continued      )

He agreed there was no contingency plan for monitoring and that the
 system had worked before but that there were no arrangements to
encourage even distribution.   POs would respond to any developing
situation.


 He did not know of the closure of the tunnel gates in 1988.
 In 1989 when he requested the gates to be opened, he expected the
people to go onto the concourse area. He believed there was room
on the terrace to accommodate them but thought they would recover
in the concourse and disperse through several routes.
When he asked himself the question as to where the people      would
go, his response to himself was the concourse area and in due course
dispersal. He would not accept that he could see an obvious risk.
He was aware that he had askef for the gates to be opened, that they
opened onto the concourse and that there was a t u n n e l .
A lot of time was spent trying to establish what routes he knew
onto the terrace.   He obviously knew all three but did not seem to
be familiar with the signing. His explanation for the time interval
between the first response from Marshall and giving the order was
that, having received the request and seen the gates burst open
and the position being retrieved, he assumed that the problem had
been alleviated. When the next request came it was as if the
"world had stopped" he could see that the concourse was clear,
appreciated the effect on their planning, he was chivvied by Mr
Murray and the maximum time interval would have been three minutes.
He agreed that he did not inform Mr Green nor the Club, nor the
serials on the concourse but with regard to the latter they would
have been aware in his view of the situation. The radio was on
talk-through, everyone would have been able to hear, that was the
point, he would not be drawn on what the serials on the concourse
would have known with regard to the state of the terraces. He
postulated that fans had a role in this too, that they would unwind,
sort themselves out and act responsibly, but he suggested that they
might well go down the tunnel, survey the scene and decide to go
back. He felt he had acted responsibly.

 He said immediately after the opening he was distracted by the
 question regarding Gate A.   Apart from not understanding it,
 it occupied his mind.     In the end he agreed that serials were
 deployed in front of the North stand and in the stand because
 he feared ticket!ess fans might enter.      He explained that law
 and order and safety in that situation were hand in glove.      He
 could not explain why he had not thought of dispersal earlier.
 He had not noticed problems in Leppings Lane until a PO opened
 the gate, he had not seen any surges, as far as he could recollect
 there was normality.    He did expect the fans to enter the terrace.
 He did not see any marked disparity. His view of the terrace was
 different and limited particularly because of his position but
 did have the benefit of the videos.    Did not recollect the message
 about the pitch invasion, could not explain who C517 (a) and (b)
 at 15.08 linked the need of ambulances with bursting of the gates.
 He did not know when he made the connection but it was later.


He would not be drawn on what he described as casual conversation
with many people regarding the causation. He did not request the
cameras to pan the terrace, although it might have been done. From
his position it was not obvious to him what was going on after 14.59
to 15.05 (C326(a) and C330).     He could not see people's faces, they
were standing up and from his angle, distance and position, saw
no obvious signs of distress.


He was again asked about the link at 2.30 between asking for kick-off
to be delayed and assessment of numbers. It was put to him that
he had a rigid distinction between excusable and non-excusable delay.
He considered it wholly unfair. He was asked whether he thought
his inexperience may have contributed. His response was that the
two important decisions, namely, the decision to open the gates,
which was unprecedented, and the decision to ask for operational
support when he realised that things were bad - were decisions which
he had taken. It was again suggested that he hadn't followed his
decision through but his response was that he had already dealt
with it.

As far as he was concerned he had been told that the ground system
 and staffing was satisfactory.     He accepted that he had ultimate
 responsibility.     He had not considered closing Leppings Lane a
major decision.      Even if he had wanted to contact ACC Jackson he
would have inevitably caused delay.      He agreed that opening the
gates was a momentous decision, it could defeat operational plan,
 potentially let in drunks, people with weapons and ticket!ess fans,
there was a risk of capacities being exhausted, but that the concourse
area was not the final destination, that fans would want to take up
a viewing position. It was put to him that if the fans were anxious
outside they were were likely to be anxious inside. He said that in
the position he was in there was little alternative to opening the gates.
As far as he was concerned, both inside and outside, as soon as it
was realised what the situation was, action was taken.
There was some confusion as to the tannoy messages but he did agree
that no general instructions to the crowd were sent out.      He recollected
that messages were being put out to "ease back

XE BY MR ISAACS

He had no reason to believe that the operational plan order wasn't
safe, nor that Leppings Lane terraces were not safe. He had not been
told by anyone of experience that there was any operational danger,
nor had any specific areas been drawn to his attention as dangerous.
His attention had not been drawn to the lack of signing or the
geography of Gate C to the tunnel.     He was adequately acquainted
with the ground for normal situations. It wasn't his task to specifically
monitor, and nobody (murray, Bullas etc) had suggested to him that
there was any abnormality on the terraces, nor that there were any
differences between 1988 and 1989.     He had not been asked by Mr Murray
to postpone the match. He thought the shortest interval between
Mr Marshall's second request and opening the gates was perhaps
U minutes.
                                         D. G. DUCKENFIELD

 from Mr. Marshall for the gate to be opened.   I remember
 turning and looking at the monitor on my left.   The
 monitor, as I recall it, is on the left and I remember
 turning and much the same as I was taken a little by
 surprise with the closing of Leppings Lane and the bus
 passing, I turned and looked and thought, "What does he
 want the gates opening for?"    An absolute shock.   As I
 turned and looked the gate burst open.   Now I know...

 Can we just make sure we know which gate we are talking
 about?   Are we talking about the gate we now all know as
 Gate C? - A. Gate C.

You didn't know it was called Gate C? - A. No, no idea.
As I turned and looked, I don't know whether I said it,
it may be I didn't say it, but in my mind thought, "The
gate has burst open," but PC Bichard, if my memory serves
me correctly said, "What's he on about?   The gate has
burst open anyway."   Bearing in mind we have got a small
TV screen - and I am guessing - 9" square, black and
white, possibly 10' away from me, and our perception was
at that time, and still is today, even though others will
say that we are incorrect, that that gate had burst open
and some fans had got in.

A mounted Officer came to their assistance, whoever they
were at that gate, and recovered the situation and the
gate was closed.   As far as I was concerned, I thought,
 He has made the request.  That has relieved the
situation," and that matter was finalised in my mind.

So what happened then as far as you are concerned?
Before you tell me that, can you remember where you were
within the Control Box?   Put it another way, where was
Mr. Murray at that point?   Was he seated in the place
where he was supposed to be or were you in that spot? -
A. No - if I answer it in this way:  I was stood
somewhere towards the back and on that...   There is a
raised platform.

There is a raised platform. - A. I was in about that sort
of location and I can only presume that Mr. Murray was in
the front somewhere.

You were at the back? - A. I was at the back.

OK, carry on. - A. The next thing that occurred, having
retrieved the situation, and the next thing that happened
was that Superintendent Marshall came over again and made
a request.   Now my understanding is he just made one
request and this request was quite a shocking experience.
He said, "If you don't open the gates, someone is going
to get killed."   That really was, I think it is safe to
say, quite riveting.   In that respect, I think to stand
                                         D. G. DUCKENFIELD

there and to be faced with a situation where a colleague
who is extremely experienced and there have been no
messages prior to that of a deterioration that is causing
him concern, to say to you, "Open the gates or somebody
is going to get killed," that really was something which
was unprecedented, was totally outside my police
experience and obviously totally outside my police
training, and really to accede to his request to open the
gates it would defeat everything we had planned in our
Operational Order of not allowing people in who were
drunk, not allowing people in who might be carrying
offensive weapons.   X do not need to go over that.    I
am sure you understand that.

Yes. - A. I was stood there thinking about that and the
enormity of that decision, and thinking, "If I don't open
the gates people are going to get killed."   Then
Mr. Murray - the atmosphere in the Control Box, to say it
was a football ground with probably 50,000 in it, and we
talk frequently about the noise etc., to use a well worn
phrase you could hear a pin drop.   The atmosphere was
electric.   I was stood there and I was asked to make
that decision and it seemed as though the world had
stopped.   Mr. Murray then said to me, "Mr. Duckenfield,
are you going to open the gates?"   As you can imagine,
whatever rigid plans people might have, whatever policies
you might have, if it means saving lives and preventing
injury then you do your level best, don't you, to save
people's lives?   So I gave the order to open the gates.

The Officer put that out across the radio, I take it? -
A. Yes.   Superintendent Murray said...   Just bear with
me a moment.

Yes, of course.   - A. Superintendent Murray - I recall
him, he had got   this personal radio in his hand.
Forgive me sometimes for demonstrating but this is how it
comes back to mind.     He had got this personal radio and
I recall it in his hand, held something like at shoulder
level like this.    He turned to me and said,
"Mr. Duckenfield, are you going to open the gates?"     Of
course I told him to do so.     He then spoke into the
radio and said, "Open the gates.     Open the gates."   In
my mind it was "gates" and there was no distinction, and
that was it.

Did you hear PC Buxton, or somebody from the Land Rover,
request the postponement of the match?    Did you yourself
hear that? - A.   I am not sure.  If I can just go through
the thought processes at about that time.    I remember PC
Buxton being asked for and I remember him coming.    I
have some difficulty about the postponement which it
probably may be better to explain later.    I am confused
because I had it in my mind that postponement was raised

He was seeking to save lives. He agreed that all the officers involved
were very competant. He agreed that the time that was available to
him was a maximum of 12 minutes, contrasted with length of evidence.
He confirmed that C326a was not a view he had, C490 (1988 match) was
more realistic.    C449 (1988 match) Pen 6 looked full on photograph.
                                      D. G. DUCKENFIELD

What I would like you to do is to tell me, first of
all, you have already told me partly what your
objective was of having this briefing, but what were
your objectives with regard to this pre-match briefing
on 14th April, and secondly what were your views with
regard to responsibility towards the public in general?
- A. Right.   I think the situation, sir, is this, that
anyone who has seen the Operational Order, and the
thickness of it, and the information it contains, must
be well aware that we cannot cater for every
eventuality and it is important for me as a Commander
to set out what my objectives are on the day, so people
are quite clear where we are.   In that respect I
prepared a briefing.   Now another unusual feature is I
typed this briefing, because I was new and I wanted to
get it right I typed it out and what have you, so this
is the briefing I prepared.   I went down it and
basically it was to outline, first of all, the fact
that it was a 54,000 - I am jumping paragraphs which
are not relevant.

Yes, we don't need everything. - A. I told people about
the crowd, how many people we expected, described to
them the layout of the Ground, and I told them about
extra time being played, the difficulties with the same
colours.  Then I came to what I considered to be a very
relevant part and I said specifically to them:

     "It is our intention today that this match will
     take place without any public disorder and we must
     ensure the safety of the public both inside and
     outside the ground and segregate the opposing
     fans".

and I talked about obstruction of the highway.   I then
went on to say:

     "I want the public to be treated properly but
     those who transgress should be dealt with firmly
     but fairly within the law."

Then, sir, I went on to say:

     "I cannot stress too highly the word 'Safety'.
     This ground will be full to capacity today and
     some of you may never have experienced a football
     match of this nature before ...."

Does it say "befote" there? - A. I am sorry, no, it
doesn't:

    "OUr job is to ensure the safety of spectators and
    you must make sure you know the escape routes, the
    problem areas, and that you are fully conversant
                                           D. G. DUCKENFIELD

          with your responsibilities should a crisis arise.
          There will be a tremendous atmosphere within the
          ground but you must not be caught up in this or
          the events that are taking place on the field you
          must remain detached and clear headed at all times
          to respond to events."

 I then went on, sir, to discuss matters generally and
 point out the individual responsibilities of the Sector
Commanders, that is who was in charge in the Control
Room, I said that the Control Room would be commanded
by Superintendent Murray, and I went on giving
information, I think, that has already come before this
Inquest.

Yes. - A. I did make the point that -- I am sorry,
sir, just bear with me a moment.   Another, I believe,
relevant paragraph is that I said:

         "All Inspectors ...."

- and this was on the Saturday briefing -

         "All Inspectors who attended briefing yesterday,
         these officers will, at the end of this particular
         briefing, speak to their respective contingents
         and advise them of what they expect and of the
         particular problems in their area."

I went on to say:

         "Any difficulties or any decisions within those
         areas will be taken by ...."

- and this, sir, says Section Superintendent.  I think
it is a misrepresentation in the transcribing.  It
really should be Sector Superintendents, so it should
read:

         "Any difficulties or any decisions within those
         areas will be taken by Sector Superintendents."

I then went on to make mention of CID matters.  I
talked about train times, travelling arrangements and I
think at the bottom of page 5, sir, I emphasised at
this point something that has probably come out
previously.  I said:
    ||

         Gentlemen, the order covers most eventualities and
         I can't in this limited time cover everything, but
         there will be additional briefings by your
         Supervisory Officers and your Inspectors have a
         copy of the operational order and are fully
         conversant with what our intentions are today."
                                                          43
                                         D. G. DUCKENFIELD

   I finally said to them, sir, in the final couple of
   sentences or so:

        "Firm but fair policing with the correct attitude.
        Safety of supporters in this ground is paramount.
        Nobody gets in without a ticket.
        Nobody takes a drink or banners into the ground
        and nobody goes in who is drunk."

   and that was the closing of my briefing, sir.

Q. It is only a very minor point and it is not important:
   the paragraph where you say that all Inspectors who
   attended the briefing yesterday, that presumably was
   included in your briefing on the Friday as well, wasn't
   it, but I take it you changed the words when you spoke
   it? - A. Yes, sir. What happened was this, that I had
   a draft and when I gave the briefing on the Friday it
   had to be changed slightly and in the transcribing the
   odd word is incorrect, but it is substantially correct.

Q. You used the same format, but I think somewhat
   shortened, on the Saturday, is that right? - A. Yes,
   sir.

Q. That was, of course, addressed to the 800-odd people
   who were in the Stadium? - A. Yes, sir.

Q. I think just so that we don't mislead anybody you
   actually left out out one paragraph which dealt with
   the safety aspect, didn't you, in the Saturday
   briefing?  Is that right? Do you want to have a look?
   - A. Which one?

Q. I am not in any sense complaining about it, it is just
   that I don't want to have any misunderstandings.   My
   understanding is that you did not deal with,  I cannot
   stress too highly the word 'Safety'"? - A. Are you
   suggesting that I did not say that on the Saturday?

Q. I am asking you. - A. As far as I am concerned, sir, it
   is my view that I said it. The only difficulty I have
   is that my original papers were handed in and I make no
   complaint about that, but I have only got the
   transcribed version and I can't check back.

Q. I may be wrong. - A. It is my view, sir, that I ....

Q. Yes, you did say it.  It is in the transcribed version,
   I beg your pardon, I take it back.  It is certainly in
   the transcription anyway. - A. Yes.
                                                               58
                                                D. G. DUCKENFTET.n


 Q. When the order was given to open the gates what
    thoughts went through your mind at that point as to
    what would happen to the people who would enter through
    the gates? As I say, you do not have to answer this
    question if you do not wish to. - A. My recollection,
    sir, is that there was space in the concourse and if
    that gate was opened I could save people's lives.

Q. Did you appreciate at that time the geography of the
   ground and in particular the relationship of the gate
   to the tunnel? - A. No, sir.

Q. All these are prejudicial questions. Were you at that
   time in a position to visualise the entry points on to
   the terracing from the concourse area? - A. No, sir.

Q. You understand the question.  Have you understood what
   I have asked? What I am asking you is, did you have a
   mental picture of the concourse area and the way that
   people would have to go if thpr were going to get
   either into the stands or on to the terracing? - A. At
   that stage, sir, I was totally consumed by the decision
   to save lives and my only thoughts were that people
   would go in the concourse. After that I didn't have a
   picture.

Q. Did you around that time when you gave the instruction
   look at the terracing as far as you now remember? - A.
   Thinking back, and it is difficult to judge obviously
   with so much that has passed, I think there was space
   on the terracing beneath the Control Box and there was
   space in the concourse.

Q. Again this is a prejudicial question.   You did not, I
   take it, give any orders for serials to position
   themselves to direct the fans in any particular
   direction from the concourse area? - A. As I said, sir,
   I was totally consumed by the decision.

Q. Did you yourself give any directions for people to be
   positioned behind Gate A with a view to channelling
   people who might be coming through that gate? - A. No,
   sir, I didn't.  Any decision of that nature must have
   been taken by somebody else and I can't add to that.

Q. What about positioning serials both within the North
   Stand and outside the North Stand? Did that at some
   point occur and again this is a prejudicial question? -
   A. That is right.  I do not know what the situation was
   exactly but action was taken to alert serials who were
   on standby and directions were given to go to the North
   Stand and on to the perimeter track as a result of the
   situation that had developed.

from Mr. Marshall for the gate to be opened.   I remember
turning and looking at the monitor on my left.   The
monitor, as I recall it, is on the left and I remember
turning and much the same as I was taken a little by
surprise with the closing of Leppings Lane and the bus
passing, I turned and looked and thought, "What does he
want the gates opening for?"    An absolute shock. As I
turned and looked the gate burst open.   Now I know...

Can we just make sure we know which gate we are talking
about?   Are we talking about the gate we now all know as
Gate C? - A. Gate C.

You didn't know it was called Gate C? - A. No, no idea.
As I turned and looked, I don't know whether I said it,
it may be I didn't say it, but in my mind thought, "The
gate has burst open," but PC Bichard, if my memory serves
me correctly said, What's he on about?    The gate has

white, possibly 10' away from me, and our perception was
at that time, and still is today, even though others will
say that we are incorrect, that that gate had burst open
and some fans had got in.

A mounted Officer came to their assistance, whoever they
were at that gate, and recovered the situation and the
gate was closed.   As far as I was concerned, I thought,
 He has made the request. That has relieved the
situation," and that matter was finalised in my mind.

So what happened then as far as you are concerned?
Before you tell me that, can you remember where you were
within the Control Box?   Put it another way, where was
Mr. Murray at that point?   Was he seated in the place
where he was supposed to be or were you in that spot? -
A. No - if I answer it in this way:  I was stood
somewhere towards the back and on that...   There is a
raised platform.

There is a raised platform. - A. I was in about that sort
of location and I can only presume that Mr. Murray was in
the front somewhere.

You were at the back? - A. I was at the back.

OK, carry on. - A. The next thing that occurred, having
retrieved the situation, and the next thing that happened
was that Superintendent Marshall came over again and made
a request.   Now my understanding is he just made one
request and this request was quite a shocking experience.
He said, "If you don't open the gates, someone is going
to get killed."   That really was, I think it is safe to
say, quite riveting.   In that respect, I think to stand
                                                          54
                                           D. G. DUCKENFIELD

  there and to be faced with a situation where a colleague
  who is extremely experienced and there have been no
  messages prior to that of a deterioration that is causing
  him concern, to say to you, "Open the gates or somebody
  is going to get killed, ' that really was something which
  was unprecedented, was totally outside my police
  experience and obviously totally outside my police
  training, and really to accede to his request to open the
  gates it would defeat everything we had planned in our
  Operational Order of not allowing people in who were
  drunk, not allowing people in who might be carrying
  offensive weapons#   I do not need to go over that#    I
  am sure you understand that*

Q. Yes. - A. I was stood there thinking about that and the
   enormity of that decision, and thinking, ”If I don t open
   the gates people are going to get killed."    Then
   Mr. Murray - the atmosphere in the Control Box, to say it
   was a football ground with probably 50,000 in it, and we
   talk frequently about the noise etc., to use a well worn
   phrase you could hear a pin drop.    The atmosphere was
   electric.   I was stood there and I was asked to make
   that decision and it seemed as though the world had
   stopped.   Mr. Murray then said to me, "Mr. Duckenfield,
   are you going to open the gates?"    As you can imagine,
   whatever rigid plans people might have, whatever policies
   you might have, if it means saving lives and preventing
   injury then you do your level best, don't you, to save
   people's lives?     So I gave the order to open thegates.

Q. The Officer put that out across the radio, I take it? -
   A. Yes.   Superintendent Murray said...  Just bear with
   me a moment.

Q. Yes, of course. - A. Superintendent Murray - I recall
   him, he had got this personal radio in his     hand.^
   Forgive me sometimes for demonstrating but this is how it
   comes back to mind.    He had got this personal radio and
   I recall it in his hand, held something like at shoulder
   level like this.     He turned to me and said,
   "Mr. Duckenfield,   are you going to open the sates?   Of
   course I told him to do so.    He then spoke into the
   radio and said, "Open the gates.    Open the gates.    In
   my mind it was "gates" and there was no distinction, and
   that was it.

Q. Did you hear PC Buxton, or somebody from the Land Rover,
   request the postponement of the match?    Did you yourself
   hear that? - A. I am not sure.    If I can just go through
   the thought processes at about that time.    I remember PC
   Buxton being asked for and I remember him coming.     I
   have some difficulty about the postponement which it
   probably may be better to explain later.    I am confused
   because I had it in my mind that postponement was raised
                                                              58
                                               D. G. DUCKKMETKT.n


Q. When the order was given to open the gates what
   thoughts went through your mind at that point as to
   what would happen to the people who would enter through
   the gates? As I say, you do not have to answer this
   question if you do not wish to. - A. My recollection,
   sir, is that there was space in the concourse and if
   that gate was opened I could save people's lives.

Q. Did you appreciate at that time the geography of the
   ground and in particular the relationship of the gate
   to the tunnel? - A. No, sir.

Q. All these are prejudicial questions. Were you at that
   time in a position to visualise the entry points on to
   the terracing from the concourse area? - A. No, sir.

Q. You understand the question.  Have you understood what
   I have asked? What I am asking you is, did you have a
   mental picture of the concourse area and the way that
   people would have to go if they were going to get
   either into the stands or on to the terracing? - A. At
   that stage, sir, I was totally consumed by the decision
   to save lives and my only thoughts were that people
   would go in the concourse. After that I didn't have a
   picture.

Q. Did you around that time when you gave the instruction
   look at the terracing as far as you now remember? - A.
   Thinking back, and it is difficult to judge obviously
   with so much that has passed, I think there was space
   on the terracing beneath the Control Box and there was
   space in the concourse.

Q. Again this is a prejudicial question.   You did not, I
   take it, give any orders for serials to position
   themselves to direct the fans in any particular
   direction from the concourse area? - A. As I said, sir,
   I was totally consumed by the decision.

Q. Did you yourself give any directions for people to be
   positioned behind Gate A with a view to channelling
   people who might be coming through that gate? - A. No,
   sir, I didn't. Any decision of that nature must have
   been taken by somebody else and I can't add to that.

Q. What about positioning serials both within the North
   Stand and outside the North Stand? Did that at some
   point occur and again this is a prejudicial question? -
   A. That is right.  I do not know what the situation was
   exactly but action was taken to alert serials who were
   on standby and directions were given to go to the North
   Stand and on to the perimeter track as a result of the
   situation that had developed.

In job since 1988, initially supervised by Mr Mole, allowed to
do some matches on his own in due course, controlled 1988 match,
no knowledge of gate being shut, not reported, discovered that
the tunnel had been closed after 1989 match. Had never been told
that this happened.                                              58, 59
Confirmed that 1988 order followed the 1988 one and that the 1989
order followed 1988. Unable to explain why coach with 50 officers
should have been in Leppings Lane at 14.35 (Mr Lloyd). There was
provision for coaches to be located there and at Penistone Road
but not until 15.00. No knowledge of specific arrangements to
check people for tickets in 1988. Apart from break-through with
music, no particular problems with the radio.
Had briefed officers but adjusted it so he wasn't too long and in
the light of what Mr Duckenfield was going to say per typed note.
Normal problems until about 14.00, confirmed Mr Duckenfield's
arrival, referee, Mr Jackson's visit. Mr Duckenfield's location
was text-book position. Confirmed that he thought at 14.15 more
Notts people than Liverpool. Actioned closure of Leppings Lane,
his log says 14.17 although his perception was later but he has
an entry at 14.21 which makes him think the time must be right.           67
At 14.30 estimated North stand half full, West stand filling,
plenty of room Leppings Lane NW terrace and centre pens filling.          68
Looked at monitor, confirmed to Mr Duckenfield that there was a
good crowd but they expected to get them in. Looked again 5/10
minutes later, Bichard drew his attention to surrounded mounted
officers. Crowd denser, Goddard reactive, requested assistance,
he deployed serial to Leppings Lane end (Sgt Higgins). Radio
went down, short period but gross disruption. Heard request for
PA assistance and Buxton's response. Confirmed to Mr Duckenfield
at about 14.30, circumstances for delaying kick-off as previously
taught by Mr Mole, remembers request from Buxton re kick-off.
Goddard said it was too late, players were out. He loyally backed
him and said he agreed with the decision and would have told him
if he had wanted something done. Recollects it was after the
gates were opened and people coming into the stadium.                     73

XE MR PAYNE

Memo of 14.5.88 setting out various points that needed consideration
(C533). He believed the ground to be safe, capable of evacuation,
had not received any adverse reports on the risk of overcrowding,
no criticism that the ground was not     safe, believed system safe
in 198^ and 1989>. Not obvious there was any risk of crushing to
people in Pens 3 and 4, had to rely on officers e.g. Marshall and
take notice of their request, not indifferent to any risk of injury.
Mr Isaacs examined rather more fiercely:
In 1988 was assisted by Mr Calvert, apart from that semi-final had
had no capacity experience, only 3 or 4 big matches in addition,
30,000 +.    Within his operational role he did not have to refer
up except for major decisions, e.g. evacuation, and even then would
expect to perform consequential duties. Mr Mole said the 1989 semi­
final would follow 1988. He overlooked the planning team. Mr
Duckenfield did not have Mr Mole's experience, therefore needed
supplementation by staff. In 1989 he saw his role as monitoring,
responding to incomf^messages and transmitting outgoing messages
when advising Mr Duckenfield. He did not consider himself superior
to the sector commanders.
At 2.30 everything looked normal, as far as he was concerned the
crowd would get in. Discussed delayed kick-off, not related in his
view, no regid rules. All things being equal, kick-off would not
be delayed simply because people were late, bearing in mind the
other factors inside. A crisis situation might be different.
Radio had gone down at about 2.40 causing disruption, only down for
short period but cause a lot of disruption.   In the end had to rely
on hand-held sets, talk-through. Request to open gate at 14.47
came out of the blue, but they had already taken action by horses,
tannoy, closure etc. Mr Bichard after first request said the gate
had burst open, position retrieved by officer but then further
request followed, followed by demand, decided action had to be
taken, asked Mr Duckenfield. If he was asked if he had considered
there was a risk, would he have taken any action? He replied that
he certainly would (distress). In any event they would have done
DAY

their best to deal with the situation.


XE MR KING

Confirmed that commander had overall responsibility, officers would
know what to do on the basis of delegation and initiative. Agreed
that one needed to plan ahead, commanding officers would need to
be acquainted with what was to be expected and also briefing was
important. No specific briefing re monitoring of overcrowding
but confirmed that Mr Duckenfield was present at several meetings.
Nothing in the order to require serial 13 to monitor terrace but
he regarded as a matter of course that they would. Referred to
Green Guide, Page 31, re distribution. The text of the Guide clearly
is aimed at structural rather than operational aspects. He accepted
that the Police did have a responsibility to make provision for
distribution, the Club and Police working together. Did not have
details of Club's activities but will expect local officers to have
responsibility for brief with Club. Had not made use of photos
available from Club, the camera gave an oblique view and another
went down length of tunnel. Knew about turnstiles and rates.
Thought the central pens and NW terrace were filling in preference
to wings and comparable, not aware of system of diversion. In 1988
had seen fans spread through terrace. He did not turn to mind to
divert people, filling as far as he was concerned had gone OK and
there was nothing to alarm him to close off the centre pens.


Inched his way through evidence from 2.30 onward. Re-identified
the sort of problems associated with delayed kick-off, confident
that he could get the crowds in at 2.30, must have looked at the
terraces between 2.30 and 2.45 but had no specific recollection of
anything to cause him alarm. More people in the centre than at
the sides, the need to divert had not crossed his mind. Confirmed
that between 2.17 (? is this correct) and opening the gates, they
had dealt with closure of Leppings Lane, extra assistance from
DAY    wtm
       MARCH 1991

221.   B D MURRAY (continued... )

mounted officers, reserve serial to Leppings Lane, tannoy messages,
crowd had got denser, Mr Bennett requested assistance and another
48 men had been sent round. Apparent gap of five minutes between
1 4 . 4 ^ and 14.52, no arrangements made to receive incoming fans,
did not cross his mind to close the tunnel, thinks he could have
got men there if he had wanted to.
Thought that they would enter concourse area and then disperse
(compare Mr Hand-Davis (17/70) who on seeing Gate A open apparently
asked himself immediately, where are they all going to go?),
his primary concern was to relieve pressure, avoid injury, he did
not recollect asking himself the question, the only need obvious
to him was to deal with relieving the pressure. Was aware of tunnel
but did not relate it to Gate C. After opening it assumed that fans
'would distribute themselves throughout the stand and terrace, did
 not expect them to all go down the tunnel. He confirmed that C517
 indicates ambulances were summoned. He said he could not recollect
 Mr Creaser coming in but if he said he did then he would accept it.
 In any case if he had been asked about the system he would have
 replied as Mr Creaser indicated.


Agreed with Mrs McBrien that it was sometimes difficult to see
people climbing up and that officers at the back of the terrace
might have been a better deterrent. He felt that it was a good
idea that there should be increased dialogue with fans. He agreed
that even if you blocked the tunnel off, fans could still enter
the centre section through the radial gates.   He agreed that the
road closure by Supt Marshall was unusual but didn't! mention it
as such to Mr Duckenfield.
Concerned about 2.45, thought turnstiles not working properly.
Tried to contact Mr Lock, unsuccessful. Did not consider postponing
kick-off at that time. Purpose of sending extra men round was to
retrieve the situation. Never consider the exit gates as entrances.
Did not connect the opening of Gate C with the escape of people.
Didn't speak to Supt. Greenwood and didn't make any PA announcements.
Confirmed to Mr Russell on photograph C534, timed at 15.00, Mr McGroby
is seen with Gate 1 open. Whether Mr Greenwood got the message from
      MARCH 1991

221. B D MURRAY (continued      )

control he was obviously reacting either from that or his own initiative
and there was no delay.


Mr Manning confirmed that he was an officer of long-standing, that
he was following a plan devised by Supt Mole, that it was very
successful, that the 1989 plan was briefed by Duckenfield and
Jackson, that it incorporated various amendments, that the team
consisted of experienced people not relying just on the written
word, including experienced control room staff, that none of them
had drawn his attention to any problems. He confirmed that what
was obvious to him was that there was a terrible problem and people
were likely to be killed, never had anything like this before,
tremendous pressure to take action. Nothing else was obvious and
if anything else had been obvious to him which could have saved
lives then undoubtedly he would have taken it.


He also confirmed that priot to receiving Mr Marshall's request re
gates, four messages in groups of two, he had instructed at Mr Marshall's
request to tannoy to people to stop pushing but they had also received
a request from Insp Bennett, Mr Sewell rang in offering some serials
and these were sent round, that he nagged Mr Duckenfield when the
final request came through confirming the risk of death, that
request was for the gates to be opened. He recollects that PC Bichard
had drawn his attention to Gate C which had burst or gone.             74
He said that when the first request came through he was trying
to raise manpower as it was an unprecedented request and he hoped
that the situation could be retrieved. It was Mr Duckenfield's
decision to authorise the request. When the further requests came
through, the position had become irretrievable. As soon as they
had overcome that decision, further requests for Gate A came and
overwhelmed them. He had to ask Mr Goddard which one Gate A was.
His recollection is Mr Duckenfield said straight away "open the gate"
(Goddard recollects that he had acted on his own initiative). He
didn't ask for the serials to go to the North stand and did not know
DAYS 67/68



221.   B D MURRAY(continued...)

about it until later.
N.B. Mr Bichard clarified timings, it would seem that the request
came through about two minutes after the opening of the gate. If
Bichard is right they were not opened until some time around 14.58.)


Next event to catch his eye was that      something was happening on
the pitch, one of the gates was open. He recounts the story of the
WPC and McGroby saying he would go down and sort it out. He had
not prior to that noticed the match being played. Not unusual to
relocate people. Mr Duckenfield said Mr Greenwood was to go and
have a look (this ties in with Mr Duckenfield). He saw Mr Greenwood
signalling and he understood that he wanted the game stopped. Not
seen any casualties but people on the pitch. Mr Murray says that
Mr Duckenfield told him to go and stop the match which he tried
to do. He then went down, returned and was sent down again by Mr
Duckenfield.
N.B.
Mr Duckenfield does not seem to recollect these instructions. You
might think that if he was wishing to amplify his role he would
have told us about this and this may be a pointer to veracity.

As he left the control room he heard PC Bichard asking for an
ambulance. Once    he was on the ground he realised that he would
need a fleet and   he radiod up for this to be    done.
His recollection   is that a seargent had told    him that bolt cutters
had already been   requested but wasn't sure. He requested tannoy
message for people to move back but cannot recollect hearing it
(Mackrell (206) and Duckenfield). He then describes going round
to the back. By the time he got there officers were already in
the terrace and pressure seemed to have been relieved. He met
an Inspector but cannot r e m e m b e r ‘whom in the tunnel. He returned
to the control room about 15.35.

220.        R GREENWOOD

Described 1981 match, was present, crushing at front, underneath
police box. He actually opened the gate to relax pressure,
subsequently people who were not at any risk also climbed over.
The pressure that year was from the back and he found once the gate
was open you couldn't really stop the flow. He agreed that remedial
action was taken which was the radial fences. He had another
crushing experience in 1985 but this time on the Kop and on that
occasion he moved the fans on to Leppings Lane terrace with no
particular problem. He was commander outside in 1987 and 1988,
having left the Division in 1986. In 1988 he had a roving commission
and used the Landrover, supervised crocodiles from the station, no
problems with getting people through in either year. There was no
filtering system re ticketless fans as far as he was concerned, it
wasn't practical. I described Ruth Cobb's description of a chicane
but he did not think that there was anything like that. He had made
provision for an area to hold ticketless fans but in fact there weren't
any, or there weren't any left over after they had bought their tickets
from ticket touts.
Compare Dr Flenley, (114) Mr Thomas (168) plus two others.
Not aware that tunnel had been closed off, said he did not see it
and must have walked past at some time. It was a policing success
as far as he was concerned.


In 1989 he was asked to be ground commander, not involved with the
detailed planning. Quite satisfied with the order, followed usual
format. Again had roving commission, was planning to be at players'
tunnel by 14.50 approx, had given express instructions regarding
anticipated problems at Spion Kop to individual officers. Carried
out a perambulation at about 14.35, spoke to PC Heliwell outside
Leppings Lane terraces at about 14.45. Saw beach ball and nothing
on the terraces caused him concern or alarm at that time.
Continued and finished up at Spion Kop dealing with a problem and
then realised he had to get to the player's tunnel where he went and
dealt with team emergance and Mr Clough. Heard kick-off and it was

                                                       /continued.
220.   R GREENWOOD (continued   2)

only after that that his attention was directed to Leppings Lane.
He had not heard or received any messages on his radio directly to
himself, nor had he heard any messages about the position outside.
He approached Leppings Lane, Pen 3, his immediate assessment was
that the first few rows were compacted but that behind them the
crowd were watching the match, appeared to be oblivious and that
the tunnel was clear. He thought that there was room for people
to move back which would have relieved the pressure. By signals he
attempted to achieve this (gate was already open). After a few
moments he realised condition was worsening and ran onto the pitch
to stop the match. He returned to perimeter track and then made
his way towards the control box where he met ACC Jackson and
acquainted him with the position. He returned to the scene, Pen 3
was infinitely worse than Pen 4, concentrated his attention there.
He had no recollection of whether or not he directed the serial to
the back but certainly initially he thought it unwise and not the
best method of relieving the situation. He had since become aware
of Insp.Bullas having been in the back. At some point he acquired
a loudhailer. He described various steps he had taken to seek to
organise the rescue, including sending for the ambulances. He
recollects Chief Supt Nesbitt but remembers also giving instructions
as to how to get people out.


He first had contact with Mr Duckenfield face to face much later,
although he did have some radio contact with him (? some time
before 15.15). (See Mr King's XE). He confirmed that he was wearing
a black anorak, flat cap and that between 14.35 and well after the
match was stopped, he was not in the control box nor on the steps,
nor did he hear in his first perambulation any cries for help or
attention from anybody.


Mr Payne established that in 1981 Police intervention was for safety.
He was aware of the safety certificate and the capacities, the radial
fences having been installed for safety and segregation. He was
aware of the officers working party and nobody had ever given him
any cause to suspect, nor did he suspect, that the ground was unsafe,
DAY 65
7.3.91

220.     R GREENWOOD (continued   3)

although he did say that in a football match localised densities
could easily occur. He confirmed that until he returned to the pen
it had not been obvious to him that there was a risk of overcrowding,
nor had he been indifferent to the risk of safety to people.

N.B. CHECK TRANSCRIPT.


He agreed with Mr Isaacs that the briefing by Mr Duckenfield had been
in accordance with normal practice. Mr Isaacs read out a section,
he could not remember the wording precisely but in general terms he
was satisfied that safety had been stressed and he would not have
expected the overall commander to go into any more detail.

MR KING XE

Mr Greenwood made it plain that although the word "overcrowding" was
not used in the brief, general safety was and as far as he was concerned
this amounted to the same thing. He felt that the people who would
have responsibility for monitoring would be a combination of track
officers, control box, officers in the West stand and himself if he
noticed anything. Track officers in particular are there to look for
problems which would include overcrowding as well as fighting. They
were in that job week in and week out. He and his Chief Supt had
roving commissions. He did not accept that one had to have a specified
officer for the task. He confirmed that nothing specific had been agreed
to stop spectators coming in. He was taken to Page 47/48 of LJT where
this issue faced and he suggested that ground control would deal with
the matter. Went on to say he didn't know what they would do, it waS
a flexible situation.
He had received no information that the Leppings Lane gates had been
opened. When he got to the terrace it was his observation that the
tunnel was clear and that there was room further back. He did not
accept that C326a gave a good representation of what he saw, and the
same for C354.    He did not accept that there was a direct correlation
DAY 65
7.3.91

220.     R GREENWOOD (continued   4)

between the opening of the gate and the condition of the terrace.
He had not felt it right to send officers around to the back
straight away or into the terrace (?), but he had also heard the
evidence from Insp. Bull as. p,
He agreed that the situation was chaotic and would have been surprised
if it had been anything other than that. His first contact with
control was just prior to calling the ambulance. There was some
discussion re the monitoring of crowd distribution with shared
responsibility, disparity in itself was not necessarily significant.
In particular, the view of Pen 6 only showed a small section and he
could not say what else was on it.


MR CATCHPOLE XE

Mr Greenwood confirmed to Mr Catchpole that the monitoring was designed
for the safety of the ground and that he would expect the officers and
indeed anyone else who noticed anything to pass it through. His
information was limited by any lack of knowledge that he might have
of events outside.


MRS MCBRIEN XE

Discussed 1981. N.B. no radial fences, fans escaped via perimeter
track gates. He did not accept that there were any formal arrangements
for checking tickets. Some discussion as to whether the perimeter
gates were shut in 1988. He was concerned about the fans at the Kop,
there were several hundred there in both years. I would not allow
question about the allocation of ends. He confirmed that his radio
was turned on but that it was very difficult to hear because of noise.
He did not hear Supt Marshall's request. His primary concern when
he approached the terraces was the fact that people were coming over
the top, he thought there was a problem there. He had not been aware
of what had happened outside. 1988 had been a successful operation but
nevertheless they had a pitch invasion and other problems including
people climbing.
 220 R GREENWOOD (continued....5)

 He did not accept that instant reaction was required for crushing
 because local densities could occur, that one had to make a
 judgement as to when and how to react, particularly as some of
 the fans like to be in a tight situation. The perimeter track
 officers were experienced.


When he got to the terrace he thought that the position was retrievable
but things got worse. There was no wholesale panic initially, he
felt that there were several factors operating to cause the problem
but he seemed to have the impression that in 1981 the pressure had
corne from behind. He confirmed that he had not raised any objection
to the radial gates being locked open but un-manned. He felt that
trying to get the fans to go back was by far the best method of
relieving the problem. The people in the front could not move but
people further back could (two clear compartments).

MR HALE XE

I stopped Mr Hale from asking questions regarding the correlation
between the deceased and the other people in the pen.

MR RUSSELL XE

Mr Russell deminstrated by the use of numerous photographs, Supt.
Greenwood's activity at Pen 3 between 15.02 and about 15.05. By           ^
using C531, timed at 15.08, officers can be seen in Pen 2. Officers
apparently standing around were subsequently utilised for other
jobs. Rescue was very difficult because of the construction of
the pen.

total block of Officers, it is Officers with spaces
in between.
         Now the reason that that filter cordon was
in place at the end of both those matches is really
to prevent public order problems because what does
happen at that end of the ground, particularly on
larger matches, that supporters from that end will
try and get round to the other end and there can
be friction, so what you are trying to do is deter
supporters from actually going round there.     You have
the conflict situation, which you have always got,
of balancing the freedom and the liberties of every­
body else that they may have parked up there.     They
may be going round there quite legitimately, so it
is trying to separate the two and put that filter
cordon in place so that people who are going round
to create trouble potentially will be deterred from
doing so and yet it lets the person who realty wants
to get round there because of a parked car or what
have you to go through it, so cordons were in place
 certainly in 1987, I believe in 1988 as well.     Now
whether that has created some confusion or not I

                                                                  48


                                       R.L. GREENWOOD



Q. Was that as you were going round? - A. No, that was
   later.  That was after I had stopped the game.

Q.    You turned and you went towards Leppings Lane.   Did you
     get up to Gate 3.   Was that as far as you got, if I
     can put it like that? - A. I may have gone a little bit
     beyond.   It is difficult to tell.  The problem that I
     saw was in Pen 3 and there wasn't the problem in Pen 4
     that there was in Pen 3.

Q.   Pen 3 appeared to you to be worse than Pen 4.      That is
     what you are saying? - A. Substantially.

Q. When you got there we know the match was still in play
   because you were the Officer who actually went and
   stopped it? - A. Yes.

Q. Can you tell me whether the pen looked any different
   to you as compared to what it had looked when you had
   been there on your perambulation, shall we say? - A.
   Yes, I had a good view of it.  I mean I looked in the
   gate for a start and then I got on the fence and I can
   see the scene today.

           There clearly was a marked difference at the
     front of the pen, the front six rows or so. Very very
     tightly compacted.  The remainder of the pen no real
     difference, no real difference.

           It was a remarkable situation.  I have talked
     about 1981 this morning.  It was different than 1981.
     1981 the pressure as I have described it was coming
     from the back.

           In 1989 when you moved and your eyes moved back
     from the poor people at the front the rest of the crowd
     were watching the game.  I generalised they were watching
     the game and I formed the assessment, the judgment,
     the perception that there was room for that crowd to
     move back.  It is clear today, clear as a bell.  It
     will never leave me.

Q. When you say you felt that the crowd could move back,
   did you mean back within the pen or back out through
   the tunnel or both or neither? - A. No, the judgment
   that I had was that there was room for that crowd
   beyond the compacted area to move back off if you wish
   that particular ar'ea.

           I attempted to get them t<? move back and through
     the tunnel.  The tunnel was not blocked at all and I
     did that when I was up on the fence because I have since
     been able to look obviously at a considerable number
     of photographs and I think when I first got there it
     certainly boosted my recollection in terms of the fact
                                                            49

                                   R.L. GREENWOOD



 . that I was involved at the gate and we got people through
   the gate at that particular time.

        There is no doubt that it got worse, but in the
  initial stages that was the judgment that I formed and
  it was only because it had no effect and the problems
  were getting worse that I then determined that the match
  would have to stop and that is what I did.

Q. When you first got there, I want to talk about the
   gate for a moment? - A. Yes.

Q. Was the gate already open.  Can you remember? - A. Yes,
   I am certain that gate was open when I got there and
   remained open.

Q. Do you recollect whether when you first got there
   people were coming through under their own steam or
   had they already got to the position, as we know it
   happened later, that people had to either be pulled,
   dragged, carried through, lifted or whatever? - A. I
   think it was probably at an intermediate stage, there
   was a bit in between. I am conscious now that people
   had been led out and came out quite freely.   I think
   that at the time that I got there it was becoming more
   of a struggle but it had not reached the stage I think
   that it probably reached later on when it became
   blocked for one reason or another, but people were
   still coming out at that particular time but it really
   was difficult.

Q. What method did you use to try and persuade people
   to move back initially before you decided that the
   match had got to stop? - A. Well I got up on the fence
   and I used both hands in a pushing motion like that.
   That was the initial movement and I was shouting my
   head off for them to move back.   Then there may have
   been people that were saying at the fronts   "We can't
   move".  It was trying to draw the attention of the
   crowd to the problem.

         I was of the view that they were unaware of it,
   they were watching the match, so what I then did was
   to point down to the front of the pen to try and draw
   their attention to what was going on.

         Dare I say it it was eerie.    I do not know
   whether that is the right word but it was a very
   strange scenario that you had got this compacted area
   at the front and behind them people seemed oblivious,
   I think totally oblivious to what was actually going
   on and it was strange, very strange.

        I could not understand it. * I could not understand
  it and I have time out to I suppose try and understand
  it.  I could not understand how with what we had got in
  the pen by way of restraints and what have you as to
  what could cause this basically.   It was like two
  compartments, two separate compartments to the crowd.

Q. Within the same pen? - A. Within the same pen, yes.

Q. What you are saying is longitudinally divided? - A. Yes.

Q. You said after a period of time you realised that things
   were getting worse and further steps would have to be
   taken? - A. Yes.

Q. Did you radio Control to tell them? - A. Yes, I did.

Q. Did you get a response? - A. No, I c a n ’t recall a response
   but the noise level by that particular time it would
   have been most difficult anyway.

Q. I think you signalled to Control as well, d i d n ’t you?
   - A. Yes, like that, just like that.

Q. And then you went on to the pitch? - A. Yes, I went
   straight on.  I suppose, we have a procedure for stopping
   the match but you know one doesn’t, one needs to stop
   the match and goes and does it.

Q. Do you remember picking up, if that is the right word,
   P.C. Packer to accompany you? Did you hear him say that?
   - A. Yes I did.      One of the, I think strange parts
   about the whole of this, well not strange, one of the
   difficult parts about it I d i d n ’t even know him, I
   d i d n ’t even know him.  I did not even recognise him.
   If only somebody can bring their recollections totally
   back tojou.      You know, very very tight timescale.

         There are other people that have said to me:
   "You said this, you said that" sometimes you c a n ’t
   recollect them being there.  It is something I have
   been told is quite natural for something of this scale.
   It is difficult to recall.

Q. Having stopped the match where did you go to next?
   - A. Well I think I went back to the fence, had a look
   there.  I went then towards, I think really I was on
   my way to the Control Box at that stage and that is
   when I met Mr. Jackson.

Q. You had a conversation with him', I take it? - A. Yes,
   I did.  I left him in no doubt as to what the situation
   was and that we had got casualties.
                                          R. L. GREENWOOD


Do you want to rest, Mr. Greenwood? - A. No, I am fine,
thank you.

Take your time.   We will let the people go out and that
will give you a chance to recover.   I will break if it
is of any use to you because it is a very difficult time
for you and everybody else as well.    If need be we will
break but I don't want to break if you don't want to. -
A. No, I prefer to carry on.

Take your time. - A. More people had started to come over
the fencing, as I recall.   Clearly I think more people
obviously were aware in the pen, more supporters were
aware as to what the situation was.   Officers were up on
the fence and they were helping people over as best they
could.   I do recall at some stage that I stopped some
Officers going in through that gate.   It was extremely
difficult.   It was a dangerous situation.   Officers
were acting in the best way that they could.   It is a
situation where it is difficult to control resources.
It is difficult to control people.   Difficult to control
supporters.   It is difficult to control Police Officers.
You are faced with something which is a unique
experience.   You cannot train people to deal with such a
situation like that and responses are different.   They
are independent in many ways.

However, when it was safe to do so, when it was the
appropriate time, I said that Officers should go into
that pen.   I also sent Officers up the side of the pen
as well to go in there.   I was aware that Officers also
came in from the back of the pen as well.   I saw that
that was the action that would be needed.   If you could
have lifted everybody out of that pen by whatever means,
then that was really what we were seeking to achieve.
It was not easy.

The rescue operation was hampered.    It was hampered I
think by a reaction that I would expect to be normal in
some people looking back on it.    I was subject to a lot
of abuse.    It was alleged that we had, and I had,
murdered people, killed them.    It was alleged the FA had
done the same.    Clearly supporters were in a traumatic
state.    I think entirely understandable, as I reflect
back on it.

Sad to say it became an attraction for the media, who
hindered the rescue operation.   I had to depute an
Officer to keep the media, the photographers, the video
man, at bay, to keep them away from the fence.

I also asked one of the Officers if he would go - this
was at a fairly early stage as I recall - and get all the
                                          R. L. GREENWOOD


St. John's Ambulance people from the ground and bring
them to that fence.

I knew, or I did it myself, I can't be sure which, that
ambulances had been called - ambulances, not just one
ambulance.   I suppose when you are operating in a
timescale like that, "Where are they?r'   There came a
stage when I discussed with certain Officers, where were
they?   Where were the ambulances?   In fact I despatched
an Officer to the corner of the Spion Kop, the North
Stand, because I knew that that is the First Aid Post
down there and that there would be an ambulance there.
That is the ambulance you see arriving on video.

I haven't got very many more questions, but just one or
two more.   Can you remember Chief Superintendent Nesbit
arriving? - A. Yes, I do.

When he came had the situation changed in any way as
compared to what it had been, say, in the five minutes
prior to his arrival, or was it still substantially the
same? - A. In terms of...?

Getting people out of the pen.    I take it at that point
he was still on the perimeter track near the fencing,
would that be right? - A. Yes, that rescue operation
had...   As I best recall there were Officers in that pen
and people were being taken out of that pen prior to
Mr. Nesbit's arrival.   There had been part of a chain, I
think, formed before.   I sit here and say that in my
view I think the rescue operation - I am satisfied that
it was done as efficiently and as quickly having regard
to the difficult scenario and the difficulties, as it
possibly could have been done.     I am quite satisfied
about that.   We did as much as  we possibly could have
done.

This is another potentially incriminating question.    One
of the aspects of the rescue is the entry of people from
the back to get people out of the tunnel, or down the
railing gates which we have heard about.   I seem to have
understood your reply that initially you did not think
that was the appropriate action to take.   Have I
understood that correctly? - A. Yes.   On the initial
assessment and initial judgment, that is correct.   There
were a few Officers at the front of the pen at that
stage.

At what point did you feel that that altered and that one
ought to put Officers within the terrace, either from the
front, side or back? - A. Difficult to say when.   This
is something which has been put to me before in another
forum.   I was always confident that Officers went round
the back very early.   I am now bolstered in that view by
                                          R. L. GREENWOOD


what I have heard, particularly from Mr. Bullas.   I have
been totally honest about it all the time.   I have said
I don't know whether I sent Officers round the back.   I
could have done.    I can't say I didn't.  Or I may have
been aware they were going round the back.   I just can t
recall but it never, until it was raised, struck me as a
particular problem.

Your concentration as far as I can judge from the
evidence was on pen 3.   That would be right? - A. Very
much so.

Did you see what was happening in pen 4?   It is very
difficult, of course, to see two things at the same time
but were you aware what was going on in that pen in the
time between, say, two or three minutes past three and
quarter past when the ambulance arrived? - A. I'think
that the answer to that is that would be yes.   There
wasn't the problem in pen 4 that there was in pen 3.    I
think the gates were open and that people were coming out
there.   The two things are just not comparable, in my
view from what I recollect.

We have heard from various people who would say they saw
you with a loud hailer.   Did you in fact have one? - A.
Yes, I did.

Do you know when you acquired that? - A. No, that is
difficult on the timescale.    I remember broadcasting to
the crowd to ask them to move back.   I remember the
eventual evacuation of casualties.    Again, something
that will never leave me.    The struggle that took place
in terms of the gates.    You know, getting people through
the gates.   I can remember exactly the words I used to
get people through there.    I told Police Officers in
there to take people out of the back.   We were not
running as a one-way situation just through the front.
We were running through the back.   We were getting them
out there.   The Police Officers at the front, it took
two to a casualty.   You can imagine that it would be
quite normal for a blockage to occur at the gate trying
to get people out, and it did.

I was broadcasting to them to say bring them to the gate,
now pass it through, now go back and the next one come,
"You come into the gate now, pass it through,” rather
than trying to struggle with the casualties actually
through the gate, which is only, I suppose, a normal
door's width.   It was evacuated very quickly in my view.
I look back on it and it was extremely quickly, I think.

     Safety Certificate in force for the ground? - A. In my
     time at that Division I knew there was a Safety
     Certificate in force.

Q. Did you know that the Safety Certificate included
   capacities which have been worked out for each separate
   part of the ground? - A. Yes.

Q. You obviously knew after the 1981 episode that the
   terrace had been divided up into pens, as we have heard
   during the Inquest? - A. Yes.

Q. And further subdivided in 1985? - A. Yes.

Q. Did you believe that the purpose of the introduction of
   those pens had been to prevent any repetition o f the
   1981 episode? - A. That was my understanding later,
   yes.
Q. Also to assist the Police in the segregation of
   different groups of supporters? - A. Yes.

Q. So far as you knew since those pens had been introduced
   had there been any repetition of the 1981 problem? - A.
   N o , there h a d n 't .

Q. Mr. Greenwood, I appreciate these questions are pretty
   obvious but I need to just get on the record your own
   knowledge.  Did you know that the ground was regularly
   inspected by representatives of the Officer Working
   Party as it was called? - A. Yes.

Q. Did you know that an engineer was appointed under the
   Safety Certificate who made regular inspections of the
   ground? - A. Yes, I knew Dr. Eastwood.

Q. And produced Safety Certificates? - A. Yes, I had met
   Dr. Eastwood.

Q. Had any of these representatives — and indeed I will
   make it a very wide question — had anyone ever said to
   you over the period that we are talking about, that is
   the ten years leading up to the disaster, that the
   introduction of these pens had made any difference to
   the safe capacity of the terrace? - A. No, no.

Q. In consequence did you, like everyone else, believe
   before the disaster that the Leppings Lane terrace was
   safe to be occupied by the certified capacity crowd?

Q.        THE CORONER:  Can you just answer the question in
     respect of your own knowledge? - A. Yes, I believed the
     terraces to be safe.
                                              R. L. GREENWOOD



     HR. PAYNE:  Did you, Mr. Greenwood, expect there
would be any overcrowding or crushing problem which
would arise on the terrace? - A. No, in fairness, not
to the extent that we witnessed.  I mean you always get
localised densities that are different.  You always
will do at every football match, every football ground,
rugby ground in the country.  You will always get that
but not to this scale, no.

Did you believe that the 'find your own level' system
which had been used at the 1987 and 1988 matches was a
safe system? - A. Yes, I have experienced it in another
ground as well.  I believe it to be safe.

Did you also believe that if an emergency of any sort
did arise on the terrace then the terrace could be
safely evacuated within the times that had been worked
out by the Officer Working Party? - A. Relying on
advice, yes.

I now come to the events of the day please and come to
the moment when you walked from your post by the
playe r s ' tunnel down to the Leppings Lane end and went
towards gate 3 and answer this question;     at any time
up to that point when you made that journey, had it
ever been obvious to you that there was a risk of
injury to people on the terrace? - A. No.

If before that time you had seen or been told about
overcrowding on that terrace would you have reacted to
it?.*-''A. Certainly.

What would you have done? - A. If you have got an
overcrowded area there are several options that are
available to you.  One option is, and I stress
dependent on the type of crowd, to open the gates and
let people out through the front of the pen.   Another
option is to send Officers into the crowd whether it is
from the side or whether it is from the rear in order
to move people.

Did you regard it as the role of the Police that if
they became aware of a safety problem, including
overcrowding, then it was the duty of the Police and
yourself to react and deal with the problem? - A. Yes,
you have heard it is our basic and our prime tenet as
such and that would be the case.  We would react to
that and always will do.

I finally ask you this question and it is this;  at any
time, Mr. Greenwood, were you indifferent to a risk of
injury...
                                                                  60
                                                     R. L. GREENWOOD



          THE CORONER:  Finish the question and then let me
     say a word before you answer.

Q.       HR. PAYNE:    Indifferent to a risk of injury to
     spectators?

Q.        THE CORONER:    Hr. Greenwood, this is another
     question which may tend to incriminate you and so you
     do not have to answer it if you do not wish. - A. No.
     The answer to that is I was never, and never would be,
     even now as an overall Commander of a football ground,
     indifferent to any risk to the safety of people who go
     into such a stadium.

                      Cross-Examined bv HR. ISAACS

Q. Hr. Greenwood, I just want to ask you about the
   briefings that took place on the Saturday and on the
   Friday before that.  The Friday briefing given by Hr.
   Duckenfield was a briefing to whom? - A. That was a
   briefing as I recall to Inspectors, Chief Inspectors
   and Superintendents.

Q. Was that briefing followed by any other briefing to the
   same group of people? - A. Yes, the Friday briefing I
   took my Inspectors and Chief Inspectors on one side and
   talked to them about problems and I think likewise the
   other Superintendents did as well.

Q. On the Saturday a similar format except that this time
   Hr. Duckenfield spoke to all the men? - A. Yes, he
   spoke to everybody who was concerned with the football
   operation at Hillsborough.

Q. After that briefing to all the men were there then
   other briefings? - A. Yes, as I said in terms of my
   particular part there, there were Inspectors and I
   think two Chief Inspectors who had not been at the
   Friday briefing and so I spoke to them.  There were
   other briefings.  The normal practise at Hillsborough
   is that the Inspectors or the Sergeants or both will
   brief their serials on their responsibilities for the
   day.

Q. I think that on the .Saturday after Hr. Duckenfield's
   briefing to all the men, Hr. Murray gave a briefing to
   all the men? - A. Yes, he did indeed.

Q. Then the men split up into the groups you have talked
   about? - A. No, there was a further briefing.  There
   was an intelligence briefing I think by Detective
   Sergeant Charlesworth on dealing with the supporters.

Serial 14, concourse area.   His evidence I found rather confusing.
In 1988 he says he was responsible for the West stand. One of his
officers was instructed to close off the tunnel which he did by
closing one leaf and having the officer stand in the gap left to
divert fans, at about 14.45. He says he did not give the order,
does not know who gave it nor how it was transmitted, but he went
to check that it was being implemented as he found out about it in
some way which he could not explain.
We then had a considerable discussion as to whether the radial gates
were locked back or just open. Right at the end he seemed to suggest
he was talking about the tunnel gates rather than the radial gates,
but who knows?


With regard to the tunnel gates, Mr Devonside, Kenworthy and others
suggested that they were fully closed, Sgt Creaser said they were
partly closed, Mr Greenwood says he must have walked past them at
some time in 1988 and did not see them closed. Mr Owen said he
went down the tunnel whilst his friend said they were being diverted.
There was also evidence from the gateman, which is confusing enough.
Crawford says it was not put on the debrief because it was routine.

In 1989 he was in the concourse area, he didn't seem to view his
brief as including the monitoring of the terraces but simply the
searching of fans. He did agree that had he received an order to
try and close the tunnel off he would have attempted to do so
(? would he have succeeded). He confirmed that the crowd were very
aggressive after 2.30 but a lot of aggression was because of the
situation outside and the action they wanted taken.
Mr King suggested to him that once the gate was open the grounds for
the aggression had gone but he did not seem to accept this and seemed
to indicate that it depended on the people in some way. He agreed
that from his limited observation and from what he was told by the
crowd, something needed to be done outside or people would be killed.
He didn't hear any messages on his radio, lots of interference.
Had he heard Supt Marshall he might have realised that some action
by him was required but by the time he became aware of the 2nd opening,
the crowd was halfway through the tunnel.   There was-an initial rush

and then it slowed down a bit. Control of the terrace was not on
the order and therefore not part of his job. Didn't know whose
job it was to control people going onto the terrace. He agreed with
Mrs McBrien that he was familiar with Mr Mole's system (?).
218.    HIGGINS                                RESERVE SERIAL

On standby in Gym. On pitch about 2.20 with Inspector. Noticed
disparity between Notts and Liverpool but did not comment on it to
anyone. At about 2.40 asked to go to rear of Leppings Lane. Not
directed to go behind Gate A. On way there with serial noticed lots
of fans urinating against a wall. Approached Gate A area, was told
by fans that things were very bad outside but couldn't see any other
POs. Inspector Delaney and others moved away to left, he remained
there, could see that gate was being shaken, noticed that the wall
was moving as well. Radiod that it was a life and limb situation
and requested authority to open the gate. Response from Supt Marshall
to open the gate, says he recognised his voice. Prior to opening
gate he lined up his officers on one side and another serial on the
other, to stem rush and guide people towards cantilever stand.


Does not accept Mr Hurst's evidence (programme seller, 22/83) that
fans were diverted into the concourse area. Says they went past
the gap in the railings, was not given instructions by anyone to
create funnel, own initiative, didn't check for tickets himself.
After the initial rush he went outside, saw Inspector Sykes, only
about 70/80 people in turnstile area left. Not many people outside
perimeter gate, saw several hundred on bridge. Gate A was then shut.

Serial 9, associated with escorting of Nottingham fans. Their
behaviour was not impeccable either. On completion of duty he
went to the Gym, had a meal, was summoned to go to Gate A at Leppings
Lane. Advised to go across the pitch as it was quicker. When he
entered field area players were on pitch warming up. Unfortunately
he was unable go give any further specific information on timings,
apart from saying that he thought when he opened the gate it was
very near or around kick-off, but he didn't know. Walked along
North stand and then past West stand, noticed Pen 6 fairly sparsely
populated, couls see concrete. As he went past Pen 4 he noticed
condition of fans, considered them distressed and that assistance
was required. Attempted to radio control, no reply, would have
asked for assistance, restriction on entry to the pens and medical
assistance. Did not see either Gate 4 or 5. Met PC Illingworth
almost behind goal going in opposite direction, rushing, appeared
pre-occupied, didn't take with him, did not see any other officers
other than PC Tattersall and one other who had               him.
Got to Gate 3, decided it had to be opened, did so, people spilled
out. They were not seriously injured, although one girl was very
distressed. As people began to encroach onto the pitch he walked
them to Pen 2/1. He had no recollection of other officers at the
gate at that point. He did not shut the gate but he left it
unattended. He did not see it burst open, he did not see PC Packer
or his colleagues or Sgt Swift at Gate 4.
His evidence is very difficult to fit in to the remainder, bearing
in mind the evidence of Sgt. Swift's serial and indeed Mr Case and
his son and friends.
He does not carry a stick.

With large group of friends. Arrived Sheffield 1.45, had about
three pints then went down to ground, Leppings Lane about 2.40.
Mass of people. Pulled under funnel bar by P0, entered via Gate C,
went towards tunnel with five friends, got to end, could see over
the heads of people that the pen was full, decided to turn round
and go back, was near side, went against the stream along the wall,
nobody urinating. Spoke to Nicholas Joynes and Francis McAllister.
Despite statements, says that they indicated they would all meet
in Pens 1 or 2. People in tunnel not excessive although more were
beginning to come down. When he got out of the tunnel large numbers
were heading towards it. He went around the side, entered Pen 2,
kick-off had taken place. He said he couldn't see the gate and did
not know that P0 had opened it. (In fact he denied quite a bit of
the detail of his statement).
He said situation totally different in 1988: there were POs across
pavement in Catchbar Lane, checking tickets, people couldn't get
through without them. He saw a number who seemed to be milling
around at that position without tickets, waiting. When asked what
they did he said they went away. No problems at the turnstiles at
all. He had a stand ticket that year, went in through turnstiles
1 - 16, through gap in wall towards stairwell XYZ, walked past
tunnel at about 2.35/2.40, blue gates shut, two POs (? stewards)
outside facing concourse area, did not hear any commands, they were
just pointing.
He agreed with Mr King that in 1989 had there been an effort to
direct him he would in fact have gone without any problems.
He said that in the area outside the turnstiles he was not in a
position to say whether there was anyone who did not have a ticket.
215.   D L CASE                                SUPPORTER

Father of Jamie Case. In Pen 3. From 14.50 onwards crowded but as
he would expect for a match of this magnitude. Things got tighter
when players came out. He was very uncomfortable but had been in
that situation before in crowded terraces. Increase in jostling
and surging. Major surge at about 15.00, squashed against fencing.
Confirmed story of son and friends re opening of gate x 2, no
recollection of P0 involvement, gate not shut after he exited on
2nd opening. Photographic evidence at C519 where he is located
at 15.00 outside gate 1. He confirmed account of conversation with
P0 where he said something to the effect that "it has got very bad
in here" and response was "it will sort itself out". Not able to
identify officer. Jamie saying "I have got to get out Dad" and
going white, conversation with officer and gate opening - all
virtually instantaneous. Time interval between opening of gates
was short.

Bearing in mind the visual evidence, he had clearly got out by 15.00»
i.e. just after kick-off,and managed to get down to Gate 1. Things
had not really become significantly bad until after the players were
out and probably a few moments later. Police intervention proved
unnecessary because of the spontaneous opening of the gate.
 He had not realised the seriousness of the situation.
213. W JACKSON                                 ASST CHIEF CONSTABLE

Confirmed that he was quite satisfied with the Order as drafted,
based on previous drafts modified in several respects to take
account of previous experience. He did not consider himself a
"rubber stamp" but neither did he have detailed knowledge of the
ground. His job was to look at it overall and make provisions.
He was satisfied that Mr Duckenfield was a highly thought of
officer supported by experienced staff, competant and able to
police the match. He was on call to attend at Hillsborough in
civvies. He wasn't there to take charge but would of course be
available if called upon. He was of course on call for the rest
of South Yorkshire.
He visited the control room about 14.00, everything appeared OK.
He then went to the directors' lobby and eventually took his seat
in the directors' box intending to watch the match. Initially he
was alone. His attention was taken up in the main by the North
stand, his attention was first directed to Leppings Lane after
kick-off when the play went towards that end and he noticed what
appeared to be some crowd disturbance. He decided to go and invest­
igate and went to the control room. By the time he got there he
thought the match had stopped. Mr Murray he thought entered
immediately behind him. There appeared to be a lot of activity.
He didn't take charge of the control box but was able to confirm
from a taped recording that the fleet of ambulances had been
requested between 15.07 and 15.08 and that he had confirmed
operational support at about 15.10. He did not know about the
opening of Gate C until about 4.15 when Mr Marshall told him but
he seemed to recollect that at an earlier time he had understood
the gates had been stormed and that this information emanated
from Mr Duckenfield.


He was quite satisfied that divisional commanders were aware of
arrangements with the Club but stewards would have been sorted out.
He had met with Mr Greenwood on the pitch at one point and exchanged
a few words. Mr Greenwood was dealing with the matter there and he
understood from him that the situation was serious.
DAY 63

213. W JACKSON (continued        2)

He said that public order involved and included safety and that          37
the primary reason for massive Police involvement was public order
problems, once their presence was there, aspects of safety were
part and parcel of their task.


CROSS-EXAMINED BY MR KING

He agreed in the end with Mr King that he first learned that the
gates had been opened by Police authority from Mr Marshall at
about 4.15 (? Mr Duckenfield present) but that he had learned
earlier, he thought from Mr Duckenfield, that the gates had been
stormed. It wasn't a matter of great moment to him at the time
because rescue was more important. He confirmed that at 15.06
they were not aware of injuries but that by 15.07 + a fleet of
ambulances had already been summoned and somewhat earlier than
that (15.07), exhibit C517, ambulances had been alerted to the
possibility that they might be required.
As far as he was concerned, Mr Greenwood appeared to be very active,
that a chain was formed by Mr Nesbitt but what might be possible to
achieve at that time might not have been possible earlier.               78
He agreed that Mr Nesbitt had come to support Mr Greenwood and
that he had taken over command because he was the most senior,           76
and that there was some co-ordination of effort of POs prior to
the arrival of Mr Nesbitt. POs seen in Pen 2 at 15.08.                   77
He agreed that doctors were not summoned until later and that
cutting equipment was not requested until perhaps 15.12 approx.

CROSS-EXAMINED BY MR CATCHPOLE

Obtained confirmation that he was satisfied that there was no
confusion between responsibilities of stewards and Police. He
confirmed that Mr Nesbitt would have taken over control from Mr
Greenwood because of seniority but he was there to support Mr
Greenwood. He also explained that it would have been inappropriate
for him to become site commander because he had to be available in
the event of another incident developing but that he could be classed   71
as overall commander making sure that matters such as the casualty
bureau, major incident plan   had been implemented, head of CID
summoned, etc.
DAY 63
5.3.91

213. W JACKSON (continued     3)

Mr Isaacs re-examined re "the lie". Established that it was very
noisy and that his attention may not have been fully fixed, that
the main effort was to organise the rescue and that Mr Marshall
explained to him that Mr Duckenfield had been given little
alternative to opening the gates in view of the nature of the
request.
He confirmed to Mr Payne that he was satisfied that the ground was
safe to use. He confirmed that the restriction on access to the
pitch had a safety aspect in that it would prevent pitch invasion
                                                                   •*\
and problems for people in the terrace or people likely to be on   /
the pitch, and that the overall order, although it was directed     f
to searching, alcohol etc., had a safety aspect because it was
recognised that these things were related to offences of violence
prevalent in a small minority of supporters.

C285, operational order, the safety aspects were illustrated by
reference to Pages 19, 23, 30 and 45. N.B. On Page 19 under Phase 3
the word "safety" actually appears (despite Mr King) but admittedly
referring to officials and players.


With regard to early arrival he said that irrespective of what advice
traffic commissioners gave, he had made arrangements by various means    90
to try and communicate the need for early arrival.                       81/82
 28 FEBRUARY 1991

 212.   B L MOLE                              CHIEF SUPERINTENDENT

Mr Mole described his experience and confirmed that although he
wasn't there in 1981 he knew that the radial fences had been
installed to overcome the problem then experienced which was
pressure towards the centre. It was his understanding that the
situation had been resolved and therefore did not have to be taken
into account further. He confirmed that extra fences were added
to help segregation   until such time as the terraces were used only
for away supporters. In answer to Mr Catchpole he said there was
always a contingency to use the NW terrace for home supporters.
He said controller performed the pivotal role. He personally liked
to a roamer and it was his policy to be at the players tunnel just
before kick-off. He had full confidence in his sector commanders.
He described to me as well as to several others, sequential filling.
His evidence in a nutshell was that where the Police decided to
only use part of the terrace they would have officers on the radial
gates as these would then be locked closed. If in the events it
looked as if more space was required as a result of monitoring or
intelligence, other pens would be opened.     On the whole he felt
that the inspectors would ask not so much as to whether they should
divert fans from an area but whether they should open up extra space.
This was his sequential filling method and he agreed that it did
require monitoring and as the Police were putting the constraints
they had to watch, although he would always expect co-operation
and input from the stewards. He saw the role of the Police not so
much as packing the terraces but as keeping an eye on them and in
responding as appropriate to situations when observed.


He was adamant that he had never had occasion to shut the gates,
would not have done so and indeed to his knowledge people were not
even diverted, although he agreed that these were options which
would have been available, including closing the tunnel, although
he didn't approve of it for safety reasons.     He agreed that if Mr
Creaser said that he diverted people then that might well be so,
the objective would be the same whichever method one used. He
might have used the serials by locating them within the tunnel
and/or terrace.
 212 B L MOLE (continued       2)

 He was very surprised that Mr Lock should have said that the control
 of the tunnel was a known practice and it certainly had never been
 passed to him. As far as semi-finals were concerned the terrace
 was treated as a whole, the fans were to find their own level.
 This did not mean that they were expected to go willy-nilly where-
 ever they liked, it still involved monitoring. If a situation
 required addressing then he would take, or expect his commanders
 to take whatever steps necessary to redress it. He confirmed that
 law and order and safety were closely intertwined.


SEE COPY TRANSCRIPT PAGE 17.


With regard to ticketless fans, this presents a problem as there
were no real powers, he would seek to keep them away from the
turnstile areas but certainly if they got as far as the turnstiles
he would hope to send them away from there. He made contingency
plans in 1988 to hold them but it proved unnecessary. He wasn't
aware of any specific filtering system to check them.


He discussed problems arising out of delayed kick-off, not least
the expectation of fans already inside and the effect of delay on
them.   He would not allow the convenience of the players to overrule
safety, although closer to kick-off the more important the effect
on the crowd became. Self-inflicted delay in itself wasn't a reason-^
for not delaying although obviously it was a point which had to b e ;
put in the balance.
As far as he was concerned in 1987 and 1988 the matches had worked
perfectly satisfactorily with regard to finding their own level.
Where problems were identified he would make recommendations, e.g.
gate on the Kop. He had very good relationship with the Club, no
complaints about 1987 or 1988 had been received by him. The ground
was considered good and if anything they had more experience of
semi-finals than most other clubs over the last 20 years.
Relationship with the Working Party enabled them to make a
contribution and they had a good response.
212.   B L MOLE (continued    3)

Descriptions of control (SEE COPY TRANSCRIPT PAGES 28/29)


Use of the internal gates as described by Dr Eastwood had not been
communicated to him and he would have thought they were unsuitable
because of the psychological impact.


On the whole he would expect the controller and/or ground commander
to take decisions. They knew him and his method of working.
Certain matters could be reported, e.g. delayed kick-off or bomb
scares.   Implementation of any action would be up to the controller.
The ACC would not normally have operational control although there
was an element of ratification and cross-divisional supply. He
would not expect him to take over command if he was present unless
he was taken off the job.


In addition to his basic training he had the benefit of the South
Yorks Manual and other ACPO guidelines, as well as other information.
28 FEBRUARY 1991

212.     B L MOLE (continued....4)                   CHIEF SUPERINTENDENT

            .           . . He confirmed to Mr Payne that prior
to the events he had believed that the ground was safe at full
capacity, that it could be evacuated in an emergency in time, that
he had not heard anyone suggest that there was a danger of crushing
and death on those terraces, that he had never had to open the
concertina gates, that nothing had occurred that would have alerted
him to the possibility of such a disaster, he had not forseen any
circumstances, nor had it been obvious that there was a serious
risk of injury due to a large crowd and, in particular, none of
the parties, including members of the working party, had ever
              |
suggested otherwise.

He then went through a number of documents:
C484        Letter from Chief Supt Moseley re segregated areas and
4.2.85      segregation, intended to enable segregation of away and
            home supporters.


C392       Eastwood to Sth    Yorks.         Drawing showing segregated
9.5.85     distinct areas.   He believed this was to help with
            segregating home and away supporters in line with Mr
            Moseley's letter.     (N.B. note Dr Eastwood, that it was
            intended to achieve separation rather than segregation.


C475       A Minute of the Officers Working Group of 7.8.85 in
            which a proposal was discussed. This was not as radical
            as the one Chief Supt Moseley had proposed. Both Mr
            Moseley and Dr Eastwood were present at this meeting,
            Dr Eastwood reported as speaking with some authority.
            It was pointed out that the Minute provided that the gates
           on the new Pen 5 under police c o n t r o ^ w c m l d allow people
           to be directed down that area. Mr Mesetey denied Dr
           Eastwood's suggestion that that would imply that all the
           radial gates would be manned and in fact said that this
                                       '-A

           manning was real ly-trH-we needed in the context of that
           Minute as long as there was opposing fans. Once the
           terrace was given over to the same fans, the need
           disappeared.
212.    B L MOLE (continued      5)


           He was adamant that the radial gates were only manned
           in sequential filling situations and he could see no point
           or advantage in having them there at other times.

C485       Page 3, No.6.    The advice not to rely on human barriers
           was excellent.     He said that the wall of the concourse
           had been built because temporary barriers had been knocked
           over. He said as far as he was concerned the Police had
           no responsibility for building the structure nor any
           control as to whether the advice was taken.     They might
           identify a problem but others had to implement the decisions.

C390       Never seen this plan before, said he was not aware of
           individual pen capacities, but see LJT Transcript where he
           appears to say that he did know that the pens held between
           1000 and 1200 people (P. 13, 24 May (Day 7).    It was not
           the responsibility of the Police to work out capacities.

C512a      Operational order, a small match, confirmed that this
           described sequential filling (1987 Sheffield Wednesday vs
           QPR).

C483       Mr Strange's memo re conversation with Sharon re capacity
a & b     and Mr Strange's telephone message. N.B. Dr Eastwood
          repudiates the contents but witness said it correctly
          describes his understanding of the system. He confirmed
          that the preservation of life was a very important factor
          in policing and in his experience it was extensive.
          Nothing had occurred which could have prepared the Police
          for the events starting at 14.52, that if he had been in
          the control room and the situation was as described to him
          by the commander, he would have instigated action to relieve
          the threat to life and reduce pressure on the public outside.
          In his view the decision was correct, particularly as he
          was releasing people from a confined space (T/S area) into
          a larger space (concourse) and he would have expected that
          the people would expand and recover themselves before
          making their way onto the terracing.
 212.   B L MOLE (continued       6)

 Cross-examined by Mr Isaacs.

 He agreed with Mr Isaacs that it would have been difficult to see
 the radial gates when the pens are full but this would be something
 one would only learn from experience, that he had had several
 conversations with Chief Supt Harold when he took over, that
 familiarity with the ground increased with experience, information
 from others and that the policing would improve with time.           He
 did not consider that the poor signing, turnstiles or the ticketing,
 created a policing problem except for the ticketing where some
 c o l o u ^ c o d i n g was required and this was implemented. He agreed
 that the match was announced on 20 March, he was leaving on the
 26th, he arranged for a meeting on the 22nd to which Mr Duckenfield
 was invited. He implemented the construction of the operational
 order under Murray, Beatty, Sewell. He personally selected the
 sector commanders and, had he remained, had no doubt that he would
 have signed the order which substantially followed previous ones.
 He was asked why the operational plan did not contain various matters,
 in particular, why did he not cater for the arrival of large numbers
of late arrivals, response not anticipated, no indication from
intelligence and therefore not dealt with.
He agreed that if large numbers were to arrive unexpectedly, he
would expect the sector commander Marshall to be able to deal with
it, supported as appropriate by the overall commander and other
officers. He stated that the plan did not deal with the possibility
of congestion in that area because there was no knowledge or
intelligence that this might occur and therefore his mind was not
activated to this possibility.
With regard to the overcrowding he repeated that he did not know
specific numbers and it was not part of the Police function to
monitor the numbers coming into the ground. He was satisfied that
the terrace as a whole could cope with the numbers allocated. He
agreed that there was nothing in the order to alert a newcomer to
the possibility that ’ the tunnel might be sealed off. Whilst he
would have expected officers to use their initiative he also
expected them to report back such an event either at half-time or
formal d e 7 brief and as far as he was concerned he was not aware of
it. Debriefing reports were necessary so that appropriate alterations
to the planning could take place. He agreed that Inspectors should
 212.   B L MOLE (continued      7)

 remain in situ although possibly arrests might sometimes force a
 detour, although he did not approve of it, and in any event control
 should have been informed. He described the briefings, his own
 over-all and then, more specifically                        . He
 had complete faith in their ability to undertake this. He also
 said he did brief people on the day before, including two at the
 ground so that problems could be dealt with.


 He agreed that if the players were already on the pitch then         this
 was an important consideration re delaying       -the kick 70 ff as one
 had to very acutely take into account the effect on people already
 in the ground as well as the effect on the players. The expectancy
 of the crowd was that kick 7 off should take place and they would
 be unhappy if this did not take place.


 He would expect the centre pens to be fuller than the sides but
 mere disparity would not necessarily indicate o v e ^ f u l l n e s s , he
 would be looking for other indicators, e.g. if people were playing
 with objects.    He said one could often sense what a situation was
 like when walking around and the more one did this the better one
 got.




CROSS EXAMINATION BY MR KING

Mr King took Mr Mole through his system, suggested that it didn't
provide for direction to sides, informing when pens were full or
sight of the radial fences or provide help regarding position at
the radial gates. He would not accept that the tunnel was the
only route. In addition, if uncomfortable, people could go back
out or go laterally although the gates would be difficult to see
in certain situations. The operational plan did not give specific
responsibility to monitor overcrowding, on paper, or provide for
even distribution. He was referred to Exhibit 513 (ACPO), paras
111-112 dealing briefly with stewards. Considerable discussion
as to who was responsible for the distribution, the Police were
not stewards. Repeated several times that if it was obvious some­
thing needed to be done then action would be taken. At the time
 212.   B L MOLE (continued      8)

 the pens did not present a problem.        If he had noticed a disparity
 at 14.50 he would not have been concerned by seeing more people at
 the centre. He looked at several photographs later on and said
 that C477, C478 at 14.46 showed signs of normality. Similarly,
 C507 at 14.52, C511 at 14.54, would not have caused him alarm,
 despite the disparity, but at 14.59 a view such as on the photograph
would have indicated a need for action but he could not say what
he would have done as it would have had to be            . Even
 if he knew at 14.50 that 2000 more had to c o me # he would not
necessarily expect them all to rush down the centre tunnel - they
had common sense and experience, they were late and they knew it
and would ask for directions.         If they were all coming at once he
might well seek to divert them. Public order and safety ran together.
If at 14.30 he was told only half had gone in he would want to know
where the rest were. He had decided that Mr Marshall should do
the outside duty. Operational order did not refer to overcrowding
either within or without the ground.


CROSS-EXAMINED BY MR MANNING

Semi-final plan tried and tested. Contingency plans had been
included for Liverpool supporters on the Kop and also various other
modifications had been made to the operational order. He expected
officers to act independently.        He did not accept the word "frenzy"
in the control room but they were pretty busy. Control was the
lynch pin. In 1988 had some radial problems which was why an
engineer was present in 1989. Sector commanders would deal with
problems and refer them to the controller who would respond. The
controller would expect to be able to rely on their superintendents.
Further discussion re delayed kick-off, mere reduction in numbers
not sufficient as they might not come and they had a shortfall the
previous year of about 3000. Assessment of numbers in pens is
very difficult, perimeter track officers, West end officers, very
important. He would expect to have known about overall numbers'
coming in and if less than half had arrived by 14.30 he would
expect this to be passed to him but in itself it would not necessarily
be cause for alarm.

 CROSS-EXAMINED BY MR CATCHPOLE

 Mr Catchpole was anxious about Mr Marshall's evidence re the system
 (DAY 52, PAGES 38 - 39, DAY 53, PAGES 20(G) and 23(G)).
 Some of his comments already covered, segregation sadly necessary.
 Explored role of stewards.    Confirmed none on terrace or perimeter
 track.    Discussed safety certificate schedule, stewarding satisfactory
 in 1987 and 1988.    Long discussion re system, response as before.
 If fans had been severely crushed outside, would have expected them
 to pause in concourse area. Failure to communicate with staff on
 concourse area re opening gates would slow down their reaction
 and disadvantage them.     1987 was a new situation, mechanism as
 described seemed to work satisfactorily.     Discussion re Mr Creaser's
 evidence, discussed willy/nilly filling.


 Agreed that opening of Gate 'C' did create a different situation,
 stewards were briefed by Inspector White, would expect stewards as
 well as POs to report anything dangerous.    Main objective of Police
 operation was segregation, they had a major role in safety.      Even
 distribution, resistance to movement by people in prime position,
 if danger noted action would be taken, everything depended on
 noticing.    Would expect Mr Lock to inform certain events, e.g.
almost reaching capacity or breakdown of turnstiles but would not
expect operational interference.


CROSS-EXAMINED BY MRS McBRIEN

He had not had previous experience of having to close Leppings Lane
pre-match for any length of time. Confirmed that people who were
crushed needed space, thought that access road would provide this
but people might not want to go there. In any case there was space
in the concourse area. Although he wasn't there, he thought froif
the video there was some disorder outside and that could affect
safety. He had never known severe congestion outside the turnstiles
so as to give rise to concern. He had operated his system at
Hillsborough from the baseline that the stadium was safe and that
the radial fences had sorted out the 1981 problefi.    He talked about
opening mthe perimeter gates in normal circumstances where such
opening would be controlled to let a specific persofi out after
consultation.

CROSS-EXAMINED BY MR RUSSELL
Mr Russell established that over the last 20 years about 13 semi­
finals had been staged and that if anything the force had more
experience of these than many other clubs.       Mr Mole agreed that
semi-finals were distinguished       from other matches in having
ground commanders at Superintendent level.       He also agreed that
it was appropriate for the ground commander to have a roving
commission and to position himself near the players' tunnel,
particularly if the overall commander was located in the box, if
it was known that problems might occur on the Kop (Liverpool
Section) based on last year's experience, and if it was known that
there was great interest in Mr Clough's position. He agreed that
communications would generally be by radio but that the ground
commander within the stadium should have been visible to the box
and that because radio was on talk-through there was a high level
of noise, communication could be lost. He confirmed that the
choice of Mr Marshall for outside duty had been his decision.

therefore the maintenance of good order is in that interest.
You see various thin gs , and I give minor examples, the
throwing of articles up and down the Kop affects safety in
that you see coats being thrown and p e op le ’s eyes could be
damaged as a consequence of buttons being pulled out.      They
are all minor things but they affect safety directly, and yet
it is public disorder .we are talking about.     The climbing from
the terraces to the faest Stand is public order, but it affects
safety if it is not stopped.    You only want somebody to fall
or land on somebody or whatever.    So all those are so inter­
twined I don't think you can differentiate between the
maintenance of public order and safety.

     If I patrol Officers in the town centre of Barnsley or
Sheffield when I command there, my main thrust is the
maintenance of good order in the town and in the city.   That
naturally in my view reflects the safety of the citizens of
the town or the city because it is a natural consequence, and
a Police Officer's ma'in duty is the protection of life and
property, which is what it is all about.   So you have to go
back to what I was saying about a Police Officer does not
spell everything out, but his whole life and training revolves
about those basic functions.   I don't feel the necessity every
time I mount an operation to spell every facet of a Police
Officer's role out on paper, because it is indoctrinated in
him.

     If I could draw an analogy with military personnel, they
are told to go from A to B and do it and have no discretion.
Policemen have discretion, and I depend upon that discretion
and ability to operate in the interests of the community they
serve.

I want to pick up now before we move into the ground one other
aspect which has featured quite a lot in this Inquest, and
that is in an all ticket match the position with regard to
ticketless fans, and in particular in 1988 the suggestion from
various people with ticketless fans that there was either
filtering or checking of tickets by Police Officers at a
distance to the ground. - A. Yes.

First of all, as far as you are aware were any instructions to
that effect given to Officers in 1988 to do that? Whether or
not they did it is neither here nor there.  Can you help me
with regard to the instructional aspect? - A. It is sad to say
whatever match you have, particularly all ticket matches, you
always have an element who will travel in the hope of getting
a ticket.  I have in,other forums talked about ticket touts,
and while ever we have ticket touts we shall have people who
come for the opportunity.  For both Semi-Finals I looked after
I made great emphasis in the media telling people not come,
and if they did I would take positive action to dissuade them
on coaches or vehicles, and send them away.  In law I have
little power other than to arrest upon things like likely to
cause a breach of the peace.

   that.  We have been part of the Working Group and quite
   clearly not the only voice.  There is the voice of the
   Pire Brigade, the voice of the Local Authority,
   building, etc., and we have always had a good input and
   a good response to ahything we have said or responded
   to on things other people have said.  I think fairly
   there has been a good relationship at Sheffield
   Wednesday.  It has been a ground that has been well
   thought of, I think, in the past.  So much so that in
   Police terms people have come from many parts to watch
   our operation which they have thought as being very
   good.

Q. The impression I have gained from some of the evidence
   of people which we have heard is that at annual
   inspections, or biannual inspections as they used'to
   be, of the Officers' Working Group, apart from picking
   up minor or maybe major defects, suggestions were made
   from time to time and these were discussed, considered,
   and then if appropriate implemented, in fact, by the
   Club because it was their ground after all? - A. Yes.

Q. Certainly some of the people who were here have
   indicated - and I am coming back to this question of
   the control of the gates - that they had understood
   that the word 'control' meant manning putting it quite
   bluntly and that meant manning it at every and each
   match and if they had understood it differently they
   might well have taken a different point of view.  Are
   you able to comment on that? - A. Yes.

Q. Actually before you do, just one moment.       I need
   something which I forgot.   (p a u s e ) You can remember
   the question? - A. Yes, I do.     In response to that I do
   not accept that that is the case.       I think what I said
   earlier, and I maintain is the position, whenever there
   was a Police decision to restrict entry to a part of
   the terracing, whichever part, which involved the
   locking of the gates then I believe it was essential
   and agreed by me that they would be manned.       When that
   was not the case there was no purpose in manning and I
   have never entered into an agreement for manning.       The
   purpose of manning is to unlock the gate, to free any
   problem that is arising or to gain entry to resolve a
   problem, namely to effect an arrest or whatever but it
   was essential in those circumstances that somebody was
   there.  When it was not locked there was no purpose.

Q. Would you go this far, and if you do not please say so,
   that irrespective of what may have been your
   understanding with regard to those gates was it
   understood that the control of the spectators in the
   Leppings Lane terracing was a Police function? - A. It

   depends on the description of control, sir.    The
   allowing of people into the stadium is a Club's
   responsibility and one for stewarding.    The
   responsibility for segregation is undertaken by the
   Police Commander an d ’his Officers.  In terms of
   segregation the decision to restrict certain areas and
   to control restriction to certain areas is a Polices
   problem and responsibility.    The actual - I think you
   used the word packing but I do not particularly like it
   but packing is probably understood by people - packing,
   if there is a need to pack is a stewarding
   responsibility.  Because of the way that things
   developed at Hillsborough and we had to utilise the
   segregation aspect then we restricted entry to one or
   two pens or whatever and as a natural consequence took
   on the role of monitoring and identifying the point
   when the restricted area we had identified, ie we the
   Police, was at a point where we needed to use more
   space and we took on that decision to extend it to A N
   Other pen.  So that extent we controlled the amount of
   use for segregation purposes.

       To have 200 people running free along the whole
   width of the terrace creates problems in itself.      To
   ^ave a thousand in a 10,100 area can create problems in
   itself.   So the purpose was for segregation to stop
   them running up to various quarters, throwing, jibing,
   climbing into whatever, and to that extent we had a
   role and responsibility. If the whole area is open
   then there is no involvement in segregation terms of
   determining a point when we move into another bit of
  the area.    So my understanding, and I believe the
  understanding with everybody, was that when we said to
  Graham, or whoever it was at the Club, "I am going to
  limit it", in fact, we had disputes about using the
  elevated section I think.    Mr. Chester wrote to me
  ®^®ut it once, Dick Chester,     and I used to keep it
  clear.   He liked to be told    when and we agreed to tell
  him when it was going to be     kept clear. So that
  rapport always went on.    Itwas when we    were asking or
  dictating the method of operation for segregation, that
  was our responsibility.

». Is it not right, because I think you told me this
   earlier, that you would have expected (a) the
   Officers...? - A. To observe.

. On the stand, (b) the perimeter Officers, (c) the
  people in the Control Room, plus anybody else, if they
  noticed a problem to intervene? - A. Absolutely.

. You would    go this   far that there was a monitoring
  function? - A. Yes.                    .

He is talking about one of the crush barriers,   144 in fact:

     ” .... and this barrier was an obstruction to the free
     flow of supporters going onto the terraces.   Quite often
     you would get a crushing so what we did, we had Police
     Officers, as I have described for the smaller matches, or
     the backs of th'e:terraces and looking after the gates,
     but the gates would then be unlocked and left open so
     there could be a free flow.

     The centre pen is always the most popular because it is
     directly behind the goal where the action is happening,
     and as a consequence I used to place Officers at each
     end of the barriers so that we would keep people
     moving because if they stopped, of course, there would
     be an obstruction, and we used to allow the people to
     come through and direct them through from outside,
     either around each end so they could go into the wing
     pens, or down the centre, but there were Officers
     there, and we used to have Inspectors who were in
     charge of that part of the ground.  I remember quite a
     number of them - I can remember Inspector Sykes and
     another one whose name eludes me for the moment...."

but he remembered it later.   It was Chief Inspector Creaser:

     ’’.... but I have known them come up to my Box and say to
     me, ’How are we filling? Have we got room in the centre
     or in front of the Box?', because pens 5 and 6 used to be
     the least popular and were always the last ones to fill.
     We used to look at it and say, 'Yes, we can get some more
     in', and when the centre pen, which inevitably filled
     first, when that was full, comfortably full. I would give
     the order, ’Close the centre p e n ’.

     Now, we didn't close the gate for obvious reasons,
     because if anything happened, of course, it would be
     obstructing the exit.  We used to then put into effect
     the barrier system and Inspector Calvert, Inspector
     Sykes, have done that on numerous occasions, acting on m\
     instructions, and sometimes on their own when they saw
     that the situation was arising where the pen was full,
     but they would then inform me, 'We've closed the centre
     pen by putting the barrier a c ross'” .

And then I asked him one question:

     "Q.  So have I understood you correctly, that in a
     situation where you were using the terrace as a whole yot
     would lock open the radial gates.? - A. Yes."

Can you help me on that.  Does that in any way help? - A. I
understand the drift of what he is saying.  I have to repeat.
I have never ever had occasion to block off the tunnel.  If
Mr. Lock has had it he has not transmitted that fact to me.   ]

First in line, entered ground from gym. Thinks he was walking past
Pen 4 just as kick-off was taking place. Went past gate of Pen 3
up to radial fence, turned, Gates 3 and 4 were both shut when he
went past them. When he faced the pen he heard a man shout near
to the centre that someone was dead. He immediately called his
colleagues to open the gate. He did not do so himself as he was
too far away. Three officers around the gate, didn't know who
opened it. Seemed to recollect it shutting once. Interesting
observation that he thought shutting it would relieve pressure on
the people at the bottom because of people coming over the tops.
Didn't see anyone being put back. All happened within seconds.
People coming out initially were running and spilling out in great
numbers, under their own steam.
Subsequently left and attended on Supt. Greenwood. When he walked
past Pens 3 and 4, initially not overly concerned, was alerted by
the man crying out. Had not heard fans screaming in Pen 4. As he
walked along he glanced into the pen and could see and hear people
saying they were being squashed, they were in discomfort but not
to the degree that had developed, he was looking sideways.
Discomfort was caused by surging. They just looked like normal fans
some were penned in, 2/3 rows back there was nobody shouting. They
were penned but not squashed against the fence to any serious degree
The time interval between observing this and hearing the man shout
out was perhaps ten seconds. He thought someone had gone to the
ground and been trampled.
Unable to say what had happened to the gates prior to his arrival
at 15.00.
Unable to identify himself on C326a timed at 14.59, with gate open.

Mr Illingworth is a regular gate officer. His name is David, he is
not known as John (Mr Ellis). He did not sit on the wall outside
Gate 5 (Lycett, Dickinson and Ellis).   He has been doing this job
regularly. Has seen the tunnel doors closed in the past (maximum
of twice) but has not done it himself.
Has never seen temporary barriers. Covered Pens 4 - 7 .
No problems in 1988 except for young man who injured his leg (he
had climbed over the fence and then fallen back). He described
gis job as looking after the security and safety of the fans. In
1989 no problems anticipated, went for dinner at 2 pm, returned
at ahout 2.50, teams not on pitch, spoke to PC Heliwell who drew
his attention to fans climbing into the stand from the North section.
Was seen on photo C511, 14.54, outside Pen 6 .
He then started coming back towards Pen 4, heard cries of distress
from the front, could understand the words "help, we are getting
crushed", very unusual, attempted to radio to control, no response
recollected, decided to open gates. First man out was aged about
20 yrs with a hurt leg, others followed, attempted to take him
into Pen 6 , he opened gates 4, 5 and 6 and never shut them again.
Did notice a serial in due course but cannot say who led it.
First noticed the serial 3/4 minutes after opening the gate. Was
on his own initially. He realised when he opened the gate that
urgent action was needed to avoid injury but did not anticipate death.
Says he made three trips before he saw other officers.
Never saw the gate shut after he opened it, but cannot explain
evidence of Hooson (123) and Sowsnowski (122). Thought restriction
on exiting might be due to past pitch invasions.
At 14.52 and 14.54 had not noticed any signs of distress.   Did not
rely on briefings as he knew his instructions.
Not given specific instructions to look for overcrowding but didn't
need them.
Was surprised how few fans were in situ at 2 pm., .and that the wings
looked empty to a degree.
Was concerned as to why so many fans wanted to get into the centre
section, at 14.52 approx. Cries for help not heard immediately upon
returning to Pen 4.   Thought they were in distress but not obviously
crushed.

He did not wish to answer questions arising out of LJT.
Confirms he could see PC Smith (?) on C511. Said to Mrs McBrien
that he opened the gate to avoid injuries. Mrs McBrien spotted an
anomoly, namely, that if ex Sgt Higgins closed the tunnel gates for
any length of time, why were fans in 1988 uncomfortable, and was it
because they entered via the radial gates.  Mr Illingworth said           52
people tended to climb over the radial fences anyway.

that at 14.54 atmosphere was "happy mood".                                61
At 14.59 situation had already changed, he had used his initiative
to open the gate. Estimated he escorted fans on his own for about
three minutes, i.e. before seeing serials, plus another 3/4 minutes       64
escorting after that.                                             65

seconds between making his radio call and opening the gates. He
thought that taking some fans out would relieve the problem.

 209.     DR EASTWOOD                          CLUB ENGINEER

 Dr Eastwood confirmed his appointment and outlined method of
 calculating capacity based on drawing, slope and crush barriers*!
 Confirmed he calculated in 1979 the figures 8,000 reduced by 10%
 to allow for lack of gangways.   He felt that a gangway in the event
would have led to even more disaster because it was so overcrowded
Jnd the gangway by definition has jfo barriers in it. He wasn't
very impressed with the argument about the 12 metre rule to exits.
He agreed that there was close liaison with the Working Party.
 In 1981 he knew that there had been a problem but not the details.
He was asked to design the radial barriers which he did, they were
approved subject to the gates being controlled. His understanding
was that POs would be at or near them. He had proposed a scheme
for individual turnstiles, well ahead of its time, and it was not
taken up. He could see no point in altering the capacity as
individual pens could not be controlled and the terrace had to be
treated as a whole. In 1985 he designed more radial fences, still
the same re treating terrace. He agreed that one would have to rely
on visual observation re capacity.
Apart from making proposals regarding redesigns, he seemed to have
had nothing to do with turnstiles. He confirmed that they had put
in extra crush barriers and that the general view of everyone was
that the steps which were being taken - radial fences, better crowd
control, more crash barriers, were all factors which enhanced safety
rather than the other way around. In 1987 he confirmed that he had
spoken to Mr Strange about the capacity. They were expecting a
revised Safety Certificate and he was not worried or concerned about
packing, particularly as it was known that, for example, for an
eight-year period in the 7 0 1s semi-finals had been played each year
and that the terracing in those days held 11,600 with fewer crash
barriers and no problems.   His view was in 1987 that one could follow
the Safety Certificate and if that said turnstiles 10,200, there was
no reason to alter it. He wasn't present when barrier 144's removal
was discussed, Mr Strange was, it was a Police suggestion, they were
anxious it should be done quickly and eventually it was agreed.

                                                               /continued.

 209.   DR EASTWOOD (continued...2)

 It was put to him by Mr Strange and he inspected the ground and,
balancing the pros and cons, decided that it was OK, bearing in mind
that the reduction in capacity was only about 8 6 , which, taken over
the whole terrace, was negligible, that the Police had the day-to-day
control and in particular Inspector Calvert, who had many years of
experience, wanted it. He confirmed that one of their worries had
been the area in front of the barrier but in the end decided that
it would be satisfactory.


I examined Dr Eastwood on the testing of the barrier. He confirmed
this was carried out and that, in his view, it had passed the test
but he had heard Dr Nicholson's finds that failure was due to excess
of its load.


Cross-examined by Mr Payne, he was satisfied that the stand would have
been safe if used in accordance with the Certificate and no gates
opened. He thought it "reasonably safe". He said he could have
envisaged situations where safe evacuation would have been impossible.
There was some realisation that the pens could form %&£££ and that
is why gates were required at the back. The Officers Working Party
thought it was reasonably safe and he agreed with that. He thought
that the changes being made, including the pens, were providing a safer
environment although, as indicated, adverse effects could follow. He
confirmed that no-one had ever thought that death would occur on the
terraces 3 He believed then and still believes now that the ground is
"reasonably" safe. He took the view that under the Safety Certificate,
he had no other duty than to inspect. He considered that the provisions
of Chapter 16 of the Green Guide re capacity was the responsibility of
the Local A u t h o r U ^ and took the view that Paragraph 161 dealt with a
side of t'hc'-pens * 5- Para 206 dealt,with sub-sections ie the ideal was
separateness,xm.ly t-frat ■wa s— not vi abl  alternative JSpJS&were required,

Police including control of the gate.
 209.   DR EASTWOOD (continued...3)

               (U
He denied that bis recorded remarks by Dr Strange on C438B
had been made by him.     He asked Dr Strange whether the new
certificate was issued yet and if not, to stick with the
Safety Certificate on the condition that the gates were open
and subject to control. He did not think it satisfactory to
allow self-distribution (except in early stages^ fhis should
be under police control).


With regard to the blue doors, he knew they       opened the wrong
way, that is why he      provided internal doors at the front for
control of the pens which did open the right way.        He was not
an expert on safety but he would have thought it understandable
to shut the outer gates.     He was taken through all the paragraphs
on means of escape (21, 53, 96, 174, 206, 209). In principle,
he said that the ground c o m p l i e d ^ i n particular he did not
really think some people moving^l 2m to get to an exit made a
a significant difference in an emergency (contrast Mr Seamans
re gangways).


Mr ftaafKrts Manning confirmed that he had not discussed the
matter with Duckford or Murray.     Mr King took him through
C268 view of the pens.     He agreed that radial fences did
create separate sub-sections and that people could get trapped
    f t was necessary to look at each section as a separate area
and that therefore some system was needed and could not be left
to spectators going     where they will because of the risk of
over-crowding.   He said it was clearly within  the minds of
everybody that they would have to be monitoring radial fences
and more accurate control. He considered the turnstile provided
the overall capacity but that you needed to control entering by
the blue gates and exit via radial gates and carefully monitoriA^

In a nutshell, capacity continued to be safe so long as proper
control over packing was maintained. It was the intention of all
the parties to make things safer. Although nothing was written
down he felt that assurances had been given by police re packing
and subsequently felt that the assurances week a little too strong.

At no point had anybody said that v t could not cope with the system.
He agreed with Mr Maxwell that the working party was conscientious
and anxious to promote safety.   If anyone had been concerned, it
would have been discussed.   It was expected that police were
responsible for crowd control and it was also his experience that
that function had been properly fulfilled. He agreed with
Mr Toulson that as notice of changes had to be given, it would
have been inappropriate to include this in his Inspection Certificate.
He agreed that means of egression had been carefully looked at by
the working party.   He reconfirmed that he thought the pens were
sub-divisions as opposed to separate sections (paras 101 , 206) and
that there was no requirement, need or point for having a separate
figure for a sub-division if there was no    accounting system and
people could pass freely. He agreed that there was no maximum
local level figure for the terraces or any other ways to stop
increases in local densities and felt that 5 . 4 had allowed for
mal£ distribution within limits. He agreed that the capacity
before the Safety Certificate for Leppings Lane had been 11,600
and this had been achieved over many years and therefore his view
was that safety had been improved by reduction in numbers, increase
in barriers and installation of radial fences.   He briefly commented
on t he.leaning crowd model and stated that he thought it was elegant
but needed more work. He stated that he had tested barriers at
Nottingham which had withstood 2kn and that it should have fallen
down and, indeed, the one at Leppings Lane should have done so
on many, many occassions if the model worked.

Mrs McBride cross-examined. She obtained confirmation that normal
entry was through turnstiles but entry through gates could create
problems Ajiib (Sxit systems to be kept clear and that the radial
fences had been put in for more                 control.    Mr Payne challenged
this and there was long and heated argument as to whether there were

prt*rrs4»p4 » • a-pfrrtr-frem-the- proposa-1 s . Dr Eastwood was shown minutes
and letters where segregation was mentioned.               He said that his
overall plan had always been to provide individual servic£*^areas and
not simply a method of segregation of different supporters. Mr Payne
drew his attention to a letter of February 1985 from the Police
which seemed to me to be making exactly the same point. He agreed
with Mrs McBride that when the gates were opened there was a large
influx and that the pressure generated in the pens was unprecedented
in his opinion and he was surprised that only^barrier broke.


He confirmed that he had nothing to do with crowd control and
particularly the outside. He confirmed that the quick release
mechanism on gates 3 and 4 were designed to enable the gates to be
opened under pressure and not to open spontaneously under pressure.


I then re-examined him.        He agreed that the centre pens filled
faster and fuller; that some differential might well apply provided it
was not too gross but initially people could sort themselves out but
once an assessment had been made on fullness in a particular area,
intervention might be needed. He felt that his blue gates could usefully
be used even though they presented precisely the same risk in reverse
as the others but said it was less acute because of the balance of numbers.
 209.   DR EASTWOOD (continued...6)



 He said if necessary there would have to be Police officers at the
 gates and at the entry to the tunnel. I asked    him whether he had
 thought this through before 15 April 1989. He    said perhaps not
 quite so clearly but, bearing in mind that his   objective had always
 been to produce individual controlled pens, he   thought it would have
 been present in his mind.


 He agreed that the control system for the distribution could not be
 implemented unless and until a judgement on the fullness of a particular
 area had been made. I asked him as to the use of the word assurance.
 His first response was that there was documentary evidence that the
gates were supposed to be under police control and said this was not the
issue. What I wanted to do was get him to explain what he meant by the
word assurance. He was reminded that he had used this word at LJJ's
spontaneously and that he was also to bear in mind that he used this
term in conjunction, not just with the control of the radial gates,
but the whole system of packing. He said that assurances was too
strong a word and confirmed that there was nothing in writing but
what he meant was that in the course of conversations with the Officers
Working Party and maybe at other times.    In conversations, he was given
to understand that things would be under control by those monitoring
which would be the Police in general terms and that this gave rise
within himself of a feeling of assurance.


He also agreed that despite his description of    the system of filling
pens, there was nothing in writing about this in any minutes. He agreed
that the terrace could be looked at as one complete unit because of the
radial gates and also as individual sub-sections because of the fences.
Finally, he agreed that Mr Strange's minute of the telephone conversation,
whilst not accurately reflecting what he had said, was nevertheless:
a)   on file               he was insistent that he had personally made
     sure that this drawn to the attention of the
     and that the message conveyed to the group was what was in the note.

           208.     DR   NICHOLSON

           Dr Nicholson gave evidence on
           (a)    numbers through turnstiles and Gate C.        He confirmed that they
           had satisfied themselves with regard to the accuracy of the turnstiles
           apart from one 1G 1 which they corrected and which he is satisfied on.
          He described their method of calculating entry through Gate 'C'
          which confirmed that they were unable to do any counting in respect
          of Gates 'A' and 'B1. They produced three figures - count, best
          estimate and maximum:-
                                           Count         Best Estimate     Maximum

          Remarkably close to stated capacity. One might have to make some
          adjustment for entries through the other gates.
          He confirmed that the number required to enter through each turnstile
          A - G was almost three times as high as what was required for some of
          the other areas and by far the highest in the ground. C ' V y j cy^~<


          (b)     He dealt   with numbers in pens 3 and 4.      He explained his
          methodology, digitisation, the difference in the four rows, packing
          densities per sq.metre.
                  Back row           7.5
                  3rd row            7.6
                  2 nd row           8.1
                  1st row            10     (this was estimated based on tests at HSE).
          This produced a count of 1,576 and average packing of 8.4.           The
          capacity of Pen 3 at 5.4 was calculated at 1,015.
          Pen 4 could not be assessed in this way but by doing comparative studies
          they were satisfied that the densities were comparable. The calculated
y '       number in Pen 4 was I b O l    . The capacity for Pen 3 at 5.4 per
          sq.m was 1,015 and the equivalent of Pen 4 was        }v ^j°    jk                  )<
          Finally, they had taken a strip of Pen 2 adjacent to the barrier fence
          and at that position the area showed a density of about 5 per sq.m.             e-3>bO

 208 DR      NICHOLSON (continued...2)

(c) I asked Dr Nicholson to confirm that they had done a calculation
of the number of people who could be accommodated outside on the basis
of 8/10 per sq.m. and he gave the total figures for areas 1, 2, 3, as
3,880 and 4,850 respectively,   d.


 (d)   Regarding barriers, Dr Nicholson explained the bowing but in his
view the legs must have held and the bowing must have occurred first.
He explained that they had found some rust on end clips and at least
one of these rust spots should have been noticed.      Nevertheless,
depending upon various complicated physical parameters, the force
required to bend and collapse the barrier was in the range of 6 / 8 - l / d
He confirmed that the test      was fe ^     and that even in the
corroded state the barrier would have stood up to those pressures.
We then discussed the leaning crowd model. This is a static model
and did not take into account movement, although he did say he
felt that in the tightly packed crowd movement might be difficult.
He demonstrated that on that model, given the positioning of the
barriers, it would have been possible for a force of 6 + kns to be
exerted, even with a 5.4 density, although they had calculated the
density behind that barrier at about 8 .


He confirmed that the test rig of Eastwoods was entirely satisfactory.
He discussed methodology of testing employed by Eastwoods and
confirmed that his method of treating the tests individually was
in line with an interpretation of the guide although it was not
universally followed and indeed the new guide had been revised to
make things clearer. I asked him why the other barrier on that
terrace which had an even bigger drop, had not broken and he said
it might be because it was smaller, there was friction in effect
between the radial fence 7 but it was all speculation.


Mr Maxwell re-examined him, obtained confirmation of his experience
in metalurgy and engineering, expert in safety and engineering, but
not sports ground as such. Had not seen the Green Guide before the
incident (nor had he studied the safety certificate), was not a
 DAYT 54

 regular football attender. Confirmed that in his experiments they
 were able to accommodate 10 people per sq.m comfortably, nobody was
 in danger or distressed. He agreed that it would need additional
 factors, e.g. dynamics or increased density, to produce pressure
 effects. He was asked about crowd movement (Mr BullaS). He agreed
 that that might well be what was needed to generate the force.
 Confirmed that the model was just a method to try and explain the
 forces on the parameters set out. He was unable to assess why the
 HSE were not willing to help when Sheffield took over responsibility
 as this was not his department.
 Mr Payne obtained confirmation from him that the Green Guide contained
 provisions applicable to the engineer and that in his view, individual
 capacities should have been worked out in respect of the pens.
Some complicated argument regarding barrier testing and whether or
not the gauge should be ^ z e r o ' d and whether or not the barrier
passed, failed or was for re-test.
He was then taken through various drawings, C387, C390, C391, C474,
all of which showed variation in designing individual control for
the pens which he agreed would have complied with the Green Guide
and which were preferable to visual assessment. He was shown C276,
he said they had calculated capacity at 8^2 for Pen 3 and 871 for
Pen 4 with existing barriers.   C390 shAgjd ^cpacities for Pen 3 and
Pen 4 as 1,200 and 1,000 respectively which he thought was based
purely on area, not taking barriers into account. He confirmed
that their figures were based on a brand new survey. He thought
that the engineer would have had some input and a duty to report
on capacities and whether they should be left to Police. He did
not necessarily think that an engineer would have had to investigate
crowd movements but agreed that the computation of figures was
important as lives were at risk. He agreed that he had seen what
appeared to be deformed rails at other parts of the ground. He
was asked about methodology of testing and agreed that they would
have chosen what they considered to be the safer method of inter­
pretation, although he said that Eastwood's interpretation was
compatibles^
20 FEBRUARY 1991

208.   DR NICHOLSON (continued...4)

Mr King sought to establish some figures with regard to the terracing,
Pen 3 and Pen 4, 3,183, leaving about 7,019 for the rest, capacity
of pens at 5.4 = 2,051, i.e. 45% over capacity, on recalculated
values 88 %. Confirmed from C275 that lots of the deceased when
last seen alive were near the front.   If maximum loading of 16 sq.m
at the front, this would increase Pen 3 and Pen 4 capacity from
3,183 to 3,800 approx, and therefore even more overcrowded.   C507
(graph of entry) indicates that at 2.30, 4,300 had got in, leaving
5,800 to come, flow rate required 1,500 per hour to get them all in
during the last4iour.


Dr Nicholson was asked whether he would defer to Mr Seaman's view
regarding the blue gates. He agreed but he also agreed with Mr
Russell to what Mr Lock had said. He confirmed to Mr Catchpole
that turnstiles operate less efficiently when pressurised but,
nevertheless, throughput was 650. He also agreed that between 66 %
and 70% of people were elsewhere than in Pens 3 and 4.

Distribution depended upon rate of inflow.   Somewhat complicated
discussion regarding force required to bend barrier.   In the end
he agreed that their tests based on a particular model of support
was comparable with Eastwoods test of other barriers and indicated
a loading between 8 and 9 kn to break (corrosion being taken into
account) as compared with test load of 6 . Long disucssion re leaning
crowd model, various difficulties with it illustrated. Agreed that
it was very exceptional to have a fractured barrier, model was
simplistic, assumed that everyone leaned forward together over
whole width (query for how long), excluded dynamic forces. He
agreed that an explanation could be that there was a forward surge
with no return which would explain the fracture and also why in
other grounds with fewer and           barriers, no fractures
occurred, because pressure was released. He agreed he was not an
expert on visual filling, gangways or the need of separate calculations
for capacity, i.e. he resiled from his earlier assertion that pens
needed individual capacities.   He agreed that in Eastwood's testing
20 FEBRUARY 1991

208.     DR NICHOLSON (continued...5)

in either case where a test had gone to zero, subsequent tests had
also shown zero and he agreed this is what he would have expected.
He agreed that     the Green Guide was for guidance and allowed
flexibility in places re the sorting out of conflicts, e.g. the
need for crowd control on the one hand and free movement on the
other.    Mrs McBrien put to him is figures for 14.52, Pen 3, 678,
Pen 4, 821. He did not have much confidence in these figures due
to poor quality of photograph.
Mr Russell showed him some photographs at 14.46 which he agreed
showed a much lower density than 15.02 or 15.03.                     (CHECK T/S)
N.B.
The photo of 14.52 is very important because it is timed just as
Gate 'C' opened.
I aksed Mr Nicholson whether it was the quality of the photograph
or the fact that it didn't fit in with the other figures. He said
he thought it was the quality of the photograph.
DAY 58

Dr Nicholson identified the photograph of 14.52 reconfirming that
it was not up to standard to give reliable counts.     He did agree
that it showed a different type of packing density to the 15.03
photograph. He also agreed that the wing pens were lightly
populated but that he was not willing to estimate the numbers
within those pens and that this was difficult to do.


He confirmed that it had taken 2 to 3 weeks to do counts and
3 to 4 days to study photographs to make a choice.

                                              EX POLICE SUPT.

Was in control room between 1982 and 85, had worked with Supt Mole
for whom he had high regard. In his days no TV or computers, games
classified according to size, could remember only one very large
match, with about 48,000, no semi-finals, big match, had led to
capacity at Leppings Lane, no problems getting fans in through turn­
stiles, match was postponed but because of difficulty at the Penistone
Road end where problems were being experienced re law and order,
difficulties were anticipated. Postponement worked, in fact everyone
was in within five minutes of original kick-off time. He described
system employed by him. Small matches, sequencial filling with
radial gates locked. Centre section sometimes sealed off as sterile
area. He never gave, and never would have given, an order to close
the blue gates but it was always part of his understanding and
practice that if the centre pens became full then the tunnel would
be obstructed by moveable barriers, and crowds diverted to left or
right. He said this happened as a result of his own initiative or
sometimes on the initiative of Inspectors e.g. Sykes and Creaser,
who often came to the control room to discuss packing. As far as
he was concerned the terrace was treated as a whole and fully used
and not segmental. He accepted that the centre pen tended to be
more popular, he took the view that a close eye had to be kept on
distribution and that control was with the Police. He also took
the view that he had officers situated on the radial gates but it
seemed main control was from the concourse area. He never had any
problems.


When he left after a few months he took over as security officer.
He made various arrangements to improve stewarding, including
training, upgrading, PA etc. He was present for 1987 and 1988 matches.
As far as he was aware, no problems outside turnstiles Leppings Lane,
capacity crowed and same numbers of turnstiles. He did know that
fans had been diverted in 1988 because he had been told by one of his
stewards after the event but he said he didn't know it was done by
shutting the g a t e s . He had good relationship with Police and there
was close co-operation and liaison.   He knew that Mr Duckenfield had
                                                         /continued..

earlier rather than later because they wanted to enjoy the atmosphere,
although there were always stragglers. He also agreed that there was
no duty on the club to postpone kick-off simply because people were
late. He agreed that it would be ridiculous to try and gear the
kick-offs to the stragglers.

I then asked him about the match day itself. He confirmed that he
had been in and around the ground, been to Leppings Lane, nothing
of any moment, that he had watched the build-up and had not been
concerned, he had noticed the disparity in numbers but it didn't
particularly worry him, he was O n the pitch, Liverpool had just
come out when Mr Lock approached him, told him the gate was open
and that about 300 people had entered. He walked around the outside,
up to Gate C, in through Gate C, enquired of the welfare of one of
the staff and then went to the police control room. Has no
recollection of excessive numbers at that point. Gate C was being
used as an auxiliary turnstile. Entering the control room the
match had definitely ended, there was a lot of activity, he didn't
feel it m s right to ask too many questions, he did hear Chief Supt
P u c k w w M f n n s t r u c t a PO to keep on t alfcnig over the tannoy to calm
ttie crowd, he didn't hear the tannoy messaqes, he could see people
                                                                         1-  ' .
being resuscitated. He heard a comment about bolt cutters, the
rest of the time was spent in dealing with administration, abandon­
ment of match etc. He confirmed that it was known almost immediately
that the match would have to be postponed but the Police were very
anxious that the announcement should not be made too early as they
wanted to retain the crowd within the stadium so that access for
emergency services vehicles were not blocked.
CROSS - EXAMINATION

Mr Payne got him to confirm that before the event both he and all
other parties associated with the ground thought it was safe, that
there was an adequate evacuation procedure and that Dr Eastwood had
issued safety certificates, that at no time had anyone suggested
that there was a risk of death from overcrowding but there had never
been a previous situation where the exit gates had to be opened
because the possibility of such a disaster had not been contemplated
and in particular the situation of risk of death had not appeared obvious

taken over, had not either surprised or worried him. On the day in
question he spent good bit of his time in club room. He had noticed
substantial numbers in at 2 pm but more Nottingham than Liverpool.
He had also noted the increased number of fans outside the turnstiles.
He recollects that Leppings Lane had been closed at some point, he
had seen no disorder, he was not concerned or worried about the
situation, no intelligence had been passed on to him. In fact,
until he learned that the gate had been opened, nothing had happened
which had alarmed him. He remembers being told that the gate was
being opened, he engaged in various activities en route to finding
out.
N.B.
The first opening was 14.48 and it would seem he didn't get onto the
pitch until 14.54, which might indicate not a high level of alarm.


He got onto the pitch and initially wasn't sure whether the players
were out but when asked about photographs he remembers (I think
absolutely correctly) Brian Clough and the problems, and that
definitely one of the teams was out. He met Mr Mackrell, told him
of his intentions, Mr Mackrell said he would go and sort it out.
He then returned to the club room, he said that he then returned to
his office, re-emerged, met Mr Mackrell again (disputed by the latter).
By this time already aware of major opening (?)                       CHECK T/S
In evidence-in-chief he said it was at this stage he had noticed
the disparity between the filling of the wings compared with the
centre but when challenged with LJT transcript he decided that it
was in fact on his first exiting.
N.B.
It doesn't quite fit in because in LJT he says he met Mackrell halfway )
between players tunnel and Leppings Lane terrace.                     V


He was quite rigorously cross-examined by Mr Payne regarding Sgt.
Higgins and the blue concertina gate, Mr Seaman and his opinion,
he claimed he was aware of the safety certificate but treated the
terrace as a whole (he did make a mistake with numbers on the
safety certificate). He estimated that it was quite common for
between 500 and 600 people to come in late anyway and at least
those sort of numbers (2/3%) not to turn up at all. (He agreed that
19 FEBRUARY 1991

207.   D LOCK (continued...3)

4 to 5,000 people in a capacity crowd only made up about 6% of
capacity). He agreed that in his days there wasn't really a problem
because he didn't have capacity matches but he would have been
satisfied that, provided it was an all-ticket match, capacity would
not have been exceeded. Density on the terraces would be measured
by sight, he could tell the difference between a full and a half-
empty bottle, he was not an engineer, never had been, had never
gone through the Green Guide in detail, had not appreciated that
packing, densities, were dependent upon various factors. He accepted
that prior to the event the ground was safe for its stated capacity,
that the emergency evacuation could be made, had no previous need to
open exit gates lik¥~on that day, nor had anything ever happened that
would have caused him to believe that such a disaster could occur.

Observation that centre pens more popular very important because of
lack of signing in mtunnel location. In addition radial gates and
general supervision of people who might not know what is good for
them. Witness said that latitude could be allowed whilst filling up
but intervention was needed if pens appeared to become uncomfortable.

Care required to avoid overcrowding but he agreed that it was necessary
to have some i d e a b e f o r e h a n d how one was going to control the filling
and the need to shut off the tunnel. He also agreed that a sign of
problems might b e _d i sp a H ^ y ~ i i r T i 1 T T ng . He was takenthrough LJT
P57 - 59, agreed that he probably assessed the pen on first visit
to the pitch.
N.B.
Very difficult to reconcile because of his evidence re Mr Mackrell ,
also in LJT he says that he met Mackrell halfway down the pitch.
In any event seems reasonable clear from his evidence to me and also
Mr Russel that he was out on the pitch after the players were on the
field, as he remembered Mr Clough coming out.            fr-Ztf pg*.

He confirmed that in 1983 or so when kick-off was postponed, fans
exhibited anxiety by pushing and shoving and the arrival of late
fans could be anticipated. No recollection of Inspector Darling.


CROSS-EXAMINED BY MR TOULSON. Confirmed that barrier 144 had caused
problems. Agreed trhat he had never had any problems. Assessment
of centre pens pased on visual reports from officers, comparison of
wing pens and knowledge of how many fans still to come. Shown
some photographs of 1988, showing even distribution and POs at back
of terrace.
N.B
Match in play for this. He said that was where they would have been
positioned and hw now said that when gates were locked open they were
not actually on the radial gates.


Mr Russell, on cross-examination, demonstrated by comparing C449
with C490 (1988 and 1989 matches) that the view from the control
box was not that dissimilar and also matched what the Kop looked like
at 14.35, i.e. differential filling, emptier at the edges than the
middle (C492).


Mrs McBrien sought to establish that fans would not normally be allowed
in through gates but on the one occasion when he did do it, it waS
only about 100 and their tickets were checked. The witness said
crowd control was joint effort and that he had passed messages re
capacities to PC R y a n . He would not condone ticketless fans coming
in generally as the capacity could be exceeded but did say in reply
to someone else that the club's capacity had been at one stage 70,000
and that this had been reduced for safety reasons, which might be
connected with, i.e. egress or ingress routes. Was unable to help her
on segregation of ticketless fans from others as he had never done it.
Didn't think temporary barriers across tunnel presented a hazard.
Mr Russell examined him regarding meeting Supt Greenwood some time
before 2 pm. He had no recollection of meeting him again although
apparently he is seen on video next to him but he did see him run
on the field to stop the match.   He remembered a discussion re Police

horses at the players entrance and something about Brian Clough. He
didn't recollect any problems w h ic h had occurred at the Spion Kop
in 198ft. He confirmed that he had only been on the pitch about one
minute prior to Mr Clough coming out, which was timed at 14.59. He
agreed that having seen the gate open he wqs making his way to Gate C
but undertook several activities which appeared to have taken him
between 14.48 and 14.57 approx, based upon Mr Clough's exi+inn
N.B.
One wonders whethere he was that anxious at that stage.


CROSS-EXAMINED BY MR HALE.
He agreed with him that systems evolved at the time when he was in
the control room he had no foresight of what was going to happen and
he dealt with other matters as he thought necessary. He agreed that
in his experience as commander he had never had any particular problems
and the experience that the 1989 commander had was quite different
to his. On the day in question he didn't think there was any danger .
to life and this was illustrated by the fact that when he came out    I
the second time and looked across, despite knowing that the gates
had been opened, the apparent disparity on the terraces which he had I
seen and the available space, his first impression was that he was     \
observing a pitch invasion or a fight and was not alarmed by it.        |


CROSS EXAMINED BY MR ISAACS.
Mr Isaacs established that when he took over as commander he received
a lot of invaluable help from Mr Harold and Mr Chapman as well as
inheriting a good team of officers. He confirmed that he thought
it would have been rather difficult to get to grips and certainly           J
would have taken several matches. He also agreed that problems
presented differently when viewed in an empty stadium as opposed to
a full one, i.e. difficulties with radial gates and need to close off
the tunnel would not be immediately apparent unless told or supported,
i.e. one would have to rely on others. The sequential filling method
was briefly discussed and he agreed it would have been his responsibility
to take the decision. Finding ones own level was then postulated, i.e.
terrace dedicated to away fans, fans would be allowed to fill but
pens would be closed off direction of control.   Nothing in the order
19 FEBRUARY 1991

207 D LOCK (continued     6)

to specifically monitor for overcrowding but confirmed that both he
and Creaser & Sykes would be able to check position, consult aS
necessary, take decision re barriering the tunnel, or even do it
on own initiative. He had attempted to try to run the matches with
officers who were used to the ground as this would ensure that they
would have mthe experience and also they would know about it because
they would have been told. He agreed that he would expect his
Inspectors to either consult with him or at least tell him what they
were doing but also would expect them to act on their own initiative.
He agreed that if the operational order made no reference to i.e.
sealing the mtunnel and this information had not been conveyed to
him, Mr Duckenfield would need to be on notice and would have to
rely on his support. He agreed that assessment of risk depended
upon    :■ experience and that if a person had not received help and
guidance from others, had no major match experience, not aware that
radial gates would become obscure because he had not seen it, not
aware of difficulty of movement within pen (not used to assisting
large crowds), not aware of arrangements re tunnel, he would be in
an invidious situation.


MR MANNING CROSS EXAMINED.
He confirmed that he had not been aware of anything untoward until
Gate C opened first time, although he could not remember how many
times he had been on the pitch (at LJT he had said 3/4 times),
before then he would have had opportunity to look at the terracing
when on the pitch and nothing he had seen had given him cause for
concern. He also agreed that the further a person was away from
the normal controller location in the box, the harder it was to
see the terracing. He agreed that the activity in the control room
was a "frenzy" and would have to deal with routine matters as well
as dealing with accidents which occurred, exclusion of fans, public
order matters away from the ground, lost children, people in wrong
areas etc. Main reliance on radio, communication very important.
He agreed that if he had noticed anything untwoard, either from the
screens, or the numbers entering or when he was on the pitch, he
would have done something about it on that day.
19 FEBRUARY 1991

207.   D LOCK (continued...7)

He confirmed that Mr Mole had considerable experience and he was
confident in his abilities. He agreed that the system which he
had left was tried and tested and one would not abandon a winning
format without good cause. He agreed that the first duty drummed
into the POs was that their duty is to safeguard life and property
and that would in his view be in the forefront of their minds.
He confirmed that at 14.48 when he noted that there were 4,500 gaps
at the Liverpool end, this did not present itself as an emergency.
He also agreed with Mr Catchpole that the fences had been put in
not only for segregation but also to control laterial movement and
help with crowd control, that he had expected the system to operate
as in the past and that the system had law and order and safety aspects
incorporated which would have been hammered into the officers.
DAY 52
18 FEBRUARY 1991

206. 6 MACKRELL (continued...3)

He then spent a considerable amount of time going through the Green
Guide (C382). He agreed that the Green Guide was used as guidance.
He was referred to Para 29, said that because the ground had a known
capacity at alt al 1 -ticket match, it wasn't anticipated there would
be any specific problems, therefore no need for contingency plans.
He confirmed t_hat in 1987 Sharon Lane had enquired of Dr Eastwood
whether the capacity at Leppings Lane was OK. Mr Strange thought
it should be adjusted but Dr Eastwopd advised that provided gates
remained open there was no need to adjust. He agreed that as far
as the club was concerned, the terracing was treated as one section
of the ground and that spectators could pass from one section to              e
another and indeed had to because of toilets and refreshment           •*
facilities. He agreed that the configuration had never been challenged
                                                                          LJ
and had appeared to him to be perfectly safe, that there was sufficient c<f >   ^
means of escape and that all the parties involved also so believed,
that he was responsible for the stewarding aspects.


Para 96 of the Green Guide was put to him, i.e. gangways/exit doors,
12 metre rule. It was put to him that as there were no gangways
it meant that an exit had to be within 12 metres. He said he wasn't
aware of this until after the disaster, as far as he was concerned
the officers' working party have major input to this and they were
happy with the configuration. Dr Eastwood, in the safety certificate,
would have considered it as part of an overview (contrast this with
Mr S e a m a n 1s opinion on the 12 metre rule, that it didn't apply at all).


Para 62 re tunnel gates. As far as he was concerned he knew that
they opened the wrong way but as they would always be in the open
position when the ground was in use, he did not see this as a major
problem, they would not be padlocked back but bolted down and
certainly would not have approved if he knew that they had been shut
on filled terraces.

                                                  SAFETY OFFICER
     Mr Mackrell basically confirmed that he was Chief Executive and
     Safety Officer, with Mr Lock reporting to him. When he took over
     in December 1986, Leppings Lane configuration was as now, that he
     checked with Dr Eastwood whether the safety certificate was correct,
     that he was not aware that alterations had been made to that end
     until after the disaster, that he had not been aware of the 1981
     problems, that he would expect the police to decide on the method
     of policing outside the ground and that he would not interfere with
     that, that he would not normally have stewards outside but that he
     did have stewards on the inside whose primary task was to be
     available in emergency, guide people up to the stands and answer
     questions from people and direct them. He said he was not aware
     of any system of sealing up the tunnel but did agree that in
     small matches pens were filled serially from Pen 1 and 2 forward
     and that therefore people would have to be directed, but never envisaged
     this as a problem because, by definition, there were fewer numbers.


     As far as the semi-finals were concerned, in 1987 and 1988 all tickets
     had been sold but as is common a small percentage, 2 or 3 percent
     did not normally turn up. The game went off completely smoothly,
     there were no problems that he was aware of, no difficulty in getting
     people through the turnstiles, exactly the same numbers having been
     allocated in those two years as in 1989.   He was asked about the
     Manchester United match in February. Said he could not remember it
     but he was not aware of any match in 1989 where any significant
     difficulties had occurred at Leppings Lane (other than the semi-final).

     I asked him whether he would agree that the allocation of turnstiles
     and throughput was a matter for the club. He said in 1987 there had
     been a discussion with Supt Mole who for segregation purposes only
     wanted the Leppings Lane terraces used. They had all come to the
     conclusion that, given that the turnstiles opened at 12 noon, it
     was perfectly possible to get the people in and indeed it had
     happened without any difficulty in 1987 and 1988. He also confirmed
     that his experience was that at semi-finals people tended to arrive

18 FEBRUARY 1991

206.   6 MACKRELL (conti nued...4)

He agreed that stewarding on the terrace wasn't done because (a) there
were no gangways and (b) there was some anxiety about putting stewards
there, so the issue never actually arose. He also apparently knew
that POs would not normally go on the terrace but it did depend upon
the conduct of the fans, i.e. whether unruly or not.


He was taken through a number of letters, in particular one from South
Yorks, C484, regarding segregation and he agreed that in the end this
wasn't done because of the Bradford fire.   He also agreed (C485) that
the Football Association in a circular had specifically stated that
segregation should be by barriers and that reliance on POs should be
exceptional and that therefore to have officers on the gates at the
back would not have fitted in with that directive. He was taken
through some correspondence with Mr Kirby about exploding bolts which
was submitted to Dr Eastwood and rejected as being dangerous.
He had, when he was at the player's tunnel for 2/3 minutes, generally
looked around the ground and seen nothing unusual.


CROSS-EXAMINED BY MR ISAACS. He agreed that the Police had inserted
in the programmes a request to Liverpool fans to arrive early, in
fact 11 am. He was then cross-examined at length by Mr King. He
agreed that the ticket only required people to take up their position
15 minutes before kick-off. He agreed that he understood the Police
were responsible for policing away from the ground and that the
allocation of turnstiles had been agreed with Supt Mole. He agreed
that the major experience of large crowds was 1987/88/89 but the
number of turnstiles for those matches was in fact less than normally
would be used and that on the basis that seven turnstiles were
available, he agreed that about one quarter of the total would be
able to get inj^half an hour and therefore three quarters had to be
in before 2.30, otherwise there would be trouble getting everyone in
on time. Agreed that the clubroom had a computer and that there was
communication with the Police.

206.     6 MACKRELL (continued...5)

He agreed that the club had left crowd control on the terraces to the
Police and that this was an understanding which he had inherited.
There was no directive to stewards for directing people in the concourse 1)
although he would expect them to do so. As far as he was aware the
Police would do the directing in the concourse area. He was not aware
of the tunnel gates being shut ini988 but agreed that such an action
might well have been consistent with what he would have expected the
Police to do.
N.B.
This is not in his evidence but it is for me. If that is so and if
the operational orders for the two years is the same, then is it in
fact not so much a failure t5)r control but a failure on the concourse.


He was asked quite a lot of opinion evidence on what was obvious on
the assumption that direction had not taken place and that the main
route was in through the tunnel, that the radial gates were difficult
to see and on the assumption that exit through the tunnel would be
blocked by continual ingress. On those assumptions he agreed that
overcrowding could occur and would have been obvious pre-match.
N.B.
It would have been obvious if questions being asked of oneself had
been in the form in which they were put by Mr King. Was it obvious
that in 1989 those questions in fact had to be asked?

He was asked about contingency planning and said that apart from
the fact that this was an all-ticket match, no additional plans
were made because exceptional numbers could not be anticipated.
N.B.
I just wonder whether notices in the programmes and the earlier    ^
opening of turnstiles are not in fact contingency plans.


He was asked to look at C326A, photographed at 14.59, he said he wasn't
there at that time. He was asked to look at Pen 6 which appears
relatively empty. He was asked whether he noticed it and whether in
his opinion if someone was monitoring the ground and saw that, they
would not have realised that even distribution had not been achieved.

DAY 52

206. G MACKRELL (continued...6)

N . B . Even distribution is difficult, bearing in mind that the centre
pens are more popular, that people might not be willing to move and
in any event it is totally impractical to evenly distribute everyone
in the terrace at every point in time.


Mrs Sinclair established that Eastwoods were consulted and advised
when required. Mrs McBrien obtained confirmation that unauthorised
entry was contrary to the Green Guide Section 45, She also obtained
confirmation that if an exit route was blocked , . one had to take
that into account when working out capacity. She asked whether the
radial gates were under Police control and this was confirmed.
Mrs McBrien asked a lot of questions about the Green Guide. Mr Mackrell
indicated that planning for emergencies lay with Officers Working
Party or advisory group. He agreed that he would not have been
consulted on operational matters nor would have expected to, even
on important ones. He agreed that theoretically 23,000 people
could have been admitted in an hour and that therefore within the last
hour all but a handful should have got through, in optimum conditions.

Mr Russell asked him to confirm that there was a segregated area at
the Kop but he couldn't remember. Re problems in 1988, he was asked
to view another photo, C449, which gave a different perspective.

CROSS-EXAMINED BY MR pSyfBiS, he agreed that the terrace was treated
as a whole because of the radial gates and the tunnel, that on the
day he agreed he had not gone through in logical order the issues
raised by Mr King and that he had thought about safety matters and
that on that day prior to the incident and indeed earlier, he had
not been concerned about any risk.
Further CROSS-EXAMINED BY MR CATCHPOLE, plans in 1985 had been designed
for segregation purposes and only posponed because of the Bradford
fire. He agreed that the whole of the ground, taken altogether, was
satisfactory and he felt that the Police could handle even distribution,
as they had done since 1985.

He agreed that if there was an excess number outside, the main problem
that he envisaged was that some fans would not see the match.
I re-examined him on distribution, he agreed that the Green Guide
provided for different numbers (27 or 54) and that simple proximity
was not the sole criteria. He also agreed that even distribution
did not mean that each person had to be spaced out, as this would not
be practical, but that the time may come when some action may be
required. He was asked about dedicated stewards in the concourse
area to deal with direction and he confirmed there were none, he
was not aware that there were any dedicated POs either but relied
on the Police to effectively do this. Confirmed that in a normal
situation the gates were not open, there was no problem.

Positionat at Kop end opposite corner to SYMAS. Perambulated ground
at about 14.45, definitely Nil of note at Leppings Lane, in fact
conversed with two girls in Pen 4 who said he would not be needed.
Returned to his position, told by Sgt that match would be postponed,
walked towards his colleague on centre Kop, told him, returned to
position, players came out onto pitch. After that he was unsure
about what was happening on pitch, noticed after a while what looked
like a pitch invasion initially. Realised it wasn't typical,
noticed his colleagues moving towards centre pens and started
making his way down. Had received no radio communication from his
colleagues. Once at pen he realised seriousness of situation,
climbed onto fence, signalled to people to move back, saw it was

seek to help people that w a v . He said that he had noticed that the
whole of the West end terracing and stands seemed to fill suddenly,
around kick-off time. Challenged with statement before LJT where,
after some hesitation, he said this was before players came on      '
pitch. Re-examined by Mrs McBrien, confirmed that     was jiroun3
kick-off time, he said at least twice around kick-off, at least
 -—           -    -n


twice before players came on pitch, and whichever way you look at
it, it may be that it was within a relatively few minutes of kick-off
whatever he saw. He agreed with Mr Payne that ^
was the same as LJT. In 1988 the fans had come in in a normal manner
and there wasn't a marked difference between the pens. He was
surprised that the Liverpool end was so empty, even at 14.15, as
he would have expected them to be there and therefore assumed that
they were late for some reason. He said there was a sudden influx
of fans into all areas.

He attended the match with three other colleagues in an official
capacity, at Spi'on Kop end at 14.45, had noticed nothing of moment
until about 15.03 when he could see some disturbance at Leppinqs
         1,

Pens 3 and 4. Saw people who were winded but didn't need their
intervention, did not really appreciate there w a s any danger until
after the match had st.nppprL whpn his attention was drawn to a lad
with an injured foot. It was after that he became aware of the
seriousness of the situation.
He was shown photo 15.01, said that was in line with what was in
his mind's eye but when shown 15.03 in some ways that was more like
he thought it was but it didn't fit in with his visual image. He said
he couldn't see many seriously injured people on the 15.03 photo.

203.    EX S6T. HIGGINS

Not the best witness. His evidence re 1988 was confused initially
about the operational order duties and seemed to think his assignment
was solely the tunnel which in the end agreed was Phase 2.
As far as he was aware the gates of the tunnel were used to prevent
ingress at matches. He thought he had policed several semi-finals
but not the match in 1981. He agreed in the end that his understanding
was that semi-finals and league matches were much of a muchness,
apart from more people at semi-finals. He insisted he received
instructions from someone (control room or omewhere else) to close
the gates in 1988, he could not remember from whom or at what time
or for how long, he said they were manned on the inside by two
officers from serial. It was put to him that no officers remember
doing this, he said he was surprised, agreed that he had not mentioned
the closing of the gate on the debrief as he didn't think it was
necessary at the time because it was a routine thing to do. Could
not remember whether mthe gates had been padlocked back before they
were shut.


The only points of any moment are:
(a) he confirms that the gates were shut in 1988;
(b) he does not know when or for how long;
(c) he accepted that it was reasonable for a commander to expect
    his staff in the position he was in to do what was necessary
    for the safety of the crowd;
(d)    there was no difference as far as he was concerned between
       league and semi-final matches.

Took his seat at 2.25, South stand, had noticed that the Nottingham
area was full, Leppings Lane centre sections fairly full, side pens
sparse, had a powerful pair of binnoculars which he used regularly.
From 14.45 became concerned about situation at Leppings Lane end.
Agreed that 14.45 was an estimate, could have been 2, 3, 4 minutes
later. Agreed he had seen people standing on shoulders, did not
remember team announcement, remembered beach ball w hen asked but
could not relate it to events. Unable specifically to relate events
to play. Stated that things suddenly got worse at a particular point.
Shown photographs timed at 14.46, (C477/478) and agreed that these
did not show t h a _scenes which had-concerned him, he was more
interested in the triangle between Pen 2 and Pen 3 gate. Had seen
no surges. When asked if he was surprised that people found the
situation acceptable at 14.45 he was to a certain extent but certainly
by 14.55 he could not imagine anyone finding it acceptable. He had
noticed people who appeared distressed and some youngsters were
turning sideways on in order to see what was going on.
N.B.
I suspect that his timing is a little out bearing in mind other
evidence and that he is describing events from perhaps just before
team came onto the pitch. That is for you to decide.

201. A K SEAMEN                                              ASST CHIEF FIRE OFFICER

Gave evidence not from his knowledge but from his study of the files
and conversations with other fire officers. There were three
aspects I was interested in:

1)   The means of escape in 1979, i.e. the tunnel and the wing exits.
     He confirmed that the fire service were concerned with escape
     but they calculated a maximum number permissable in a space
     based on that and the figures in the Green Guide, that the
     means of escape in the terracing based on the stated capacity
     calculated by Eastwood was in excess of requirement and the
     terrace could be evaculated in about 5| minutes.
     In 1981/85 radial fences were inserted. These had gates at
     the back. The fire services had recalculated egress time
     using these gates as a secondary means of escape and were
     satisfied that they were adequate provided they were manned
     so that people could be directed through tFiem in the event
     of an emergency. He said they would never have agreed other­
     wise. He agreed with me that although they felt the radial
     gates had to be manned, they did not consider that the tunnel
     had to be because that was a normal entry and exit route and
               w e"   '   '   i   j   i— ...   i   i   i—   I.— ..— i   _ . T ..ju   i   .— — -


     therefore known to the people on the terrace. He also agreed
     with me that if neither of these routes were blocked then the
     evacuation time would have been halved approximately, assuming
     that all available routes were used. He also agreed that the
     perimeter track gates were never used in their computations.
     They were there to facilitate Police entry and exit and could
     be used for localised problems but they never contemplated
     that mass evacuation could take place through them. He also
     said that all their assumptions had been that the loading of   ]
     the terraces would have been by conventional turnstile method. /

2)   I then discussed with him the provision of gates lower down
     in the radial fences., He drew my attention to the fact that
     this had actually been proposed at one point. Eastwood had
     objected and had accused the fire service of it, they had not
     needed them and whilst they would not have objected to their
     installation they could see no necessity and when it was dropped
     they were quite content.

    201. A K SEAMEN (continued...2)

    3)   I discussed with him the 12 metre rule. He said this only
         applied where there were gangways and, as it had been decided
         that this particular terrace did not require gangways, it had
         no application. He didn't mean that people had to be within
         12 metres of an exit.


    4)   I tried to get out of him what he thought about risks of having
         gates in the front but he dod not in fact make any helpful
         co mm e n t .

I   5)   I asked him what he thought about closing the blue tunnel gates
         against the crowd. He said as far as they were concerned,
         these gates were supposed to be locked open with padlocks,
         but if they were closed, i.e. to prevent more people entering
         then he thought it would be safe provided they were manned
         as the people operating the gates could be communicated with
         before the people exiting from the terrace reached the gates.
         He instanced that perimeter gates as such were in the same
         situation, but of course these are in the open air whereas
         the tunnel is an enclosed space.


    Even if he is absolutely right about the manning of the   radial gates,
    the primary means of escape was always considered to be   the tunnel.
S
    In the events which happened on 15 April the tunnel was   not obstructed
    by fire or other disaster, apart from people going down   of course,
    and even on his construction, would not have had to be policed or
    stewarded. It should therefore have been possible to evacuate the
    pen within five minutes, provided that the people within the pen
    realised that an evacuation situation had occurred.

    Cross-examination by Mr Maxwell
    He agreed with Mr Maxwell that the Green Guide only required reasonable
    degrees of safety, that there was always a balancing of risk, that
    they were satisfied that if the arrangements agreed in 1985 had
    applied, the ground would have been reasonably safe and that, although
    they had powers to seek enforcement, the primary and most convenient
    authority would have been the local authority.

He was taken through various sections of the Green Guide by Mr Payne
as well as a drawing by Dr Eastwoo           ich showed an alternative
method of controlling entry. Spen            time on the question of
the manning of the lateral fence gates. Insisted that whatever the
documentation might say about Poli             ;he fire service had
understood it to mean that the gates would Q e manne ^ - ^ When pressed
he said this was necessary so that in an emergency they could be
unlocked if locked, and that an officer bv waving, or other indication
could direct people.                                        appropriate announce-
ments over the PA system. He agreed that the tunnel did not have
to be manned. He was shown photographs of packing and agreed that
there would always be some difficulty for people at a distance to
get to the gates but that if capacity wasn't over-exceeded there
would always be ease of movement. When pressed on capacity he
agreed that no specific numbers had been allocated and that one would
have to rely on visual assessment. When pressed on how exit routes
had been calculated after penning, he said as far as they were
concerned it made no difference. When pressed on the tunnel gates .
he said he didn't think it mattered that they opened the wrong way
nor did he think from a fire point of view in closing them, because
it should be possible to get the message to people to open them before
the crowd spilled out. He told M p ^ K f n g t h a t ^ i s far as they were
concerned the Police had givp-n a s s s u r a n c ^ t n a t they could control
flow into the pens and that (the r a d r p ^ f e n c e s would enhance crowd
control. He agreed that the radial gates were not obvious to people
and it was necessary to be careful about the number of people allowed
into the pen and that even distribution should be effected as far as
possible. (N.B. All this not really within his competance).
He again confirmed that it had never been in their contemplation
that a mass evacuation would occur through the perimeter fence gates,
these were for localised events and Police use. He agreed that even
if there were no radial fences, localised overcrowding/crushing could
occur and that turnstiles would slow individuals and assist with
distribution. The PA system was part of the evacuation procedure
and necessary to direct people to tunnel or radial gates.

N.B. CHECK MR FOSTER'S CROSS-EXAMINATION.
 DAY 50
14 FEBRUARY 1991

201. A K SEAMAN (continued...4)

In a nutshell, Mr Seaman's evidence was that crushing could occur even
on an open terrace, that once radial fences were installed, fire
service required a secondary means of escape which took the form of
radial gates but that they wanted these manned, but the primary means
of escape was always considered to be the tunnel, which did not require
manning; that the perimeter gates were never included in calculations
and not intended for mass evacuation, although they could be used for
people to get out in small numbers. He considered the terrace ssj e
if used on this basis and subsequently added that evacuation procedures
would be activated by appropriate signals through t\
On this day, even if he is absolutely right about trKe^riianning, it
was not relevant because the tunnel was not obstructed by fire or
bomb etc and that did not require manning. A primary means of escape
was therefore available. It was perhaps obstructed to a greater or
lesser extent by people and of course no PA announcements regarding
evacuation were made.


He gave some surprising answers, in particular his explanation of
the need for POs to man the radial gates on the one hand and his
assertion that he considered closing the inward-opening tunnel gates
against the crowd to be safe, simply based on the argument that
messages re emergency evacuation would get to the tunnel gate operators
before egress of the crowd, a very unsafe premise in the light of the
events at Hillsborough. He would not be drawn on the location aspect
of the radial gates, whether or not one can rely on visual, tannoy
or other means of communcation to turn a forward-facing crowd intent
on watching a game and which is not specifically aware of danger to
itself from, say, fire.

200.     S ELLIS                           FREELANCE PHOTOGRAPHER

He located himself near Gate 5 in front of the advertising hoarding
on the perimeter track.   He was a little in advance of an officer
he identified as John Illingworth.   He arrived between 14.50 and
15.00. He t m W c e c h t h e relative emptiness of side pens and commented
on this t<jf John^IJlingworth but didn't think the officer heard him.
He then bustled about getting ready. He didn't notice Lycett or
Dickinson. His evidence was confused, it seems to be that at around
kick-off he could hear noises from the pen including screams and
indeed he looked round and saw two girls pressed against the fence
and screaming. He could see people clambering over and his recollection
is that initially PC Illingworth and possibly others were pushing and
or signalling people to get back into the pen. He didn't find that
surprising, on the contrary, he was surprised that more officers had
not turned up to assist to prevent people spilling onto the track.
On the other hand he said that the cries were unusual and that he
had realised something wasn't right when he heard them. He seemed
to reconcile his position by saying that the people who came over
the fence appeared perfectly OK to him except for one lad who vomited
gnd he called the St Johns Ambulance man over. He agreed that the
centre pens hadn't looked worrying. What surprised him was that for
a semi-final the wings still had space and he assumed it must mean
that a train had been delayed. Said he did not realise that a disaster
had occurred until definitely aft-pr t-hp piayprs had left the pitch.
In fact he moved himself and his equipment towards the North stand,
he wanted to safeguard it. He said that despite his proximity to
the gates he had not noticed them being opened. He was shown a series
of photographs including C472/C473 which indicated some movement of
fans and the gates but he seems to have no recollection of any of
this. The only thing he did remember was that he looked at Gate 5, it
was closed but he thought this was after kick-off. He agreed that
his attention was momentary and he could not tell the full extent of
Illingworth's activities (quite apart from having* his name wrong).
N.B.
Illingworth's name is David Alfred, not John, so who knows whom he
has identified.

199. S TRACEY                             SUPPORTER   TICKETLESS

He came by train, arrived station 12.45. He did not have a ticket,
got to ground about 1.15. His evidence was that there were enormous
numbers of people without tickets trying to get them at that time.
He also confirmed that he observed POs advising fans without tickets
to move away but that they didn't do so. He spent a good bit of time
perambulating the ground, together with his friend Martin but was
unsuccessful. Eventually he was back at Leppings Lane outside the
perimeter gates when a crowd surge occurred which carried him up
to the tunnel entrance. He didn't recollect going through a big
gate or indeed anything else, he said that he was knocked off his
feet and that it would have been possible to step out of the crowd
if he had wanted to but he did not, he wanted to get in. Once at
the tunnel it was full and he had to shuffle down (MR McMAHON PLUS 1)


Got onto the terrace, Pen 3, players definitely on the pitch, not
entirely sure whether they were playing. Going down tunnel, about
half-way down a further surge occurred which took him onto the
terracing. Whilst there he heard a loud crack but couldn't relate
it to anything in particular. He managed to get further forward
and climbed over the perimeter fencing. He had not seen the gate
open but once he had recovered on the pitch-side he did see it and
then assisted with the rescue.
13 FEBRUARY 1991

198. A ATKINS                             ASSOCIATED WITH P MACDONALD

He arrived with some friends, including Peter MacDonald deceased,
at 11 am. Leppings Lane he said 14.45, having spent some time in
pubs, he said he had four pints (there were 15 of them together
initially). At Leppings Lane the perimeter gates were closed, he
was in a crush outside perimeter gate t o such an extent that he was
having difficulty breathing. He could see a PO pulling people over
the turnstile roof, there was an officer allowing a few people
through the perimeter gate at the time. Eventually they got into
the turnstile area buw t the crush was just as bad. He and his
friends climbed over the dividing wall into turnstiles 1 - 16 and
then managed to get through those turnstiles. He said the match
had not yet kicked-off at that point. Although they had terrace
tickets they tried to get up into the stands. Peter MacDonald
was ahead of them and had managed to get through but he and the
others were stopped. Peter came down towards them and he thought
a PO then checked his ticket. In the meantime he and his friends had
managed to run up the stairs with another crowd and he got into the
stand just as Beardsley hit the crossbar. He said he last saw Peter
about three minutes prior to that, on the stairs leading to the West
stand, the staircase being behind turnstiles 1 - 16. Peter must
therefore have traversed the concourse area, gone through the hole
in the wall and down tunnel, and unfortunately died at some time
after the match was already in play. He had said he was sitting at
the back on the low wall in the stands and that from there he could
not see the terracing, all he could see was the tops of the fences.
He confirmed to Mr Catchpole that despite the fact that he had been
advised that he could not go up into the stands, he nevertheless
took the opportunity to do so. Mrs McBrien enquired whether he was
further checked upstairs by POs (bearing in mind the time, the
incident which was developing and numbers, this seems to indicate
unrealistic expectation of checking in connection with some element
of determination).

Travelled by coach, ! Ishford Coaches from Wellingborough, departed
10.30, arrived 1.30, coach he did not think was searched. Leppings
Lane 1.50, in ground 2 pm, had no problems, went to the right, Pen 3,
everything OK, he was with quite a number of friends, about four, he
was immediately behind goal. At about 14.20 experienced surges in
his position, didn't like it, noticed that there was more space and
it was quieter more to the right in his pen and moved there with
some of his friends (one remained behind). After about 15 minutes or
so,          the pen got fuller and surging began again. He then
decided to get out into Pen 2 for his own safety he said. He took
up a position between Pen 2 and Pen 3 near the front. Some time later
his friend also joined them and said he had some difficulty in making
his way across towards the fence. He climbed over the fence because
that was the most convenient thing to do. Hadn't really thought
about gates but it seemed that he was aware from other remarks that
radial fences might have gates at the back. The overall impression
was that the pressure effects that he was experiencing in the pen,
certainly initially, were localised and in a microcosm illustrated
the differences in different densities, within one pen.

196.     I FEARNS                         SUPPORTER

Travelled by train, arrived 11.45, met Paul Carlisle on coach to
ground, Paul left them at 1 pm to try to change his terrace ticket
for a stand ticket. He said that although Paul hadn't really admitted
it, he was nervous of standing on terraces. He did say that one of
the reasons for going to the centre was that they had arranged with
Paul that if they didn't meet up and he didn't change his ticket,
they would meet behind the goal. He entered through the turnstiles
and was with four other friends including Carl Lewis. Carl had a
ticket for the stands but for some reason no longer had his stub
and therefore had to enter the terrace with them. They went through
the tunnel into Pen 3. Up to 14.45 nothing out of the ordinary,
some time after that, 14.50-54 a big surge came. He was adamant
that this was before the players came onto the pitch. He was also
adamant that he had seen Gate 3 open before the big surge, didn't
know how, only open for a moment, nobody managed to get out and
Police shut it. He did not see the gate after that. He was familiar
with the ground but wanted to go behind the goal for reasons stated
above.

195.   P EDWARDS                                   SUPPORTER

Arrived by car 12 noon, couple of pints, Leppings Lane about 2.25,
described condition in turnstile area as being "panic-stricken" for
himself and others, frightened of being c rushed into the wal 1 .
Entered through turnstile, didn't see a gate open, went down tunnel
which was clear. Had been before in 1980, remembered ground but on
the day had forgotten that it was possible to get round sides. Said
that in 1980 tunnel was in fact blocked off. Four of them went down
tunnel, entered Pen 4, very packed, moved to the left, players not
yet out, this was about 14.50, heard cheers when players being
announced as he was making his way across. Concerned for his
safety, gradually got worse, expected it to get more packed as
kick-off approached, worried because he realised that there were
more people outside and he assumed they would all be coming in
behind him. Pressure constant but felt surge around kick-off time.
Only saw one player, goalkeeper, several surges, big surge at kick-off,
went forward with no return. Fairly near the back, could see all people
below him except those immediately against fence and they seemed in a
worse condition. Saw gate open and shut, did not notice POs. Would
have been able to get out of the tunnel by turning round but once on
the terrace it would have been very difficult. Agreed with Mr
Catchpole that tunnel was most direct route, that he would not have
looked around for alternatives. In 1980 says two central gates were
blocking tunnel, not told why, went around side, having got round
went towards centre, very crowded at centre than at wings, positioned
himself near the fence because he was worried about how packed it was
in the centre. He said a wide part of the central area was packed.

Mr Sweeney came by train, arrived 12.05, went to Sheffield United
ground, had a couple of pints, got a lift to Leppings Lane, had to
walk to ground, arrived Leppings Lane 2.40, entered 2.50 (although
he didn't look at his watch, he seemed determined that his timings
were right). He went down tunnel, no problems, went left, Pen 4,
took up match-viewing position, was able to look at his programme
and although congested did not consider it to be unusual for the
type of match at that time. He thought it was about 2.55 (caveat
on time), he said he couldn't remember players coming out nor any
of the match. He recollects that there was a surge which carried
him forward, became very packed, he was panicking, he thought he
was dying, he managed to      climb onto the barrier where he had a
bird's eye view.    Saw PO    outside,shouted   towards him but hedid
not appear to take any notice. He had been facing the wrong way
before he climbed onto barrier. Did not see the gate open but once
it was open some space appeared and he was able to get out.   He did
not see Sgt Swift. He said quite freely that he panicked.
(Map Ref. C461).
I put to him the part of his statement at bottom of Page 2. He said
it wasn't right, it hadn't been written by him and it put the wrong
slant, but when I actually took   him through it, everything he had
told me was exactly as in the statement, apart from he said in the
statement that it was as       the players came out that itbecame more
packed and seemed to be a larqe surge and he had momentarily seen
the ball kicked. He now said that was not the case.

In 1988 he seemed to recollect that tickets were checked distant from
the ground but could not remember what time he came, he said 2 -ish,
which he then interpreted as meaning any time up to 2.40, and he
also said there were POs in the concourse area who were signalling
to people not to go down tunnel, he didn't remember the gates being
shut.

                                            LIVERPOOL SUPPORTER

Travelled by Amferline coach, departed 10.30, arrived 2.00 pm., checked
for alcohol by Police, not for tickets, note that some alcohol was
found on this coach. He went to a pub after arriving, had 1/2 pints (?),
left 14.40, Leppings Lane 14.45. Entered through turnstiles. He
was sure it was kick-off time. He had actually seen a gate open
but didn't check which one, query Gate B in view of his position.
Approached tunnel, said tunnel was full, people wall to wall,
impossible for people to urinate at the side, progressed propelled
by crowd but not worried as this was large match. Said that it was
like automatic flow towards the tunnel with no fanning out, in
contrast to 1988 when he remembers 5 or 6 POs who were directing
people away from the tunnel and thus leading to their dispersal in
the concourse area. Entered terrace, match undoubtedly in play,
progressed about ten steeps down with his friends (4 / 5 ), not
comfortable, went back and took shelter, so to speak, behind brick
tunnel entrance wall. People still entering tunnel. He thinks he
was in second position when Beardsley hit crossbar, wasn't entirely
sure about whether he was told by people around him that that had
happened (he heard a loud roar while still in the tunnel). He said
he helped people up into the stands, he saw POs enter the terracing
between 3 and 5 minutes after he had got to his second position,
Saw almost immediately (one minute) someone being carried out. His
friend went out to help, came back and told him to go out as he
would be of more use out there. He also said that whilst at the back
he had seen at around the same time, i.e. 4/5 minutes after Beardsley
hit the crossbar, a P0 motioning people off the fence and pushing them
off (query touching their hand). He said to Miss Adelman it was
possible to motion with one hand and push people off with the other.

                                             SERIAL 13

Located up on West stand, operational order, directed mainly to law
and order matters, no specific reference to watching for overcrowding
or safety but did not think he needed that, nor did he think his
serial did. At about 2.45 at front of stand, looked at crowd,
appeared to be completely normal as far as he was concerned, happy,
content, good-natured, playing with beach ball etc. He was then
distracted to some problem on his stnad, when he next looked players
were on pitch. After that and probably before kick-off, he noticed
what appeared to him to be like a wedge of people (ref molten lavapO
entering Pen 3 and coming to a stop. There was no gap behind it, in
contrast to the previous swaying which he had noticed. He realised
straight away there was something wrong, tried to radio control x 3
and was unsuccessful because traffic/noise. Tried to signal to
perimeter track officer, eventually attracted the attention of one
on R-H side of the goal (probably opposite Pen 3), officer moved
forward to approach fence. He formed the opinion that the officer
did not understand what Bullas was trying to convey to him. Found
it difficult to explain what it was that gave him that impression
other than the officer seemed merely to approach the fence. His
last glimpse of him was looking into the pen. Mr Bullas decided to
go down to look, left his serial in situ (he would have been wrong
to denude the stand). As he left the stand by the nearest staircase,
he turned round and could see one of the gates open. He then made
his way down into the concourse, taking a few moments (query how long)
He saw a few people coming out, there was no mass police presence
(compare Mr Tissington), he did not see Sgt Morgan and Inspector Sykes
He went down the tunnel, there were POs in it, he advised them to go
forward to get people out. He was definitely not the first officer
in because he saw a WPC bring someone out. His view was at that time
the only physical means possible to relieve pressure - v


He was asked whether he had seen people using the radial fence gates
and he confirmed that he had seen people passing backward and forward
over the period of time when intermittently he had looked down, and
he confirmed that he was aware of the policy of fans finding their
own level. He had agreed at LJT that he knew the pens had capacities,
                                                                /cont.

although it is clear the Safety Certificate does not actually specify
these. It is not clear therefore what the basis of his understanding
is or was. What he was sure about was that he did not know the
numbers. He agreed that assessment of over-capacity depended upon
judgement. Put to him that waiting until people were distressed was
in fact too late.

He also dealt with assisting a youngster of 14 out of the tunnel.

tickets not checked, entered about 1.30, no problems, was in Pen 3,
no particular problems at all, it got fuller as time went on,
remembers seeing Stephen Thompson and Tony Grier behind him, said
hello but did not join them. A bit tight, did not see Tony jumping
off barrier. Reasonably OK until players on pitch, felt two surges
after that, first one relaxed a little, second was much stronger and
didn't relax, carried forward, K made some comment that it was a bit
packed on the first surge. Prior to that time it was like a normal
match, he could see the gate, his recollection is that it was opened
the first time by fans, not sure about people being pushed back,
thinks they escaped, but remembers the police closing gate, thought
it was shut for five minutes but when challenged backed off this time.
Eventually he was pulled over the perimeter fence.

Travelled by car, departed 10.30, stopped in Snake Pass pub, played
his guitar. Arrived Sheffield 2.30, Leppings Lane 2.40 - 2.45.
LANDROVER not seen or heard. Entered through concertina gate, wasn't
quite sure which, thought it must have been Gate C. Was told by some
official not to enter but was carried along with the crowd, he thought
he would get arrested. Commented to his friend that they had got in
without tickets and that this was another Watford. He explained that
he had been to a match at Watford, wasn't quite sure which year, query
1988, when the crowd was let in through a big open gate but in Watford
they had entered very calmly.
He did agree that in the concourse the crowd was not disorderly and in
his view would have responded to being directed away from the tunnel.
On getting to the tunnel he could see players on pitch, he managed to
 get onto the terracing, R-H side, made some reference to the teams
 being announced but was pretty sure that they were on the pitch when
 he was on the terrace. Team announcement was 14.51 and itlooks as if
 he entered after 14.52 so it is unlikely that he would have heard it.
 As far as he was concerned, the tunnel was the only entry. His
 evidence was difficult to follow but it seemed that at kick-off things
 got rather more hectic but he and his friend conversed that they were
 OK. He also mentioned that there were screams and shouts but he did
 note that someone who could shout must be OK, it was t he ones who
 could not shout that were in trouble.
 He says he had been there in 1986 but there were no radial fences then
 (he is wrong), said he did not realise there were fences in 1989, he
 didn't actually get to one but apparently the message was passed across
 that people could not move laterally. Recollects goal being struck,
 remembers one or two people being passed over the railing, couldn t
 get them over and they dropped back.     Said it was quite common for
 people to be passed forward if they fainted. He didn't think gate
 was open after Beardsley hit the crossbar but agreed that he hadn't
 seen it properly and that his timing may be hopelessly out. He did
 hear people shout to push back but also confirmed that he saw POs
 indicate that, he did try but it wasn't possible. Another fan tried
 as well.     He eventually left via tunnel.

189. G HUTT                                      SUPPORTER

Travelled by Amberline coach, departed between 9 and 10 am, arrived
1 pm, uneventful journey, met up with friends, including Chris
Devonside, Gary Church, Simon Bell (all deceased). Entered ground
about 2.40 via T/S. Went down tunnel, clear passage, onto terracing
and took up match-viewing position at about 2.45. No recollection of
beach ball, confirmed that when team came out it was no different to
normal game and this was at initial position from entry time. Would
have been quite content with condition provided no more people
entered pen. Between team coming out and kick-off was moved forward
to second position, at which point he was squashed and had become
separated.
Saw PO at gate, he had the impression that he did not want to open it
because he was shaking his head, did allow a few people out then shut
it again. It then opened once more and he managed to push his way
out. Having rested outside he was then escorted into Pen 2 and from
Pen 2 he could see that the game was still in progress, i.e. he
managed to move from his position quite a long way, exit, rest,
re-position in Pen 2, all between kick-off and before match finished.
That would indicate a very short interval between openings of gate.
In 1988 he had gone with Devonside, not sure about time, thinks about
2.30, blue gates on tunnel firmly shut, no PO or steward seen, entered
Pen 2 and moved through radial fence gates into Pen 3, which he had
found on his own. He confirmed that there was no reason for him to
use those gates in 1989 as he was in the position he wanted to be in.
In any case once he had got to the second position he could not have
used it but might have been able Ito do so from position 1. He
claimed that there were barriers outside concertina gates in 1988 and
that tickets were checked, he had one, he saw nobody    3 without a Cj
ticket. He looked at the photos for 1988, it was put to him that he
might be thinking of the perimeter gates but he did not think so, he
thought they were open.
He said that when taking up their first position, he noticed there
was still some space in the front.

In dressing room about 2.15, remembers two senior officers coming in
and discussing emergency procedures, this was standard practice.
Exited onto pitch about 2.55. Can no longer remember whether photos
were taken first or net inspection. Ran down to look at net, neither
saw nor heard anything unusual but did not really look. Concentrated
then on game. Heard a voice behind him saying there were problems
and the match would have to be stopped. Did not know who had asked,
thought it probably was a PO. Was waiting to attract referee's
attention, ball out of play, was waving his flag when he noticed
officer run onto pitch to referee. Returned to players entrance,
stood around for a while to await developments. Was not really
aware of the seriousness of the situation until very much later. Had
no responsibility for supervision of the crowd and was pre-occupied
with the match.

He was located outside turnstiles 1 - 16, was there until about 2.10.
Until that time had noted that there a few intoximated people who
approached him asking for locations of pubs. He advised them that
if they came back in that state they would not be admitted. In fact
He did not turn anyone away that day and only knew of one other fan.
There were problems with the tickets, Liverpool Kop ticket holders
were coming to him and he had to redirect them. People were confused
with the colour codings and the letterings of the turnstiles. He did
agree with Mr Catchpole that the colour coding etc were visible and
that it was a habit of people to ask for confirmation. He also
agreed with Mr King that at LJT he had said he thought the colour
coding was inadequate. His assessment of the ticketless fans was
that it was not a particularly dramatic problem. He discussed the
arrest of the ticket tout by PC Roberts, the tout had 11 terrace
tickets, 7 Kop tickets, £701 and was selling tickets for £35. They
were all genuine. He only saw one forgery that day. He had
to leave his post at 2 . 1 0 to go the gym to take a complainant, and
on his return at about 2.40 things had deteriorated. He was in A - G
turnstile area, saw Inspector Bennett, first on the ground and then
on the roof. He could hear people crying out in pain, he tried from
the turnstile to signal for people to push back. It_was hopeless.
He estimated a crowd of 4,000, the people in front were crushed.
Initially said couldn't see what was happening at back but later said
they were pushing. As far as he was concerned it was an unprecedented
unique situation and an emergency. Mr King established therfapart
from the 1987 semi-final which was a Sunday match and where the kick-off
was postponed, he could not remember details of capacity crowds and
although the witness said he had had many years of experience, Mr King
put it to him that he wasn't comparing like with like, as this was a
larger anticipated crowd. Mr King took him through the number of
turnstiles and throughput, suggested that the numbers could not
conveniently be coped with. He also suggested that the mere presence     j
of an excessive number of people in an area could create overcrowding
and danger. Mr Morgan refuted this on the basis ^iat people had to
push in but in the end said that sheer numbers.might be sufficient.

  187.   PS J MORGAN (continued...)

 On cross-examination by Mr Catchpole, he backed off.
 N.B.
 This is an interesting argument but it seems to me that numbers on
 their own are relatively meaningless and in particular capacities do
 not define the maximum number that can safely be accommodated as to
 overcrowding because safe capacity may be stipulated for other reasons
 e.g. exiting points, rather than volume. This illustrates the danger
 of relying on the opinion of non-experts, the difficulty is where to
 draw the line between the expert knowledge and the extension).


Whilst in the concourse area he saw Gate C open, he thought about 200
people rushed in, he was pushed to one side as he tried to calm them
down, people were aggressive, several people fell, and when they had
all passed, he was surprised that nobody was injured. They looked
to him as if they were in a "state of haste". He went out through
Gate C, did not see it close. Outside people were surging, chanting, I
singing, a happy crowd but there was a pervasive smell of intoxicants,
(earlier all cans and bottles had been taken off fans and put into
bins). He went to the funnel bar, assisted people to get out of the
crush, some objected, did not want to lose their place. He directed
them to Gate C, some came back and said they couldn't get through,
he went to give instructions for it to be opened but did not in fact
see it done, although he knows that it was. Whilst assisting he saw
Gate B open, this relieved the pressure in turnstile area dramatically,
he thought Gate B opened in the period between 14.48 and 14.57 but he
doesn't know. He then went back to turnstiles 1 - 16, his officers
there were disturbed but relieved that things had been sorted out. He
does not recollect hearing or seeing the LANDROVER. Recollection of
radio message to attend on the pitch, went round with his serial, no
recollection of players on field, surveyed the scene, had met Sgt
Murray, ashen-faced, told to do what he could, saw that his help
would be better at the back, went round (N.B. photographic evidence
identifies him on field at 3.09 (CHECK) and there is a photograph of
him in the pen at 15.15. He entered tunnel, there were people standing
at the end, together with three POs who did not appear to realise what
was going on. He told them to follow him, that people were dying,
started pulling people back. He fought his way onto the terrace,
some difficulty with some people who did not co-operate, but in the

    end he managed to get forward and helped with the rescue. He confirmed
    that many of the fans did magnificently, others appeared shocked, as
    indeed he had noticed were some of the POs on the pitch.
    He saw Supt Greenwood on pitchside but has no recollection of seeing
    Chief Supt Nesbitt. He was asked if he had seen Mr Nesbitt's scheme
    for removal of the deceased but he had not. Mr Russell took him
    through a series of photographs, one of which showed Sgt. Murray
    making his way towards the South stand at 15.06, shortly thereafter
    they must have met. Another photograph shows him on the pitch at
    15.09 and a third in the terrace at 15.15. He was also shown some
    photographs around that time indicating other POs within the terrace,
    and one timed at 15.03 showing someone being passed forward in what
    appeared to be an organised way.

Mr Doyle departed by car 11 am, arrived Sheffield 1.20. Had one
pint at pub, Leppings Lane 2.20, saw some police horses, there
were no queues. One of the horses was stationary but the other
was moving about, not very impressed, he tried to queue but there
were too many people. His brother lifted a couple of lads up and
gave them to a mounted officer for safety. Entered via concertina
gate. Went down tunnel, OK, at tunnel exit there were people but
he was sucked into the terrace. Teams were just coming out.
A man made his way out and as he did so punched him in the throat,
he was carried forward, feet not touching the ground. Got to crush
barrier, ducked under it with his friend. Tried to get over to the
right and succeeded. Game was in play, managed to climb into Pen 2
over dividing fence (he had a vivid memory of an old man who was
stuck t h ere).? Beardsley had just hit the cros s b a r^ judging by the
roar. He recollects seeing a Police Sgt with a stick walking up
and down. They were were screaming at him, no response. He managed
to get over to Gate 2, it was still shut. It was opened and he ran
out. He said the officer at the gate and the Sgt. appeared not to
understand what was going on.    He ran, took up position on the fence,
tried to help people out. He insists that there was no PO on the
fence, that he was one of the first of the supporters but he didn't
see Gate 3 open and that the match was still in play. He recollects
hearing a voice from the stands addressed to him personally to go
and stop the match. He also made some comment about a WPC and a PO
who were unhelpful to him and he remembers another three officers
who appeared to want to chase him when he came out of Gate 2 (CHECK TRANSCRIPT).

CROSS-EXAMINATION RESUMED DAY 49
I re-examined him regarding the Sgt with a stick, he felt confident
that he had seen this. I put it to him that South Yorkshire officers
do not have sticks and he also agreed that he had seen them at Anfield
but he was pretty sure that he saw what he saw.

Miss Adel man put a series of photographs to him, starting at 15.02
and 15.04 which showed him in Pen 2 looking out, both photos showed
gate to the pen open, he then looked at photo 15.05 where he is not
seen on the perimeter fence. At 15.07 he is seen on the perimeter
fence, query cigarette, Gate 3 open and POs. He still maintained
that he had not seen any POs and he had earlier said he had not
seen the gate open, but it is clear that it was adjacent to him.
He confirmed that he had been up and down twice and thought he had
been on the fence for quite a considerable time. He also eventually
agreed that he had based his assumption that the match was in progress
on seeing Grobeler and it could be that the match had actually ceased
when he heard the shout to him to stop it. He was thanked by Mr King
on behalf of the relatives for all he had done.

Mr Doyle's evidence is a good illustration of (a) the effects of
memory, (b) attempting to reconcile what someone believes to have
 happened, i.e. that the Police did nothing, with the events, and
 (c) how mistaken that can be.
 (It is clear that Mr Doyle has a strong view about the inactivity
 of the Police as, even on the photograph where they are seen on the
 fence, he asked whether in fact it showed that they were not doing
 anything.)

Friend of Mr Seddon.
He said arrived Leppings Lane 2.35. He saw LANDROVER but did not hear
any announcement. He was pretty sure that the Landrover was in position
when he arrived. This would put the arrival time considerably later,
after 2.45. On the other hand he was certain that the turnstile area
was more of less deserted of people and the whole of the crush was
outside the perimeter gates which were shut and controlled by police
horses. He didn't think the crush was excessive but he did see young
people and teenagers climbing over the gates and walls and he confirmed
that there was crushing at the gate and that people were getting under
the horses, he thought to escape the crush. He was challenged over
times but was sure the turnstile area A - G was clear. The gates at
some point were opened and he entered, initially turnstile area was OK
but for some reason turnstiles were not operating and then people began
to get crushed. He entered via Gate B and then down tunnel, entered
after match had started. He thought crowd at exit of tunnel jutted
in by about 5 yards , no pushing, with people choosing to go left or
right. He did not agree with Mr Seddon that their position was easy.
He felt more crushed but although he has admitted to feeling pressure
he could not say he was in fact in a crush. He saw PO gesture to go
back. He ^felt shortly after that a surge forward which he thought
might be linked to Beardsley hitting the crossbar. Having said that
he was fairly tight, on being challenged with his statement he agreed
that he had said it was quite comfortable on the terrace where they
were and that Mr Seddon and others were able to read their programmes.
He also interestingly said that just before entering the terrace a man
with a boy came out, the boy was crying, the man did not look too
distressed and said it was "murder inside" but neither he nor anyone
else turned round, they all went forward.

Arrived by car, departed 10 am, arrival 12.30, went to pub, five
pints, left pub 14.15, Leppings Lane 2.30 - 2.45. Saw about 70/80
people who he thought didn't have tickets on bridge, but on cross-
examination agreed there might have been far fewer as quite often
friends are also trying to get tickets for just one person, (in line
with T W L l oyd?).
Approached turnstiles, two mounted officers were positioned to prevent
people going through, this was plain to him, there was pushing which
seemed to increase as kick-off got nearer. Eventually officers moved
aside and the whole crowd pushed through the perimeter gates. He was
in turnstile area adjacent to Gate B. It opened, mass crowd entered,
quite a rush, he didn't want to be part of it, held back, then went
in through gap in wall and down tunnel. Tunnel was clear, exit
blocked, managed to get through, game was in play when he entered.
Considered the space he was in ample, described it as easy. He did
not see the crush barrier go but when he eventually moved torward
he noticed it had broken and thought that might be the explanation
of the apparent space. He did not feel any particular discomfort.
Before going forward had noticed people going into the stands, did
not think any more about it, had not realised people in front were
crushed. Could see P0 telling people to go back, couldn't understand
the necessity for this. In any case could not go much further back
because of wall and thought the tunnel was too narrow as an exit.
Saw people climbing over. Confirmed that he had been a regular attender
for years, stood on the Kop, he enjoyed beinjsquashed.
OUtside again, at the perimeter gate mounted officers were trying to
control crowd who were pushing. People shouted to get back, thought
it was sheer weight of numbers. Did not see or hear LANDROVER.
Confirmed that five pints of alcohol in his view would not affect
behaviour and in fact he would be quite willing to drive if he were
allowed to. His impression was that Liverpool supporters tended to
be well behaved in pubs. Confirmed he had seen people go under police
horses but he might have done it himself as well. On the terracing
his friends had managed to stay together as a group when they entered
and were quite easy in that position.

       Went by organised minibus, owned by Fly Time, thirteen of them,
       departed about 9 am, stopped at Stocksbridge about 12 noon at Silver
       Fox, had already been stopped by Police prior to that once, their
       mini van was rechecked another three times after the Silver Fox.
       They were checked for alcohol and tickets. Says he came over
^   v''- Snake Pass and was held up at the village of Tintwistle. Pretty
         thorough search he describes. Eventually parked in Halifax Road,
       Leppings Lane 2.35 to 2.40, claimed he parked at Halifax Road 2.30.
       Gives an account of entering Leppings Lane from Halifax Road and says
       he saw a coach full of POs parked on the corner of Leppings Lane/Halifax
       Road. Wondered later why they had not been used. Says they were there
       at between 2.35 and 2.40. (Nobody else seems to have noted this coach,
       which is very surprising, if it was there, possibility is that this
       may have been coach which was taking officers from Midland Station
       (Sgt. Swift etc) to the Gym but this would make his arrival time
       considerably later and we have heard no suggestion that the coach
       was actually stationary and parked).
       Entered through perimeter gates. Pressure on the R-H side not too
       great but outside the pressure was greater, decided to wait near
       River Don but crowd got bigger again and he was swept in the right
       side and pushed towards turnstile area near funnel bar. Informed
       that gate was open and ducked under the bar, entered as POs were
       opening. Prior to that it had been really packed. Did not see
       or hear LANDROVER but saw mounted officers in the middle of the crowd.
       Did not see mounted officers come past him from Gate C area.
       Entered via tunnel, normal walk but halfway down could feel pressure
       building up, forced to walk more quickly. It was like running into a
       brick wall, people were jammed up tight. He said that with the force
       of people coming from behind, they were virtually getting pushed
       further and further forward. Ended up near barrier which broke, but        115
       didn't break while he was there. Players were already on field when
       he entered pen, saw nothing of the match or kick-off. Finished up
       in front of the barrier, able to edge round it, facing uphill, at
       that point thought he couldn't stay there as he wouldn't be able to
       enjoy the match. Man near to him said he thought the gate at the
       front would have to be opened, seemed only way out. By this time
       people were screaming and walking on his head like stepping stones         116
183. T W LLOYD (continued...)

from the back to get over the barrier. Further surge, carried forward,
at that point he felt he had to give up, was encouraged to throw
himself forward, blacked out and then was on the running track.
Says that he was being escorted away as if under arrest by a PO after
that. Agreed that he might have lost consciousness twice.


He describes the travel delays, left at 9 am from his palce but did
not leave until maybe 9.45. He went round Manchester, some holdups
at confluence of roads, held up maybe 20/30 minutes, then held up
in village of Tintwistle, held up by two sets of roadworks in Snake
Pass, then OK until stopped by Police for tickets. Traffic was moving
on Snake Pass but slowly at roadworks.

Very distressed lad, friend of the Glovers.
Travelled by car, departed 11 am, arrived about 2.15. He had a
stand ticket, tried to get directions from PO, told to follow the
crowd in. Entered apparently through A-G, just continued to follow
the Qnowd down tunnel on to terracing. Says he had no idea how
he got into the ground, did not realise he had entered via big gate,
just followed crowd. Movement was a cross between walking and running,
entered terrace, thought players were on pitch judging by the roar
and also could see their heads, but thought that was five/ten
minutes later.
Having entered terrace he realised he was in the wrong place, got
carried further forward to near barrier, did not initially think it
was serious because he had been in similar situations before, but
then it became tighter and tighter, became very upset when describing
 someone close by who appeared to be dying.   Helped out by WPC.
Never saw either of the Glover boys in the pen.

181.     L D LLOYD                   ASSOCIATED WITH MARTIN WILD

Travelled by car, departed 10 am, arrived 1.30. One of their group
of five was ticketless. Whole group split up trying to find him a
ticket, i.e. about five people were asking for spares, split into
two groups. They eventually got one. He met a PO at some point,
chatted to him and then overheard a radio message about trouble at
Leppings Lane. The officer left and they made their way to the
turnstiles. Arrived about 2.30, saw two police horses, recognised
mounted officers as Liverpool men, heard people being asked to push
back. Saw foot officers outside perimeter gates which were open.
He siggested that the gate should be shut. It was shut for a moment
but then reopened. He would not have objected to the gates being
shut, his view was that the Police were anxious to keep traffic
flowing in Leppings Lane and therefore moving people towards the
perimeter gates. He thought there was quite a bit of traffic, buses
and cars. Having entered T/S area he was told to get under the
funnel bar with Mr Wild (deceased) and then entered through Gate C.
Prior to that he recounts a comment made in the crowd that the
match was going to be delayed. He was about halfway to the turnstiles
at that stage where it was rather congested. On that shout, it tended
to ease a bit. Someone then shouted "it hasn't been postponed" and
the crush restarted. He noticed a change in the pressure between the
remarks, although even when it eased it was still fairly tight.
Tunnel fairly clear, entered terrace, did not look any worse than
any other game, Pen 3, players just coming onto pitch, things got
tighter, came to a standstill just as game kicked off. Did not
think he was in a life-threatening position, although very uncomfortabl
Things changed when there was a sudden surge. This was not unexpected
but it did not relax. Happened just after kick-off, that is when he
lost Martin Wild, up to that point he had looked OK.   Exited via tunnel

Coach travel (Sunspan), departed 10.30, arrived 1.00 pm. Coach
was checked for alcohol and tickets, arrived Leppings Lane 2.25,
big crowds, entered through Turnstile, POs outside turnstiles, not
doing much. Saw two police horses within perimeter gates, in his
view causing confusion, incapable and unable to do their job because         77
they had allowed too many people in and they didn't know what they
were doing. Supporters were asking officers to form queues. He
thought by the time he got there it was too late to achieve this
but they just wanted officers to do something but he did not feel
that either he or any other supporters could have helped themselves.
He did not think, despite all this, that the crowd were pushing,
just too packed.
Having entered through T/S saw people being searched by POs.
Did not notice concertina gate open, free entry through tunnel, into
Pen 3, no difficulty in choice between pens but could not have got
back once he entered. Entered about 14.40 to 14.45, no recollection
of b^ch ball, took up position in line with R-H goalpost, OK, bit of
movement, moved to about 6 yards box where it became very tight.
Heard players announced in this position, recollects players coming
onto pitch. Recollects game initially, in Pen 3 at that point,
assisted into Pen 2, having made his way across virtually the whole of
the pen, room being created by people exiting. Saw fans on the railings
shouting to people to go back but no officers. In 1988 he had entered
at about 2.25 via tunnel, free passage, no stewards, gates not closed,
always thought Hillsborough not a very good ground. Crowded in 1988,
comparable to how he was immediately behind the goal.
1989 claimed that fans were pulling people over and Police were not
having any of that, but then admitted he had only seen one. He knew
the officer he had described was PC Grunhill, Merseyside Policeman.
When asked whether the crowd was eager to push forward, he said not
eager, everyone was trying to get into the ground, nobody was wanting !
to push forward.   He did agree that he heard appeals not to push,    (      86
and he further agreed that neither the police nor the crowd could do
anything, it was just too packed. He confirmed that although officers        88
were saying "stand still" there was movement forward and he in fact
did move forward, thought that the Police had lost control.

When cross-examined by Miss Adelman, he again insisted that he saw no
PO on the fence but the one case he described occurred after he had
got onto the pitch and it was his impression that the POwas pushing
a person back into the pen gate. He felt that the PQlice were
restricting the flow of people trying to get out by their presence.
He also said that the exit to Pen 2 was very congested. He agreed
with Mr Payne that if the Police were trying to get the people out
that was fair enough but in his view they were creating more havoc
by being there.

179.   N ABBOTT                              TICKETLESS FAN

Travelled by train, arrived 12.50, wearing football gear, directed
to coaches, ticket not checked or requested.
Arrived Leppings Lane 1.15. Started looking for spares, walking
up and down. Wandered fairly far from ground, tended to walk
against stream, saw another 20/30 people doing the same. Saw
PO moving people on without tickets. Obtained his ticket at 2.40,
joined crowd outside perimeter gate, gate shut just as he got
to it. He realised the reason because he could see the crush.
He was against the R-H gate, he saw the L-H gate open and some
people went through. He didn't see a horse cordon but did see
a couple of officers. He did not hear or see the LANDROVER. Saw
Gate C open, eventually got through it, got to tunnel, could see
two players on pitch pre kick-off. Entered terrace, entry was
clear but terrace was full, carried forward and ended up on barrier
with one leg over and leaning over backwards. Arrived just about
when kick-off was taking place. At that stage still prepared
to watch match but things became different within about one minute.
It was during this minute t,hat he heard cries for help and also
saw POs signalling for people to go back and assisting. Felt
barrier go but did not see it fall, although he felt it lower
on his leg. Unable to relate it to events on field. Slightly
more comfortable at that stage. Eventually approached fence,
ladder against it, tried to climb over, WPC and man tried to assist
but only managed in fact to pull his jacket off. He went back
into terrace and eventually made his escape through tunnel.
N.B.
Very interesting witness with regard to people falling back into
the terrace. It is quite clear that he was not pushed in but,
to an observer from a distance, could it have looked as if he
was pushed?
Outside Turnstiles he saw police physically trying to close the gate
but he didn't see how they were in fact opened. He confirmed that at
kick-off he wasn't frightened because he expected the crush to ease off
as it normally did.
Identified himself on photograph in Pen at 15.02 and says this was before
he got to the barrier, it might have taken him another minute.

178. T E CULLY                                   SUPPORTER

Regular and active football supporter. Travelled by car, departed
11 am, arrived Sheffield 1 pm. claimed arrived Leppings Lane 2 pm
but subsequently shown photograph 438 and identifies himself on it
at 14.30. His account of conditions at the turnstiles area much
more consistent with 14.30 plus than 14.00. He said that the
turnstile area was pretty packed, that he was near the funnel bar,
there were POs near the turnstile crushed against the wall. There
was a PO on the other side of the funnel bar, ht; duikt-ta i n -aQa-0 lllt--‘
0 f•^^t•^re-£^^np^ har to get    furwaffl. He told the PO that there
were pickpockets operating at the back of the crowd and to do something
about it. He said he knew this because someone had tried to get his
money, he said he was, sroi     they did operate in crush situations
and in fact they created a crush (6htEt1fr TRANSCRIPT)-.
He eventually entered through a turnstile, with his lad, went down
tunnel, lot of people at the end, thought it was too crowded.
Difficult to assess how far he actually entered the terrace. Turned
round (query, had he lost his lad at that point or later, not clear
from evidence). Came back out, turned right through gap in wall and
managed to get past six stewards and PO up into the stands with his
terrace ticket. Whilst on the stands he saw that his lad was down
below in /the terrace. He borrowed two tickets from friends, having
shouted to his lad to meet him. Went downstairs, met at Gate C which
at that point was being opened by a PO, there was a rush of people
coming in, he grabbed hold of his lad and ran towards the other stair­
case leading to the stand. The stewards were just shutting the gate
at the bottom of the stairs. He managed to grab them and pull them
open and get upstairs, returned to his location. The players were
then on the pitch. He sat down to watch, could only see the tops
of the railings of the terraces, could not see the crush down below.
Noticed people coming over the top but didn't think too much of it.
Expected it all to get sorted out and did not realise anything was
seriously wrong until he saw people being resuscitated. He was asked
by Mr Payne about his opinion as to the risk of people going down the
tunnel and then cross-examined by Mr King as to the value of t’hat
opinion, (legal argument as to whether I should have allowed either
or both of these in view of ruling re Motson).

    In response to Mr Russell he confirmed that he knew tickets were
    sometimes dropped from stand to terrace, in fact admitted he himself
    had effectively done that, he had also seen it at Wembley and York,
    Liverpool fans throwing tickets out over the fencing for others to
    use outside the ground. Not uncommon practice. Other ways of getting
    into the ground were by bribe etc. There was no tried and tested
    system but if you want to get in you always can, and he had done so
    when he was younger.
5 FEBRUARY 1991

177.   N SAVAGE

Travelled by car, departed 11 am, arrived Sheffield 2 pm., held up
at Stockport. Had one pint plus two cans, arrived Leppings Lane
2.30. Very confused witness who seems to have put things out of
his mind.   Said that when he arrived the perimeter gates were open
(his statement says they were closed), saw PO not doing anything at
perimeter gates (statement says PO was controlling crowd). Remembered
Police horse standing on his foot. On terrace said he did not see
the barrier. His statement was read out to him. On the whole
he thought the statement was accurate but felt that game had not
kicked-off, despite what he said in the statement.


Impossible to work out which turnstile he came through. He insists
that the tunnel was not in front of him, that he had to turn left,
having been directed by a PO to go to the tunnel. He also says that
he saw what sounds like Gate C opening briefly and another gate
opening at the left (which would presumably be Gate B or even A)
but he could not have seen the concertina gate. He would not go through
the gate, whatever it was, because he was frightened due to the mass
of people going through and expected there would be pushing and shoving.
He therefore stuck it out at the turnstiles.


In 1988 he entered about 1.30, he thought it was pretty tight, worse
than the Kop, he saw people being pulled into the stands at half-time
but could see no reason for this except that they might want to get
a seat. Despite the tightness in 1988 he was willing to go back into
the same pen.
N.B.   I think this witness's evidence in court is pretty weak.

176.   P TWYDALE

Travelled by car, departed 9 am, arrived 2 pm, held up at Stockport.
Leppings Lane 2.30. (CHECK TRANSCRIPT)




Moved into PEN 3, was initially uncomfortable in position marked (1)
about a third of way in. He then moved across to the right until he
hit the radial fence which he said he didn't know about. Moved along
the radial fence towards the back. Took up position right by the
opening at the back of the radial fence. He was OK then, the players
had just come out. He watched the match and saw kick-off, saw
Beardsley hit the crossbar but seemed after that to have lost interest
in the match. He said he was aware of the problems because he had
been in it himself. He confirmed that the gate leading from Pen 3
to Pen 2 was wide open and padlocked back. He said he was standing
on it which is why he could see what was going on. Other people at
the back would not have been aware in his view. He confirmed that
Pen 2 was considerably empty, he said not many people were using
the gate. When asked why he didn't go himself he said he was helping
people to climb into the stands. He agreed it would have been much
faster for them to go into Pen 2 and said he actually suggested it
but nobody wanted to go, they just wanted to go up into the stands,
perhaps they were scared of what it was like in Pen 2. Later a PO
came and he more successfully managed to divert people into Pen 2.
He thought he could see hundreds going up into the stands and also
subsequently substantial numbers going through the gate.
N.B.
He identified himself right in the gateway on C      . H e did not
appear to be on the gate then, it is also difficult to see if he
maintained that position, which he said he did, how he could actually
have helped anyone into the stand as the overhang is further forward
I think (CHECK).

175. A HOLLINRAKE                            SUPPORTER


Travelled by coach (Eastmans), depart 11.30, arrived 2.40. Held up
near Manchester - heavy traffic. Leppings Lane about 2.45. Coach
was checked outside Sheffield for TICKETS and ALCOHOL.
LANDROVER and TANNOY not seen or heard.
At Leppings Lane masses of fans spilling onto the road, crushing
outside perimeter gates, saw one officer attempting to control crowd
and opening and shutting perimeter gate. Recollects hearing mounted
officer shouting to people to "go back". Officer on perimeter gate
unable to control crowd, just too many fans. Entered tunnel, clear
up to exit, more substantial block than described by Mr Mull in.
Shoved his way through, describes as pushing hard with his body,
thought that people ahead of him (a) couldn't see (b) were also
trying to get in. Asked why he didn't wait, he said he only did
what every other football fan would have done and what he would
normally expect to do at Anfield. Confirmed to Mr King that the
behaviour of the fans was no different from normal behaviour of
football fans. One has to do what one has to to in order to get in.
He confirmed that he was not prevented by POs from entering the tunnel,
just ordinary fans trying to get in and they would not know the status
of the terrace. Confirmed that players were on pitch while he was
still in the tunnel. Exited, after that there was a surge, went to
the right and forward, lost control of movement, kick-off had just
taken place. There was a youngster pressed against barrier calling
out for help, couldn't help him, he was against the barrier, felt
it move, gave way and fell forward (CHECK TRANS .CRIPT).

174.   G GAINS                                SUPPORTER

Coach travel, Amberline, departed 11.15, arrived 1.30. Leppings
Lane 2.15 to 2.20. Coach was stopped, 'IStpilTS WERE CHECKfOI \
Having got off the coach he had a couple of cans of lager and some
pies. Near Gateway, at about 2 pm mounted police officers started
moving people towards ithe ground. N 6 problems. Timing is most
suspect as he describes considerable crowd activity. He noticed
mounted officers having trouble controlling the crowd, got crushed
along the wall near Gate B, thought that people would be hurt.
Got to turnstiles, had not heard LANDROVER or TANNOY. Tunnel was
clear, entered terrace, PEN 3, carried by crowd towards barrier,
sure that barrier broke after players were on pitch but cannot
confirm whether match had started but it was only a short time
interval. Had been squashed shortly before placers came onto pitch
He felt that he heard shouts that the barrier was going, fell
forward.

With regard to 1988 he remembers that the   blue gates at the tunnel
were shut, not sure when he got there but   thinks about half an hour
before kick-off. He went through gate in     the wall and round to NW
terrace. Not certain whether POs were on    gate.

 173.     P DUGGAN                            SUPPORTER

Keen football supporter. Attended match in 1988, Pen 3, travelled
by coach, arrived Leppings Lane 2.30. Had free access down tunnel,
it was not closed nor were there any directions given. He had been
near the front and having a broken arm that year was anxious not to
be in too crowded an area.   As far as he was concerned, it was fine.
(Compare his evidence with Kenworthy, Devonside and another supporter
who claimed police were directing people away from Pen 3 at 2 pm,
whereas another supporter said he was directed at the exit of the
tunnel to go along the back at about 2.20?). He was stopped three
times, tickets checked, but he didn't see anyone who didn't have a
ticket, therefore cannot say what would have happened in that case.


1989 - travelled by Amberline coach, departed 10.30, arrived 1.pm, '
then had to spend a little time looking for a chemist for one of
their friends. Leppings Lane entrance 1.55, clear entry, PEN 3
about 2 pm. Fairly crowded at entry but once through that, the
terrace was fairly empty. Up to about 2.30 nil of note. 2.30 Martin
left pen to get some food. Returned 15 minutes later. Recollects this
was point of time of the beach ball. Gave evidence that it was very
crowded from 2.30 onwards but in due course agreed that as far as he
was concerned, until kick-off he was not uncomfortable but the penT
was filling up. When play, ers were on pitch pre kickoff, people
started coming below the barrier and he was gradually being moved
forward. He was not near the barrier when it broke. He noticed
just before kick-off a couple of kids being passed over the fence.
Said he saw the gate open and one of them being put back in. It
closed again. He did not see it open further. He recollects the
barrier, or part of it, hit his legs and knocked him down. He thinks
it was point of time when Beardsley hit the crossbar, he didn't see
                                                  *
this but recollects there was a roar a few moments after kick-off. »
There was also a surge at that time.

172.   S MULLIN                               FRIEND OF ERIC HUGHES

He mentioned that Mr Hughes had told him that in 1988 he, Mr Hughes,
had been on the terraces with another friend and that the latter had
found it a little bit scary as he didn't like crowds. The witness
himself had been in one of the stands.
In 1989 a group of them travelled in two cars, departed 11 am, arrived
2.15, Leppings Lane 2.25. It appeared disorganised and crowded. The
witness had a similar experience outside turnstiles at Derby and
made ud his mind that he would never get in such a situation again.
He and Eric had got separated in the turnstile area with Eric being
ahead. Witness stepped to one side and stood close by Gate C where
it was calmer. Gate was opened wide, he noticed steward and couple
of POs but they were not checking tickets, he just walked in. He
found his friend who got through the turnstiles, having been to the
toilet they entered tunnel, it was the only route he could see.
They intended to go to the corner. Tunnel was clear apart from wall
of people right at the exit. They had a bit of difficulty getting
through this crowd but it is not unusual to do a little bit of
forcing just as one enters the terrace. He confirmed to Mr Isaacs
that it was a matter of "excuse me", and wriggling through, but he
went in carefully and did not create a surge. On exiting the tunnel
he realised the players were on the pitch, he noticed Hanson, commented
on this to Eric. Had moved slightly down and was just surveying the ^
scene, signalled to Eric to move towards the right-hand front corner,
there was a terrific surge which carried him almost to the front. He
could see a Policewoman at the gate.   She seemed to be taking advice,
a PO came along and opened the gate.   Prior to that he had noticed a
young boy immediately in front of him in some difficulty.   This lad
was extracated with some difficulty and he then followed. The
Policewoman directed him towards Pen 1 and another lady officer opened
the gate to Pen 1 to let him in. It was clear. He was pretty confident
that he was one of the first, if not the first, to enter Pen 1 (see time
schedule which put this at just after kick-off). Whilst 1n Pen 1 he
was near the Police control box.   He remembers being told that Beardsley
had hit the crossbar and saw officer go onto pitch to stop the match.
DAY 44
172.     S MULLIN   (continued...)



There were shouts towards the control box for something to be done
but in this respect his evidence was a little difficult as he seemed
to relate this to Mr Kelly coming up to the box.   He remembers
people shouting at Kelly and blaming him.
He confirmed that if he had been given a choice he would not have
gone down the tunnel. He also confirmed to Mrs McBrien that when he
exited from Pen 3 he did not realise the seriousness of the situation
and made his way down to Pen 1. He might well not have gone if he
had known and would have wanted to look for Eric and others. He
expected the situation to ease itself. He found that at football
matches one always gets situations which are a little bit 'naughty'
but they always sort themselves out. He confirmed that his entry onto
the terrace was careful and did not creat a surge.

171.   P J SMITH                              S SUPPORTER

Travelled by car, departed 12 noon, arrived at pub "Windsor Castle"
1.15. Arrived Sheffield 2 pm, Leppings Lane 2.15. Police officers
outside, queues, busy but no difficulty getting through turnstiles.
Went to toilet, programme, tunnel full but clear passage, entered
Pen 3 14.30 to 14.35. In his view the pen was fuller than he would
have expected at that time (compare A Brown, Day 41, page 78, he
was expecting more people in the pen at 2.25).
Moved forward and took up position marked as 1. on Plan C429.
Saw beach ball being knocked about, he didn't get to touch it,
pen was very full at this stage, shoulder to shoulder. He heard
team announced but could not see the pitch. Says at that point
people were distressed around him. Was carried forward against
barrier which broke. He was vomiting, his thigh was pressed against
it, thought it was lower than normal (had it already y i el d e d ?) .
This was around kick-off. Barrier then moved slightly and then
collapsed. Initially said time interval 1/2 minutes but then
modified it to possibly four. People collapsed forward. He says
he saw people climbing out well before kick-off. He noticed people
trying to pull the fencing down. Didn't see whether they were
successful. Did not see gate.

N.B.
This witness has a different time sequence to the majority. He
places distress at about 2.45 - 2.50 and also times exiting from
pen considerably earlier.


He didn't see kick-off but heard a roar which he took to be it.
It seems on his evidence that the barrier may have yielded at around
this time and probably collapsed shortly thereafter. Does his evidence
                                           ■~s
illustrate pockets of distress ixi^addMtion.* If he is right that it
was as severe as he described it at 2.45, people behind him seemed,
either then or later, to have very little appreciation of the situation
and that there were others who were capable of playing with a beach
ball, climbing barriers and cheering team.

Sat outside Pen 5. Unable to remember which way round the ground he
walked. Was there just before kick-off, didn't hear any cries,
did not observe any distress, noticed that Pen 6 was emptier than
Pens 4 and 3, not concerned, did not see any gates opened at all,
did not see Sgt. Swift, did not notice people walking to Pen 6 .
Everything looked completely normal to him, based on his experience
as a ball boy since 1988. Says that officer was sitting at Gate 5,
but witness more interested in the match, was only glancing, but
definitely saw no distress nor did he have any hint of the disaster
until perhaps 6/7 minutes into the match. A lot of noise from all
sides, he recollects Beardsley hitting the crossbar.

169. T M MOORE                         FRIEND OF P HEWITSON

Left about 10 am in a van, very unsure about times (lively witness).
At least three of a group of six did not have tickets. He probably
had a stand ticket which   he and P Hewitson had bought between them.
At some point, which was   never clearly established, he swopped it
for two terrace tickets.    Having got to Leppings Lane he saw it was
very crowded and says he   withdrew to the bridge where he noticed
that the perimeter gates   and turnstiles appeared shut, based on
lack of movement. He says he was near a senior officer who apparently
spoke into his radio requesting Leppings Lane West End gates to be
opened. He also says he was near a TV cameraman and that they were
directing him with regard to the the pictures (if that is right it
is unlikely that he was on the bridge but rather a little parapet
where Supt Marshall and the BBC cameraman had been). He did not
see or hear LANDROVER. Although his evidence was difficult to
unravel it sounds as if he noticed that the perimeter gates were
being opened and he took a shortcut and clambered up the sides to
try to get ahead of the crowd. He thought that outside the perimeter
gate was quite a dangerous situation. Having entered through Gate C
he made his way down tunnel. Halfway down another friend stopped and
said he was going back out for some reason. He says he then handed
him his unused ticket for re-use. He agreed subsequently that if
everyone were to have done that it would have been very dangerous as
it would have meant that the capacity would be exceeded. He said it
was just an instinctive thing. He eventually entered terrace, he said
they had a choice, did not know about the railings, got tight about
halfway down, thought of going back, unable to do so. He was close
to the barrier that broke, did not see it but he felt the terrace
concrete move and heard a sound, two or three loud bangs, tilted
forward.    Statement was put to him that a few minutes after match
had started he heard the sound, but his evidence was not clear. In
addition there were some ambiguities about the timing when they managed
to buy their tickets or exchange them. He claimed initially this was
done an the motorway in stationary traffic but it seemed as if he and
Paul did not get their tickets until nearer the ground.
At the ground at about 2.30 or later.
This witness was quite interesting but there are a lot of inconsistencies
and his recollection of events was poor.

  Travelled by Amberline coach, departed 10 am, arrived 1.30.
  Coach not stopped or searched. Met up with Jason Kenworthy, Chris
  Devonside at Gateways. Arrived Leppings Lane 14.20. T/S area not
  organised but there were queues. Entered, searched on entry. Was
  in a group of 13 people eventually, including C Devonside, Simon Bell,
  Gary Church, Giles Hutt, Jason Kenworthy. All got through T/S,
  entered through t u nn e l , clear, Pen 3. On entering terrace, nothing
  on pitch, halfway down terracing commented that it was packed,
  stronger surges than normal, heard players announced and saw them
  come onto pitch, does not recollect beach ball. Surging at time of
  announcement, very uncomfortable, pressure from behind, surges
  gradually got worse, moved forward, initially able to recover position
  but eventually fixed. Crowd eventually solidified, Gary Church asked
  for help, unable to do so, up against barrier, unable to relate to
  events on pitch. Thought barrier had broken, estimated about 50
  people went forward, he is certain that he was got out from pen at
 /15.04, based on video evidence (through Gate 3). If that is correct,
  it must mean that the barrier broke before Beardsley hit crossbar.
  Assumes barrier broke because of sudden surge forward, also says he
  thought it was under strain.
  In 1988 he says that at 2 pm he was directed to Pen 1 or 2 by a steward
   who wore a bib with the word "Steward" on, having been told that the
   centre pens were full. He confirms that he had been with Anthony Owen
   in 1988, Owen's evidence was that they had entered via tunnel into
   Pen 3. Mr Thomas still felt that he was right and therefore Owen would
   have to be wrong. He describes that the major surge which went forward
   and did not relax occurred after the teams had been announced. When           43
   he fell forward he was only about one metre from the perimeter fence
| and was carried out through the gate. He agreed that his earlier      || 1
I statement contained guesses as to time and reconstructions as to      I
 1 events to try to make them make sense.
\ He says that in 1988 they were stopped on the bridge and had their
 \tickets checked.

Travelled with Horrocks, her recollection is Leppings Lane 14.20,
got frightened in T/S area, crowd very tight, did not hear LANDROVER.
People at the front were pushing back to try to relieve pressure.
She felt there was some relief but not much. Entered through T/S,
was confused as to which T/S she entered. Saw concertina gate open
once only, probably Gate C as near toilet. Tunnel normal walk,
Pen 3, halfway down terrace said to Keith she hoped crowd didn't
remain like that for the rest of the game. Players were already on
pitch. Still accepted condition at that stage but soon realised it
would not improve. Close to ft Horrocks (Deceased). Recollects surge
forward (query Beardsley hitting crossbar), could not breathe, people
shouting for gates to be opened. Opened and she said re-shut at 15.04
(Beardsley's shot). As far as she remembers gate was opened subsequently
and she did not see people climb over until after that.

Travelled by van, departed 9 am, arrived 10.50, Leppings Lane 2.20.
Had 3/4 pints at the pub. At the ground there were hundreds of
people, perimeter gates were open, one police horse only seen.
Entered through turnstile, didn't see Gate C open, did not hear
LANDROVER or TANNOY. Noise outside, was like a madhouse, got
through the tunnel, not too bad, saw players on field when he
exited, 14.54, wriggled his way through, very packed, steady increase
in pressure, recollects seeing some people but not details.
Confirmed that when first exiting on terrace did not think it was
unusual (was used to Anfield with 60,000), expected it to settle
down after kick-off. Confirmed he was "breathless but I have been
in that situation before so I wasn't panicking about it".
Agreed that there were no radial fences at Anfield. In 1988 he
was on same terrace. In his part of the pen not too bad but the
areas behind the goal were a bit tighter, came in about 2.30.

165.   B DEVONSIDE                         RELATIVE (FATHER)


Had ticket for North stand. He entered 2.20 approx, it was crowded
but he had no particular difficulty. Went onto the North stand,
talking to people, say Chris Lawler (full-back of Liverpool), went
to speak to him, took his seat about 14.40. Noticed after about
5 /7 minutes that distribution of crowd was uneven, admitted that
he wasn't concerned at either 14.40 or even 14.50. He was savouring
the atmosphere. He had noticed beach ball. At about 14.55 he
noticed a few people climbing into the stands. He wondered why
they were doing it and why the Police were not stopping them.
After the players came out things escalated. Once the game had
kicked-off it was as if something had erupted within the area
behind the goal. He recollects that Beardsley hit the crossbar
and that people were climbing out. He remembers the perimeter
gates opening and shutting for a very short period of time but has
difficulty in saying which particular gates or what time it was.
Unable to say whether match was in progress when gates were being
closed.
With regard to 1988 he says they were in a pub until 2.40, then ran
down to the ground, he went to the toilet and when they came out he
recollects the tunnel gates were closed and people had to go round

                                            FRIEND OF C DEVONSIDE



Departed 10.30, arrived 1.30. Leppings Lane 2.25. Lots of fans
converged, prior to that had at least two, possibly three cans of
lager (two purchased by him and one from Mr Devonside, see evidence)
At turnstile saw three mounted officers, entered through a turnstile
did not see LANDROVER or hear TANNOY. Having entered concourse
they went to toilets and then down tunnel. Entered Pen 3 with
Anthony Owen (see previous witness no. 163) and Chris Devonside.
INitially stood at the top then moved to their second position
where he was when beach ball being knocked about. He remembers
climbing onto a barrier and being held by Chris. He admitted
that he had reconstructed events and that, for instance, he had not
seen Beardsley hit the crossbar and in the end confirmed that he
hadn't seen anything on the day.
He does appear to remember the gates being opened and shut twice.
He thought the first time about ten people got out, the second time
it was left open and he got out, game was still in play. He agreed
with Mr Manning that Anthony Owen's account of making their way down
to Position 3 was probably more accurate than his.
He says that in 1988 the tunnel was closed off by gates. They were
shut and he saw no police officers. They then  walked around and
went into the side terracing. Doesn't know the time.
He confirmed that he was very uncomfortable (1989), in position 2.

Travelled by mini-bus, departed 11.30 approx, arrived 2.15.
Leppings Lane 2.25, big crowd, entered via T/S. When questioned
his first response was that there no queues, just pushing, but
backed off and said that there was none and that he got through in
4/5 minutes despite the fact that this would mean that everyone in
front of him would also have got in in the same time.
He did not see or hear the LANDROVER or TANNOY. He was not
uncomfortable in T/S area although there was some pushing.
Entry through tunnel normal, Pen 3, knew about radial fences.
Initially stood at the back, then moved forward to Position 2 on
Plan, was there when beach ball was being patted about, left that
position about time players came out because he was being hurt in
that position. He was able to leave and make his way towards the
front. It was whilst at the front that he felt surges, got out
shortly after kick-off. He had last seen his friend Gary Church at
Position 2, associated this with players coming out. He remembers
two openings of the gate.   In cross-examination he thought he moved
from Position 2 to fence between 2.50 and 2.55 which was when he lost
Gary. He knew he had got out just after kick-off and felt he had
been at the fence for about five minutes. On the other hand, he also
was sure that Liverpool was on the pitch at 14.54 when he was still
at Position 2.
 He said that they went down the tunnel in 1988 and were in the
 same pen.

   More accurate with regard to timing than .Griffiths I think. (See
   comments re entry under Griffiths) LANDROVER and TANNOY not seen
   or heard. Says he did push into the crowd but he didn't know his
   route. Police officer seen around coaches.
   Tunnel empty. Exited from tunnel, thought Pen 3 looked full, moved
   into Pen 4, stood at back, thinks at that point players were about
   to come out. Tight but satisfied, players were already on pitch.             53
   Sudden surge, unable to keep his feet, carried forward near the little
   gate which was shut. Heard people screaming, said Police lady kept
   repeating that she hadn't got a key, but subsequently modified this
   to perhaps she meant she did not need a key.                                 60
   Unable to recollect her position, never saw the gate open.
   Interesting comment in that he appeared to be able to discuss with
   his friends the police lady's comments re key. Heard other shouts
   but was unable to distinguish them. Confirmed that at 14.54 he
   was reasonably comfortable, it was just like an ordinary derby at            56
   Anfield, you expected to be pushed at the Anfield Kop and that is
   how it was. More concerned about the little children at the front.
   Identified his friend Carl and probably himself on photograph C367
   (timed at 14.59) with Sgt. Swift. Friend definitely out and he       i


   almost certainly at that time. Query therefore his estimates on
   timings.

Travelled by coach (x 2). Left 11 am, not sure when he arrived in
Sheffield, query 2.45 (compare C Jones who is more accurate I think
with times, he thought they arrived about 2.15). Griffiths says
his coach not searched but the other one was. Chris Jones says
both coaches were searched, including checks for tickets.                             ^ J~zcc^J
LANDROVER and TANNOY not heard. Chris Jones says it was very                               o**/
crowded, he was pushing in because he claimed he didn't know                           Irh
where to go and wanted to find correct turnstiles. Griffiths says
he saw three police horses, claims he went through Gate C on second
opening, it was a fast entry, able to get out of the crowd, went to
toilet, programme seller near wall but did not purchase programme
(compare with Mr Ball), took about 2/3 minutes, some pushing.
Jones says definitely went in the first opening, Griffiths says
tunnel clear, he could see goalkeeper.
Griffiths says that outside they had to go with the crowd*.acid thinks
he was one of the first. On entering terrace, fuller^tjian usuaNJ but
able to make way a little./ Jones ducked under the bjysnyeh, JJp^re was
quite a heavy push, he wasV-settarated. G r i f f i t h t ^ ^ L W s t T e ^ against
further barrier which he said was the one thajt b r ok e / (Position 2).
He seemed to recollect Beardsley taking a s h d t i ^ f o n ' t see what
happened, then barrier collapsed around that time. Also noticed
people falling forward. In the end he agreed to the following:
"you associate it with around the time when Beardsley had a kick but                     36
you don't know actually what happened to that". Also agreed that the
barrier breaking could have been earlier.                                                37
Also agreed t ‘hat he would have been prepared to watch the match at

Departed 9.30, arrived 1.40, parked a long way off, did not see any
excessive drinking, arrived Leppings Lane 2.40.
Spare tickets - 20/30 requests, mainly away from ground, people
walking away (compares with Ruth Cobb). No LANDR0VER or TANN0Y
seen or heard. Saw four police horses, entered via Gate C, tunnel
clear. He was ahead of crowd and speeded up to keep ahead.
Knew players were on pitch from noise and could see them from the
tunnel entrance. Entered PEN 4, took a few paces, almost immediately
concerned, people being taken into stands. Felt surge from behind,
carried half-way across terrace, kick-off after surge. Total time
sequence short from surge to squash. Exited eventually on the
concourse and tried to resuscitate John McBrien.
When walking across concourse after entering, pace was fast, crowd
behind him was travelling faster than he was and picking up speed.          15

Present in 1988 but was in one of the stands. No recollection of
people being pulled up from terracing that year. His main concern
on the terraces was the number of people, he did not see any POs.
Tunnel was clear apart from solid crowd at the end. He would not
have wished to push into the crowd. He went in sideways to avoid
the main route but felt that it would have been difficult for the
crowd that was coming down behind him to have stopped.

place 14.10. Leppings Lane about 2.30. Crowd milling around, crush
towards turnstiles, he felt that Police were just standing around,
no queues or organisation. MOunted officers there, angry as was the
crowd, altercations. Not very impressed with mounted officers'                               1 1

Crowd solidified at kick-off, fighting for his life. Could see
Kester, he was tall, and although he looked pale he thought he would
be OK.


Two of them had come without tickets but had managed to buy them at
Trowel 1 Services. He had difficulty in remembering sequences in the
terracing but recollects cries to POs which initially at least were
not responded to.                                    (£ )& (& >

Departed 9.30, arrived 11.30, by car. Leppings Lane 14.40 to 14.50
(associated with Jonathon Owen). NOTE Jonathon had a Stand ticket.
They went to Hillsborough Snooker Centre, Jonathon only drank soft
drinks and then they went to a pub. He had four pints altogether.
Got to ground between 14.40 and 14.50. Waited 5/10 minutes to
try to swap ticket. Friends did not turn up so went towards
turnstiles. Joined crowd between 14.50 and 14.55 (estimated).
Was sure he arrived at ground between 14.45 and 14.50.
Went towards turnstiles 14.40 to 14.50 as above.
Not uncomfortable in turnstile area and no impression of crush,
no recollection of LANDROVER or TANNOY MESSAGES.       X /«■ouU          f" ^ <
Gate opened, amongst first to go through, thought it opened more
or less fully but insisted that the game was in play when he looked
through tunnel. When they entered tunnel it was clear, it wasn't
crowded so no POs or   Stewards. Went to the right, terracing was
crowded as one would    expect,     comparable with 1988. Moved to the
right and was pushed. Unable to relate to events on the field.
This witness claimed surge 10/15 minutes after entered, i.e. well
after the match must have finished. Witness was not distressed
when first entering terrace.

N.B.
This is the first witness who indicates that someone with a Stand
ticket entered the terrace. This possibility had been canvassed
but discounted as unlikely, with an earlier witness.

At 14.45            went back, 14.55 players on pitch, didn't see
them but could tell from the cheers. Got pushed further, got
tighter and tighter. When players kicked-off got pushed to within
eight feet of front. Surge at kick-off, nothing unusual about that,          ^
what was unusual was that it did not relax. It was at that time          ;
he became aware of abnormality. He was surprised how few people \
were in terrace when he entered about 2.25 because his experience I ^
was that you had to be in your place 1 hour before kick-off to J
get a reasonable view.
Did not see anyone transferred between pens 3 and 4, saw people
climbing over fence. Initially people pushed back by Police, it
took them a few minutes to realise and then started helping.
People being pushed back coming from behind. People were squashed
up at time when people were being put back in pen, and people
around him he thought were dead.

Together with Singleton and Sephton, standing right against gate.
Had some difficulty with timing. Heard team announced at which
point he appeared still to be OK but did not see them come onto
pitch because during that time pressure had increased. On the
other hand said strong pressure occurred just at kick-off but he
didn't see kick-off. Recollects surges, with one main one,
recollects seeing officer, pressure getting worse, the officer
saying it would sort itself out. Gate opened, he was pushed back

by PO, gate shut, he did not protest, nor did he say anything to
the officer. His dad was objecting too. Gate opened again and
he got out. Darted to his right because he did not want to be put
back again, but in fact people were being let out of the gate then.

Up in commentary box by about 2.35. Prior to that had overheard
some conversation in Referees' room re emergency procedures but
was a bit reluctant to mention this as he wasn't supposed to be
there. Rehearsing his commentary,about 14.45 noticed empty
terracing. Found that unusual, speculated that it might be
reserved for Sheffield people. Was expecting the whole of the
terraces to look like centre pens.        bo
 Then concentrated on match, was made aware by message that
 something was happening at Leppings Lane end at about 3/4 minutes
 after kick-off. Looked over, saw what he thought was overspill
 from the middle pens, thought it was due to overcrowding.
 Nothing surprising in that, happened quite often, people were
moved by Police into emptier spaces, which is what he thought
would happen. Did not recollect seeing people being escorted.
 Didn't initially think it was a law and order problem. He thought
 it was peculiar that the crowd was distributed as described at           <2^
 14.46. Did not think there was any particular reason for people
to arrive early at al all-ticket match but said he had been in
situations outside turnstiles where there was quite a bit of
pressure.     When asked by Mr King re introducing another 1000 people
he said he was not an expert on crowd packing but would have              2 z.
expected them to be directed to the sides and also felt that there
really wasn't ^anouffii e& om 'to take them (re-assess this in light of
any evidence from HSE and others).

was prejudicial and not complete because it did not incorporate
within it all the other factors which had lto be taken into account

    Described how things were done and worked. Watched video.
    Confirmed that pre-match he and Motson had noticed relative emptiness
    of the side terracing but it was that rather than the fullness of
    the centre pens which attracted their attention.
    Had views of Leppings Lane on his monitors but did not record them
    for quite a period. As far as he was concered, there was nothing
    extraordinary happening. Did not appreciate that there was crowd
    problems until some time after kick-off. Did not think, even then,
    that the situation was anything much out of the ordinary. He
    confirmed that he was not of course responsible for monitoring
    the pens but he also said that the activities, beach ball etc,
    were entirely consistent with a happy crowd. He also felt that
    if anything of interest had occurred his attention would have been
    drawn to it. He had many years of experience.

Viewed pitch from top of South Stand. At about 2 pm thought the
ground was emptyish. Later on heard a loud roar, decided to have
a look, the players were on the pitch at that time, having a
run-out. He didn't see them come out, he viewed the scene for
2/3 minutes, he could see centre pens were "jam packed solid".
People at the wings were moving around freely. Would have been
surprised that people looking at the scene would not have
comprehended that it was crowded. Unable to see any injuries
within the pen, too crowded, more packed than he had ever seen
it before. 1988 also full but differential between wings and centre
pens not so marked. Saw people climbing into the stands and over
fencing, thought it was pitch invasion. Went back in, told his
friends not to hurry as he thought the match would not kick-off,
or if it did it would have to be stopped. Came back out, could see
people "carrying injuries" (game still in play). First of all said
he changed his mind as to what was going on but when challenged
with statement he agreed that upon his return he still thought the
problem was pitch invasion and injuries were caused by climbing
over fence, but changed his mind shortly thereafter. Unable to
say what it was that changed his mind except that it just didn't
look right. He then went to pitch and helped many people, in
particular he assisted one of the Hicks girls.

Acting as ball boy, always same location, Leppings Lane end, sits
on step outside Gate 5. Himself, Mark Dickinson and regular PO
were there. Came on to pitch after players had come out. Walked
round by Kop and North terrace, saw nothing remarkable, except
that he thought that the pens on the edges looked a bit empty.
When he got round, sat in usual location, noticed nobody in Pen 5,
relatively few people in Pen 6. Pen 4 was tight, didn't think
much of it, was a little surprised that people had not spread
across. Heard and saw nothing u n u s u a U m a t c h _ h a d kicked off, didn't
see any gates open, did not see sf e ^ m i t -h ^fleard one call for help
from a lady at some point, stayed in position until match over,
then left for the North Stand. Had not realised or seen any sign
of any risk. He thought pens at the side being empty indicated
that people were coming late. Wondered about match postponement,
didn't hear anyone in distress, heard a lot of shouting but nil
of note. When people spilled out, had not noticed any problems,

    Travelled by car with Eric Hankin and others.          Departed about 10 am,
    arrived 12.30.       Beehive Pub, full, he had three pints, others the
    same. Left pub 2.15 with his friends (ten). Noticed surprisingly
    few people, nor did he see any POs. Leppings Lane entrance 2.25 to
    2.30. When he first got there it was reasonably quiet, no crush
    at turnstiles but within two minutes people seemed to come from
    everywhere, very sudden, crush developed, saw people ducking under                   'j ^
    barrier, getting in front of others, making things more difficult.
    Saw couple of officers outside who did not appear to be doing
    anything but, after challenged with statement, agreed that statement
    was correct and they could not have done much. Once inside saw
    3/4 officers receiving verbal abuse. Whilst in concourse saw
    Gate C wide open (presumably 14.52). J d e n t ^ n t o pen via tunnel
    after Gate C had opened. Tunnel OK. Went onto^terracing, five

no queues, did not hear message from Landrover or Tannoy, nu PuHt-e

being shut, which would put him at 14.57, but insists that what he
saw happened at 14.40 (very poor on times).
Entered Pen 3 with brother. Saw nothing of people, players, etc.
He went out through gate, saw it open first time, a few people got
out, shut again, re-opened, he then got out. He could see his
brother, tried to communicate with him but he had already fainted,

Travelled by car, departed 10.30, arrived 12.20. Arrived Leppings
Lane 1.30. Not searched, no problems getting in. Knew his way.
Saw Gary Aspinall in Pen 3, passed the time of day with him.
Nothing significant, did not see him when crush was bad. Build-up
from 2.30 onward. 14.45 to 14.50 became much tighter. Did not feel
any surging. At about 14.50, felt that he had to move from his
position and go to sides at front of pen where he had noted there
was some space. In the end he decided to stay where he was. He
felt that there was a crush but not to such an extent that people
would be killed and that it was very busy but normal for a semi-final.
At 14.50 he could have changed his position if he had wished, but
would have had to do some pushing. Very similar to what Anfield Kop
would have been like. By 15.00 he was unablee to move.

see people against fence who looked frightened, they did not look
blue. After he had sat down he returned after a few moments to
collect his coat which he had forgotten. Able to retrieve it from
outside.   People looked about the same.    Time interval between two
openings of gate was very short.
Said he was comfortable until a few minutes before match started
and others were the same.
Mentions three surges, two forward and back, the third didn't relax.

Entered stadium between 1.45 and 2 pm. Pen 3. Took up position
on platform right against Gate 3. Did not move from that position
until he left the pen. O.K. until about 14.50, then pushing began.
Not really concered at that stage. Got really had at kick-off.
Was worried but not for his life, just before gates sprung open.
He saw a P.O. outside the gate. He was looking in but he could hear
shouts behind him to get the gate open but officer did not appear
to react at a l l ." Trie gate burst open owing to the pressure and
he and James came out. P.O. grabbed them and pushed them back in.
It was difficult and manouevre was completed by sutting gate. He
did not protest nor did he say to the officer that people were
injured or distressed. He was not aware of the extent of the
problem, did not see what was going on behind him. He
surprised at being pushed back in because of the cries/( Within
less than a minute gates sprung open again. This time escorted by
same officer towards the right. He looked back and could see the
gate remained open, people coming out, he didn't look into the pen,
therefore unable to say what could be seen. He did not see Beardsley
hitting the crossbar. Felt surges just before players came onto
pitch. Did not hear anyone call out behind him, re a child (Mr Jolly).

Entered without any difficulty. Paul and Anthony came later. He
was a few steps ahead. His recollection is that all was fine, normal
happy swaying and singing, until kick-off. Then surge. Paul was
carried forward, he lost sight of him. At that point he could not
move, he saw POs dttgmg~rrratptpq?1 a ^ t a k e people over fence. Despite
statement, he said he could not remember anything about the gate
opening, although he did hear cries of "open the gate" and requests
to push back. Confirmed to Mr Humphries that until kick-off, the
position was comparable to big Anfield Kop match.

 Travelled by car, approached via Nottingham.         Area within turnstiles
 and perimeter gates congested. Crushing but didn't feel in danger,
 had arrived at about 2.25, jostled about for about 20 minutes, had
 seen several POs including mounted officers. Mounted officers had
 been outside perimeter gates, officer ;within turnstile area as well
 Could see officer shouting to people to move back. Was assisted
 under funnel bar and directed to Gate C, surprised wide open,
 trickle of people going through, waited for his son near turnstile,
 did not see any POs or Stewards in the area, no crush or rush in
 concourse area, did not see anyone fall over or lose shoe, or get
 knocked over. Entered tunnel, this was fuller, progress was
 shuffling, entered Pen 4, players on field, initially able to move
 to left because he wanted to get to the sides. About one minute or
 two before kick-off it became unbearable and noticed man bent over
 barrier, not able to push back at all. Noticed people being pulled
 up behind him, he had been spun round, felt that they must have had
 more room as he could not have been released at that point. Thought
 possibly some little more room up at the back. Did not notice
 anyone being pulled into the terrace when he entered the pen.
 Did not like it behind the goal, thought this was a young man's
 area, full of excited people who might not mind being crushed a bit.
 He thought that one person could have diverted the crowd coming
 through Gate C to the sides.        (Contrasts A M Dodd, Thorpe, Beadsley,
 etc).
Saw no distress, nor any children being passed to mounted officers.
Insists entered through wide open gate. Remembers perimeter gates
being shut and opened. Approved of shutting.
Did not hear tannoy or landrover.

140.   D M BOWNES                             CHIEF LICENCING OFFICER

Took over responsibility in April 1986. Was not informed by anyone
at that time of any particular problems. His department would
have had to initiate proceedings for enforcement, if informed.
Confirmed that as far as Leppings Lane was concerned, apart from
initial reference to council (-sf-ee+a-l committee) requesting V \
and further general report re administration organisation, no '
reference to the council members as such was made. Agreed that
 it was his department which was the lead department in effect
 and that he was the person responsible within the department.
 He confirmed that he had no experience in the y d^wUX, but has
to rely on the reports from officers working party. He agreed
that this appeared to have two functions: (1) inspection and (2)
reaching of decisions. He confirmed that at the first meeting
 he attended, on the initiative of the OWP it was agreed that
barrier 144 should be removed. This initiative had not come from
the Club but from the Police. He could not remember the details
of the discussion but it was considered before a decision was
reached and the Club was asked to implement it. No change to
the Safety Certificate was made. In fact at no point was the
certificate amended either in drafting or substance prior to the
disaster. He described the input from various departments and
his need to rely upon their advice.    There is no minutes available
of that meeting. In 1986 approx he decided that a review of the
drafting of the certificate should be undertaken and this was
still being undertaken at the time of the disaster. The schedule
itself was not being reviewed. He also revised the methodology
of the OWP which was renamed Advisory Group.


He agreed that the council had a responsibioity inter alia to
enforce the Act, carry out inspections, impose conditions, and
various other administrative matters. He was pressed as to who
he would look to for guidance in certain situations and i^ fi^al
analysis was driven back to the Advisory Group, irrespective of
whether they had the expertise, he would have had to rely on them
to give such advice as they thought necessary.
DAY 38

140.     D M BOWNES (continued...)

He agreed that at no stage had any revision been made to the Safety
Certificate in relation to the penning either by Sheffield or
South Yorkshire, despite the fact that a certificate had been
in force for a considerable number of years. He agreed that at
no stage had anybody suggested to him that the system at Sheffield
was unsafe. He agreed that an assessment of safe capacities was
multi-factorial. As far as he was concerned all aspects of the
Safety Certificate were of equal importance. He fielded numerous
questions regarding assessment of the certificate relying upon
the advice which he might obtain. He agreed, very reluctantly,
that some method of counting would be needed to assess safe
capacities, and that individual capacities were not set for any
of the pens. He was not aware that Mr Butler had any expertise
in engineering but expected he would obtain this if necessary
from within resources of his own department. He did not think
that there was any particular risk of matters falling between
two stools in view of the set-up of the department. He also agreed
that changes in capacity required changes in the certificate.


In cross-examination by Mr King, his view was that as a matter
of common sense it was necessary to monitor the filling of the
terraces and that if the people whose task it was to monitor the
terraces felt that the arrangements were such that they could
not effectively do so, and that individual pens etc were needed,
then the continuation of that system was an unsafe thing to do,
in particular because the existing system would not necessarily
indicate whether there was overcrowding.                              4^

. A BUTLER                     PRINCIPAL DISTRICT SURVEYOR

 Painfully slow.
 Started Sheffield 1985. First meeting he attended was in March 86
 just before City took over. Retracing to a certain extent previous
 history. Confirmed that Certificate was issued in 1979 by SYCC.
 Terraces at that time were open, that from the records he knew that
 radial fences had been installed but he knew that there were gates
 at the back of these, that they were intended to allow passage for
 supporters or to be closed off if segregation was to be achieved.
 His responsibility was structure rather than ascertainment of numbers
 or means of escape. His responsibility was to check testing of
 barriers, walls etc. He confirmed that there was an officers'
 working party consisting of representatives of the Council, Police
 and Fire Services. The Club and the engineers were not members
 but did from time to time attend, that inspections were undertaken
 bi-annually initially but the objective of this was to see whether
 the Safety Certificate was complied with and reasonable safety achieved,
 but enforcement would be undertaken by the Local Authority (Admin &
 Legal), but that they would only act if members of the Officers'
 Working Party or indeed anyone else, told them of any dangers.
 He confirmed as far as he knew no prohibition notice had been served,
 nor had anyone raised any questions regarding safety.
 As far as he knew, nobody had complained about the lack of safety
 as a result of the radial fences, on the contrary, these had been
 installed mainly on Police request for segregation purposes but also
 to avoid internal surges. He agreed that he had been at the meeting
 in August 1986 when the removal of a barrier had been suggested.
 This was at the request of the Police on grounds of safety. It had
 been considered by the Group and he advanced several reasons, including
 reduced danger and not having a build-up in the tunnel, but he did
 mention that he understood that the tunnel would be controlled by a
 Police presence and that supervision could be effected from the control
 room, it was agreed at that meeting for the barrier to be removed.
 This was in effect an executive decision of the Group rather than a
 request by the Club. He was not aware of any complaints or any problems
23 JANUARY 1990

A BUTLER   (continued...)


following that removal until the disaster.
There was a very long cross-examination by Mr Payne
(IN TRANSCRIPT - SUMMARY OF EVIDENCE).
Mr Payne also established that after the City took over, he did not
think that any direct thought was given to the Safety aspects of
the variation in the Certificate and this was justified on the grounds
that they had taken over and that the alterations had all been
considered and agreed in 1985. It seems that if the inspections
were undertaken without reference to the documentation and, for
example, the safety limits and capacities and the impact of the
fencing had not been considered, in a nutshell, as far as he was
concerned, no hazard had been so obvious as to necessitate any
intervention or complaint to the Club, apart from relatively minor
matters.

There was cross-examination by Mr King and he agreed that safe capacity
can be countered by turnstiles, but distribution of people depended upon
the man on the ground seeing to it that people were safely distributed.
 It was put to him that the 1981 and 1985 proposals for radial fences
had originated with the Police but he confirmed that anybody could
make a safety recommendation and that the issues as far as he could
tell from the documentation had been properly considered and that
the Club had given notice of its intentions to make these alterations.
He agreed with Mrs McBrien that he didn't have any reason to think
that the ground was unsafe prior to the 1989 match. He was questioned
firmly by the Fire representative as to what contribution, if any,
they could have made to the issue of the removal of the barrier in
August 1986 and that, apart from general considerations of evacuation
times, it would seem that the removal of a barrier is a structural
matter.

      Mini-bus. Left 10.30, arrived 2.30. Heavy match traffic. Contrasted
      parking arrangements very unfavourably with 1988, not stopped nor had
      tickets checked either. Said 1988 arrangements were far better,
      tickets were checked and people not let through. Said he actually saw
      this happen, people were told not to go to the ground (.CHECK TRANSCRIP T )
      (contrasts other evidence about searching coaches and checking of tickets
      etc).
      Arrived at turnstile, huge crowd, stood back with Jon Paul, thinks he
      was outside perimeter gates. Saw Gate C open, entered, walked through,
      down tunnel, no problem, relatively easy access, took up position about
      halfway down at 2.55, no discomfort, things got tighter, surge, moved
      to within three feet of gate. Shouted to P.O. that had a boy there,
      officer appeared not to take any notice, could see that he might not
      have heard him (he could not distinguish what was being said around
      him). Could see the gate, it appeared to him to open twice at least.
      People were going out, in ones. When asked why he couldn't get out,
      he said he was prevented by people ahead, did not know where people
      escaping were coming from. Agreed he could not see what officer could
      have done to get him out.   Lost consciousness and revived on terrace.

      Coach (Amberline), left 9.45, arrived 1 pm, long journey but still
      got there on time. Onto terraces about 1.45, Pen 3, empty, filled up
      around 2.30, fairly full. Remembers beachball being thrown around.
      More packed at 2.45. Was used to pushing on terrace. Players came
      on pitch, further surge, holding on to trousers. Took up position
      between barriers. Things became really bad. People shouting, saw
      P.O. push someone back into pen ? (CHECK TRANSCRIPT).
      again after few seconds. Able to get out this time. Game was
      still in play.

      Travelled by car, left 10.30, arrived 1.30, held up a bit. At ground
      between 2.00 and 2.15. Turnstile very crowded, took half an hour to
      get through, did not see any gate open, entered tunnel, progress clear
      until end, then saw terrace was full, suggested they go back but it
      would have been difficult because of crowds going back. Assessed
      situation and decided to carry on. Entered between 2.45 and 2.50, pen
      was quite full but noticed that side pens were emptier by comparison.
      Took up position at barrier, when teams announced was uncomfortable and
      crushed against barrier, as was Andrew. He ducked under it and it was
      better on the other side for a time. Suggested to Andrew that he did
      the same. Initial evidence was that Andrew did not want to, but he
      subsequently modified it to "Andrew couldn't because of the crush".
      He was with Andrew at the barrier at kick-off. He recollects he was
      moved to radial fence and managed to climb out.

I V K E GILLflTT                                 FIRST AIDER

     Attended the match in capacity of first-aider, under the control
     of St Johns. Posted at the corner of Kop and Leppings Lane.
     Noticed at about 2.15 that Liverpool end relatively empty. At
     about 2.45 terrace was fuller but he noticed nothing unusual. He
     did see just before players came out a massive surge in Pen 3 which,
     as far as he could see, returned. Players then came out on the
     pitch and from then until match ended saw nothing at Leppings Lane
     end. He saw Beardsley at the crossbar, massive roar from Liverpool
     end. At the same time Mr Wells came over and said there were people
     dying at the other end and he was to get the oxygen bottle.
     On further questioning he said (in line with his statement) that
     when Beardsley hit the crossbar, he did look across, he could see
     another huge surge but his impression was that it did go back.
     Kathy said "let's go and look". On the way round he met Mr Wells
     who told him to fetch the oxygen bottle. They went to the ambulance,
     the match was finishing. He then approached Leppings Lane and
     Mr Wells directed his activity. His attention was focused on
     Mr Baron. He then tried for about one minute without success. He
     then noticed a man who was unconscious and someone standing close
     by who did not appear to be in any danger. He found that strange,
     that people could be so close and y e t things were so different. He
     then looked further back and noticed a distinct gap but people were
     not moving away, he also had stones thrown at him.
     He felt that the Police were not doing as much as they could
     initially. He described the people on the terrace and the Police
     as being in "shock". He did not see any signs of Police organisation,
     Once things got going, the effort was magnificent.

i S 3 . W H DUCKWORTH                             GOOD WITNESS

      Travelled by train, searched on numerous occasions, partly because
      he was carrying a bag but at no point was his ticket checked.
      Relationship with Police friendly. On approaching the turnstile
      he noticed a couple being arrested and two POs leaving. Entered Pen 3
      at about 2 pm. Recollects beach ball incident at 2.40, some surging
      then, not concerned for himself but worried about a couple of youngsters
      Incident carried on for a few minutes. At about the time the players
      came out he was pushed by strong surge forward. In itself this did
      not worry him except that the surge did not move back as normal. He
      was still not too concerned at that point as he expected it would
      right itself inja short time. He then remembers two girls crying and
      being lifted up and taken out by the Police. Following this, two or
      three were not allowed out. It seemed obvious to him that the
      Police could not have realised what was going on. By this time he
      was up near the front. He remembers the pitch gate opening in the
      time between the players coming out and 14.59, and it was after that
      he finished up at the front near Mr Baron. The Police were assisting.
      The time interval between the girls coming out, pushing the people
      back, and helping, was very short. He put his head down so people
      further back could climb out more easily.    He could see St Johns
      Ambulance man giving oxygen.
      He felt the opening of the gate created more problems for him because
      of crowd movement towards it but he also thought it probably helped
      to save lives. He thought that the way to clear the pen would have
      been from the rear. He initially said that he knew that people at
      the rear knew what was going on and did go out but, during re­
      examination and cross-examination he in the end said that his friends
      had left because they were worried for their own safety and that they
      did not know what was going on. 'He also said that at 14.35 approx
      one of his friends lost a shoe which got caught in the barrier, this
      had worried him but it really wasn't anything. As far as the people
      exiting through the pitch gate were concerned, and climbing the fences,
      these were certainly initially able to move under their own steam.

                                                                 /cont.

W M DUCKWORTH (continued...)

He felt that because of his position and his wedging, he would have
to go up over the fence rather than go out at the back. His timing
in relation to the St Johns Ambulance man seems somewhat faulty as
he obviously placed him as quite early on.
It was obvious to him that the people around him were both distressed
and complaining, but he did not think it was obvious to the P.O.s
when they pushed the people back and, although initially he said he
thought people at the back knew what was going on, he then recanted
from that.

134, GERARD BARON                             SON

    Travelled by car. Left 10.30, arrived Sheffield about 12.30. Into
    ground , 1 pm, onto terrace 1.15-1.20. He parked at Halfords, saw
    hardly anyone on the grass verge, about 8/10 people. He was searched
    but his Dad was not, at the turnstiles. Entered terrace via tunnel.
    Not too bad at that time. He had great difficulty in recounting
    events in relation to time as he was unconscious for a period.
    He initially said that it became uncomfortable at 2.15 but he was
    unable to relate it to any event, eg. beachball, players on pitch,
    pre-match kick-off, post-match. On the other hand he seemed to have
    very good recollection of hearing people shout to the Police and
    pleading with them and that a 10/11 year old boy was definitely pushed
    back into the pen by a P.C. His statement was put to him (page 4-5).
    He agreed that, although the times in it were guesses, he believed
    them to be as accurate as he could get them. From that statement it
    seems that he thought the pen was normally full at 2 pm, manageable
    but uncomfortable after the players left the pitch for kick-around,
    then steady increase over 30/40 minutes (this would take us to 2.40
    to 2.50), at which point it became unbearable. Following this there
    was a sudden surge, immense pressure, he was separated from his Dad.
    In his statement he was able to recollect people shouting to the Police
    "open the gates, there are people dying here" and repeats the incident
    with the boy. When pressed it would seem he could not actually see
    the gate closed but he assumed that it was.

 Travelled by coach. Stopped off at pub off Ml at about 12 noon, stayed
 about an hour. Coach had been stopped, searched and tickets checked.
 Arrived at coach park about 2 pm, walked down Halifax Road with Dad.
 Went through cordon of Police. Six officers across pavement and ^
 road, fans were being stopped and told to drink up. Arrived
 Leppings Lane, no particular problems getting through. Parted from
  his Dad, had a stand ticket. He went into the North stand, did not
  notice anything until match stopped. He then thought it was a pitch
  invasion. He noticed some police dogs, only realised something was
  wrong when he saw the fans on the field.

    Went round to Gate 3, acknowledged the gate officer.   There was some
     discrepancy as to when they went round. Initially he said players
     were on pitch. When challenged by his statement (kick-off had occurred)
     he said that that must be right (compare all the other officers'
     accounts). Great, deal of noise. Gate officer standing looking at
     gate from edge of pitch. Noticed gate opening, five men ran out, they
     did not seem distressed or in any trouble. He caught hold of one and
     pitch officer and possibly another, put all of them back into pen.
     Gatewas shut. He said there was no difficulty in getting them in,
     nor any protest. They were not distressed in his view. He did not
      hear any screams, in particular did not hear "let us out" or "God
      help us" (Hooson). There was nothing that he saw to suggest imminent
     danger but he did agree that the crowd was very densely packed, more
      so than he had seen before, but he could only see their faces, his
      attention was fixed further back. He did not notice until considerably
      later people at the fence. He described people gesturing, spitting
      and swearing. He was again asked about the fan he took back,("Mrs
    . McBrien) He had no recollection of any conversation with the fan,
      nor was any sign of fear or panic on his face. The gate opened
      again, three more fans came out. He was about to put one back when,
      for some reason, he realised that help was needed and started pulling
      people out and doing his best. He said at the time he did not see any
      reason for not putting the fans back, he now realises that he was in
      error then, but it could not be undone. As far as the people who
      ran out were concerned, both the five and the three came out freely
      without any difficulty, there did not seem to be a great surge behind
      them. He thought the problem arose when people tripped over, others
      fell over them and crowd   pressure did not allow them to get out.
      He confirmed that, reading between the lines of the operational order,
      the intention was that people should not be allowed on the pitch and
      that he had received no brief re overcrowding.

      *   The man he escorted back to the pen offered no resistance, he was
          holding his right arm.

From the time of arrival to the time of first opening, closure and
re-opening and rescue, could be measured in seconds and he also
said he had no real idea of the passage of time. Oddly he kept
referring to the fact that it seems slow to him, although in fact
it went very fast.     He could not see what, if anything, the pitch
officer was looking atwhen he was gazing into the pen.

PC COOPER                       PART OF SERIAL 16
Was asked to go on the pitch. Got to just past Gate 3, players on pitch,
he faded the pen, he could see people pushed against the fence and
could hear shouts and screams but took it that these were simply in
a normal forward push which would relax in a moment. He noticed the
gate bursting open and a few fans coming out. These were put back,
he was unable to see by whom. Gate was then shut. Within 30 seconds
of this he could see that fans were distressed, gate was opened and
people initially came out on their own. He did not think they were
particularly distressed and was intending to usher them into Pen 2.
It was shortly after this that assistance was required to get people
out. He assessed that only three officers could work at the gate and
for a time stepped back. He remembered formation of a conveyor belt.
He also recollected instructions to form a chain but was unable to
recognise either Greenwood or Nesbitt.
He confirmed that he acted on his own initiative and did not receive
instructions. He agreed that the fans were put back when people looked
distressed but at that time, in his judgement, this was simply a push
forward, part and parcel of a normal football match and he did not at
that stage see it as a serious incident. He did not remember where
the gate officer was located.

    Travelled by car, departed 9.30, arrived Sheffield 11.30. Entered
    stadium 1.30, onto terrace 2.00, Pen 4. Initial evidence that
    terrace really became bad at about 3 pm or just before. Challenged
    re statement (2.30 he had said). Upshot of his evidence I think was
    that they were tight like sardines at 2.45 but things did not really
    get significantly bad until the teams came out. The crush was like
^   a normal one except that it didn't relax. He said he was not pushed
    a great deal as they were unable to move because of the packing.
    He said that at some point earlier someone had been trapped against
    the barrier but he had come off and wasn't hurt. He described P.O.s
    making people go back into the Pen but it would appear that this
    was simply by signals, finger movements, which were obeyed. There
    was one episode where he said PO tapped a person's hand to make him
    go back. He thought this occurred at about 3.10 to 3.15 but said
    that he didn't know what was happening on the field and there did
    not appear to be large numbers of people around. He also agreed
    with Miss Addelman that he did not know what words had passed
    between the officer and the fan or on what that fan was standing.

       Boys went on their own towards terracing. He and his wife went
       up to the stands, getting there about 2.30. Could see terraces
       were fairly crowded. Very difficult to assess his timing, seems
       to describe the start of match and that gates were not opened
       until well after that. Agreed he had not noticed people being
       pressed against barrier prior to kick-off. Limited view of terrace,
       possibly limited view of fencing, although very firm the gate was
       not being opened. Said that he had not seen officers and others
       signalling for people to go back until shown his statement which he
       agreed was substantially correct but not quite. (CHECK TRANSCRIPT)

       Very similar evidence to Mr Steele. She never sat down, was standing
       in the Stands.   At 2.30 terrace looked full but comfortable.
       Remembers players coming onto pitch, toss of coin, nothing else
       of game because attention diverted to terracing. Realised something
       was wrong, people were being pulled up, one man tried to squeeze
       past her and said something to the effect that people were dying.
       He made no attempt to leave the stand.   She agreed with Mr Payne
       the visual evidence, if correct, indicated gate open 15.59. Events
       described started after toss of coin at 15.55. She said people near
       her were shouting for gate to be opened. They could clearly see
       what was happening on terrace.

    commented to friend that he would expect the gates of the tunnel to
    be closed to control crowd. Uncomfortable. Things became tense when
    the players came out. He became distressed, noticed that someone
    was being pulled up into the stand. Though that people were being
    lifted up between 2.50 and 3 pm. Never entered his head to climb
    out or leave pen at that point. Nevertheless, felt at 2.20 to 2.25
    that crowd was very large and Police might have taken steps to
    control ingress. Recounted league match experience in January 1989

     face him, called towards police officer outside, close by, no

     had opened gate. Tried to lift Adam over fencing, unable to do so.
     Quite sure Adam had fainted by then. Lost consciousness. Thinks
     he was in match-viewing position for one or two minutes before

      Very big crush and, not seeing the Landrover, did not get out.
      Managed to get a cup of tea in the Gym. Sat down and was asked
      to leave. Evidence appeared to be that real awareness of difficulty
      when arrived at Gate 4 although statement indicates (and he agreed
      with this) that he began to sense something was not quite right
      as he made his way further along the track towards the South side.
      Describes fears about opening gate. Thoughts about discipline,
      but did not hold him up. He agreed this was because he had been
      taught that the perimeter gate should not be opened except in specific
      circumstances. Agreed that people had to be helped out.
      Confirmed ,presence of PC Akred Sosnowski and that he was joined
      by Sgt Swift (note this re timing on photograph). He saw other
      officers on track, spoke to a track officer (query who) and told
      them to get help. Also spoke to an Inspector, suggested serial
      to the back, poor response from Inspector who he describes as "non­

     surging, initially not alarmed, crowd not distressed. Surge did
     not retreat and, in the time it took to look away and back again,
     he noticed that people were crushed and distressed, and heard calls.
     Approached Gate 4 with PC Hooson.   Gate opened, people needed to
     be helped out.
     Agreed with Mr Payne that it would have taken about two minutes
     to get from the Gym to Pen 4. Therefore alerted to incident at
     a time on or before 14.57, based on scheduled time of Gate 4 opening.
     Described fans further back not particularly concerned but, as
     disaster progressed, people panicked and came over other people's
     heads from further back. These wer much fitter than the ones at
     the front.

    Based at Sheffield Midland Station, directing fans. Arrived Leppings

    Shortly thereafter told to go onto pitch. Walked on perimeter
    track past the North stand. Could see people being pulled into
    stands, players on pitch, game notstarted. Noticed central pens
    full, stopped at funnel, instructed serial to take up position.
    Was called over because serials had noticed distress. He viewed
    the situiation, assessed whether people could be exited and re­
    admitted in Pens 6 and 7. Unable to use radio because of traffic,
    signalled to control that he was opening gate, did not do so himself
    but it was opened, no recollection of it being shut again. Had
    expected people to pour out but in fact they had to be pulled out.
    Initial lot not too serious, people not far back appeared oblivious
    of situation. After few minutes started encouraging backward movement
    but there was panic and people came forward. If only they had
    taken a step back they would have been OK.
    He had seen no activity by the regular officers on the perimeter
    track nor had he noted people being moved to Pens 6 and 7. Difficulties
    with getting people out related to the construction of the gate
    and its narrowness. He agreed that the crush had begun before
    the game had started. He also identified himself on a photograph
    which was timed at 14.59 (15.00) hours.   He had intended to move
    the people into enclosures 6 and 7.

           could see people at back were not responding, decided to go round the back.
           Got to concourse, liaises with Sgt. Sykes, down tunnel, people obstructive,
           not keen to leave, but managed to get through quickly. Took at least two
           people out through tunnel. Tunnel became congested with rescue attempts.
           Went down into pen and started passing people forward. Came across
           Victoria, identified himself on video assisting with rescue at 15.21.
           Was satisfied before he left for the tunnel that officers on pitch were
           shouting and signalling to people at back. For whatever reason, people
           at back not responding, obviously not able to comment as to whether they
           were able to hear (but compare Mr Oyitch's evidence and Simon Hughes, and
           Anthony Grier).


           Expected to work on own initiative, did so every day, Did not think
           emergency message would have made any difference to his reaction, would
           not expect to have to wait for orders.

iffi. A LEIGH


     Mr Leigh travelled by train. Arrived early in Sheffield. At the station
     was told to wait. Ticket not checked but accent recognised. Waited about
     20 minutes to half an hour, entered bus, not checked for tickets or alcohol
     Arrived Leppings Lane 11 am. Went to pub "Horse & jockey", queued for
     1| hours and was given one bottle of Pils. Left pub at about 2.10, got
     something to eat, went down to ground 2.40. Got through crowd, not too
     bad. Through turnstile, entered Pen 4. Initially not too bad, was near
     the back singing, then heard one name announced of the players, Ian Rush.
     From then massive surge, carried through barrier. Estimated time from
     announcement to surge about five minutes. People distressed around him.
     He was not too bad. Shouting and screaming to Police. Remembers one
     officer, couldn't hear what he said but believes in his mind that he said
     "shut up you dickhead". Couldn't see or remember anything that occurred
     on the pitch. After that everything more or less hazy. Ended up between
     Pens 4 and 5 and helped out in that area.

IIS . GARY OYITCH


     Friend of P Goodman.      Entered ground more or less same time.   Stayed initially
     with Marion and Inger at the front, then joined Philip Goodman at the rear.
     Couldn't see, made his way back to the front at 2.40. Had to force his
     way through. Stood next to Marion. Thought there was a tight crush from
     about 2.40 onwards. Remembers team being announced and discussing names
     with Marion. No further recollection of events except for three surges,
     On the first he climbed onto fence and was told to get down by fan, surge
     gave him space to do so. On the second surge he did not climb, the third
     surge left him pinned against fence, unable to move. Could see Inger getting
     worse from then.    Unable to relate surges to events, except in so far
     as they occurred after team announcement - probably lost consciousness.
     Could not get through the gate which was close by because he was trapped.
     Eventually freed himself. Remembers police officer patting his face through
     the fencing     to try to revive him.
P GOODMAN

Train journey from London, early entry about 1.30.   No problems whatsoever.


Was with Marion and Inger at the front, couldn't see well and decided to go
to the rear. Stood right against the wall in Pen 3, three or four persons
away from open gate. Stood there throughout the match, tight but not distressed
at any time. Cheered the announcement of team, saw players come out, saw
complete match and saw Beardsley's ball hitting the cross-bar. Saw people
climb into the stands a few minutes before kick-off, was within inches of
them. They were not distressed, he thought they were merely joining their
friends like in 1988 when they did it at half-time. Could see fans 2 or
3 minutes into play on perimeter signalling to go back. Couldn't/didn't
as he was against the wall. Saw no-one apart from one or two people use
the exit gangways. Had no difficulty in enjoying match and participating
in singing etc.


He was a bit upset.   Identified himself on Exhibit 360.

J/fc. P TAYLOR

     Travelled by coach, Barnes, left 9.15, arrived Sheffield 2.05. No stops,
     long delays on Snake Pass because Police searching minivans. Coach not
     searched. Arrived turnstile 2.25. Perimeter gates probably open. Horse
     spun round, created gap, went into it. Officer was shouting "stop pushing" but
     DQt practical. Another horse in enclosure relieved itself, thus creating
     gap. Pushed forward, got to turnstile, remainder climbed onto or over
     other people. Got onto terrace about 2.30. No big problems. Standing
     near barrier talking to a girl. Liverpool supporter decided to relieve
     himself. Witness didn't like this so moved to side fence. This is the
     barrier which broke. This was about 14.45. Saw a few people climb over
     and then used his leg as a stile to help people across. Initially people
     queued orderly, but as kick-off approached, panic set in. Up to then seems
     not particularly distressed himself but after that he helped his brother-
     in-law across and then things became rather tight for him. At kick-off
     approx. he was turned round to face the stand. Did not see anyone leave
     via gate at the back. A pile of bodies developed near him and he started
     passing them across, initially to supporters but then to Police Officers.
     He moved towards the gate, picked up a girl whose leg was trapped, applied
     the Kiss of Life but realised she was dead.

     This witness wept.
     He weighs 18 stone but at the time was only 13 stone.

US   L TUDOR

     Travelled by train. Arrived Sheffield 1.30. Arrived at Turnstile 2.20.
     He had been eating chips in Leppings Lane. Did not want to enter then but   ^
     was ushered along by mounted officers. Would have avoided entry if he           fn
     could have done because it was too early for him. Took ten minutes to get
     through turnstile. Entered terrace, Pen 3, via tunnel at about 2.30. No
     problems. Things started getting tighter towards 2.30 - 2.45 but things
     became considerably worse when players on pitch.

     Throughout he was not particularly worried as he anticipated that the crush
     would ease off once kick-off had taken place. In fact this did not happen
     and the crush became worse with time. He recollects that at one point,
     for no reason, the crush became even stronger and contr-ibute-s this to the
     barrier breaking. He had also described surging on the terraces from 2.30
     onwards. Uncomfortable. Could not give a reason why it occurred but could
     be people falling over or voluntarily movement. At one point between 14.54
     and kick-off he was at the pitch gate, he was calling to police officers
     to open the gate - a little boy at the front. He was calling because he
     was concerned for the boy, not because he was worried about himself. The
     police officer did not respond in any way and it appeared to him that he
     had not heard. He then moved to one side and it was after that he became
     fixed but was able to breath throughout. He was standing next to Mr Baron (?)
     Recollects the oxygen being brought but considerably later.

       Travelled by car. Arrived 1.15 Sheffield. Arrived Leppings Lane turnstile
       about 2.30. Relatively free entry to turnstile area. Then became crushed.
       Was therefore at least until 2.50 once crush over. Saw Gate 'C' open and
       went through. No recollection of climbing under or over funnel bar.
       Query location. Concourse clear, man in front stumbling. Looking for
       programme seller, approached tunnel. Could see pens were crowded and had
       been warned by friends not to go. Went to right to Pen 1. No recollection
       of players on pitch but conceded in cross-examination that arrival time
       probably 14.54 - 14.55. Saw 30 supporters pulled up, worried stand might
       collapse, could see central pens were crushed. He was worried about them
       but he could not identify specific distressed people. Saw no Police Officers
       on P.O box steps. He and others tried to attract police attention with
       no success.


       Kick-off - people were being taken over front fence. When he saw the (
       he exited via Gate 1. Match had stopped by then, assisted with resusitating
       one or two people, then Sarah, position hopeless.


       His impression was that the terrace was overcrowded and the people were
       trying to reduce pressure. Present in 1988, approached ground by Middlewood
       Road both years at about same time. 1988 recollects barriers for ticket
       checking. Cannot remember if they blocked the whole road. Said they were
       being checked for tickets and alcohol - had not happened this year (but

       Had been taken through photos by Mr Payne. Felt that because he was further

       missed others going into stands.   Nor could people standing behind have
       missed it.

From Bristol. Entered terracing with his friend, S Fortune.
Didn't enjoy 'rushes' at about 2.30. Took refuge in front of the
barrier. Hicks girls moved as well, probably for same reason.
OK then, average for big game. At 14.45 noticed that younger
girl was being held up by the older girl. Seemed to have either
fainted or was in some sort of distress. Felt that people in
pen were trying to attract attention of people outside. Between
14.45 and 14.50 crush became worse and girls disappeared from
sight. Last seen at about 14.45. Some difficulty on timing,
statement refers to having caught a glimpse of Hicks girls later
when man trying to ask people to push back. This was about 14.55
according to statement. No longer able to correctly remember the
times.
Conformed to Mr Isaacs that crush was severe just before team came
out and he was worried for his life.

Travelled from Bristol by coach. Departed 8.30, arrived Motorway
Junction 12.30. Police check on coach, checked for both tickets
and for alcohol. Early entry, searched twice at entrance.
Entered Pen 3 about 1.45, began to build up 14.15, bit of pushing
and shoving, decided to move nearer the front, protected by
barrier, where it was quieter. Not uncomfortable at 2.30. Got
really unconfortable 14.40 to 14.45. Challenged with statement
which indicates no discomfort 14.45 but recollection now poor.
Claims discomfort 14.50, query after team being announced?.
Shouting for gates to be opened possibly 14.55. First noticed
Hicks girls at 14.40, had been crying, didn't like the pushing
referred to earlier. Did not see either of them faint, people
shouted for them to be got out, no response, lots of noise.
He became distressed probably about 14.55, pressure build-up
initially slowly then sudden surge. Totally unable to remember
events on field but he himself not in particular trouble until
perhaps 20 minutes later when people around him were going
purple. Heard police shouting to people to push back, people
climbing over his head to get out. At one point was able to
speak to his friends who seemed to be OK.
Always able to move his arms, remembers beach ball, no problems
at that time.
In reply to Mr King, excessive tightness about 14.55 and it was
\ hour or 20 minutes after that.
Recollects part of barrier being thrown over the fence. Thinks
people were on fencing at that time. Recollects gate bursting
open on two occasions and it being shut on both occasions. Thinks
period during iwhich police did not respond was about 2/3 minutes.
Agreed it might be that they did not hear, but didn't know.
Felt it was pretty obvious what was going on.

Travelled from Carlton, Lancs, by car, arrived about 11.30.
Leppings Lane 1.15, searched twice. Entered terrace, Pen 3,
virtually empty. 14.20 started filling up, began to feel              95
uncomfortable 14.45 to 14.50. Noticed the two Hicks sisters,
the younger fainted prior to players on pitch. At that point he
was slightly squashed but OK, worried about her because of the
faint. She revived after a couple of minutes and said "yes, I am
fine". This definitely happened before players were announced.        97
People called to PO to get the girls out as he thought they looked
distressed but girls did not want to go. Remembers goalie in goal,
massive surge forward, like normal match, but this one stuck (query
whether this occurred when goalie on pitch). Recollection of Gate
3 opening about five minutes after surge, opened by fans, shut by
Police. Found it distressing on terrace between 2.45 and 2.50         100
(times are an estimate because he was fighting for his life).
Unable to move. In reply to Mr Manning, the Hicks girls kept          102
shouting "&o don't want to go, we want to stay"..

Mr Marshall was Superintendent outside the ground. Very high regard
for Mr Mole. 1988 was a Police success. Recollects some transfer
into stands, recollects centre pens being full, no concrete visible.


Did not attend the brief but nothing new. Did not think officers
would normally be on terrace pre kick-off unless sent in. Fans
fexpected to find their own level.
Overcrowding could not arise because capacity should not be exceeded
No means of counting people in the pens.     Little experience of
capacity crowds.     Agreed difficulty in deciding when a pen is
overcrowded.
Not aware of closing of tunnel.
Operational orders for 1988 and 1989 substantially the same.
38% or so of Police Officers employed in the match.
Concerned about safety of people outside and inside the stadium.
Prepared for day by condensing order. Patrolled the ground, lots
of people drinking from four-packs.
Leppings Lane about 2.20ish, everything OK.     His view is that
requests for closing the road was 2.25 approx,i.e. later than Supt
Murray's log. Discussed with Mr Sykes. People had problems finding
their way. Holding area for ticketless fans on Leppings Lane bridge
discussed with Mr Sykes.
Very difficult to weed tick^jt+efs^Sans out.
Not particularly anxious ^6t 2.30Ja<ft from then onward more and more
people came, situation deteriorated. At 2.40 approx assistance
would be required. Tannoy messages PC Buxton, messages actioned
at 2.44.     Heard a message but could not recollect what it said.
Crowd pushing forward, unprecedented experience, aggressiveness,
resistance to advice.
Insp Purdy indicated necessity for action. Reluctant to implement
it but in the end acceded to request, used Insp Ellis's radio near
Landrover.    Timed interval between tannoy request and request to
open the gates about four minutes.     Mounted officers trying to close
perimeter gates, not held, people rushed forward, Gate A was shaking,
difficulty with estimating numbers, 6/7,000, rather than only 3/4,000
1 4 - 1 6 JANUARY 1991

10?.   R MARSHALL (Conti n u e d ...2)

Felt that unless gates w ere opened people would be crushed to death
in front of the turnstiles.
Didn't think it would be a practical proposition to seek to hold
people away from the ground, in order to stop people who were
apparently ticketless.

Did not personally request kick-off to be delayed and did not think
of it, but now knows that Insp Ellis had announced it over the
address system with no apparent effect.


XE MR PAYNE
Requested gates to be opened but had no control over order.     Was
relieved that the crush had been relieved.   Did not at that time
think that injury would be caused within the ground.
Expects POs to act independently. With regard to pushing would
expect people to use their heads and in his view a very significant
minority were the problem.
Felt that unless something was done they would be counting bodies
outside the ground.

MR KING XE

Assumed terrace would not be overcrowded because of safety certificate
i.e. fixed capacity. No specific instructions to look for over­
crowding because the issue did not a r i s e . Difficulty with seeing
radial gates when terrace crowded and in those circumstances became
self-contained. Discussion regarding the obviousness in planning,
no specific planning decision to divert fans, relies on observation.
No positive steps to ensure even distribution apart from observations
by officers, which is difficult. Restriction on people entering
turnstile area depended nn jn anpnw pp. forming queues. Nothing specific
in the order but about(47)j^fficers plus mounted staff to safeguard
and marshall the crowd. Law and order specification (850 officers)
because of public order problems with football crowds.

     Mr Duckerydield's briefing related to safety.                            58     *
     Late arrivals can be anticipated.     Agreed that the police had not
     done any advance work on the number of people through turnstiles
     but these opened at 12 noon and had worked satisfactorily in 1988.
     He assumed throughput 1000 per hour when money isn't changing
     hands.    Problems with large numbers of late arrivals obvious with
     hindsight, particularly in the light of 1988 experience. Discussion
     re placing cordon "too late" across perimeter gate, crushing in
|   turnstile area having already occurred.     Two steps taken, closing
     gates anc* putting cordon, plus foot officers..? Spectators too had
^   a responsibility not to crush into an area where people are in
     distress. He had about 70 POs plus 17 mounted doing their best.          69/70          *
     Presence of police force was to control the crowd. He had not
     forseen th^t after 14.40 thousands of people would come.    He
     said thitf 3jy p e o p l e had been injured outside.                     71
     Criticism of reliance on 1988 situation.                                 Day 30

    K i ck-off. Delay mentioned by Mr Duckenfield. extraneous causes,
    delayed kick-off would enable people to get in if they were late
    but there were spinoffs.
    Agreed that closing Leppings lane was an unprecedented decision.
    Reinforcements at 14.44 plus Landrover. Did not accept that numbers
    in themselves were the only cause, sheep-like behaviour also an
    element. Could see Landrover and broadcasting but cannot recollect
    what was being said.
    N ’B - He only learned that Insp Ellis had broadcast that the kick-off
    was being postponed, after the event.
    He agreed that if time pressure was removed, levels of anxiety would
    fall* He agreed that a crowded pen carries an obvious danger of
    over-crowding if more people go into it.
    N -B - this presupposes of course that the crowding is noted.
    He confirmed that it was ground control who took the decision to
    open the gate, not h i m . _ _ _ _                                       11,12       *

    He did not hear any warnings to anybody that the gates would be
    opened. He did not concern himself where the people were going
    because he was busy but judging by the numbers outside at 14.44 he
    thought the terraces would be empty.                                     13
 DAYS 29 - 31



 109.   R MARSHALL (continued    4)

 Mr Marshall agreed that the possibility of diverting fans should
 be a consideration bearing in mind that the tunnel is an obvious
 route. He thought it was highly dangerous to close the tunnel
 g a t e s . He agreed that if the middle pens are noted to be full
 and crowded then it is obvious that to avoid overcrowding steps
 sh#uld be taken to divert people.


 He agreed with MR CATCHPOLE that he was an experienced officer and
 that the operational order was drafted on that basis, that it was
 addressed to experienced officers. He agreed that his experience
 on the day was unprecedented. F ans not responding to advice or
amenable to regulations, that no report of problems in 1988 had
been received but the system which had been used for sequential
filling depended upon assessment of crowd densities.


He agreed with MRS MCBRIEN that he had not complained about the
operational order. Capacity was 10,100 but no way of counting
into i n d i p 4 u a l pens. He agreed with Mrs McBrien that in 1988
(same/fmnberjs) people had entered without difficulty. He had
about 70 officers there at the height of the crisis. He agreed
thaK££«wfiunications were important. He said it was impossible
to expect the Police to check every person for tickets.                     41
Had made contingency plans for ticketless fans with Insp Sykes.
At 2.15 not worried by fans' behaviour, closed Leppings Lane
because he was worried about road traffic accidents. Agreed that
they were overwhelmed by numbers and crowd behaviour.                       52
Agreed that at 14.47 they had lost control of the situation.
Apart from the serial which had come up (? Sgt Higgins) nobody
else immediately available. Took the view that unless gates were
opened people would be killed. It enabled control of the situation
outside to be regained. Opening of the gate was for safety reasons.
He explained that policing was by consent and that riot shields and
water cannon were not acceptable means of crowd control in England
at football matches.                                               61   *
 DAYS 29 - 31



 109.   R MARSHALL (continued   5)

 He still did not think that delaying kick-off would have made any
 difference, even with hindsight, but he did not request it.
 Crowd were not taking notice of messages anyway.   He did not think
 there was any possibility of forcing the people into the sterile
 area. Opening gates is contrary to normal police practice. Had
 to balance the risk of ticketless fans getting in against possib­
 ility of injuries.                                                    73

 MR RUSSELL XE

 Flashpoint - Liverpool fans in Kop in 1988.
Agreed that playing with beach ball etc were signs of normality.
Whether he could hear the words of PC Buxton or not he was satisfied
he was imploring people.


MR PAYNE XE

Never had this sort of experience with a football crowd before.
Request for opening gates made when they had been overwhelmed.
Unprecedented situation.                                               82
He agreed with Mr Payne that with the state of knowledge as it
was before the match, it was not obvious to him that the crowd
would rush down the tunnel into a full pen, in a normal situation.
He agreed that there had been criticisms by Mr King re planning
and the radial fences, crowd control and distribution. He agreed
that nobody before the disaster had made these criticisms to him,
the Club, the Engineer, the FA or the City or Liverpool or the
Fire Service.


MR ISAACS XE

In normal circumstances late arrivals would be a small proportion
of an overall crowd, in contrast to 1989. He said that anxiety of
not getting in would arise as kick-off approached but in normal
circumstances people would remain patient and that he had not been
forewarned by experience that the majority of fans would behave in
the way which he saw. He had been taken by surprise by the events.
109.   R MARSHALL (continued__ 6)

He agreed that the view to Leppings Lane was limited.     Diversion
of fans at the tunnel depends upon other demeanors.


MRS MCBRIEN XE FURTHER

He agreed that difficulties at the turnstiles was a contributory
factor.   He agreed that if the correct number of fans had gone in
through the turnstiles there would have been no safety problem
that day. .


He agreed with MR HALE that the total time he had to consider that
was about four minutes. He agreed that barriers sometimes inflamed
people (Mr Langley). He agreed with Mr Thompson's view that anythi
other than bricks and mortar would have fallen down that day.
He agreed there was nothing in the order about pyrotechnics or what
to do about stabbings.
Mr Marshall had some difficulty in reconciling numbers.
Postponing kick-off presents problems.
General practice is to restrict it to extraneous circumstances,
it needs decision, communication and acceptance.
Mr Marshal said when asked that if the crowd had been minded to
comply it could have done so, i.e. individually.

Q. That's Barnsley, Doncaster, Rotherham and Sheffield as
   well? - A. Yes.

Q. The whole lot for that is 3,000? - A. Yes, sir, in round
   figures.

Q. Which you have to divide, as you have explained to me, to
   get shifts, subject to adjustments? - A. Yes.

Q. About 850 men were actually employed on this one fixture?
   - A. The total in fact did exceed that because the
   officers from D Division, that is the city centre
   Division, mounted their own operation to meet trains,
   along with officers from the Traffic Division who were
   also mounting an operation for traffic control.

Q.   I just wanted to get an impression of the numbers
     involved.   You attended the next briefing on the 15th
     where you had all these chaps, including yourself, being
     addressed by Chief Superintendent Duckenfield? - A. Yes.

Q.   At that briefing was anything said firstly with regard to
     law and order? - A. Yes.   Mr. Duckenfield went through
     the briefing which he - it was basically a repetition of
     what he had given on the Friday previously.

Q. Pick out the main points he made as far as you    can
    remember. - A. Well, there are a whole list of points.
    If I can start by saying that we wanted the fixture to
    take place properly.   We wanted to police it
(   professionally.  We were concerned about thesafety   of
    people, both outside and inside the stadium.  We were
    concerned that the life of the community which surrounds
    Hillsborough Football Ground should go on in as normal a
    way as possible.   We were concerned to see that people
    who were coming into Sheffield from Nottingham and from
    Liverpool behaved themselves in a manner which was
    proper.   We were concerned to see that people got to the
    parking areas and what would happen to them at the
    parking areas, both from the point of view      of being met
    and spoken to.     The general ethos was one    of
    professionalism, determination to see that the event went
    off properly and to do a good job.

Q. Can you remember   when any specific mention was   madeof
   any difficulties   anticipated? - A. Well, there is always
   provision in respect of emergency evacuation and that is
   clearly something which every officer needs to be aware
   of.   There is a strict code of practice laid down in
   respect of that.   A coded message exists which is passed
   out over the tannoy and that was stressed.    If officers
   heard that message coming out on the ground tannoy they
   would be aware that some emergency existed and they would
   need to gear up their level of thinking to what they were
                                                                  23

          were asking for spares, or otherwise asking for
          tickets? - A. I would find the greatest of difficulty
          in giving you any reliable answer about that, sir.

        0. At about quarter-past-2 then, you returned to the
    B      ground? - A. Yes.

        0. Hot having been particularly dismayed at that stage by
           anything? - A. What did dismay me, sir, were the
           numbers of people who were drinking in the street.
           That was something which I personally felt rather sad
           about, that people would need to drink such a lot of
           alcohol really to enjoy what should have been a
           pleasant afternoon of sport.

        0. But it is fair to say although you personally did not
\          like it, in itself .... - A. There was not a great deal
           I could do about it.

        o, They were not actually doing anything which you could
           have done anything about? - A. No, despite the amount
           of drinking which was going on the prevailing mood was
           quite good, no real problems.
    D   0. You then returned to Leppings Lane, right, and do you
           know about what time you got there? - A. It would be
           about 2 p.m., sir.

        0. When you first got there at that time what was it like?
           - A. Again it was very congested with people moving
           about, queues at the turnstiles, people going into the
           ground, a lot of people milling around.

        0. Problems, at 2 o'clock? - A. Nothing that as not
           anticipated at that stage.

        0. Describe to me then what happened from then onwards as
           far as you were concerned? - A. Well, I patrolled in
           the area; I checked on the deployment of the police
           officers who were working there.   There was a Chief
           Inspector Creaser who was in charge of police
           deployment at Leppings Lane turnstiles; Inspectors
           Sykes and l’urdy who were both experienced officers
           working there, along with four sergeants and forty
           constables, both male and female; five or six police
           horses, again botii South Yorkshire officers and
           Merseyside officers, working in that area; busy,
           carnival atmosphere, a lot of people, nothing at that
           stage to become anxious or alarmed about.   My
           perception was that this was a typical semi-final and
           at that stage everything was going to plan.

        0. Was this when the train contingent had already arrived
           or had it not got there then as far as you remember? -
                                R. MARSHALL


So what you are saying is, let us assume for a minute
that this had not been a tragedy, if you have a group
of ticketless fans close to the ground, even if they
cannot actually see, if they can hear, this helps the
enjoyment if they can listen to the radio or watch a
TV I suppose? - A. Well, it achieves two things, i.e.
it helps the non-ticketholders to get a flavour of
what is happening and it solves the policing problem.

Would it have been a practical proposition to try and
weed them out and disperse them elsewhere? - A. This
is an enormously difficult problem, insofar as people
will not readily admit to being a non-ticketholder.
If asked, there is usually some explanation, that
their mate has got a ticket, or their brother has got
a ticket, or they are going to buy a ticket, or some
other explanation, but it is no easy task when there
is a crowd of many, many thousands of people to
actually tease out the people who do not have tickets.

Supposing that this had been done, say, at the coach
reception points, or the mini-van reception points.
Would it have been possible to do it there, or when
they were coming down Halifax Road, for instance? -
A. So far as the coach visitors were concerned, there
were two checks, one at Tankersley as one leaves the
motorway and one at Oughtibridge, which is a couple of
miles on the westside of the ground, to try at that
stage to discover people who were attending without
tickets and people who were carrying intoxicants on
coaches, and so forth. When coaches had been
searched, they were given a sticker to put on the
windscreen which would obviate further searching.
There was coach parking in Clay Wheels Lane and in
Halifax Road, and space for mini-coaches in Wardsend
Road.  At each of those locations were serials of
officers who were working under my control who had
been briefed that they must check that the coach
passengers and mini-bus passengers had tickets.   Now
that was generally achieved, but as I am sure the
Inquest will appreciate, it is a different proposition
to actually stop and ask every other person who is
attending who has not been a coach passenger whether
he or she has a ticket for the fixture.

What I am trying to find out - I have heard what you
have said - is assume for the moment that your
officers at Tankersley, or somewhere else, got onto a
coach and said, "Everybody got a ticket?" and half-a-
dozen people put their hands up and said, "No, we
haven't".  What could they have done, and what powers
did they have? - A. They have no powers whatsoever in
respect of detaining those persons.  The fact is they
would note the presence of people without tickets and

                                                 R. MARSHALL


Q. You have mentioned that there was pushing twice. You
   have mentioned that. Can you describe what you mean
   by that term? - A. Just a strong pressure moving
   forward all the time, completely oblivious of the
   welfare of other people, a completely unprecedented
   experience in my experience, people aggressively
   pushing forward completely resistant to advice or
   instructions from the Police Officers who were there,
   from the mounted Officers and from other members of
   the crowd.

Q. Could you hear members of the crowd communicating
   with people or not? - A. Not in so many words. There
   was an enormous amount of anger and aggressiveness.
   People were upset that they were being subjected to
   that sort of treatment.

Q. This is a deduction you have made from looking at the
   crowd? - A. Yes.

Q. Time was marching on at this stage? - A. Yes, it was,
   sir.

Q. So far as the match itself was concerned? - A. Yes.

Q. Could the anger have been that they felt they were
   not going to get in? - A. Yes, that is possible. The
   situation was deteriorating by the minute, from 2.35
   onwards. There wasn't an enormous amount through the
   turnstiles that I could see and so clearly there were
   difficulties there. Time itself was imposing an
   urgency on the crowd.

Q. When you say there was pushing and aggressiveness,
   and you have used various words to describe it, can
   you say from where it was emanating from? I do not
   mean can you deduce, but did you see where it was
   emanating from? - A. It was emanating really from the
[ back of the crowd.

Q. Clearly we have heard from many other people but the
   people right at the front, say at the turnstiles,
   what was happening to them? - A. They were being
   crushed.

Q. They were not in a position to do much about that? -
   A. That is right.

Q. You would agree with that, would you not? - A. Yes, I
   would.

Q. What I am trying to find out is how far back in the
   crowd did you notice forward activity? - A. There
   wasn't a finite line to the crowd. The crowd was
   being supplemented all the time from two sources,
   from people coming from the Leppings Lane roundabout

                                                  R. MARSHALL



Q. Can you estimate how many about? - A. It is very hard
   to be accurate but probably about 6,000 or 7,000
   people.

Q. It is difficult for you to answer this question
   because you have not done many Semi Finals but have
   you done big League matches in that area? - A. Yes.

Q. With what sort of numbers? - A. 3,000 and 4,000.

Q. Pardon? - A. 3,000 or 4,000, probably more.

Q. I am sorry, 3,000 or 4,000 supporters? - A. The
   situation really is, if perhaps I can explain, is
   somewhat different at League games in so far as it is
   easier to get people actually into the ground because
   normally coaches are permitted to unload in Leppings
   Lane and you can control the numbers of people
   actually getting off coaches and going into the
   turnstiles at will but when you have virtually a
   capacity crowd that is not feasible.

Q. So you had a very big crowd there? - A. Yes.

Q. Outside those gates and, in fact, bigger than you
   ever had before would it be fair to say at that time?
   - A. It was the same numbers that had been there in
   the year previous in 1988.

Q. No, I am talking about you? - A. Personally, yes,
   sir.

Q. The situation outside the ground then ameliorated.
   It improved? - A. Not immediately, sir.

Q. Tell me? - A. Because large numbers of people still
   were flooding into the area.  In fact, after three
   o'clock there were still substantial numbers of
   people coming into the area of the turnstiles but the
   opening of the gates alleviated the pressure on the
   people who were at the front of the crush.

Q. Are you saying to me that the primary reason for
   opening the gates was to relieve the crush of the
   people in the front? - A. That was the reason.   I
   felt that unless the gates were opened people would
   be crushed to death in front of the turnstiles.

Q. You had a concern, rightly or wrongly, that there
   would be injury or perhaps even worse? - A. I had an
   awful decision to make, sir, and I made that decision
   based on what I thought to be the circumstances
   prevailing at that time.
                                                                42


                                                           R. MARSHALL




             - A. Not at all and the reason I say that was because
             there were five or six different places that people
             could have gone, having entered through the gates.
             They could have gone round the south corner of the west
    B        stand to the area by the police control cabin; through
             the tunnel; through tne gate in the dividing wall which
             goes across the concourse; if they had gone through
             gate B they would nave gone into pens 5 and 6, or pen
             7; entrance through gate A would have taken them into
             the north stand; and of course there were the two
             entrances to the west stand which fed into the
             concourse either side of the dividing wall, so there
             was not just the one place that people could have gone
             to.

        Q. It is not difficult to see with hindsight that things
           might have been done differently but at the time, in
I          the light of the knowledge that you then had, did it
           cross your mind that this was going to cause any risk
           of injury to anyone inside the ground? - A. No, sir.

                         Cross-Examined by MR. ISAACS

        0. Mr. Marshall, just one or two points if I may so I can
           see if we can put this in perspective.  Following your
           experiences in 1988 there was nothing that you learnt
           of which caused you to think that the operation had not
           been a successful one? - A. No, sir.

        0. Notning that on the face of it appeared to be necessary
           by way of change to any future arrangement, any
           operational order, so far as the policing of
    E      Hillsborough for a semi-final was concerned? - A. Ko,
           sir.



t
        Q. You had been in the ground in 1988 and so far as in the
           ground was concerned, no reason to do anything
           differently in 1989? - A. No, sir.

        Q.   You were asked by the Coroner about the transfer of
             people from the terracing at Leppings Lane to the
             stand, and as I understand your evidence you say this,
             tnat to see as a police officer people transferring,
             being helped up by friends or by people they don't
             know, but by people who are in the stands, is not
             unusual? - A. That is right, sir.

        0.   People often v/ant a better view? - A. Yes.

        0.   Or they merely want a free stand - and by stand I mean
             sitting down seat - as opposed to a place on the
             terraces? - A. That is right, yes.

                                 /Q. Particularly
                                                              45



                                             R. MARSHALL


             at that time, and then you saw them themselves
             becoming the pushed? - A. Yes.

             But there is a time when they are, in fact, partly
             responsible for the crushing that is going on until
    B        they then cannot do anything about it? - A. That is
             right, yes.

             And the stage where the pushers become the pushed goes
             further and further back as more people join? - A.
             Yes.

             Am I right in understanding your evidence to be this,
             that up until about 2.30 you still did not have
             serious concerns that you would be able to deal with
             the matter satisfactorily? - A. Yes.

«       Q.   Then more and more and more people came to join the
             throng? - A. Yes.

        Q.   When you finally got through your message to control -
             "Unless the gates are opened at the Leppings Lane end
             people will be killed" - and I know this is very
             difficult, Superintendent, but what sort of timescale
             did you think that you had before you felt somebody
             would be killed? Are we talking about seconds here,
             in your own mind, the urgency of the situation? - A. I
             never thought of it in terms of time because it is now
             so difficult to describe in a quiet room such as this
             the sort of things that were happening before my eyes.
             It was hot, noisy, pushing, shoving, people crying
             out, clearly people crushed against the walls by the
             turnstiles, not much evidence of people going through
    E        the turnstiles, anguish written on faces and the
             mounted officers in the thick of it, anguish written
             on their faces, police officers just pushed against
             the walls, and I just felt that unless something was
             done to relieve that situation we would be counting
t            the bodies outside the ground.

        Q.   You put the urgency as you saw it in your voice as you
             put that message through? - A. Yes.

        Q.   Just one final matter:  even after people had gone
             through the gate there were still a large number of
             people to go through the turnstile and they continued
             to do so? - A. Yes.

                         Cross-Examined by MR. KING

             Mr. Marshall, can you help us on this.  You mentioned
             that grounds such as Hillsborough have a capacity
             which is worked out in advance as to how many people
             should be allowed to enter the ground? - A. Yes.

                                               R. MARSHALL




Q. But those officers were here in 1989 dealing with a
   semi-final with a capacity crowd expected, right? - A.
   Yes.

0. They don't have the experience of dealing with that day
   in day out, do they? - A. No.

0. As I understand it, the only semi-finals in recent
   years which had been at Hillsborough were '87,  88 and
   the one we are investigating today? - A. Yes.

0. The operational order goes into a lot of detail about
   matters concerned with law and order, doesn't it? - A.
   Yes.

0. They are not left to the good sense and experience of
   individual officers, are they?  It is written in what
   they should do about alcohol, weapons, fighting and so
   forth? - A. Yes.

0. Can you help - you may not be able to - why it should
   be thought they ought to go into writing and be in
   detail in a planning order, but matters relating to the
   numbers getting into a particular area for safety
   reasons isn't, is it? Can you help on that? - A. Yes,
   I certainly can.  I wonder if you have thought about
   wny there were 850 officers on duty for a football
   match? The reason why there were 850 police officers
   on duty for a football match is because the game of
   football has over the last, I suppose, 20 years,
   standards of behaviour have deteriorated to the extent
   that there are public order problems, whicti I do not
   think I need to elaborate on, and the reason why the
   police are there in sufficient numbers, in substantial
   numbers, is to counteract the problem of disorder.
   That is why the details of action to be taken in
   respect of prisoners, searching and the control of
   alcohol are written into official orders.

0. I understand that, I have sympathy with it. Unat I
   don't understand, unless the police don't regard it as
   part of their function or important, is why equal
   importance is not given in the operational orders to
   problems of crowd safety and overcrowding and crushing.
   Why don't those problems figure as well as the others
   in a planning order? - A. I submit that they do figure
   in the sense that part of Hr. Duckenfield's briefing
   related to safety, and he spoke about the need for
   safety of fans, both inside and outside the ground, but
   The main reason that police are there is to counteract
   public disorder.

         week in week out, and are sensitive to the situation
         at Leppings Lane.

         To be fair to those officers, Mr. Marshall, those
         junior officers, they had not, day in day out, been
B        dealing with large crowds arriving at a semi-final,
         had they? - A. No.

         So where would we find the instruction that their job
         was to look to see how many were in the turnstile
         area, make a judgment as to how many were already in
         and then make a decision as to whether to close off
         the area until those already in had got through? - A.
         I don't think that would be an instruction that would
         be put into the words which you have described, but it
         is part, nevertheless, of the variety of instructions
         which they would have received, and I feel quite sure
         that Inspector Sykes, knowing Sykes as I do and the
         experience which he has, would be the sort of
         individual to have imparted that sort of information
         to the officers.

         We have the evidence of Mr. Sykes, so we can look at
         that.   You are saying that that would be their
D        specific instruction? - A. Specific instruction is
         the wrong word.   I would not say it would be a
         specific instruction.   It might be more of a general
         nature.

    Q.   Whatever it be, a general instruction or a specific
         one, they did not carry it out, did they? - A. No.

    Q.   Because on any   view, before you had the problem of the
         crushing there   had not been the prevention of the
         people getting   into the area, before you had the
         crushing? - A.   No, that is true.

         The problem here is that steps were taken to reduce
         the numbers getting into the turnstile area at too
         late a stage? That is the problem which occurred
         outside the ground on the semi-final, was it not? - A.
         That is a very simplistic explanation of that problem.
         The problem seems to ignore the fact that spectators
         have not got a responsibility to themselves and to
         their colleagues.  I cannot understand how people
         would crush into an area where people are obviously in
         distress.  Let us not beat about the bush, we have got
         a situation where we have got the best efforts of the
         police officers, and at the time when the problem
         started arising I am talking about 70 police officers,
         17 mounted policd officers, all doing their best to
         stop people crushing into an area which is already
         congested.  Now it seems to me it is a fact of common
         sense that if you are a member of a crowd like that




H
                                  R. MARSHALL


you don't crush into the area; you wait until the
crush has been relieved, you wait until common sense
prevails. You do not just barge in and expect to gain
entrance to a turnstile when clearly the turnstiles
are clogged up already. What you are suggesting
implies that the Liverpool fans, either a minority but
a very, very influential minority, just waited until
police officers allowed them to gain entrance to the
turnstiles. Now that is not so. They pushed into the
turnstile area, despite the best efforts of a
substantial body of Police that was there trying to
prevent them doing that, and I don't think that fact
should be obscured.

                                         R. MARSHALL


Q.   That is obvious, is it not? - A. It is obvious now
     with hindsight, yes.

Q.   It is obvious, with respect Mr. Marshall, from anybody
     looking at Pens 3 and 4, seeing them congested, that
     they would say to themselves, "Anybody going down that
     likely route through the tunnel is adding to an
     already crowded pen". That is obvious, is it not? -
     A. That is obvious, yes.

Q.   A crowded pen carries with it, as more people add to
     it, the obvious danger of overcrowding and crushing to
     the people in it, does it not? - A. Yes.

Q.   That is obvious? - A. Yes.

Q.   Just taking for one moment your point that it was
     unfortunate, you say, no doubt on behalf of ground
     control for the moment, that only Gate C was opened
     when it was opened, the fact is that you left it to
     ground control to decide which gates and what gates
     would be opened? You left it to them, did you not? -
     A. Yes.

Q.   It was ground control who made the decision to open
     Gate C; it was not you, that is right, is it not? - A.
     Yes.

Q.   Gate B, which you have told us about, leads into a
     concourse area which is not the area through which
     somebody with a standing ticket would have expected to
     find himself in if he had entered with his ticket, do
     you agree with that? - A. Not necessarily.  He could
     have gone through the small gate in the dividing wall.

Q.   Let me take you through   it with respect.   If I had a
     standing ticket for the   Leppings Lane terrace and I
     was there on 15th April   1989 I was expected to use
     turnstiles A to G? - A.   Yes.

Q.   If I had been queueing up in the mass of people there
     outside turnstiles A to G, I would be expecting to go
     through those turnstiles into the area where Mr.
     Griffiths is pointing with his pointer? - A. Yes.




                                     /Q. I would not be

                                                   R. MARSHALL


Q.   I would not be expecting to go into the area on the
     other side of the little gateway in the wall? - A. I
     think it would depend if you had been to the ground
     before.

Q.   We have been through all      that before? -A. Yes.

Q.   As far as you are aware, what steps if any were taken
     to ensure that if Gate B were opened for the moment
     that the people who entered through Gate B into the
     concourse area which they were not expecting to be
     on, would stay in that area and go to the left and
     not go back through the little gateway to get to the
     tunnel which would be the area they were expecting to
     be in. Were any steps taken? - A. None that I am
     aware.

Q. Were you aware of any warning being given from what
   you could hear, on radio or otherwise, to anybody
   that any of the gates were about to be opened? - A.
   No.

Q. It follows from that, Hr. Marshall, that you did not
   hear any message being sent to the Club stewards, to
   the Club authorities or to any Police Officer. That
   is correct, is it? - A. That is correct, yes.

Q. You have already agreed with me that it would be
   obvious the need to divert people going through the
   tunnel from getting on to Pens 3 and 4 if Pens 3 and
   4 were already full and crowded. You have agreed
   with me? - A. Yes.

Q. To divert people from going....

     THE CORONERS   Excuse me, I do not think he quite
agreed with that. What you had put to him was that if it
had been noted the pens were full and overcrowded.

       MR. KING:      Oh yes, I agree entirely.

     THE CORONER:   So long as it was understood that that
was what you meant.

       MR. KING:      Absolutely, sir.

       THE CORONER:      Yes.

Q.       MR. KING:   Mr. Marshall, you were not inside the
     ground, were you? - ,A. No.

Q. You were not in ground control? - A. No.

Q. You had no responsibilities for judging whether or
   not it was safe or otherwise to allow a whole lot
   more people on to Pens 3 and 4. You were not in that
                                R. MARSHALL


Even when you saw people being pulled up into the
stands behind you thought it wasn't unusual, that this
did happen at football matches, people did move their
positions? - A. Yes.

And some of them would go over the radial fences too?
- A. Yes.

They would just move because probably they were
uncomfortable where they were? - A. Possibly.

In fact, you said there is always some movement going
on, it is a mass of heads and bodies so there is a
general movement altogether? - A. Yes.

You said that it is difficult for you to know exactly
what is happening inside the pens unless you are in
it. You would not know exactly what anybody feels in
a pen, would you, if you are right the way across the
pitch? - A. That is true.

You would just see movement in other words? - A. Yes.

You said that Inspector Sewell would know if anything
had been seriously wrong in 1988. There has been a
suggestion that there was crushing taking place that
year, but if there had been serious crushing this
would surely be known to Inspector Sewell, would it
not? - A. I would assume that if someone had reported
being crushed and Police had become involved in the
removal of that person to the St. John's Ambulance
First-Aid Room, then that would have found its way
into someone's de-briefing sheet and would be part of
the information generated at the end of the game, yes.
But if that person had merely accepted that he was
being crushed and had not sought any form of first-
aid, or had not reported that to a Police Officer or a
member of the ground stewarding staff, then it is
perhaps unlikely that the information would have
surfaced.

So it is mainly hearsay.  From the Police point of
view it was not serious? - A. I had no knowledge of
people being crushed in 1988.

We have heard time and time again that it was a very
successful operation, so I would accept what you are
saying definitely on that point, and no problems were
discussed, as I asked you earlier.  There was a safe
capacity for the terraces, were you aware of that? -
A. Yes.

                                        R. MARSHALL


Q.   The numbers that should have been allowed on those
     terraces in 1989 anyway were over 24,000.  I have not
     got the actual figure.

          THE CORONER:  It is 10,100 on    the whole of the
     terrace, from one end to the other,    divided into two
     aliquots, or two bits. That is the     terrace, 24,000
     terrace plus stand, but we are not    really interested
     in the stand at the moment.

           MRS. McBRIEN: Yes, thank you.
Q.   So there was a safe capacity and you knew about it.
     This capacity, this known number, would only be
     recorded at the turnstiles, would it not? - A. Yes,
      there was no means of actually counting spectators
     into the pens on the Leppings Lane terrace at all.

Q.   This information would be relayed to the Club
     management, would it not? - A. Yes, they have got an
     electronic system which, as I understand it, operates
     on the turn of the turnstile paddle wheel, and that
     registers an entry on a digital recording system in
     the Club's control room which is beneath the South
     Stand near the players' entrance.

Q.   So this would be very useful information for the Club
     to have that day, would it not? - A. Yes.

Q.   I believe within the system there is a bell that rings
     when the pens are getting to a certain capacity? - A.
     Yes.

          THE CORONER: I think, Mrs. McBrien, you have got
     to use the word "terrace", and not the word "pen",
     because the witness has just said you could not count
     the people into the pens.  I think you should use the
     word "terrace".  It is an important point actually.

          MRS. McBRIEN:   Yes, it is.

          THE CORONER: So can you rephrase your question so
     that we get the answer right in relation to the
     correct question.  Shall I do it?

          MRS. McBRIEN:   Please.

          THE CORONER: If I have not got it right, you tell
     me.
Q.   Mrs. McBrien is asking you to say the information from
     the counters was important for the Club to know how
     many people were entering, or had entered, and you
     would agree with that? - A. Yes*

The reason I asked you if you requested the gates to be
closed, once this pressure had been released and people
had gone into the ground, why were the gates left open?
- A. The gates were not left open, the gates were
closed by Police Officers.

Without opening the gates, you had outside a public
order situation, and the people at no time, well they
don't usually lose in that sort of situation, do they?
They usually, through one means or another, bring
things under control? - A. This goes to the very heart
of the issue because there is a term used, and it is a
fairly hackneyed phrase, but it is called policing by
consent. -The Police in my experience in the UK police
the public by consent.  In other words, the public
allow Police Officers to tell them what to do, to
respond to reasonable requests, to exercise some degree
of self-control, to exercise a degree of feeling and
compassion towards other human beings, and that is the
way that policing succeeds in this country, witnout
recourse all the time to riot shields and to water
cannon, and to live ammunition and that sort of thing.
These things are an anathema to the British Police
Service.  Eventually, when a situation does arise of
the sort which I felt arose from about 2.40 onwards on
15th April, the forces of law and order eventually
become overwhelmed. There were about 70 Police
Officers, 6,000 or 7,000 people, some of whom were
determined to get into the ground come what may, no
thought for other fans, no thought for Police, no
thought for anything except themselves, and that really
is the total nub of this issue, that if people consent
to be policed and people consent to follow the
reasonable directions of Police Officers, don’t shove
and push, then we would not be in this situation.

This surely was not a riot situation at all, it was
just a lot of people crowded together anxious to get in
by kick-off? That wasn't a riot situation and yet the
Police in this country are able to deal with riots,
miners' strikes, that was dealt with successfully.   Wny
is it they could not deal with that situation? - A.
Mrs. McBrien, we were trying to police a pleasant
afternoon of sport.  It was not supposed to be a riot
situation it was supposed to be a pleasant afternoon
where people would come, watch a game of football, get
excited, enjoy themselves, and having watched the game
of football go away.

Really I have tried’to paint the picture yesterday and
I have tried to paint the picture to you now.  The
video which you have probably seep shows the situation
quite clearly:  enormous crowds flooding into the area;
the presence of Police Officers not dissimilar to that

Selwyns coaches, (x 5)
Left Liverpool 11.30, travelled in convoy, started parking up 1.50
onwards, Halifax Road. No alcohol on coach. Was stopped, checked
and searched. Did not check for tickets but very thorough job
otherwise. On parking, officers entered, further check, all very
amicable. Walked down to roundabout, lots of POs checking fans,
police very stringent (see R Cobb, Campbell?).
Had come without a ticket, not intending to go in, but was given
one.
Arrived Leppings Lane about 14.40. Busy, joined throng of people,
smaller outer perimeter gate shut. He felt that this simply
increased pressure within the turnstile area and remonstrated with
P0, officer explained rationale to him, felt it would inflame
people and it was a mistake. Had noticed two police horses within
turnstile area, thought that their use with gates shut created
problems. He was still outside perimeter gates (compare McMahon's
assessment and mounted officer's intentions).   Denies excess pressure
on perimeter gates.
Says that there was a steward on the gate who was reluctant to open
them but was asked to do so and says mounted officer within turnstile
area beckoning people to come in. Entered via Gate C. Evidence
regarding this not consistent and somewhat confusing. Not many
people about, just people briskly walking in. Entered tunnel, very
dark, had to walk carefully, I way down tunnel theTe waT~a~sudden~
surge, carried forward onto barrier on terrace, could see players
on field, red and green shirt. Graphic description of falling dowti
tumbling etc. Heard people shout "push back", apparently he had
reached perimeter fence.
This witness thinks he was saved by Christopher Traynor who he thought
he recognised from photographs. The problem is that he feels he went
into Pen 4, and Christopher Traynor was definitely in Pen 3. Sgt.
McCombie had tried to reconcile this in April 1990 but witness could
now not really remember the conversation. He said "when I saw the
photograph it didn't not look like him". Said in answer to Mr Manning
that the Don River perimeter gate was not under pressure.   The others
had lots of people.

Coach left Liverpool 10 am, Barnsley 12.30, stopped approx half hour
at pub, reached Sheffield 2.15. Coach not checked. Leppings Lane
2.25/2.30. Initially not too crowded outside perimeter gates but
became more so, started getting pushed, coming from behind, just
the crowd moving forward.
Mounted officer, broadways on, trying to stop forward movement, it
would have been ja^rGssible to comply but carried on. Became very
distressed in front of turnstile area, not crushed but pushed along.
Entered via turnstile, waited for friends, 3 or 4 minutes, proceeded
about 2.50, concertina gate noted to be wide open. Steady flow of
people down tunnel, some confusion, forgot as to whether he knew
radial fences */ere there.
Players were on pitch, when they first came out it was not too
bad but as kick-off approached it got worse and worse. Got carried
forward but initially still able to guide himself. Carried forward,
kick-off having already taken place. Saw Carl Lewis and Stephen
Roberts after kick-off, didn't look too bad (statement says they were
obviously in distress and pain). Reconciled this by saying that they
were distressed but not too bad. Not worried for his life. He and
others were calling out for people to move back. No noticeable
difference, fell over for a short period (fifteen seconds), no
surges felt, first saw people climb over fence just after kick-off.
Saw gate but thinks it did not open until 2/5 minutes after kick-off.
Shut, open, re-shut and bolted, stayed shut for three minutes.
Long discussion as to whether he could see the bolt in view of his
location (and the fact that there is no bolt on this gate).
Confirmed he had had four Pernods and was not worried about his own
condition at kick-off because he had been in similar situations
bef-ore. Fairly adamant that gate was shut after kick-off,
Notwithstanding photographic evidence of opening it at 14.59.

Departed 10 am arrived 14.20. Stopped on Motorway, just heavy traffi
Alcohol, about 20% of people, checked for alcohol at Penistone Road
(see R Cobb). At Turnstiles 14.40, packed, people began to hurry in,
perimeter gates open, Merseyside mounted officer seen, unable to
control crowd. People were clearly pushing, nobody taking any notice
but officer should have had more back-up. Excess numbers, mounted
officer tried to close perimeter gate to did not succeed on his own.
Did not enter through turnstile. Got carried alopng, feet not
touching the ground, through Gate C (compare Mr McMahon). Had
moved out of turnstile crush prior to this, positive he was lifted
off his feet.
Concourse area quietening down, could see players on pitch, able to
walk down tunnel, no problem. Exited, surveying the scene, got
pushed against barrier, ducked underneath, pushing continued.
Became frightened when he saw young lad screaming for air just about
kick-off time. Scrambled back up to tunnel (some time after match
had finished). Had some difficulty getting back, had to push through
In 1988 entered pen 2.30/2.45, too many people, did not enter terrace
His impression was that in 1989 when he exited condition was better
than 1988, not much, but better. When exiting, people still coming

Charge nurse.    Travelled by car, departed 10.30, parked 2.15,
stopped at Sheffield end of Pass 1.15 for food. Alcohol, odd
ones seen drinking from cans. Arrived Leppings Lane 2.25, about
500-1000 people estimated. One mounted Merseyside officer seen
trying to get people to queue, not successful, everyone being
pushed, people distressed and coming out, frightened outside
turnstiles, people shouting "don't push, people are getting hurt"
etc, made no difference. Entered by turnstile, into tunnel about
2.50 to 2.55,based on players being on pitch. Entered Pen 4.
Intended to go to NW terrace, position initially fluid, around
kick-off time became oppressive, increased over next few minutes.
With crush increasing could see a young man distressed. When crowd
relaxed after match stopped, checked young man, no sign of life,
(Paul Carlisle). Compared with 1988, Pen 3 quite crushed then,
which is why he wanted to go to NW terrace, worried about injury
in 1988, people climbed up into the stand at half-time.

            Several        people          picked him up, stood him up, facing the wrong

            somebody           else was           against          the       barrier.              He could      hear

            crackling          noise.             He        and        others        tried    to     push     man off

            barrier.            He        thought that this was just a few minutes after

            2.40,        but    on        pressing           said that it was at the same time as

            fans     were       being        pulled into stand. (See compilation tape re

            timing.)            Then       managed            to turn around.                Pressure had eased

            slightly           for a       moment.           Was               moved forward abit.                Things were

            very      tight,      very           confusing,             very frightening.             People were

            trying       to     climb up the pen.                      Police Officer was pushing them

    to    two      pubs        and        had     six pints.           Stayed in the pub      until

    2.15.         Arrived at 2.30.                His recollection was perimeter              gates   J

    shut.          Severe        conditions              outside       perimeter     gates.     One

    mounted        officer           tried        to     get     people     to back off, without

    success.             In     due course did manage to get through perimeter

    gates.             Queuing        for       turnstiles.             Got to adjacent Gate B.

    Not     distressed           at that          point.        Did hear a few comments about

    women        and     children.                Gate            B opened.       Entered, went through ^

    No    police         or     stewards           there.          People     passing both ways.

way,   not      aware    of gate and radial fences, about two minutes

between       entering     the tunnel and coming to initial full stop.

Had     been      to     other   large    matches     and   described   severe

difficulties          in entering e.g. Wembley, Wimbledon final.          Took

minutes       after     start.       Ticket   not     taken on that occasion.

Turnstiles       just clicked through.          He confirmed to Mrs McBrien

    employed        since        1953.          Difficult witness. He did make point

    that     he    had     noticed         that there were markedly few people by

    2.30     as    he     had     a lot of programmes left.             Did not see gate

    open     but     saw       people      coming through.          Said that Steward and

    Police        Officers were stopping people going through the gap in

    the     wall.          Did     not     know how but assumed that this is they

    always        did.           Tended to agree with whatever was put to him.

    Eventually           agreed       with me that what he had said was based on

    previous       experience          and      not    what he had seen.     Then agreed

    with     Mr    King        that      exit    had been blocked 15 April 1989 but

    definitely           did    not      see    what    was     going on once gates were

    open.         Had      also       agreed     that     neither    stewards   or police

    officers       were standing there continuously.                   Did not know that

    West     Stand       had      two entry points, despite length of service.

    He     said that he was only in that position at semi finals.                      He

    recollected          fans      coming       thought       the other way, but was not

Expected        such conditions at big match occasions.          On previous

occasions        been in similar situation and lost shoe.         When went

under        barrier     lost "Gordon".      At fences managed to get over.

A     lady     police     officer      pulled him out.   He thinks the match

was     still in progress then.            Heard cries of stop pushing.   He

thought        play     might   well    have been in progress at his first

position.

tighter    that         year after kick off.                 Very tight and extremely

uncomfortable           to    such     an     extent that people were pulled up

into stand.



1989     left     10.15       Liverpool. .           Sheffield 1315 (with 3/4 hour

wait     forfriends.           They arrived at 1.45).                 Had something to

eat.       Set off for Leppings Lane 2.30 approximately.                               Through

turnstiles            1435      -    1440.       Described           Me tbfcjfSl'tte   Officer

lost.      Entered Pen 4 - 1440 approximately.                             Very busy.     Went

to     left.       More       space.     Not apprehensive.              After few minutes

movement        forward       and      over     to     left.         He split up at that

point,     approximately              1445     (lost     sight        of     David     RIMMER,

deceased.)            At      that point had been mentioned that crush was

about     equivalent           to     1988.          Tried     to    set stop watch when

players        came     out     - 1454.       Unable to do so because could not

move     arm.          After a few moments managed to get arms up to do

it.        Intending            to      watch         match.          Very     tight,     very

uncomfortable           but     not     worried.        Things get worse from then.

Became     frightened           at about kick off time.                 No surge, general

movement        to     left,        escaped     to   Pen        5 - approximately 1515.

Looked     at clock.           Prior to that had heard cries for help from

the      front.               Not    heard     until    match           actually   stopped.

Confirmed           that   he had not reported his experiences to anyone

      "nobody        would listen".           Except in immediate vicinity could

not     hear        crowds.          Uncomfortable         at     1440.      Being knocked

about     but not frightened.                 25 years experience.            Opinion that

officer        on     track     would     have       been       aware     of crushing.   He

recalls        punching        air but no recollection of teams being read

out.

 and     C,    unusual         gave     instruction not to open Gates.              Saw an

  ejection        at 1440 (probably 1448) 50 or so fans entered.                         Then

 heard        police     instruction             to    open     Gates.    Crowd coming in,

  knocked        him    over.          Not       injured.        Crowd went into tunnel.

  some     prodding        remembered            the police sometimes diverted fans

  to     sides     in     league matches, never in semi-final.                    Loads of

  monitoring           terraces       from       control        box and organising police

  cordons.             Also expressed opinion that after opening Gate ’C*

  it     would     have        been    impossible          to     close   blue   gates    and

Once     through        the perimeter gates other officers appealing not

was    wrong,        based     on       what    he saw and the crowd which he had

         When arrived Gate C shut. Crowd 2/3,000 people squashed in

         He thought area 1-16 appeared in order, with queueing (but see
         other evidence). Crush worse ever. Attempted to put horse              43
         between perimeter gate and crowd to create breaK, attempted
         to push people back out, methodology relies on people transferring
         forward momentum to backward momentum, did not think it was
         hopeless, horse was catalyst. Gap created, horse moved out of            I a ^

         of 1androver or tannoy. People started running around his horse,
         space filled up, felt that people at perimeter gate were pushing,      47    —
          horse subsequently had to be retired. Obvious danger to people        49
          but other than those trapped in front of turnstile, had the ability

          to move but did not respond.
          Crowd very dense, caused by pushing, excess numbers in area.
          Hundreds of people ran around his horse, but query Gate C open?       55.* 56
          He felt that a non-aggressive crowd could safely be let through
          a perimeter gate but that if the mood was bad, things might be
                                                                                 57
          different.


          N.B.
          Quite clear that turnstile area was overcrowded but consider
          evidence already heard regarding necessity for counting mechanism
          into a restricted area as well as need to control distribution.
          Clearly no possibility of counting people into turnstile area.
          Position in fact analogous to terracing but there was a police
          presence at turnstiles.

Checking incoaches at Claywheels Lane. Completed job about 2 pm,
took up position at junction of Claywheels Lane and Penistone
Road at 14.25. Filtering system, fans advised to drink up or
dispose of alcohol cans at that point. Did not check for tickets.
^aw ticketless fans but these tended to be walking away from the
ground. Felt that about 50% of people going down had alcohol.
Described them as "happy drunk". Crowds going down until 15.05.
Ticketless fans advised that they would not get in. In fact
some had apparently stayed near coaches when told.

85.   R W BEADSLEY                         GATEMAN 'C'

Four years' experience.   On gate with two others plus Liverpool
steward.
Did not go outside after 2.30. Gate was then shut on advice and
only opened for ejections (he thought about six after 14.45).
His impression was that there were many more people coming in
after 2.30 in 1989 than 1988.

Ticketless fans - requests about 10/15. After some difficulty
recollected three openings but times different to video. Police
presence in concourse not possible at that stage because of
amounts of people.
Did not feel regular officers were there. Recollection of blue
tunnel gates was that they opened in the opposite way to which
they normally did. Thought they were used to close off tunnel
in 1988 for a short period. 1989 did not attempt to hold flow
of fans - frightened - says he would have done so if ordered.
Noticed tickets being thrown over gate. Heard people asked to
"give over pushing". Entry in 1988 more orderly. When asked
on third opening (14.59) when tickets were being checked, the
majority had tickets.

84:« S THORPE                             CHIEF STEWARD

22 years experience. Responsible for West Stand and Gates B and C
only, not terracing. Not aware of anybody responsbile for terracing          73
(stewarding).
Discussed giving directions lto fans and problems of stewarding
access to stands. Semi-final day, mix of normal and other officers,
would not put his stewards on terracing amongst Away fans, too               81,    90
dangerous.   He confirmed impression that Gate C was endangered but
this is not supported by his gatemen. On stands became aware of
Gate C opening, went to staircase and instructed stewards to allow
fans up, no chance of stopping them. Forbad any attempt to close
gates leading to stands. Felt that on most occasions fans were    ^    A
allowed onto terracing on their own but had had noticed that the
police had on previous occasions been involved in filling the
terraces and, from statement, that tunnel had been closed in 1988.     98, 99, 100,
                                                                           105   , 110,111
N.B.                                               113
This witness confirms 1988 diversion at tunnel. He also describes
the difficulties of holding the crowds who were seeking to enter the
stands, proportionally far fewer than those going down tunnel. If
he is right, this is significant as to the effectiveness of closing
or diverting fans from the tunnel.

59.   KENNETH ARTHUR RAWLINSON                     SUPPORTER


Drove up by van. Departed 10.30. Arrived 12.15/12.30. Arrived
ground at 14.40. In crowd outside turnstile. Directed to Gate C.
Steady stream entered tunnel. Mass of people like a brick wall.
Worked his way back out. Query - possible the team came out.


People still entering tunnel 14.55. Thousands already there -
worried. First went left and then re-crossed tunnel entrance
to North side. Noticed at tunnel mouth that match already in
progress. Saw people climb over. Looked like normal over-spill.

Only realised situation was serious when he saw the injured on the
pitch. Did not enter pen one because he thought terraces were full
but when he looked at it from the North stand, it looked fairly
empty except at the back.


Describes looking at the crush in the centre pens which did not
appear to him any worse than he had seen on other occasions.
He would have preferred to enter the wings but he followed the
crowd.

58. ELIZABETH JANE WILSON                              S.Y. MOUNTED POLICE OFFICER
                                                       9 YEARS EXPERIENCE
                                                       NEWISH HORSE

Moving people about whilst asking ticketless fans to leave. People
seemed happy. About 150 asked for directions. Found tickets a
little confusing. 14.30/14.40 atmosphere changed and alcohol cans
were seen.

Saw the Landrover arrive, recalls trying to assist with its parking,
ie PC           does not remember this. Did not hear loud 7 sp eaker.
People were packed solid. Formed part of a cordon. People smacking
the horses and pushing.

She heard them say that kick-off would be delayed. This did seem to
reduce panicking by some although heard shouts from within the ground            Pg 93/94
which increased pushing and aggressiveness. Crowd changed suddenly
and felt ^ o p e r a t i o n from crowd to help with control.                        17/7

  What happened then, as far as you were concerned? - A.
y I could see that PCs Stanbridge and Grunhill were
  trying to organise the queues and, in fact, actually
  did that at one stage and relieved the pressure at the
  front, and then there seemed to be a massive influx of
  people that actually came through the perimeter gates
  and joined the people in the pen which caused a lot
  more pressure on the turnstile and people just near
  the turnstiles.  So then I thought about taking my
  horse to the end of that blue barrier so that I could
  try and get the horse into the crowd, into the
  supporters, and then join PCs Stanbridge and Grunhill
  there, so that in effect we could block the pen area
  off at that stage and, therefore, allow the fans to go
  through the turnstiles and therefore relieve the
  pressure at the front.

 So what you are saying then is that you wanted tta
 erect, if I can use that term, a barrier between the
 perimeter gate and the end of the funnel bar? ~ A.
 That is right, sir.

 Did you manage to get your horse into that area or
 not? - A. No sir, I did not, because the people were
 so dense, and even though they had a little bit of
 room to move back, they would not move back from them,
 they just kept on ignoring them.   I requested them to
 move so that I could get in and, therefore, form the
 barrier so that they could form up on my left-hand
 side and just release the pressure on the right.   But
 because I co uldn’t get in I was just wasting my time.

 Was that because the people at that point had already
 filled up the whole of that gap right up to the
 perimeter gates and beyond, or was there still space
 for them to move back?  That is a very important
 question. - A.  There was a little bit of space for
 them to move back, yes.

 They could have moved back? - A. They could have moved
 back, yes.  In fact, when PC Grunhill moved towards
 me, obviously the movement of a horse walking out
 actually created the fans to corner back.

 As a matter of interest, did you by chance see
 Inspector Hand-Davis in that area? - A. Not at that
 stage because I was more concerned with what was
 happening at the front of the turnstiles and I was
 trying to get the attention of PCs Grunhill and
 Stanbridge so that we could form the cordon to relieve
 the pressure.

 So you did not succeed and there were PCs Grunhill and
 Stanbridge still inside, so what' did you do next?

, Did a gap form, as far as you could recollect, between
  the back of the crowd who ware advancing towards the
  turnstile and the perimeter gates which you were
  holding shut? - A. Yes sir, it did.

 How big a gap would you estimate it? - A. Perhaps
 three or four yards.

 How long did it last? - A. I remember that there was
 pressure from my left and again requesting the people
 not to push, but again, as has already been mentioned,
 the people who you are directly in contact with will
 never admit to pushing.  It is always the people from
 behind.  So then being concerned with holding the
 gates and requesting the people not to push, I could
 not give a figure on that at all, a length of time at


 Never mind what the people would admit, did you feel
 that all the people who were pushing against you from
 the left, from the outside, were propelled forward, or
 did some of them at least have a choice as to what
 they were doing? - A. I think at that stage, sir, the
 crowd was so dense that these that were directly in
 contact with me did not have any choice at all.

 So people further back might have had a choice, but
 the ones right next to you were, in your estimation,
 genuinely being pushed? - A. That is right, sir.

 That presumably means that if you were talking to them
 and asking them not to push, which I assume you did,
 it would not have made any difference, because they
 could not do anything about it? - A. That is right.
 In fact, that is what they said to me, they could not
 do anything about it.

 And that was your perception as well? - A. That is
 right, sir.

 I think you noticed several people had fallen over, is
 that right? - A. No sir.  What happened was there was
 a surge from my left, which caused me and the horse to
 be pushed towards the gate, which in turn catapulted
 the gate open.  The horse stumbled and, in turn,
 people just fell down in front of me.   The horse
 scrambled to its feet and inyself and PC Scott actually
 bridged the gap until the gates were closed again.

 IIow much does your horse weigh - about? - A. About 650
 kilos.

 I think around this time you decided that you wanted
 to send a radio message, is that right? - A. That is

Q*          ire rou °nlv just referring to one event there? -
     A. That's right, sir.

     ►2?kJn8*°ver the landscape of your experience you can
     tnink of one other occasion when a similar situation has
     cropped up? - A. Well, where we have got pressure on the
     turnstiles, just one, sir.

Q. Have you ever known such huge numbers as occurred here to
   arrive shortly before the kick-off? - A. Only on that one
   occasion when as I say I think the special train was late
   tor some mechanical failure.   We got the bulk of the
   tans just trying to get into the match, not wanting to
   miss any of the match.

Q*                     thl« 1989 eve"t, did you hear appeals
           made to the crowd to ease back, to stop the ,
     crushing that was taking place at the front? - A. Not
     from where I was, sir.

Q. Did you make appeals yourself to the crowd to move back?
   - A. Yes.    Most of the mounted lads in the cordon were
   just trying to talk to the people directly near us to
   stop pushing but obviously they were being pushed on to
   us and they were appealing to us that they couldn't do
   anything about it.

. Did it appear to you that the people at the back of the
  £!i?i,i 4 Were doing anything to co-operate to stop the crush
  building up? - A. From where I was, sir, I was
  concentrating with what was happening at the turnstiles,

Yes, our only real concern was the South Stand car
park which we felt hadn't been catered for. A lot of
crushing problems can occur down there sometimes with
queuing and we built in a small contingency for that
in 1989 as opposed to 1988.

That was as a result of an experience in one of the
previous years, was it? - A. Yes, not a complaint,
just an awareness that we had not catered for it and
it needed to be built into 1989*s operations.

Had anything happened previously to prepare you for
what was to come in 1989? - A. No, all of my mounted
experience in some way helped but I couldn't pull the
answer out of the hat.  There wasn't an answer so far
as I was concerned to pull out of the hat.

From your experience please - a lot of other
witnesses have done this but I think the Jury would
 like to hear from you as being in charge of the
mounted section - can you compare the events of 1989
with your previous experience, particularly of those
two previous finals?    I think three things are
particularly interesting, one is the numbers of the
people, two is the time at which they arrived and I
think the third one is the behaviour of the people.
First of all, in terms of numbers in the period
shortly before the kick-off? - A. I think the easiest
and most graphic way of describing this is that our
operation was planned to start finishing at quarter
to three, certainly in terms of Penistone Road.    In
all three Semi Finals I prepared for the mutual aid
horses to stand down at quarter to three and go back
for a meal.   Certainly in terms of what happened on
Penistone Road in all three years we were able to do
that.   By quarter to three on Penistone Road all the
fans were in at that end.    Certainly in terms of 1987
and 1988 most of it was all over by quarter to three
on Leppings Lane.   1989 is different in respect that
we were still very much involved at one end of the
ground in 1989 with huge amounts of people and that
was the most amazing thing to me in terms of the
three years.

Can you make a comparison please in terms of the
behaviour of the croWd? - A. Yes, I think that
behaviour, I can't say it was an aggressive thing on
the part of the Liverpool people, I think more of a
complacency.  They knew the ground'. I worked it out
that they had been there four times that year.   I
felt that they were as confident in the ground as I

Q. Indeed I think you made certain modifications to the
   plan, the Operational Order for the day, to balance
   your forces as you thought fit. Would that be
   fair? - A. Yes, it was important for our men not to
   regard their positioning as too static.  They had to
   be flexible enough to move to any part of the ground
   if they needed to and so those were guidelines
   really, the Operational Order, but the South Stand
   was the one I catered for particularly.

Q. The command and control of the mounted force was
   yours and was delegated to you, is that fair to
   say? - A. I think it is fair to say that positioning
   on the day up to say two o'clock was up to me but we
   came under the control of the radio, under ground
   command of radio control, and could be moved about at
   will.  So they had our positions and deployment and
   knew where we were.

Q. The specific instructions you would expect to be
   relayed to you as in charge of the mounted section? -
   A. No, for instance, if anything had happened on
   Penistone Road I would not want or need to know about
   if I wasn't there and I would expect the Ground
   Commander to deploy the horses as he thought fit from
   there.

Q. Would it be fair to say, as I understand you to have
   said in evidence, that you formally requested
   assistance at round about 2.40? - A. Yes, sir.

Q. Up to that time you dealt with the situation as best
   you could on the ground? - A. I am very much "a hands
   o n ” situation. There wasn't a lot of time to be on
   the radio but as soon as there came a moment to do it
   I radioed up, yes.

Q. Really just to emphasise the situation that faced
   you, the point has been made, but 4t was the
   suddenness of the build-up and perhaps the behaviour
   of the fans which you found untypical? - A. Yes, I
   think we were overwhelmed with the large numbers very
   quickly.  I think behaviour implies some sort of
   criticism of Liverpool football fans and I don't
   think that is fair. ..

Q. No, that is not implied. - A. A frustration, a desire
   to get in quickly and the worse it'^ot the more
   frustrated they got.

Q. In terms of crowd behaviour, I meant the evidence you
   have heard before I think of fans not listening to
   reason? - A. Yes, sir.

Q. That is the impression which has been given in
   evidence. ~ A - Yes, people wouldn't acknowledge your
   requests and were deaf to them.

Q. So it is not simply a case of numbers if requests
   which were made had perhaps been adhered to? - A. No,
   sir, no.

Q. Inspector, when you saw large numbers of people going
   through Gate A you immediately said to yourself,
   "Where are they all going to go?".  That is a
   question which was obvious to you? - A. Yes, sir.

Q. Indeed you said that yourself in giving evidence in
   relation to Gate C. You did not actually see Gate C
   opened, did you? - A. No, sir.

Q. Nonetheless if you had seen thousands of people going
   through Gate C that is the same question you would
   have asked yourself on that occasion? - A. I assume
   so, yes.

Q. When you went up to the control box, did you actually
   go into the control box? - A. No, sir.

Q. You were able to see over, I am sure, to the centre
   pens which were on the Leppings Lane terrace? You
   could see that, could you? - A. Yes, I had a good
   view of that, sir.

Q. Were you in Court today when photographs were put up
   of the situation at the Leppings Lane end? - A. Yes.

E             may have become complacent because they had had no

              arrival, would that be fair? - A.  I think that is
              fair, yes.

     'really are not designed to wo.sk in, is it not? - A.
      Yes sir.

Q.   It is obvious just looking at it that it would be
     crucial for the purposes of getting people through
     efficiently and safely that that area between the
     perimeter gates and the turnstiles area just should
     not get too congested? - A. No sir.

Q.   I am right, am I not, that in the Operational Order
     there is no provision dealing with the prevention of
     congestion at turnstiles?  I could not find anything.
     - A.  No.

Q.   That is right, there is no provision? - A. You are
     right.

Q.   When you arrived, if I could just take you to the time
     I want to, when you had got back to the Leppings Lane
     end when the train had arrived, if I could take you to
     that time in your evidence, at that stage were there
     any queues at the turnstiles? - A. No, I think it was
     fairly empty.

Q.   Then there came a time, which obviously was not long
     afterwards, when you said to yourself, "There is a
     problem in the turnstile area"? - A. Yes.

Q.   You tell us again what time that was? - A. It must be
     around the 2.30 mark.

Q.   Really from 2.30 onwards events just got out of hand
     from that time? - A. In terms of numbers, yes sir.

Q.   Also in terms of the ability of yourself and your
     brother officers to control the numbers getting into
     the turnstile area by the sound of it? - A. In terms
     of the ability of the turnstiles to cope with it as
     well, sir.

Q.   But in terms of your controlling the numbers getting
     into the turnstile area, from 2.30 onwards everything
     got out of hand? - A. Yes.

Q.   You noticed at 2.30-ish when you went in that there
     was the problem at the turnstiles.   Tell us again what
     the problem was when you went in at 2.30-ish? - A. I
     could see that there' was some concern *about crushing
     at the front, and I could see the Liverpool officers
     working up there to try and alleviate that, and I
     joined in to help.

Q.   How long_after that, when you went in, was it when you
     became totally enveloped with people? - A. I think

     , that within 5 or 10 minutes of that we were wrapped up
      with people completely.

Q.    Those people who were being crushed at the front of
      the turnstiles when you went in at 2.30-iwsh, excuse
      me for an obvious question but they had to have got
      into the turnstile area? - A. Yes.

Q.   And they had to have got in through the perimeter
      gates? - A. Yes.

Q.    The people who were behind them, right the way back
      until we came to where you were, they had all come
      through the perimeter gates? - A. Yes.

Q.   The perimeter gates when you went in at 2.30-ish were
      completely open? - A. Yes.

Q.    While you were still in there doing your best to deal
      with the situation, and then becoming more and more
      enveloped with people, the perimeter gates were still
      open? - A. Yes.

Q.    The decision to seek to close the perimeter gates came
      at a time really when it was totally out of hand in
      the turnstile area, was it not? - A. Yes.

Q.    But you would agree with me from my earlier questions
      that it was very important, looking at that turnstile
      area, to control the numbers ever getting in there in
      the first place, you would agree with me? - A. Yes.

Q.    What system was there being employed before 2.30 to
      actually control the numbers going into the turnstile
      area? - A. None as far as I could see.

Q.    One of the things we have noted from 1988, and you
      have agreed with this from your recollection now, is
      that in 1988 the perimeter gates were closed much
      earlier than apparently in 1989, that seems to be
      clear? - A. Yes sir.
                                      ✓
Q.    Can I now deal, if I may, with just a little about
      crowd behaviour because you have given us a lot of
      information, but you would not say to this Inquest,
      would you officer, that everybody who was pushed up
      against your horse was themselves acting totally
      voluntarily as opposed to themselves acting
      involuntarily because of things going on behind them?
      You could not say everybody was in the category of a
      voluntary pusher towards you, could you? - A. No, that
      wouldn't be fair at all.
                            P.   HAND-DAVIS


'Indeed, you gave a description to this Inquest about
 becoming enveloped by people, such that you decided to
 get out of the situation.  I think on another occasion
 you have actually gone further and described how your
 horse was actually lifted up almost off the ground
 because of it? - A. Yes sir.

I think on that earlier occasion you were asked, your
attention was directed to whether or not you felt that
the people around you, who apparently were causing
that situation, were acting voluntarily or
involuntarily, and your answer was involuntarily, and
you would agree with that? - A. Yes.

Because one of the problems we have here, is it not,
is that the people around are in a crowd being
pressured from behind? - A. Yes.

And the more people who arrive from behind, the more
difficult it is for those in the front, or whatever
section you are going to make the front, whether you
sectionalise it off or not, to do what you want them
to do? - A. Yes.

Because it is nigh impossible to move back if you are
at the front of a section if you have got tremendous
pressure from behind you, is it not? - A. Yes.

I appreciate that there was a time - and it seemed to
be a very small time in this particular saga - when
there was a gap at the back of the crowd in the
turnstile area and the perimeter gates, because you
have told us about that, but that gap did not last for
very long, did it? - A.  No.

How long did that gap last for? - A. Probably five
minutes.

Meanwhile people were still pouring in through the
perimeter gates? - A. We weren't exactly inactive all
the time,  We were waving our arms, gesticulating,
shouting to people.             '

Of course, but people were still pouring down Leppings
lane, were they not? - A. Yes.

Until you very sensibly put that cordon up very late
on, no steps were bging taken to prevent the flow of
people down Leppings Lane, were there? - A. We had
tried prior to that the gate tactic of shutting the
gates.

When you were using the gate tactic, people were still
flowing down Leppings Lane? - A. Yes.

Q.   ' I ought to deal with that because you were closing the
       gates and I do not blame you in that situation at that
       time, but you were closing the gates onto the people
       who were already pressing against the gates? - A. No,
       not really.

Q.   There were people coming down Leppings Lane, you have
     already told us, in great numbers? - A. The pressing
     was on the other side at the turnstile side.    They
     were not pressing up against the gates per s e . We
     were able to shut the gates so that there could not
     have been that much pressure on them.

Q.   But then, after you had closed the gates, people were
     flowing down Leppings Lane, were they not? - A. They
     were flowing until 3 o'clock.

Q.   We have heard from Inspector Creaser that there came a
     time, probably round the time you are  talking about,
     when there was about 5,000 people around that
     turnstile area in and outside the area? - A. Yes sir.

Q.   Would you agree with that estimate? -    A. Yes, I would.

Q.   You would agree with me that the more people who come
      down Leppings Lane, the more they add onto the
      concourse area which is the pavement area between the
      perimeter gates and Leppings Lane? - A. Yes.




                              /Q. Tell me
                                              P.   HAND-DAVIS


If everybody hadn't arrived by two o^clock, if one was
inside the ground shall we say in the control box and^
could see at two o'clock that the bulk of people hadn t
arrived, you would know from then onwards, at that time,
you were in for a problem? - A. Indeed.

Tell me, did you ever receive notification that you were
in for a problem? - A. I think I have said so that I
hadn't.
           Cross-Examined by MR. CATCHPOLEt

Inspector, can I follow on from there?   We have heard a
lot from many police witnesses who have said they can
only police crowds with the reasonable co-operation of
that crowd? - A. Yes, sir.
If a large crowd had arrived at 2.30 onwards on this day
that had been co-operative and had heeded the advice
given by the police officers, do you think that situation
would have been unpoliceable? - A. No.

Can you explain what the difference between events of
that day, 2.30 to 3.00, is from my example of the crowd
that wants to help the police, that is co-operating £ “ h
them and listening to reasonable advice? What was th®
difference in the crowd on that day? - A. As compared to
previous years?

Well, just generally, or compared to previous years? - A.
I think it was again this word "frustration.    There
were such huge numbers with such little time to get in
through so few turnstiles that this air of
unreasonableness descended upon people.

You had an air of unreasonableness.   Is-that what made
it in the end an unpoliceable situation? - A. People
pushed and shoved and got more and more panicky and the
turnstiles became - it became almost impossible to pass
through a turnstile.

It is obvious that the more you pressurise a turnstile,
the more it is jammed up, the less'quickly it will
actually work? - A. I think that is what happened, sir.

Your evidence, in tandem with many other officers who
have given evidence, has been that the events of the 15th
of April were wholly exceptional.   Is that fair? - A.
Yes.

You can no doubt confirm that since your time in the
South Yorkshire Police from 1986, that the layout at that
end of the ground has remained the same? - A. It has,
yes.

F N GRUNHILL (56)                            Mounted Merside Police

Things quiet initially but after 2.15 (very approximately) pressure
began to build up. Was within T/S area. Appealed to crowd,
ineffective, felt that people at back were capable of movement and
he observed pushing. Managed to create gap between T/S crowd and          6
perimeter gate. People didn't move back, felt perimeter gates
went (forced). Crush intensified. Nothing to stop people spilling         7-10
onto riverside. Tried to create wedge (as per S Fry).
(RECHECK CROSS-EXAMINATION TRANSCRIPT).



57.   P.S. SMITH                             MOUNTED MERSEYSIDE POLICE

Seven years' experience.   Alcohol - felt more people in streets
taking alcohol than normal. Between 2 pm and 2.15 pm T/S appeared
slow, positioned outside perimeter gate. Advised people outside
perimeter gate, capable of voluntary movement. No pressure to move       40
forward, no restrictions on people to go down Leppings Lane but
plenty of room.   Two cordons formed. Saw Landrover, appealed,             41, 42
had no effect. Perimeter gate shutfor short time. Was obvious
to people that they were trying to block road. People going forward      43
on their own volition, many unwilling to listen to reason than in        44
any other crowd.   Exampled crowd outside T/S two/three weeks later      45,
at Tranmere, only two T/Stiles operational, orderly queues, many           7<78 81
not in until 4 pm, no p r ob l e m s .
Plenty of room in Leppings Lane, no reason why queues should not
have been formed.   Agreed geography was not ideal. He had done          46, 49
it before at Sheffield Wednesday and Everton. When buildup occurred
he deployed two officers within T/S area. Commented that a crush         57
can occur around a T/S with only 20/30 p e op l e .                      71
Ticketless fans difficult to estimate.    Creation of barrier caused
aggressiveness.                                                84

55.   S FRY                                PC 5043 MOUNTED OFFICER
                                                   HER5ET5TDE---

Initial perambulation, some drinking, of no moment. Went to
Leppings Lane as train escort about 14.10. Nil of note. Sweeping
for 10/15 minutes. Nothing unusual. Last time he looked at watch        23
wa 2.15. Went towards Leppings Lane entrance between 2.15 and
2.30, congested, joined other mounted officers. Positioned outside
left-hand perimeter gate, T/S A-G, appealed to people, some response,   24
others incapable, others didn't care. Some made effort to step
aside, others content to stay. Rapid buildup, gap at rear of
crowd within perimeter achieved (about 8 ft). Noted that people at
rear of crowd under no pressure. Noted that those close to him
were under no pressure from people outside, appeared to be pushing
towards T/S. No response to appeals.                                    26
Within seconds crowds had merged.                                       27 - 28
Moved outside. People still forcing their way past. Joined cordon,          P.'j/?
positioned near sweet shop, people squashed between tail and under      27
horse, did so voluntarily. Horse was hit, exceptional experience
for him. Had seen pushing before, including at Anfield, desperate       33
to get in. Agreed that he was encouraging people towards Leppings       33 - 37
Lane at about 14.28 when position was getting difficult. Objective
was to try to get people into the ground in an orderly manner, not
to stem the flow. No reason why queues should not have been formed
up to Halifax Road if necessary. Have to rely on people's nature
to co-operate. POssibly easier at Anfield but even there they have
to rely on people joining back of queue.
Agreed that ideally pressure should be removed from the back, but       43
agreed that he was attempting to segment the crowd, attempting to
communicate with people further back, but to be fully effective
would have needed others to split the crowd.

52.   K E HORSFIELD                         P.C.

On T/S 16. Describes grounds up to 2 pm as quiet, 2-2.30 as normal,
after 2.30 things became rather more hectic. At 1.30 noticed small
groups who did not appear to wish   to enter and at that time was still
able to walk up and down queues.    Stand infilling with disappearance
of queues. Could hear cries coming from A-G area. After a while
realised he couldn't continue with his activity and went to
perimeter gate to help mounted officer. Perimeter gates were open
and closed about 2.40 but not before. People were climbing over
the gate which he had closed. He was jostled, abused and in the
end had to let go of the bolt of the gate and the gate opened.            88
Recollects Gate A opening, which relieved the crush.                      92
On entering the pitch he could see the players just going into the
tunnel (15.07). He was called by Sgt. Morgan to enter the terrace
via tunnel. Tunnel was clear, nobody was ahead of him, he could           89, 90
see trouble on the terrace, crush situation, people pushed forward,
he pulled people back who were still pushing forward, had to fight
his way onto terrace. Recollects that people in the stand above
were pointing to the front and shouting but he could not make out
what it was but he could tell there was a panic.



53.   J KILLOCH                             WEST MIDLANDS P.O.

He confirmed that the identification of Richard Jones at 14.56 had
now been reviewed and withdrawn by the parents.

48. R W CREASER                           CHIEF INSPECTOR


Mr Creaser had experience going back to 1977. He had responsibility
in the area for Leppings Lane turnstiles and rear enclosure. He
was supported by Inspector Purdy. He described searching
techniques including discretion. He said that the flow rate was
about the same as that of 2.00 pm in 1988 and 1989.


He said that about 2.30/2.45 there were crowd increases but not
remarkably, but that then it was like a "leaving" crowd arriving,
mainly young people 17-23. He would describe them as fighting
drunks, 2/3 pint men and that there was a very high percentage
who were taking in alcohol. Distinguishing features - late
arrival and high alcohol.


Ticketless fans estimated at 200. Did not think they had any right
to turn people away and, in any case, not practical to ask 54,000
people whether they had tickets or not. Attempted to form cordon
with police horses about 2.45/2.50. Perimeter gates were then
closed but gave under pressure. He thought the gates were closed
before the cordon. There was considerable pushing and jostling,
more than just trifling social contact. Cordon worked but needed
discipline when concertina gate opened. Recollected LANDROVER
arriving, saw him stop then push forward and then stop by sweet
shop end of cordon.
He approached PC Buxton and requested kick-off to be delayed.
Also heard Constable Ryan over the tannoy system at that time.




                                                    /continued.

     48. ROBERT WALLACE CREASER (continued...2)



     He confirmed that he was in Leppings Lane in 1988 as well and said
     the 2.30/3.00 situation was different.


     Closing the Tunnel

     He said that he had learned that the tunnel had been closed in 1988.
     Thinks he discovered this after the 1989 event although not entirely
••




     sure, cannot really remember because 1988 went so smoothly. He did
     not give the order to close the tunnel.

     (See photocopy of Pgs 4 and 5 volume 13)

     In cross-examination, he describes some of the difficulties of queuing.


     (See photocopy of Page 14 volume 13)

     Attempts were made to try and stop people surging outside. People
     less well-behaved and who had more alcohol arriving in large numbers
     as time progressed causing those more innocent to be crushed at the
     front. He agreed that the people not having drink were quieter than
••




     those who had. He agreed that only a limited number of people had
     got into the turnstile area but that the problems there were due to
     their condition and conduct and if people had heeded advice then
     there would have been enough room to acommodate them but that there
     is no mechanism for counting them in.


     (See photocopy of Page 22 and 23 volume 13)

     He then discussed filling with Mr King and agreed that if people were
     left to themselves they would fill in from the center outwards. He
     agreed that distribution would be via the gates at the back and entry
     onto the terraces was forward, and that one would have to turn round        Pg 26
     to see them but that the crowd would be able to detect movement towards
     those gates and the same strategy had been employed in 1988. He                27
     agreed that it was important to redistribute if the centre pens are full.
     (See photocopy of Page 28 and 29 volume 13)
48.    ROBERT WALLACE CREASER (continued...3)


He agreed that if a pen got too full it would be sensible to
direct people elsewhere. He agreed that he did not know of any specific
planning for this but that it was unnecessary for it to be written
into the operational orders because Police Officers were experienced
and he himself had often gauged the fullness of a pen.


(See photocopy of Pages 33,34,35 volume 13)

He confirmed that Inspectors were more than used to responsibility
and were in fact in charge of the city at night. He confirmed
that he received specific instructions from Supt Murray that
should monitor the pens. This would be an informal briefing .


(See    photocopy of Page 27 volume 13)


He had considerable confidence in Inspector White. He said he had
specifically asked Supt Murray for confirmation as to the manner
of filling the pens and was told that it would be the same as last
year. r He agreed that there was a system in operation to ensure the
pens are filled from specific instructions during leagae games and
that that would involve shutting off some pens possibly and that
it was essential that large numbers should not be allowed into full
pens and that there is potential danger and the possibility of
injury.

He made it clear that the operational order could not cover every
possible eventuality. He agreed that it was relatively easy to
climb into the stands and that it was a practice to be discouraged.
He agreed that the stewards were properly briefed by Insp White and
that none were deployed on the terrace.
He agreed that on Exhibit C305, timed at 14.30, no problems appeared
to exist with queueing. He agreed that had kick-off been postponed
and the information conveyed, it might have reduced the pushing. He
agreed that the opening of the gate was the correct decision.
DAY 13
5 DECEMBER 1991


48 R H CREASER (continued...4)

He agreed that he would not report up unless he needed guidance
and that he had had no contact with Mr Greenwood after 2.30.              60
Finding their own level was a tried and tested method. As far             62
as he was aware the same method was used in 1987. He didn't voice
any adverse comment but would have done so if he thought it wasn't
safe. Semi-final being an all-ticket match they knew how many
people were going. The lateral fences were designed for safety.
He confirmed that the assessment on filling of a pen was simply
a visual one and neither stewards nor police officers were posted         65
on the terrace. He confirmed that closing the blue gates on the
tunnel would stop people entering but that he felt that for exiting
reasons it was an unsafe step.                                            69
He agreed with Mr Hale that solving one problem often created another.    70
He agreed that the terrace was treated as one pen.                        72
He confirmed that the lateral fences tended to stop convergance
towards centre. (See Mr Mole who also said that).                         73   *
He agreed that distribution entirely hinges on recognition of fillings.   74
He was satisfied that the order, from having read it, had a very
professional approach.

                                      R.W. CREASER


Q. Can I just ask you:  it sounds then from what you say
   although you believe it happened you yourself have no
   recollection of giving that order to close.  That is
   correct? - A. Yes sir.

Q. What do you think, bearing in mind what you have just told
   me about the 1988 match that it went off as far as you
   were concerned smoothly, why would anybody wish to control
   or seal off the tunnel? - A. If the central pens, the two
   central pens from which access is gained by the tunnel
   were full then a quite justifiable decision might be made
   that we will not allow any more fans in there.  There
   are several ways of controlling that.  One of them would
   be to consider closing that gate or putting Police Officers
   at the concourse end of the central tunnel to discourage
   people from going down the tunnel.

Q. And that decision would have to be made at what level or
   by whom? - A. It would possibly be made by an Officer of
   the rank of Inspector.

Q. And the sealing or the closing would of course be done
   on the concourse side of the tunnel not at the terracing
   side? - A. That is correct.

Q. Presumably those Officers cannot actually see what is
   going on in the terraces in detail.  Is that right?
   - A. Well I don't know the length of the tunnel, it is
   perhaps 10, 15 metres.

Q. A bit longer than that. - A. It  is several seconds walk
   although viewing the terrace from the rear of the tunnel
   is not an accurate way of estimating whether or not the
   pens are full because it is a shallow slope and you can't
   see the front of the pens from the rear of the pens from
   the tunnel.

Q. That is in fact the point I was putting to you.  In order
   to get a proper assessment as to whether or not the tunnel
   should be sealed it really has to be done from somebody
   who is on the far side, namely who is looking at the
   terraces from the ground end rather than the tunnel end?
   - Q. When I have worked at Hillsborough I have used several
   methods of gauging when those pens have been full.   I
   can itemise them if you want.  One of them will be
   information from the Ground Control who have a sideways
   view slightly to the front and to the side and they can
   view across the terraces.  People on the perimeter track
   obviously have good sight of how full the pens are at the
   front.  It can be observed from the West Stand, so from
   the steps to the West Stand which are situated near the
   concourse end of the tunnel you can go up to the West
   Stand and view it from the West Stand or alternatively
   communicate with somebody who is in the West Stand by radio

                                          R.W. CREASER


Q. But they all depend upon somebody communicating with the
   Officers out in the concourse area to take action of some
   sort or other? - A. Well when I have been an Inspector with
         <5uti«s I myself have walked up to the West Stand,
   looked down and made an assessment of whether or not those
   pens have been full.

Q. I see and when you say an Inspector with those responsibilities
   you mean an Inspector in the concourse area, do you mean?
   - A. Yes sir.

Q. As far as you know you have no knowledge that that tunnel
   was sealed off in 1989? - A. Correct, yes sir.

Q. I am not criticising you, I am just asking you? - A. No,
   that is correct. At the time when that action was likely
   to be taken, i.e. when the pens were full, I would have
   been outside the Stadium.

Q. That is why I asked you that earlier. - A. Yes sir.


                        Cross-Examined by MR. PAYNE:

Q. Mr. Creaser, I wonder if you would be kind enough please
   to go through with the jury the planning that took place
   in preparation for this match and please do it by reference
   to the Operational Order which I think you have got in front
   of you.

           MR. JONES:     C285 sir.

Q.         MR. PAYNE:  Now in the Operational Order can you go
     to page 15. Now at page 15 headed "Senior Officers'
     Duties" I have come straight to the part where your name
     is first mentioned, Mr. Creaser.  It starts off by saying:

           "Chief Inspectors and above will NOT use a
           call sign but will be identified by their name
           and rank."

     Then one runs one's eye down the column of Officers and
     you are about a third of the way down the page in charge
     of Sector IB, Chief Inspector Creaser.  Right? - A. Yes
     sir.

Q. I am just drawing your attention to it and then we will
   come to the particular serials.   Under your command are
   Serials 11-19 and Reserves 20/21.   Over the page at page 16
   there is a further table setting out the Inspectors who
   are under your command in sub-sectors 5 down to sub-sector
   9, that is halfway down the page, each of those Inspectors
   in command of mostly two Serials.   In the case of Mr. Builas
   in the West Stand just one and it gives the call sign of
   each of those Inspectors.  Right? - A. Correct sir.
                                                        14




                                                R. W. CKSftSER


  So on one side people do not form a queue in the road
  because they get run over.   So that assists the
  Police.   The traffic flow stops people walking into
  the road.   In addition there will be a horse walking
  up and down to make sure that people form flat queues
  against the turnstile walls.

       That queue can be extended along Penistone Road.
  As I am sure you will appreciate, at Leppings Lane
  end there is a different geographical layout.   I have
  heard it described by various means of funnels and
  that sort of thing.  It is far more difficult to get
  people to form orderly queues.  The other factors
  that you have to bear in mind is the willingness or
  otherwise of those people to form an orderly queue.
  I am sure people have given examples of people who
  queue for going to the theatre or other social
  events.  They form an orderly queue without the
  necessity for large numbers of Police Officers,
  Traditionally that is not the case with large crowds
  attending football matches.  So all I can say is that
  the attempt is to form an orderly queue.  That can be
  achieved at most football matches with some degree of
  co-operation from the participants.

Q. In the light of the numbers who arrived between 2.30
   and 3 o'clock, particularly at about and after
   quarter to three on the occasion of this match, was
   there any way in which the Police Officers could have
   complied with this part of the operational plan? - A.
   They were striving to achieve it but I think this
   Court has had the advantage of seeing the video and
   you can see the efforts made.   Particularly
   prominent are the mounted Officers who you can see
   over the crowd.  Perhaps there is no sound on the
   video but the mounted Officers were encouraging
   people not to push.  The definition of an orderly
   queue becomes blurred as the crowd gets larger.

Q. On the question of the crowd, I would like to ask you
   a question about that.  It has become apparent as
   this Inquest has progressed that although obviously
   the crowd is made up of a large number of individuals
   there are significantly different sections of the
   crowd and that there are some sections who are well
   behaved and orderly and other sections, who are not
   well behaved.  There are some sections, a significant
   number, who have had too much to drink.   From your
   observation and experience, Mr. Creaser, can you tell
   the Jury what effect does each of these sections have
   on the behaviour of the crowd as a whole? - A. I
                                            R.   W.   CREASER


turnstile area for the purpose of efficiently going
through the turnstiles, then you will be in trouble as
far as getting people efficiently into the ground, won't
you?   Youmust be if you get too many. - A. Yes, sir.

Therefore, any planning ought to take into account
control of the numbers going into the turnstile area,
would you agree with that? - A. It is difficult the way
you are putting it because you are sort of bending the
question that you should give a plan to some event, and I
have got to relate it to experience.     I can't draw it
out on paper and plan it that way.     An event of this
nature is policed by experience.     The offices who were
in command of this match were very experienced police
offices and in their experience at that location the
situation you are describing had never previously
occurred.     If somebody had given them some indication
that there  was a possibility that this might have
occurred, then, yes, some thought would be given to it.

Do I take it from that that before this matcn in 1989 no
thought was given to a means of controlling the people as
they go through the perimeter gates, controlling the
numbers going in to the turnstile area.

      THE CORONER:   Mr. King, I think you can ask him
whether he gave thought, but he can't say that there was
no thought because he doesn't know what other people
said*    Answer that question in relation to yourself.

     MR. KING:   Sir, he did say he was aware of the
planning.

     THE CORONER:   Yes.   Well, first of all in relation
to yourself and then in relation to people you know about
who did the planning, but not in respect of every
conceivable person there might be, so answer twice, so to
speak.

     THE WITNESS:   Sir, my answer would be in my
experience and the thought I gave to this, this is a
situation which has never previously arisen.   Ue were
policing an event which is - my description - a carbon
copy of the event the previous year.   There was not a
problem the previous year, so when an event has run
smoothly why change it?

     MR. KING:   I understand that.   It is saying that
because there has been no fire we won't have any
precautions to prevent fire.   I am asking you:   was
there any provision, to your knowledge, in your planning
for the control of the numbers of people entering the
turnstile area? - A. Your analogy is unfair.    We had
here a football stadium that holds approximately 52,000
                                              R.   W.   CREASER


people.   We have policed that on many occasions when
52,000 people have attended at that football match.    The
kick-off time was a conventional kick-off time of 3.00 pm
and never in my experience, and, I suggest, in the
experience of the other 'senior officers who commanded
this, has there been any indication that that area would
become over-full.

What you are saying to us - and I understand your answer
- is because we haven't experienced this problem in the
past, we didn't - and you may say legitimately - provide
for it happening in the future.   That is what you are
saying? - A. Yes, sir.

What it comes down to is this, that there was no
provision in the planning for the control of the numbers
of people going through the perimeter gates into the
turnstiles area?   That is right, isn't it? - A. No, it
is not.   The planning is we were put in charge of this
policing operation, police officers who have got
considerable experience of public disorder situations.
The police officers in South Yorkshire are perhaps
fortunate, or you might say unfortunate, that they have
vast experience of policing large events where there is
public disorder.   I would include in these the miners'
strikes of the early seventies, the steel strike of
1980/81, the miners' strike of 1984/85, numerous football
matches, race meetings.   Officers from South Yorkshire
visited the riots in Liverpool at Toxteth, the riots in
Birminghan, Handsworth, and so we have a core of very
experienced police officers in dealing with public
disorder, perhaps far more experienced than several other
police forces.

The planning would be that you combined the experience
and talent of those officers in applying their policing
tactics to situations as they arose.   If some event was
not planned and not written in this Operation Order it
doesn't mean to say that no thought would be given to it
should it arise.

Dealing with the Operational Order - just take, for
example, page 31 of the Order, which we have looked at
\tfhich are the duties of the serials outside the Leppings
Lane turnstiles. - A. Right, sir.

Do you agree with me this much:  there is no written
provision in this Operational Order dealing with the
controlling of the entry of persons into the turnstile
area?   You will agree with me that far? - A. Yes, and
there is nothing specific in that about the example you
have quoted about there being a fire in the stadium.
There are all sorts of contingencies not mentioned in
there.    The point I am making his that there were very
                                                               27

                                     R.W. CREASER



Q. I agree. - A. If you empty the stadium when it is full you
   do,that and that, you have difficulty if not it would be
   impossible to see those gates.

Q. I am obliged.  So as far as the fans finding their own
   level on terraces filling'the pens, if they enter through
   the tunnel and the terrace is already full in the centre
   pens then they are going to find it almost impossible, I
   would say impossible by their own devices to find a way
   to the side pens.  You would agree with me? - A. No sir.

Q. You don't agree? - A. I disagree with you entirely.

Q. Why? - A. The method of filling those pens and letting
   them find their own level was a tried and trusted method
   and if you talk about an individual spectator moving
   through those pens then what you say is probably correct
   nobody else would notice it, but if it became too full
   in those pens then people in the crowd would be able
   to detect movement through those gates and in fact the
   strategy was used in 1989 because it had been successful
   the previous year.

Q. In order for people in the centre pens to move    to the
   left or the right they have to go through that    small
   gate at the top, that is the only way they can    go if
   they are going to move while on the terraces.     That is
   right, isn't it? - A. That is correct.

Q. There is a way of getting to the side pens round the
   side of the West Stand, isn't there? - A. There are three
   access points to the terraces, one through the central
   tunnel, one to the south end of the West Stand, one to
   the north end which is also as it happens a tunnel.

Q. If one comes through the turnstiles A-G one can either
   go through the tunnel? - A. Yes sir.

Q. And we know that takes you to Pens 3 and 4, the centre
   pens? - A. That is correct, yes sir.

Q. Or if one knows about it one can go to the left through
   that little wall and round the side to the side pens
   eventually? - A. That is correct, yes sir.

Q. Or one can go to the right to the side pens.     Right?
   - A. That is correct, yes sir.

Q. If the Pens 3 and 4, those are the centre pens, become
   too full and the side pens are not yet full so there is
   an uneven distribution if you have got that picture.
   All right? - A. Are you hypothesising on any particular
   match?

                                       R,W. CREASER


          i0 just deal with that. Would you agree with me, as
'"r" t m c b o d y who has experiences of terraces, that it is
     important to redistribute, to make sure that anybody coining
     toto the ground doesn't go down into the full pens but
     fOft* round the sides to the emptier pens. That would be
     * •ensible plan to have, wouldn’t it? - A. Yes sir.

Q. Often one talks about the even distribution of crowds across
   a terrace.  You understand that concept? - A. Often one talks
   about it?

Q. Yes, but do you understand the concept of even distribution?
   Do you know what I mean having a crowd evenly distributed
   across a terrace? - A. Well that does not happen at football
   matches.  As you have said there is a preference for people
   to be behind the goals.   It is very difficult to get an
   even distribution.

Q. Well it is difficult if you leave the fans to their own
   devices obviously, but you can in fact have means of
   controlling the entry into individual pens, can't you?
   - A. I can.

Q. Well could you not devise a system for controlling entry
   into individual pens? - A. If you asked me to do that I
   could, yes sir.

Q. You could for example, I have just put examples to you,
   you could for example have a turnstile which only gives
   access to a particular pen, couldn't you? - A. Yes, are
   we talking in general what I could do at any football match
   in any ground, or are you asking what happened last April?

Q. Let me deal for the moment with just general ways of
   filling a terrace which is divided into pens, all right,
   just generally now before we come to last year. - A.
   Right sir.

Q. You have agreed with me that if you leave it to the fans'
   own devices they are likely not to evenly distribute
   themselves, they are likely to go to the two centre pens
   behind the goal, because that is what you have said?
   - A. If I was considering this problem then I would
   consider where do these people who have paid money to
   come and watch football want to stand and if they want
   to stand behind the goals and I can facilitate that then
   I will do that and it might be, and I will talk now in
   more specific terms, at Hillsborough if there is for
   example when there is a league match away fans coming
   then I would certainly fill one or other of the two
   central pens first and it might be that that is the
   entire complement of away fans but I would try to
   facilitate the people as much as I can within my terms
   of reference to watch the game of football they have
   come to watch.
                                    R.W. CREASER


JUtd in order to facilitate the filling of pens    you have
to*have a means of directing people to a given     pen, don't
you? You have got to direct them to a pen in       order to
have control over where they go? - A. Well you     are putting
it in very specific terms.   People come in and    they naturally
walk into a pen, yes.

In order to control the numbers entering a pen you have to
in some way either prevent people going where they want to go
and you don't   want them to go or generally direct them in
a given area.    You have to do something to control the
numbers going   in a pen if you are going to control them
you have got to do something? - A. To control the numbers,
yes, you need a counting mechanism, some turnstile or
electric ray or whatever to count the numbers.

That is just counting the numbers but actually ensuring
that people go into a particular pen which is a means of
controlling the numbers you need to direct them in some
way, don't you? - A. If I am exercising that sort of control,
yes.

And one of the ways you can do that, just coming now to
the Hillsborough ground, is for example you can cordon off
or block off a tunnel which is the means of entry on to
the centre pens and direct people round the sides.  That
is one way of controlling the numbers going into a given
pen, isn't it? - A. It is, yes sir.

Another way   of controlling numbers of people going into
a given pen   is to make sure that a given turnstile leads
only, gives   access only to one particular pen.  That is
another way   of doing it? - A. It isn't at Hillsborough.

No, but that is a way of dealing with it, isn't it?
- A. It is not a way in which I have got any influence,
but yes, you are right.

You seem to think I am criticising.  I am not, I am trying
to elicit from you experience of means of control.  That
is one way of dealing with it, isn't it? - A. Yes.

Now just looking at turnstiles A-G now and dealing with
Hillsborough as it was on the 15th of April, everybody
who came through those turnstiles A-G were people who
were going to stand on the terraces.  I say "everybody"
that is the turnstiles which were designated for those
who were going to stand on the terraces.  You agree with
me? - A. Yes.

In Hillsborough on the 15th of April all those turnstiles
led to the same concourse area, didn't it? - A. Yes sir.

As you rightly say those individual turnstiles weren't
in any way directed to a particular pen on the terrace.
That is right? - A. Yes sir.
                                                            32



                                              R.   W. CREASER




Q. So the system as you understand it was just generally
   leaving it to any particular Officer who saw something
   to bring it to the attention of another Officer? There
   was no specific .... - A. No, sir, no ....

Q. Well was there a specific .... - A. No, I will refer
   you to the Order, the part of the Order that says that.
   It is called "Intention".

        "It is the intention of the Police to allow this
        match to take place and to ensure public order and
        safety both inside and outside the football ground
        •   • • •
                    •*

Q. I understand that. - A. And that is the intention and
   that is the written instruction.   Following that, if I
   can relate to my experience perhaps as an Inspector,
   when I was monitoring the pens at Leppings Lane I would
   use all sorts of methods to establish when in my
   opinion no more fans should be permitted entry to a
   particular pen. I would go up into the West Stand and
   look down and decide whether or not I thought it was
   full.   I would ask Officers who had sight of the pen,
   perhaps in the Police Control Room, whether they
   thought it was full.    I would, although I wouldn't use
   this as a reliable method, people who exited from the
   pens, perhaps down the central tunnel, might say, "It's
   choc-a-bloc in there, don't let any more people in".     I
   would use a variety of sources, but,all that can't be
   documented in an Operational Order.

 Q. That, of course, is relying on spontaneous information,
    I understand that.  What I am asking for, and it may be
    it is just a straightforward answer, there wasn't a
    specific briefing or a specific Operational Order
    directed to the monitoring of the pens, that is right,
    isn't it? - A. No, it is not right. There was a
    specific order to say that the fans will find their own
    level within the pens.

 Q. I am sorry, I didn't realise that.  Could we have that
    again, please? - A. Yes, my instructions were that the
    fans would be allowed to find their own level within
    the pens.

 Q. And how was a fan who had entered Pens 3 and 4, those
    are the centre pens, to find his own level if there was
    no way he could get to the sides beyond Pens 3 and 4.
    Once he was on the terrace how was he going to find his
    own level on to, say, Pen 5 oc 6? - A. Well, surely
    that is commonsense?  If you go to a football ground
    and you stand on a terrace and you are not comfortable,
    or you are not satisfied with the view you have got,
    you would prefer to be close to the corner flag to see

                                                              33



                                                 R.   W. CREASER




     corner kicks being taken, or you want to be directly
     behind the goal to see penalties taken, or wherever,
     you determine yourself where you want to stand.

Q. But you go onto the centre terrace through the tunnel,
   and you meet the radial fence on your right-hand side
   when you are moving across.  You can't go any further,
   you are in a crowd.  How do you get into the side pen?
   - A. Well, these things happen.  People have come who
   have consumed alcohol, and 1 would stress they are a
   minority, but these people would presumably want to use
   the toilets and other facilities such as they are at
   the club.  The question shouldn't be addressed to me as
   to how they get out of there. They either go out the
   way they have come in or through the radial fences.

Q. To whom should I direct the question ....

          THE CORONER:      I don't think you can ask the
     witness that.

          HR. KING:      So be it, sir.

          THE WITNESS:   I can say I have never experienced
     people having been in a pen and wanting to go from that
     pen, whether to use the toilets, to buy a hot dog, to
     buy a programme, to get a better view in another part
     of the ground, I have never experienced them having
     difficulties in being able to do so.

Q.        13R. KING:  If a pen is too full for the safety of
     the persons in it .... - A. We don't let that situation
     arise.

Q. I am sorry? - A. You should not let that situation
   arise.

Q. You shouldn't let it arise, right. Well, I agree with
   you, so what provision was there in the Operational
   Order designed to prevent, shall we say the centre
   pens, getting too full? What was the system in
   operation on 15th April directed to that problem? - A.
   The situation would be that Officers would be told, "Do
   not allow any more fans entry" into whichever pen was
   causing the problem.

Q. Where were the Officers stationed who were going to
   stop the fans going onto those pens? - A. 'where were
   they stationed?

Q. Yes. - A. It depends which pens.

Q. Let's say the centre pens.  Where were they stationed,
   these Officers who on 15th April were going to prevent

*
                                               R. W.   CR E A SE R




     the fans getting into a Pen 3 or 4 which was too full.
     Where were they stationed? - A. They would be stationed
     - Officers could be used at that location from the
     concourse.

Q. Are you saying it is the Officers on the concourse ....
   - A. No, I am not saying that.  You are asking me - it
   could be, there are two reserve serials there, it could
   be members of the reserve serial.

Q. What I want to know is who on 15th April, which
   Officers, had the specific duty of preventing fans
   getting into Pens 3 and 4 when they had become too
   full? - A, You misunderstood me. What I am saying is
   that if the pen became full then I or another Officer
   present, on their experience of policing that football
   match, would make a decision it is time now to stop any
   more fans entering a particular area, wherever that may
   be, and the Officers deployed there would be dependent
   upon the Officers available for deployment at that
    time.

Q. So the system for preventing any further fans going
   onto Pens 3 or 4 would be for you, was it you who would
   communicate with Officers on the concourse?  Who had
   the job of deciding whether or not Pens 3 or 4 were too
   full? Who was in control of that problem?

          THE CORONER:   That is a very difficult question
     for this Officer to answer because this is potentially
     an incriminating question, I think.

          MR. KING:   So be it.

          THE CORONER:   I had better explain this to the
     witness so that he can decide \?hat he wants to say:

Q. In a Coroner's Court you do not have to answer any
   question which may tend to incriminate you.  It is in
   the Rules - it is Rule 22, I think.  This question has
   a potential, in my judgment, a potentially
   incriminating aspect to it. You are, of course,
   entitled to answer it if you wish, but if you genuinely
   believe that an answer might incriminate you then you
   are perfectly entitled to refuse to do so. - A. I am
   obliged, sir.  Will that warning be given in relation
   to every single question of that nature?

Q. If I notice it, yes. > A. I am obliged, sir.

Q. I won't give it at such length, I will probably shorten
   it, but you will know the sense. - A. Yes.  Then I can
   only refer you back to the written instruction, "It is
   tne intention of the Police to ensure that the match

                                                              35




                                              R.   W.   CREASER




   takes place safely” , arid so all Police Officers would
   have a responsibility in that direction.

Q« I do understand that.  I am trying to find out - there
   may not have been - whether there was a specific plan
   in the operation planning for first of all discovering
   whether or not, say, the centre pens were too full, and
   then for taking steps to ensure fans didn't go into the
   centre pens.  What was the system which was going to be
   put into operation? - A. The system would be that when
   the information was received that the pens were full,
   in fact, that would be as they were approaching
   becoming full, some positive action would be taken to
   prevent more fans entering that part of the ground.

Q. Let me take that in stages then. To whom would the
   information be sent? - A. To the people controlling the
   match.

Q. And who were they on 15th April, 1989? - A. There was a
   set up, the Police Ground Control, which would be
   headed by a Chief Superintendent, who would be assisted
   by a staff of four or five people in his Control Room.

Q. Where were they stationed - in the Control Room? - A.
   They would be in what is called Ground Control, which
   is overlooking the terraces that you are talking about.

Q. So in other words they were in the Control Box, I think
   everybody knows to what I am referring, which is higher
   looking down over the terraces? - A. That is correct,
   yes.

Q. So you say the information would be passed to them,
   right? - A. In some respects they would be one of the
   sources of the information because an Officer at the
   rear concourse, or an Officer who walked down the
   tunnel, would perhaps gain the impression that the
   centre pens were full, and I have done it myself.   I
   have radioed back and said - at different matches -
    These pens are full", only to be advised by those in
   control to say, "Ho, they are not full actually, there
   is plenty of room at the front."

Q. I understand that, they could be a source. - A. So it
   is not just from one single source.

Q. I understand that.  I am talking now about the
   collectihg of the information once it has been
   received, and you tell me that the information would be
   sent to the Ground Control in that Box? - A. Correct,
   sir.                                                9

      DAY 11
      3 DECEMBER 1990

      45. ROGER GRAHAM HEWSTONE                SUPPORTER & PROBATION OFFICER

      Coach Traveller, Departed 11.45am. Delayed at Manchester, checked
      by Police. Arrived 14.30/14.35. Thought at least 15/20 coaches
      had already arrived. One or two coming in behind. Reached
      Leppings Lane about 14.35/14.40. Crowd were stationary in a
      wedge shape at the perimeter gates. Saw 2 mounted Police who
      were ineffective.

      Previous poor experience in a large crowd at Wembley so stood to
      one side near the bridge. The crowd appeared stationary.

      Noticed arrival of LANDROVER and the Inspector using a loud-hailer
      asking for mounted Inspector. He also heard requests to crowd to
      ease back to no effect. He then heard him say that an attempt was
      being made to delay kick-off which had no obvious effect.                Pc 65/67

       Saw Police Officer make scissor action with hand, some gates
       opened and the crowd poured in. He was able to go through the
      Jajrnsti1e and the concourse was fairly empty. Entered the tunnel
       which was completely empty except at exit to the terrace where
       crowd was backed up and stationary. Would only have been able to
       get through by forcing his way. Able to watch match from that           Pc 71
       position.   After 5 minutes, noticed 2/3 people coming out,
       breathing heavily and perspiring commenting it was worse than
       Heysel. He remembers this comment was made as the ball hit the
       cross-bar. Noticed someone he thought was a Steward coming down.
       People in tunnel unconcerned. He decided to leave and went back
       out. He saw 5/6 fans take a run back and bull-doze their way
      through. Agree|5d that Police Officers had less control outside
       and that everyone had free passage down Leppings Lane.

3 DECEMBER 1990

44. GRAHAM RICHARDSON                          EVERTON SUPPORTER

Coach traveller. 11.00am to 14.45pm. Checked by Police 10 miles
from Sheffield and when entering through Gate C. Leppings Lane
perimeter gates shut, crowds shouting to get in and angry saying
trouble if gates not opened. Saw 3 mounted Police Officers.


Entered Gate C 14.55pm. Entered concourse area had to go with      Pg 32/34
crowd into tunnel. Tunnel full but not blocked but was a bit
of a push. Players already on pitch whilst in tunnel and moving
onto terraces which were already packed. Heard the whistle go
for start of the game. Could hear people shouting and felt an
increase in pressure when Beardsley hit the cross-bar. He          Pg 39
said several coaches had arrived at the same time as theirs.       Pg 44


Witness quite clear that there was pushing outside into the
tunnel and onto the terraces. On the terrace it did seem he
was able to pass between people.

Travelled by car, departed 10.30, arrived 2.15. Troublefree journey,
Leppings Lane 2.30, masses of people, saw mounted officers inside,
edged towards side, entered via Gate C, went to toilet. He said
tunnel was jam-packed solid with people and he was moving slowly
with ’.the flow, no room to run (see Mr McMahon). Could see pitch
from tunnel, players getting ready to kick 70 ff. Game kicked-off
just as he exited, crossed diagonally Pen 4 towards Pen 5. Worse
crushing experience ever, been on Kop and Wembley. He entered
tunnel   because he thought the 1B 1 above it was linked with the 1B '
on his   stub. Said he couldn't get out of the tunnel if he had
                                                       fwvr
wanted   to. He agreed with Mr Catchpole that it was (.chance that
he had   retained his stub.

Travelled by coach, didn't leave until 11.30.       There was a bit of
pushing at the coach station and they had to wait and he got on the
last coach.   Came across Snake Pass and didn't arrive in Sheffield
until 14.40. He had noticed a few people drinking from cans.
When he arrived at 14.45 perimeter gates were open, PO letting
people through. POs on foot seen, four mounted officers seen.
Having got through perimeter gates, stepped to one side to avoid
crowd, thought people were being hurt. Saw Gate C open a little bit
to allow injured person in. Overheard people at Gate C "next time
gate opens they were going to push through". Assumed they had no
tickets but didn't know. Did not see or hear LANDROVER. Gate opened
again, 50/100 people went through, police horses stopped them. He
thought the group that made this remark consisted of about 10 people.
His view was that 50/100 people pushed i n . ^ M o u n t e d officer tried to
control crowd, Gate C re-opened, authorised, entered, able to make
his way down tunnel but was bumped, exit of tunnel was blocked,
players were on field, got pushed towards left. On first entry
terrace did not look too bad.
Got separated from his friend because of pushing from behind. Fans
were saying "push back", able to do so a little. Took a little rest,
felt people coming over his head, he was squashed, people were
complaining about this as they felt just as bad. Heard people at
the front appealing for relief but couldn't move back. Helped into
Pen 5 by PO. He was able to tell that the people at the front were
in trouble. He said that the people in the pen were pushing. Told
Mr King that the terraces were bad but not as bad as he had been in
before, that he had control over himself, but he did also see people
in distress who looked quite bad.


 Then saw that the perimeter gates were being shut by PO but they
then re-opened. He saw mounted officer shouting at the people near
the gate and they were shouting back.

39. S BERRY                                       SUPPORTER

Manchester United fan with Liverpool supporter friend.
Had a ticket for Spion Kop. Went to the "Fox" and decided to try
to get in the Leppings Lane end.   Arrived Leppings Lane 14.15.    He
says perimeter gates were shut, saw one PO, heard shouts from an
officer, crowd surged forward, gate opened. He in fact entered via
Gate C (Kop ticket). He describes a police cordon at approx 2.30
or thereabouts. Able to walk through, not stopped, but he says he
saw similar situation in 1988 when people were stopped and couldn't
get through if they had no ticket. Insists he actually saw this
with his own eyes despite the fact that in 1988 he was going to
Penistone Road end of ground.
At the perimeter gates only one officer. Heard a shout "only one
cop on the gate" and to rush him or push him. Shout came from in
front but pushing came from behind.   He could see people were pushing
from the back but only limited number got through.   Saw mounted
officer trying to calm the crowd.
As he entered the terrace play was in progress, he was able to ease
his way through, cratotled but not oppressive, could have put up with
it if need be. There was then a surge and he climbed out, he thought
gate was open when he got out. He thought in 1988 the flow of people
had almost stopped by 2.30 and agreed that at that time in 1989 it
was only just starting. He thought that people came later in 1989
because 1988 had gone so smoothly and it was numbers rather than
behaviour which caused the problems. He agreed that he himself had
gone to the match much earlier in 1988 and modified his arrival time
in 1989 to 14.45 to 14.50.

NAME      MATTHEW COLIN

DESIGNATION:     Supporter


STATUS;   Wolverhampton Wanderers team/Liverpool

ASSESSMENT:




          Mr. GilPld was a student and a supporter of Wolverhampton
          Wanderers. Attended the match on 15th April 1989 with
          a friend. Neither of them had tickets but they knew
          from experience that tickets touts would be around.
          They left home in Sheffield at 12.30, arriving near
          Middlewood Road at 1.15. They got to Leppings Lane at
          1.30. At that time he saw some fans taking some cans
          and bottles, not quite as many as he thought and they
          were all perfectly well behaved. There very few people
          at the turnstiles at that time. They were unable to
          purchase tickets and had tried the other end of the ground.
          They met Liverpool supporters as they walked along. These
          again were drinking, were carrying sets of four cans
          or what was left of four cans and 2 litre bottles in
          about a 50/50 proportion but again they were not concerned
          about their behaviour.
          They were unsuccessful there as well and they returned
          to the Leppings Lane area at about twenty past two. They
          were approaching it at the Catch Bar Lane end and again
          met supporters who he described as being somewhat more
          loud, carrying alcohol perhaps in slightly higher proportior
          than earlier but he didn't think they were as such. He
          thought that the age range was rather younger than earlier.
          When asked what he understood by "drunk", he replied,
          "When they are obviously out of control and can't walk
          properly" and he accepted there might be gradations in
          the use of that word.
          He was approached by perhaps three to five people asking
          him for tickets.
          Finally after some more walking about they finished up
          at Leppings Lane at about quarter to three. He saw a
          Police Officer with a megaphone and he recollects that
          the officer was trying to reassure people to keep calm.
          He did not see a Land Rover, nor did he hear any loud
          speaker announcements from it. He was positioned at
          that point on the roadway somewhere by the little bridge.
          He could see the perimeter gates leading to the turnstiles
          and whilst he wasn't sure whether they were all shut,
          he was confident the middle ones were closed but he thought
MATTHEW COLIN GOLD (contd.)

that the outer ones were open with stewards posted at the
open ones. He recollects he saw two stewards. He describes
the behaviour of the crowd and says "They were trying
to get through the other side (the gates) pushing". He
based this upon the way they were trying to get to push
through the gates that were open and to try and open
the gates which were shut. When asked how they were
trying to open the gates, he said "Either by physically
opening them or by asking or shouting at other people
to open them". He admitted that he could not hear the
words but he could guess what they were saying by their
gestures. He did not observe any movements in the gates,
i.e. swaying movements.    Having notices the concertina
gate opening, he and his friend decided to approach it
in the hopes of getting through. The perimeter gates
were by this time open and he went and stood by the fence
by the river     ---     He . . . . . . . . . . before he got
through the railing gate, he had noticed a police horse
there and that there had been words and indeed some blows
exchanged between the officer and the fans.

Whilst waiting near the concertina gate, he heard people
complaining about entries and indeed one lady say, "Some­
body's going to die outside". He didn't at first know
whether this was true or not but when I put this to him,
he said, "Yes. I looked at my friend and sort of agreed
with her, looking back at the mass of people".

Strangely enough, this witness was more concerned about
the people outside the perimeter gate and was not particu­
larly concerned about the people outside the turnstile
area.
                                                        /
                                                         /\
 In the event, the concertina gate was opened and he e n t e r e d s
At the point in time when he entered there was no rush
but there were still many people left outside who were
anxious to enter as well. He went down the tunnel at-he
thought about five to three. There were no problems
in the tunnel and he entered into pen 3. On first exiting
there was a wall of people and he had to push his way
to get through to the terrace. He pushed and was pushed
at the same time. He said, "I suppose we were pushing
but not really barging". They went straight down the
centre railing and then about two-thirds in starting
going towards the right. He said, play had definitely
not started, though he could see the players were warming
up.    It was at this point that the match started and with
the extra surge of people, we were moving further to
the right.
Although he was not fully in control of his movements,
he said, "I wasn't too worried at that time". They
reached a position which they hoped to' stop at more or
less opposite the exit gate and about six rows back.
Movement in the pattern had been sadly forward and not
always at the same rate.
MATTHEW COLIN GOLD (c-ontd.)

You will recollect that at this point the witness sounded
distressed because we were taking him through the identi­
fication of a father and a son who I believe was probably
Mr. Murray with his boy. The witness gave poignant
evidence of the father's attempt to do his best for his
boy, the latter being smaller tended to be pushed down.

The witness then described seeing people bent over a
barrier and how he attempted to push them back above
the barrier. Play was proceeding at this point. Having
given up that attempt and turned round, a massive surge
carried him past the lad towards the gate. He thinks
that the surge might have coincided with Beardsley hitting
the crossbar. He says that he saw the gate being half
opened to being fully pulled back. Eventually in quite
an orderly way, he inched his way towards the gate and
was able to get out under his own steam.

When asked the position of the father (Mr. Murray), he
said he was just in front of him.

When asked by Mr. Manning, the witness Agreed that he
thought people were turning up late but he was also
surprised that the match was still kicking off at three
o'clock.

When asked if it might have been better to have stood
still rather than pushing forward, he said, "The time
was getting much closer to kick-off time and although
it might be obvious to stand still and be more orderly,
you don't see things like that in that situation".
In reply to Mr. King, Mr. Gold confirmed that it seemed
obvious to him that all the people outside Leppings Lane
would not be able to get in in time for the kick-off
and that he was, in fact, surprised that it had not been
postponed. Mr. King elicited that there was a flow forwarc
of the crowd and this witness found it easier to go with
them and particularly as they were going in the direction
in which they wanted to go anyway. This was, of course,
from the terraces.

He confirmed that people were distressed both on the
barrier and indeed father and^son before the final surge
occurred which carried him towards the gate.

Mrs. McBrien asked whether anybody attempted to take
his ticket. He agreed with her that he thought that
somebody would say something but there wasn't much they
could do once you were there.

Mr. Russell explored what the witness had means by people
obviously pushing and he replied, "It .is just the fact
that they were trying to get towards the turnstiles or
the concertina gates and obviously somebody pushing with
arms but walking forcefully could be seen as pushing,
I suppose".
MATTHEW COLIN GOLD (contd.)

He also agreed with Mr. Russell that he was able to "ease
himself between people and that the decision to turn
right earlier described was a conscious one. He also
agreed with Mr. Russell that the barrier close by to
which he stood was the one that eventually broke and
was the one over which the people were bent forward.
He had seen it buckle but had not seen it break.

(Note: He has already told us about the progress of
the game at this stage which may help with fixing the
timing for this event.)
There was some confusion as to precisely what time he
entered the ground. I don't think it really matters
very much because he is quite clear that the match had
commenced as they were making their way down the terrace.

DESIGNATION;      Supporter.

 STATUS:

ASSESSMENT.      A good and interesting witness.   He gave a
                 clear account.




    Mr. Knowles left early from Birkenhead at 10.15.     There
    were traffic delays on the road around         . He arrived
    in Sheffield at 1.35. He had two boys with him. His aim
    was to get into the ground as was his normal practice a
    good half an hour to forty minutes before the game, in order
    to enable the children to get a good position.     On this
    occasion because they had had a long journey, they stopped off
    at a pub in the town centre, where they had something to eat
    and drink.   Supporters were there from both sides as well as
    local people and the atmosphere was grand.     They caught a
    taxi to the stadium, leaving at about 10 past 2. They were
    dropped off at approximately ten minutes walk from the stadium
    which they approached from over a little bridge, turning right
    into the ground.   They arrived at about 2.30.    They were met
    by a ’bunch crowd’ attempting to make their way into the
    ground.  He also noticed that there were people milling around
    on the little bridge. He noticed that there were no orderly
    queues, there was just a crowd. He did see some perimeter
    gates and that there were two police horses in front of them.
    The gates were shut. He together with the boys made their
   way through the crowd and came up to the horse.      There was
   a bit of pushing and he also felt in some danger from the
   horse itself.    He was noticed by the policeman standing within
   the gate, and because of the two      boys, he was allowed to go
   through, the gate being opened slightly.     He describes the
   attitude of the crowd at that time as being frustrated, not
   knowing exactly what was happening.     There was no indication
   of why the gates were shut.    He does however say that there
   was quite a crowd inside and again there were no orderly
   queuing and so he thought that people were a bit anxious
   about what was actually happening.    He heard various remarks
   including comments like "I have got a ticket. Why can ’t I
   be allowed to go through". When asked whether this was being
   said forcefully or not he said "no, they were shouting but not
   really aggressively".    Having now got beyond the perimeter
   gates but outside the turnstiles in the area of turnstiles
   H and G, he says it was literally a free for all trying to

 get through the turnstiles.   There was no sort of queuing or
 anything.   There was a police officer in there at the edge of
 the crowd.   People were trying to get past him to get out saying
 they were in the wrong place with wrong tickets, and that they
 we re’nt being allowed in. This was impossible, because the
 gates were closed. He felt it was pointless to try and join
 a queue so he stood to one side and watched.    There were people
 climbing the walls, there were people on the wall trying to
 pull people up and there was quite a crush going on, in fact it
 was worse than it had been outside the perimeter gates.     He
 describes it as being a complete blockage with no real movement
 but that the area outside the turnstiles was barred on the
 right by a barrier and that beyond that, things were moving
 quite freely.
 By about quarter to three he was getting a little
 anxious.   He was comparing the situation with other football
 matches where policemen are normally stationed by the turnstiles
 asking for tickets and forming queues.   The situation he
 observed was just a crowd of people pushing each other and
 trying to gain entrance.   He said "obviously probably they paid
 money, they wanted to get in and see the game.    They were
 worried about not seeing the kick-off".   He spoke with the
 policemen and he was told that the men had been pulled out as
 they were worried about getting hurt because they were standing
 by the wall and were being pressed up against the wall. He was
 told that the policeman had actually being taken out. When
 pressed, he confirmed that he recollected that the actual words
 which were also said to him were "let them fight amongst
 themselves, if that’s what they want to do".    The impression he
  formed was that control in that particular area had been lost,
 had been given up and the matter just been left to the fans to
 try and get in any way they could, which left them open to
 pushing and shoving each other in an attempt to get through.
 Interestingly, he suggested that the concertina gate might be
 opened to allow people through and thus relieve the blockage at
 the turnstiles. When asked whether he noticed that the crowd at
 this stage was becoming agressive he replied "I think they were
 very frustrated in trying to gain access to the ground.     The
 ones at the back were pushing and saying come out let’s get in
 and the ones at the front knowing that there was nowhere for
 them to go were shouting back" please stop pushing, people are
 actually getting crushed in the front part.    Please ease back"
 but in a situation like that you ca n’t really hear or understand
 you are just pushing forward trying to gain access.     I do n’t
 think they could hear anything being shouted from the front".
 He was asked whether he heard any loudspeaker annouoncements.
 He said that although he saw an officer with a microphone, he
 did not hear anything himself.   Eventually he overheard a
 message to the effect that the gate should be opened and he
 managed to enter it. He distinctly heard shouts going up from
 the back, a message being passed back that the gate was open and
 he said that there was no sort of funnelling or telling people
 in which direction to go. He entered the tunnel with others and

exited on to the left side, Pen 4. The back of this terrace was
quite full but he did not think this was anything unusual and he
therefore, because of the boys, decided to move to the front.
Their first aim was to go down behind the goal but noticing that
it was packed, he told the boys to move left away from the
centre.   They managed to get right down to the bottom and he
then said "down at the bottom there was a yard or so of flat
area right next to the front and that was fairly free.     There
was a gap you could walk along so we walked along as far as we
could go. We then came up against the fence running from front
to back".   He didn’t particularly like it there and he stepped
back a little way into the terrace and he positioned the boys a
couple of steps forward and actually on the fence itself.     He
remembered that on entering the terrace, the players were on the
pitch, the goalkeeper was in the goal in front of them.     He said
that having got their viewing position and had been satisfied
with it the game kicked off "possibly in a minute or so the game
did actually kick off". He noticed that the enclosure next to
him on the left was empty (this is in fact a void area and was
intended to be so) but he also noticed that the outer pens were
relatively spacious.   The game having kicked off was a shot at
the Liverpool goal.   There was a forward movement from the crowd
and he was moved against the boys. He found that he could not
move back.   He noticed the people further along were beginning
to climb the fence to try and get out. He said "I don’t know
why, I will never know why, I just said to the two boys "climb
over the fence and get on to the pitch.   I just d on ’t feel
comfortable, I think there is something wrong".   You may feel
that this inclines at that point he had not yet appreciated the
seriousness of the situation but instinctively felt that the
boys should be put into a safe environment.   He said that at
that point he was not being crushed in the sense that he was
hurting in any way but he was up against the fence, unable to
move and that did worry him. He thought if I am going to get
pushed any more from the back, there is nowhere for me to go.
At that point, it was bearable but any more pressure would have
been a different matter.   People were beginning to shout "please
stop pushing" and in fact he heard shouts from the back saying
"move forward".   He was unable to say whether the cheering came
from his own pen. He described his son being put back into pen £
by a policewoman but confirmed that that pen was in fact empty
and that his son was in no danger in that enclosure.     Somewhat
later, he noticed a man who appeared to be in a very poor state.
He describes how a police officer who was standing at the gate
helping people by pulling them out coming into the pen and
attempting to give him the kiss of life.   He then left the
enclosure, assisted with trying to rip up the fencing and then
quite properly went and looked for the children.    He felt that
there was no way of going backward and that the only way out of
the enclosure was through the fence or over the fence.     You will
probably remember this           of Mr. Hale because he used
their illustration

                        of p ^ ^ a n d was trying to demonstrate with that the fact that if
                        pressure is applied to columns which are not contained, they
                        will merge. A proposition which the witness accepted. When
                        asked by Mr. Payne what was the nearest ordinary means of escape
                        he replied "back through the tunnel". Mr. Manning explored the
                         reasons for the trapping at the perimeter gates and the crushing
                        within the turnstile area.      He agreed that there obviously was a
                        danger of police officers being crushed, but he would have
                         thought so would have other people standing next to them. He
                         also could understand the feelings of apprehension which
                         somebody like Mr. Gillan might have felt.     Finally he agreed
                        with Mr. Manning that at the moment just before the kick-off the
                         terrace did not appear to him abnormal.     He agreed with Mr. King
                         that he was not aware that the Leppings Lane terracing was
                         divided into pens and indeed he described them as cages.      He
                         also said that terrace 6 and 7 were virtually empty.     That he
                        was surprised at this bearing in mind the closeness of the
                        kick-off and the crowds which were still outside.      He agreed
                         that there was no queues at the turnstiles, that it was like a
                         bottleneck he said.     There was nowhere for anybody to go and
                         that although, when he approached the perimeter gates were shut,
                         the fact that there were masses of people within the turnstile
                         area indicated to him that at some point they must have been
                         open.    He confirmed that he had seen stewards in the concourse
                         area but that they had stood aside when the gate was open. He
                         also said that he wondered how it was possible to get on to the
                         outer terraces. We then had some discussion with regard to the
                         difference between swaying and surging.     The witness himself in
                        his statement had used the word ’surge’ to describe the events,
                        having at least described two of these. He confirmed that after
                         the second surge he had heard screams and shouts from the crowd
                         against the fence indicating the pain and obvious discomfort.
                        He was specifically asked whether he got the impression that
                        people were trying to get out, that there was panic around him.
                        His response was not in the sense people were frightened, but I
                        think they were all expecting the crush to ease off.      Question
                         "but it didn’t" Answer"it didn’t". Question, "and you heard
                        shouts clearly from people wanting to get out" Answer "Yes". He
                        said that he felt that the police on the pitch side at that
                        stage had not realised what was going on. Mr. Knowles just
                        before the end of his evidence was asked to re-summarise the
                        position with timings.      He said "we came out of the tunnel.
                        There was a fair pack of people at the top of the terrace      so I
                        suggested we make out way to the front of theterrace and       to the
                        left because there was a fence down the middle.      You could only
                • _L    go left so I pushed the lads in front of me. We forced out way
                        down.    It was tightly packed, but you could gain access.     We got
    OUA. &<(V (         down to the front and behind the goal and began to walk along
\,—     *■rs.v^iCrvL^T' the front towards the left of the ground. There was a slight
                        gap at the bottom that you could walk straight along.      You
                        w eren’t pushing past people moving up and down the terrace.      It
                        was a pretty straight channel through. We got as far as we
                        could at the front.

   We came up on a fence running from the front to the back of the
 ground and I took a step on to the terrace and a
 step up on a large spur of the fence standing holding the fence.
 As the match kicked off I was pushed towards the fence behind
 the boys then it eased off slightly and I took a step back
 towards the terrace.   I think somebody had a shot at the goal.
 The ball went over, the crowd moved forward again and I couldn’t
 move. When I went to move back, I couldn’t move as far as I had
 moved forward.   It was at this time that further along the terra
 ce towards the goal, people were looking to get out over the
 fence and at that time I just told the boys to get over. As
 they were climbing the fence and I helped them over, as they
 moved out, I was then pushed against the fence and couldn’t
 move". In a nutshell then this witness says that although the
 terrace was very full just before kick-off, at kick-off he was
 in a position where he was satisfied with his position and the
  location of the boys.  Shortly thereafter when a kick towards
 his goal had taken place, he for reasons which he cannot
 explain, got the boys to climb out and it was after that that
 he became immobilised by the crowd though not totally and
  initially in any discomfort.  He felt that at that stage,
 although people were shouting for help, the police on the
 other side did not realise what was going on. We know from
 the video evidence and indeed from his account that shortly
 thereafter assistance was being rendered though it’s only
 fair to say that the fencing itself was not actually torn
 away until about 18 minutes past 3 (video evidence).
 When he was cross-examined by Mr. Catchpole, he was shown two
 photographs C305 which showed the situation at 14.30 and which
 he agreed showed no anxiety amongst the people standing about.
 This was contrasted with C301 which he felt was in fact a bit
 busier than he recollected it and he agreed that for whatever
 reason something had turned an apparently quiet orderly crowd
 at 2.30 into the sort of scenes which he had witnessed
 relatively shortly thereafter. Mrs. McBrien asked some
 interesting questions of this witness and she inquired whether
 he would have been upset if the match had been postponed and he
 said "no provided the information had been passed over".    You
 have to remember that this witness had already said that he
 had not heard any loudspeaker announcements.   Bearing in mind
 that last minute announcements were undoubtedly made, you have
 to consider whether or not an announcement of a postponement
 would in fact have been heard and what effect if any that
 would have had on the crowd.   He was also asked by Mrs. McBrien
 whether he had noticed the notices for the toilets on the
 right and left hand side of the tunnel and he responded "no".
 The point of her question was whether he felt that access routes
 to and from these toilets should at all times be kept clear
 which he agreed with but the point I want to draw to your
 attention is that this witness had also said that he had not
 seen any other signs directing him to the outer pens.   I d o n ’t
 think it is disputed that the signing in the concourse area
 as far as the outer pens was either poor or non-existent, but
 to the tower which he was entering in to. This witness also
 agreed with Mrs. McBrien that he had seen the stewards being
 used to keep exit       clear.  He was also cross-examined by

Mr. Russell re the frustration of the crowd. He responded.
The question which you have to consider is whether even if there
had been such a sign it would have been noticed, bearing in
mind that he did not see quite large signs for toilets adjacent
wanted to get in to see the game, talking to each other, asking
w h a t ’s going on and various other questions". He finished up
by saying "you were getting mis-information from different
sources all around the ground". Mr. Russell illicited from
him that just before the kick-off he had not found the terrace
abnormal and that he was satisfied with the position of the
lads up against the fence. His state of mind changed around
the time when there was a shot at the goal and the surge
occurred. Misapprehension was for the boys, he was not in
discomfort himself at that time.

     NAME:     KEVIN '66WEtL

     DE SIG N A T IO N :       Supporter


     STATUS:        Friend of Barry Bennett

     ASSESSMENT:




               Mr. Kevin ©ewe^l ,fvias a Liverpool supporter. He described
               leaving Liverpool at about quarter to twelve, running into some
               traffic problems which caused a delay for a good half hour.
               Having parked, they had to walk for about twenty-five minutes
               and they approached the ground at about half past two. Whilst
               walking to the ground they saw lots of supporters. They
n/   kJL           n°tice some drinking from cans but none of them appeared
               to him to be visibly drunk. He describes the crowd which
               met his eye an appreciable crowd, not actually physically
               pushing but milling around outside. He estimated the numbers
               as more than five hundred. He confirmed that when he arrived
               the outer perimeter gates were shut but that some time he
               saw the middle gates outside turnstiles A - G and that a
               small number of people went in. He was unable to say whether
               the crowd was more tightly packed as he approached the perimeter
               gates and he backed off from them as he said he did not like
               crowds. He felt he was only yards from the gate and he seemed
               to recall seeing a police horse in front of them.
               He then says the gates having first opened and then being
               closed again, there were three opened and everyone went in.
               He said, "I was one of them that went in and I started to
               queue up in front of the turnstiles. It was quite packed
               there. I was told the policeman shouted that the side gate
               was open. I was then helped under like a barrier". Help
               was provided by a policeman who guided him round the corner
               to a big concertina type gate where he went in. He timed
               his entry to the middle perimeter gate at about seven or
               eight minutes to three. (This would fit in with the opening
               of the concertina gate at 1452 and stayed open for about
               five m i n u t e s . )          .
               He was asked whether he heard people outside the perimeter
               gates shouting for the gate to be opened. His reply was,
               "It is difficult for me to recall. It is possible, just
               the same as every other home game. They possibly were shouting
               to open it, asking them".
                                                               i
KEVIN COWELL (contd.)

Having entered the concertina gate, he recalls going down
the tunnel. He described it as packed. There were quite
a few people going through and there were some people coming
back out as well. He confirmed that none of these people
said anything and when pressed thought that there were just
a couple coming out along the side of the tunnel. Although
his recollection of the tunnel had quite a few people in
it, you were able to walk. He entered pen 3. He felt that
as he was coming through the tunnel the match had not yet
started. He said, "They were just ready to kick off upward".
He was asked, "In the centre?" Answer: "As I actually got
in they kicked off as I was positioning myself". He confirme<
that the first few steps in the terrace was packed and that
he wanted to try and get somewhere as safe as possible which
from his point of view was just under the barrier. He
confirmed that at that point he did not feel particularly
apprehensive but that the stand was packed or full. He did
not consider turning round and going out. He also confirmed
that he had to force his way through but he was able to make
relative progress through the pen, though there was some
pressure from behind.
He then went on to explain that the pressure kept on coming.
People kept on coming in. He heard shouts and screams.
When asked, "Was this half way on the terrace?", he replied,
"This is in front of me. There were people trying to climb
out and the police were stopping them initially. There was
somebody on the fence shouting 'move back, move back'". He
was asked whether he could hear this and he replied that
he could. Other people-were shouting back, "We can't move
back, there is no-where to go" and then there were people
still coming in at this time.
He recalls Beardsley hitting the cross bar which is timed
at 1505, (check this time) but cannot recollect what was
going on on the terrace as he was getting pretty desperate
and it was getting quite bad then. By this time fans were
climbing out at the front, behind and over the sides.
When asked whether he noticed whether people were trying
to get into other pens from the back of terrace, he replied,
"No, it was about three quarters of the way forward, just
a bit back they were climbing over the fence into the far pen".
He thought that at this time people were being helped over
the fence but timing was difficult.

It is clear that initially people were hindered from getting
over the fence. It was difficult to define the length of
time that that meant, he thought a couple of minutes at least.
He was cross-examined by Mr. Hale. He was asked, "When you
were outside you felt apprehensive then?" "Yes, that's right".
'He did not like crowds?" His response was, "I don't like
crowds, no". Mr. Hale then asked him, "You also took the
decision at that time (referring to him on the terrace) but
it was not all that bad. It was not bad enough for you to
turn round and try and fight your way up the tunnel?"
 KEVIN COWELL (contd.)


He replied, "I don't believe I could have got back".
Mr. Hale put it to him, "What I think you said was, 'I did
not try' and his reply was, "No". Question: Because you
really think it was that bad at the time? "No, on first
impression, no". He also agreed when Mr. Manning put it
to him, that the terraces looked as they normally do.
His response was, "That is correct".
He described the situation at Anfield being much more
organised but agreed, when Mr. Manning put it to him, "But
you are used to hearing people shouting to open the gate?"
His response was, "Yes".

Mr. King asked whether he would expect a football crowd to
be totally stone cold sober and the response to that was,
"No". He also confirmed that he was not worried about the
amount of alcohol being carried by people. He thought it
had been about twenty five minutes from the time he arrived
at the ground to the time he had got through the concertina
gate but it was very difficult. When asked how much space
there was on the terrace between him and the next person,
he said there was very, very little space and that in his
view it would not take many more people. He also said that
he not know that the terracing had been divided into pens
by the aid of fencing and that the side pens appeared to
be relatively empty.

He was asked by Mr. Catchpole as to whether having entered
through the concertina gate the line of travel was in one
direction towards the tunnel, to which his response was "Yes".
When asked as to whether he had followed the crowd, he did
say that there were no signs to go left or right but that
he had, in fact, followed the crowd through.
He was re-examined by Mr. King regarding Anfield and he
described the situation there as more organisation and more
space. He was asked to confinpM5y~M)r. Russell that the
perimeter gates were shut at^?f464 arid that there was a mounted
officer outside the gates." Qda-was also asked to confirm
that two minutes later and another photograph the little
gate is open and it was put to him that that was the time
which he entered the perimeter gate into the turnstile area.
He confirmed that when he entered the terracing at about
kick-off time, it looked as it normally does at Anfield on
a full kop and that it was normal for full terracing, as
he had experienced it at Liverpool, at the time when he
arrived into the ground.

You will remember that this is the case when Mr. Payne examinee
the witness arising out of his comments regarding policing
and organisation at Anfield. The operational order was put
to him and he suggested that the crowd really built up outside
the blue perimeter gates. He accepted that between half
past two and three o'clock there many people approaching
from both directions of Leppings Lane.
KEVIN COWELL (contd.)

It was put to him that the perimeter gates were being used
to try and control the number of people getting to the
turnstiles and he rather reluctantly agreed. It was also
put to him that if the gates had not been used for that
purpose, the people who had were being held by them would
have been stopped at the turnstiles and again, somewhat
reluctantly, he agreed to this.

In a nutshell, Mr. Cowell having arrived about two thirty
got to the perimeter gates and decided to stand to one side
as he did not like what he was seeing and did not like crowds.
At a point in time the outer perimeter gates were opened,
he was able to enter and shortly thereafter he was guided
towards the concertina gates. He followed the crowd down
the tunnel (having said that he had not seen any directive
signs) then he got onto the terrace which more or less
coincided with the kick-off. He on the whole felt that whils'
it was full it was not so full as to necessitate a retreat.
In fact, he said it was similar to Anfield on a full kop.
One has to bear in mind that he has already indicated that
he doesn't like crowds and although in response to one of
the lawyers, he said that he didn't think he would have been
able to go back out had he wished, he did, in fact, say
that people were exiting as he was coming down and at that
point he presumably had not made his way any distance down
the terrace and was able to make some voluntary progress
and things then began to get more difficult. It appears
that he was able to understand the signals from the fencing
and he could also hear people stating that they were not
able to move. It appears to be very difficult to be precise
about timing but certainly fans were climbing out by the
time Beardsley hit the crossbar. It is quite clear that
initially people were prevented from going over the front
fence. He tried to put a time on it but admitted that it
was difficult and I would consider that one has to treat
times a couple of minutes as a very subjective observation.

This witness is interesting because he displayed apprehension
outside the perimeter gates because of the crowds and yet
appeared to accept the situation on the terracing at least
initi a l l y .

NAME:           COLIN LESLIE GILLAM      (W')

D E SIG N A T IO N :    Security Guard


                Employed as sub contractor to club

ASSESSM ENT :          a rather nervous witness. His evidence reads better than
                       it sounded. He appeared to me to be truthful but confused
                       with regard to the timings and in particular I think his
                       evidence does not correlate well with others with regard
                       to the opening and shutting of the perimeter gates.



                Mr. Gil lam was the Security Guard employed to control
                 traffic through the outer perimeter gates. He describes
                his positioning which was by the gates which led to turn­
                stiles A - G. His task was to control the entry of vehicle
                and consequently he positioned himself at the centre gates.
                Initially, there were not very many fans, though he did
                notice a small group who appeared not to have tickets
                and who were moved on by the police. He said, "The youngst( rs
                were going into the ground. They were hanging about
                where I was mainly just so that being in the way of other
                supporters coming in and so the Mounted Police asked
                them if they had got tickets. They seemed to shake their
                heads as if to say .no".
                Things became more hectic from about 2 o'clock onward.
                He said he had been surprised that not more people had
                come earlier than that. This was based on not very much
                experience of large matches. He then described " a tremendc us
                influx of people coming on. So many people were coming
                that the turnstiles became jammed with the weight of
                the people and one of the Mounted Police Officer guided
                his horse right into the influx of the queue at the turn­
                stiles. He drove his horse between the people to relieve
                the pressure on to the turnstiles so that the horse was
                dividing the influx of people into the turnstiles','.

                He then describes several other matters which I don't
                think I need to repeat but he was obviously very impressed
                by a young Police Officer who at about half past two
                turned up at the gate, namely the gates next to the River
                Don.   Mr. Gillam said, in answer to a question, he closed
                the gates behind him. Mr. Gillam was asked whether the
                gates remained shut and he said that they were not until
                after 3 o'clock. He explained that he went to assist
                the young officer and he said} "We tried to keep the gates
                closed to stop any more people coming in because there
                were too many people. There were hoards and hoards of
                people and those gates had to be closed, otherwise it
                would have been just one big crush".
COLIN LESLIE GILLAM {contd.)

He was then asked what happened and he said, "We held
the gates" and he was asked for how long and he said,
"Until after three o'clock". He was quite clear about
his view in relation to this young officer, for when
I asked him whether he was impressed with the officer
who had come to stand in front of those gates, he said,
"Yes, very brave indeed because I was scared and I was
on this side of the gates". He also confirmed that a
steward who was with him and who had been with him for
about three hours wore a yellow bib.
When he was cross-examined by Mr. King, he agreed that
at 2 o'clock if he had been asked he would have said
something like, "It looks as if there's crowds of people
still to come". He also agreed that in addition to the
gates alongside the River Don two police officers had
closed the middle gates but until that was done at twenty
past two people had been gaining access to the turnstile
area. He also replied in response to the following
question, "And it was only after the crowd had really
become so dense the queues were impossible that efforts
were made to close the gates, that's the position?""
And his response was, "That's right, yes".

Finally, he described what he called a human barrier
of officers which he said formed outside the outer perimet
gates. He confirmed that the last time he saw this was
at about two o'clock and that it had effectively blocked
vehicular traffic but not pedestrians coming. He was
shown the photograph C282 and he confirmed that the cordon
he was describing was of that nature.

You may feel that Mr. Gillam was an honest witness but
he relied for some of the other evidence which you have
seen and heard, particularly on video. The timings
particularly with regard to when the centre gates and
gates alongside the Don were opened may be somewhat out.
In fact, you may feel that he had some difficulty with
remembering precise times, though that is not entirely
surprising and does not necessarily mean that the rest
of his evidence is unreliable but it is a factor which
you must take into account when you assess it.

D E SIG N A T IO N :   Supporter


status:          Relative (sister)


ASSESSMENT :         Very good witness, clear but some of her evidence
                 is difficult to reconcile.




                 Stephanie w^s the sister of Richard Jones and a friend
                 of Katie Cox, both of whom lost their lives unfortunately.
                 They all had tickets.

                 She confirmed that they had gone to a pub and that Richard
                 had had a pint of beer. She described the supporters
                 whom she saw walking along as happy. She saw none carrying
                 any cans.
                 When they approached the ground, about ten to three;
                 she wasn't entirely sure, she recollected a large crowd
                 with some two or three mounted officers. She had no
                 recollection of goi-,ng through the outer perimeter gates.
                 She described some pushing but it was, in her words,
                 just normal people just moving about. She described
                 a police officer who was near gate C whom she says
                 was trying to split the crowd without success. Her view
                 was that there was just too many people there and that
                 he had no chance on his own.

                 When asked if she thought if he would have been more
                 successful if people had obeyed him instantly, she replied
                 "No, I think if he had had more manpower it would have
                 helped rather than if everyone had obeyed". She then
                 described how she got pressed up against the gate, her
                 arm being trapped and feeling uncomfortable. In due
                 course the gate was opened wide. Her recollection is
                 that the fans helped to open it. She said they had been
                 screaming at him to open it because they could see that
                 something was going to happen outside if he didn't.
                 She described the influx like taking a cork out of a
                 bottle.

                At the end of a tunnel it was reasonably clear. When
                she came down the tunnel she said the exit and the terrace
                was clear of people. She did not think that the match
                had started at that point. Her descrition of the terraces
                was that initially the terraces, "Just a normal amount
                really, I wasn't really worried". In fact she went on
                to say that worries had dissolved once she had managed
                to get into the ground from outside. However, before
                they were able to take up a viewing position, an awful
STEPHANIE LINDA JONES (contd.)

lot of people came behind and started moving them forward
in a gradual push. This then changed and "started to
get more and more surges, sort of things". She then
went on to describe how Kate had lost her shoe but somebody
picked it up for her and then a big surge came which
split her from her brother and Kate. She finished up
right in the front facing the wrong way and was unable
to remember anything about the match.
She confirmed that she was able at that position to scream
with a loud voice. Her recollection of exiting in that
somebody said to her, "Here you are love" and "I sort
of stepped out on to the pitch or somebody pulled me".
Having got out, she noticed that the match was still
in play and that the TV camera was pointing at her. Her
recollection was that shot of her was taken immediately
after she got out. (You will know from the video that
it is timed at          )
She then describes that several people were being taken
to the end pens and she thought that they-were exiting
out of gate 3. She then looked at a photograph of her
outside the ground timed at 1454.
The problem that we had was that Stephanie was categorical
that she was squashed up against the gate and that it
was the concertina gate. If her recollection is right,
then the only entry she could have got to would have
been at 1459 as it is-clear that she is not under any
pressure at 1454 which is two minutes after the main
opening of the concertina gate. That, of course, means
that from the time she entered the stadium to the time
that she was filmed outside on the pitch side of the
terrace, the total time was only about 4 minutes and,
in fact, she must have entered onto the terrace after
the game had started, more or less at the kick-off at
which point she still described the terrace as normal.
However, even if she came through at an earlier point
and if we assume that her recollection of being squashed
against the gate is wrong, her total time from the concertina
gate to the pitch cannot be more than about 8 minutes
(check this t i m e ) .
During cross-examination, she confirmed that the crowd
was dense and the horseman she described was enveloped    /
by the crowd that although she wasn't pushing herself, [
people in front of her might have thought she was because
she was herself subject to pressure and that one horseman
on his own would not be able to do anything.

We spent a lot of time trying to unravel her timings,
particularly as at that point in time Catchpole had noted
that the family had identified that she was on the terrace
at 1456. However, as you know, her evidence . . . . . . . . . . .
STEPHANIE LINDA JONES (contd.)


Finally, we spent a further bit of time discussing the
mechanics of crowd behaviour. Stephanie on the whole
took the view that it was unrealistic for a crowd who
was going to a football match to not press forward when
they were interested to get in.

When asked by Mrs. McBrien whether it would have made
any difference if an announcement had been made that
the match be postponed, her first reply was, "I don't
think so, I mean it wouldn't have mattered really. It
would have given everyone a lot more time to get in".
Mrs. McBrien pressed her, "You still think they would
have pushed forward even if they had half an hour for
instance to wait?" Answer: "Well, no".
See also page 46 at A, B.

She did, however, confirm that she herself heard no
announcements of any sort.

ASSESSMENT:




               This young man left in an official coach from Liverpool at
               ten with two friends and arrived Sheffield at twenty
               past one and went to the Fox Public House. They got
               there about one thirty. He said they couldn't get in
               to buy a drink and they went to a local off-licence to
               have a couple of cans. He thought there were about a
               hundred people outside. He said they bought six cans
               between three of them. They didn't leave the pub until
               two thirty-five or thereabouts, at which point this witness
               says he had nearly drunk one can. The other one he was
               still drinking. In other words, he had set off from
               Liverpool at ten, he had been in the public house for
               over an hour and he had nearly drunk one can and a bit.

               They went to the ground at between twelve minutes and
               five two which he later agreed was two fifty-five. Despite
               the lateness of the hour, he thought he would be able
               to get in. He often left it until about that time at
               Anfield. There was a substantial crowd still going towards
               the ground and it was getting bigger as they got nearer.
               He did not see a Police Land Ro ve r , ; nor did he hear
               any announcements or a loud speaker. He recalls joining
               the crowd which did not appear to be moving and he also
               remembers a mounted officer but only one. He apparently
               was stopped by officers on his way to the ground near
               a social club because he was still carrying a can. When
               challenged about the quantity, he said they hadn't bothered
               initially. It was only later they learned about the
               off-licence and it was turned two before they managed
               to start drinking.

               Although he said he was quite close to the mounted officer
               on the outside of the perimeter fence, he had his
               on, he didn't really pay much attention to him. He didn't
               think the horse was that close to him as to impede his
               progress, though he did think that the movement of the
               police horse affected the crowd movement.
               I asked tiim, "It was packed in front of you, wasn't it?"
               He said, "Yes".
               I said, "It was moving as far as you could see?"
               He said, "No".

    ALAN PAUL JONES (contd.)

    "Not much point in pushing into it, was there?"
    He said, "No".

    For reasons which he was not able to give, he appeared
    to have no recollection of how he traversed the space
    from outside the ground to within the concourse area.

    You will remember that he had fairly good recollection
    of nearly everything else but this part of the events
    in the afternoon seemed, as far as his evidence is concerne
    a total blank. I find this somewhat difficult to understan
    because from the little which he remembers he did not
    appear to be under any particular stress or pressure
    at that location.

    He described entering the tunnel and being able to see
    the players on the pitch and that it was obstructed.
    Although therfe was some ambiguity, it seemed that this
    obstruction was at the bottom of the slope.

    He then described how he stopped behind the stationary
    crowd with more and more people coming itito the tunnel
    and it getting tighter within it.

     I asked him, "You joined them and you were quite prepared
     to be stationary as well?"
     Answer: "Yes".
     "People came behind you and pressure built up from behind.
     Is that right?"
     "Yes".
     "So there was pushing from behind, not to put too fine
     a point on it?"
    Answer: "Well, yes".
     "You lost control of your movements?"                           '
     "Yes".
     "And you were carried with a mass of people forward onto
    the terraces?"
     "Yes".
    He entered the                  . He could hear yelling
    and shouting but was unable to recollect what was said.
    He was unable to pinpoint what was happening on the field
    when he entered the terrace at the back but he did say
    it was getting tight and t h a ^ i i r s a s i f e ^ i n n i n g to hurt.
n   Io.'»»t-he r- words-,— hp wac ^
    eT E ^ o f t hg^tuTiTrerK He desBcJtrerTTovTpeople fell over
    and how he himself was stood up. He marked the plan
    C298. He then described how the push which he said was
    continuous propelled him against the various barriers
    and down the terracing. Things seemed to be eased off
    a little bit by then and he managed to climb out. This
    witness did see police officers helping people out.
ALAN PAUL JONES (contd.)

He agreed with Mr. Payne that on the way to Sheffield
he was stopped by the police who were looking into people'
bags.

On cross-examination by Mr. King, Mr. Jones agreed that
if people had not been allowed into the tunnel, then they
cannot have been pushed any further forward.

status     :   g.jr -|    f r iend of Mr. Low, ticket!ess fan   (Spion Kop)

ASSESSMENT:




               Alison's evidence was similar to Mr. Low's. She thought
               they got into the enclosure quite early, perhaps before
               two and was not crowded. She thought that by half past
               two it was really full and she thought at that time
               it was as full as she would normally expect the terrace
               to be. From 2.30 onwards they started being moved forward
               by the crowd. She confirmed that in the beginning there
               was some space ahead of her. Movement at that time
               between 2.30 and quarter to three was voluntary and
               they had control of their movements. They
               on their barriers and at that point she said she wasn't
               worried.

               She was asked what time Dave and Julie separated from
               them and she thought about quarter to or ten to three.
               I asked her "Why did that happen, can you remember?"
                She answered, "Julie had never been to a big match
               before and she started to worry. It was pretty normal
               at that time. They were able to move away on their
               own volition and they had to do a little pushing".

               Alison confirmed that because she had been at big matches
               before, she wasn't worried at that stage, i.e. between
               quarter to and ten to three. She, too, remembered the
               pre-match warm-up but could recollect players coming
               on to the field or the               . She confirmed
               that pressure was building up from behind and whereas
               earlier they were able to move forward on their own
               volition, this became different and they could not have
               stopped at this point and she became frightened.

               I then said to her, "Now think hard, can you think that
               at that point the game had started or was in play? I
               know you told me you can't remember but I want to be
               quite sure". "I can't remember but I would think it
               would have started."

               I said, "what makes you think that?" Because she could
               hear the crowd shouting around the other end of the
               ground. People around her were shouting but they were
               shouting to get out.
ALISON JANE BENNETT (contd.)

She was asked whether she could see people climbing
out and at what interval. She thought about 3 or 5
minutes after she had nearly been shoved to the front.
Her impression from the noise was that the game was
in progress and that this coincided with the point when
people were climbing out.

She went on to say that she thought people were climbing
out before the game. I asked "By how much?". She said,
"Not very much, a few minutes". (Because this witness
didn't see the match, it is very difficult to be sure
about her timing and recollect as to when certain events
occurred. I am sure she was doing her best but you
will see that she was having some difficulty. She was
shouting because she was in discomfort and people helped
her out over the side fence.)

She described how people were trying to get girls and
children out and that although there were some at
the front they were trying to pass littlfe children
to the front.

Shen asked how this was achieved if the arms were
really tight so that they couldn't move, she said,
"It was quite a way back, they were sending them from a
long way back, down the sides".

She was shown a plan C297 and she indicated that this
movement was coming from about the third row of barriers
across. She says she saw several police officers in
front but did not appear to be doing a lot to start off
with. She did not hear them shout, "Go back", despite
the fact that she was only two or three people away from
the fencing. Although she was tightly squashed at the
time she was still able to shout. In effect, was able
to do so throughout.

The first time she noticed officers assisting was after
the match had finished when she was on the pitch.

On cross-examination, she confirmed that she was searched
when she entered the ground by a Police Officer.

In response to Mr. Payne, she confirmed that about quarter
to or ten to three, it was crowded but not uncomfortable
and she agreed that when it did go wrong it was some
time after quarter to or ten to three. She agreed with
Mr. Payne that in her view the Police had not realised
what was happening but felt that they should have been
listening to the people who were telling them what was
going on.

                      were asked about a beach ball and
they recollected this being thumped about.

She agreed that there was noise and that she could not
ALISON JANE BENNETT (contd.)

hear what was coming from behind her but only from the
people around her who were shouting to get out.

Mr. King cross-examined and she responded in answer to
him that at 2.30 the pen was as full as she had ever
experienced it and that if she had been told that a few
more hundred people would be introduced at that time
she would have thought that they had been mad.

We should, of course, remember that this in line with
what she had said originally to me but you have also
to remember that quite spontaneously she gave the time
of ten to three as being the time that Julie left them
at which time she repeatedly describes the conditions
as normal. This is not a criticism of her but simply
illustrates the difficulty of establishing the border­
lines between normality and abnormality or even derivations
of abnormality. This is confirmed because when Mrs.
McBrian asked her, "would you say the conditions were
quite normal for up to 1450" her response was "yes".
Mrs. McBrian then said "But they suddenly changed afterwards
to which she again replied, "Yes". Mrs. McBrian elicited
the pick up out of the pen at about quarter past three,
perhaps a little bit earlier. She agreed that it was
noi sy.

ASSESSM ENT:




                David came to the match with hir girlfriend Alison and
                three others, none of whom had tickets. They bought
                tickets for the Spion Kop because they were cheaper.
                Having got the tickets, they went to a pub, the White
                Horse. There were 50 to 100 supporters, mainly Liverpool
                supporters and behaviour from their point of view was
                perfectly satisfactory.

                They left the pub about one o'clock and went towards
                Leppings Lane. Having made some enquiries they were
                directed by a Steward to try the turnstile area but were
                refused entry. They went back to the Steward and he
                directed them to turnstile G, they wer* allowed through
                without any problems. Tickets were simply taken in the
                normal course of events. In fact, of course, these tickets
                were not valid for that entry. He confirmed that he did
                not have to plead with the turnstile operator. He explained
                that he did not want to go to the Spion Kop because they had
                been there the previous year and they hadn't been very happy
                with other Liverpool supporters. Having got in, they went
                down the tunnel. This was a route he had taken on previous
                occasions. He knew that the terrace was divided into pens.
                He made no attempt to move from behind the goal and, in
                fact, entered Pen 4. He said that the pens started filling
                up just after 2 o'clock and it filled up and people started
                swaying about. He described this as an involuntary m o ve ­
                ment. H* ascribed it to the fact that it occurred because
                it was tightly packed and people were moving about. He
                remembers the players coming out for a warm-up and going
                back in but he can't remember the teams coming onto the

DA i/ID PETER LOW (contd.)

      He described a general increase in pressure and this time
      he noticed that it was getting tighter and tighter and
      people were trying to climb over the fence. He said these
      were people ahead of him without other people coming from
      behind. He confirmed that it was very noisy and that there
      was chanting and singing from people right behind, i.e.
      further back. People where he was located were trying to
      get out. People around him were shouting, anxious to get
      out. He confirmed that throughout he was able to shout
      and as I understood him, the people further back were still
      chantinq.
      A question: So you are then saying that the people at the
      back were still happy and content and enjoying whatever
      was happening and didn't realise what was going on at the
      fribt.
      Answer:    It seemed that way.   Yes.
      The enclosure gradually thinned out and he was able to force
      his way back out through the tunnel.
      He was asked whether he knew if the ground was licensed and
      he said he did not but he believed it to be a very good
      ground.
      He said he saw police outside the fence. Initially there
      was a lad in front of him with his hands on the fence and
      he was being pushed back but then he saw people being helped
      over.
      When asked, for how long, he said, "A few minutes".

      The question was repeated: "I see, a short period of time".
      The answer was "Yes".
      He marked his position when he went into the ground at one
      o'clock and again when he was in front of the barrier.
      Plan No. C296.
      He agreed with Mr. Payne the swaying was associated with
      close proximity and, in fact, was one of the enjoyable thing:
      about standing on the terraces and was not something that
      one would normally worry about. He would have expected it
      to occur in a big match such as this.
       He also agreed with Mr. Manning that if a number of neo"le
       at t he back are larkina about i t can s^t up a cascade
       effect.

D/ VID PETER LOW (contd.)
     He reminded Mr Manning that he had had three pints afid
     a bottle of lager by the time he left at one and he
     confirmed that the bulk of the crowd had remained behind
     after he left, so he could not comment what amount of
     alcohol was consumed by them after that.

     Mr. Payne further cross-examined and elicited in a normal
     situation crowds were standing shoulder to shoulder
     in front.
     Mr. Kiff$asked him to look at C.267 showing a view of
     the terrace and, in particular, the people exiting from
     the tunnel did so slightly forward from the bare wall.

     Mr. Low agreed with Mr. King that from a normal position
     as described to Mr. Payne, things got tighter and tighter
     so that he was, for instance, unable to move his arms. On
     return he was absolutely jammed.
     In response to Mr. Catchpole, he was definite that there
     was a Steward outside the ground. He can be described
     as wearing a yellow jacket with the word "Steward" on
     it. He also agreed with him that following a situation
     such as this, there will be rationalisations and blanks.

     When asking this gentleman whether he would agree that
     shortly after him seeing a Police Officer pushing a
     young man back but there were officers attempting to
     assist fans, he replied "I didn't see no police officers
     attempting to assist fans". He then carried on, "Forgive
     me if I am wrong about that but I think you told the
     Learned Coroner there was a short period of time when
     people were helped out of the pens after you saw this
     incident". Answer: "There were fans helping other fans
     out". "Are you saying that never at any time did you
     see Police Officers helping fans out of the pens?"
     Answer: "I didn't see any, no." "Do you accept, in
     fact that it did occur but you just did not happen to
     see it?" Answer: "Yes."

     He was asked whether he could remember the teams being
     led out and people panting the air. He said he could
     not remember it.

     He appeared to take the view that in a normal crowd
     it is always possible to get one's arms up without having
     to make any adjustment in one's body position, though was
     nevertheless, so close that one was compelled to move
     by a sway or surge. He also agreed that he was able
     to breathe or to shout and that at that point in time
     when the Police Officer pushed the person back whom
     he described, he was shouting as indeed were most of
     the other people, as he had told us earlier. He was
     unable to relate it to any event on the field.
CUVID PETER LOW (contd.)

     You will recollect Mr. Low was the witness whom we
     re-called when we dealt with the question whether his
     tickets were genuine or not.
     Mr. Low was unable to say how many tickets the ticket
     tout had but the implication of his reply was that he
     could have sold them Leppings Lane tickets as well but
     they were more expensive.

             Following some traffic delay, they arrived in Sheffield
             at 2.30 and outside the ground at about 2.45. He walked
             to the ground a distance of about a mile, so fans appeared
             to him happy and he did notice some carrying cans but
             he could not put a figure on it. He agreed with Mr. King
             that for that type of match he would have described himself
             as coming late. He also agreed that on his approach
             to the ground there was police presence but that at the
             entrance he saw very little and, in fact, felt there
             was no organisation at all.   He also said that there
             was no-one to direct them once they got into the turnstile
             area.
             He was asked whether people on their own initiative people
             are not capable of seeing that there is an obstruction
             and he replied that he would say, "Yes but in a situation
             like that, no, because everybody is trying to get in".
             He gave afairly graphic description of the conditions
             outside the peniy/He said, "in my honest opinion if somebody
             had not opened the gates I think you would have had a
             lot more deaths on your hands because it was quite obvious
             from where we were standing that the actual fencing of
             the gate, or whatever system it was, I do not really
             know. It was swaying about and it was quite obvious
             if somebody did not do something, it would have gone,
             it was a simple as that. I am afraid you would have
             had a lot more d e a t h s on your hands. Well I feel that
             way".
             He entered the terraces via gates, he entered the tunnel
             and entered pen 4. In his case it would seem that he
fcn'H        experienced severe congestion, almost from the moment of
             entry and he timed as being at the time when the players
             were warming up. He can recollect that he was in fact
             fairly far back near the tunnel at this stage and he
             described how he heard people screaming. He was pressed
                              2


RICHARD JOSEPH THOMPSON (contd.)
as to whether he heard requests for people to move back
and although he thought it was possible, his response
was somewhat ambivalent, "I would imagine they would
do, yes".

Hewas carried forward by some movement or surge and hit
a barrier with sufficient force to crack two ribs.
Eventually he crawled over people's heads on his hands
and knees and was able to get out through the gates.
He then looked back at his son who was still in the
original position far back. He called to him but it
was obvious to him that his son could not hear him. In
due course his son was freed and rolled over the crowd
and in fact got quite close to the front fence. He
perceived that his son was calling for help and he also
heard a policeman shout "Go back". He took it that that
was a remark addressed to his son, though when pressed
he did in the end agree that the policeman and son were
not, in fact, having a direct conversation.

                                                     t.
whether the exchange of conversation was in fact a personal
one or whether the comments of the police officer was
addressed to people generally other than to an individual.
In the event a police lady did have to extricate his
son.

Although he felt that the pressure on the terrace was
worse than the crushing outside, he did agree with Mr. Hale
that the crushing out there had been the worst he had
ever experienced. He was not able to be of much help
with regard to activities on the pitch when he was trying
to get out as his main concern, quite naturally, was
to exit himself.

Mrs. McBrien questioned him about the use of portable
barriers but his view was that if they were just "ordinary
things" they could pick up they would not have lasted
five minutes. He agreed with her that he would have
been quite happy to wait longer if the kick-off had been
postponed.

In a nutshell, then, we have a man and his son who was ~
caught up in a severe crush at the turnstiles, so bad
that he felt that there would be many deaths some relief
was not achieved. Having entered through a big gate,
he exited onto a terrace which was very crowded, in fact
so badly that he couldn't move. He was subjected to
a surge of such intensity that he cracked his ribs on
a barrier, he escaped by crawling over the heads of other
people. His son eventually was rolled down towards the
front. He confirmed that there was an incredible amount
of noise and that despite that he could hear his son
calling for help and he could also hear police officers
on the outside shouting "get back". Fortunately in due
course his son was rescued.

    ASSESSMENT:




            This young lady attended the match with her boyfriend
            neither had tickets.      She said she didn't know it was
            an all ticket affair.      She came by train and taken to
            the ground on a supporters bus or coach.         There was a
            policeman on the bus, he did not check for tickets
            and when it stopped he said "Off and into the ground"
            This would have been between 1.00 and 1^.30 p.m.          At
            that time policemen were telling them to keep on the
            pavements and not walk in the road.         They spent until
            about 2.40 p.m. looking for a ticket during which
            time they did notice that there were some fans who v,
ft] o<X^"   were carrying alcohol which was mainly in the form
            of cans of beer.      She could not tell the quantities.
            She was more concerned about behavour, everyone
            seemed happy.     Eventually they did manage to buy a
            couple of tickets from a tout, joined the crowd,
            people were shouting "We want to get in, we have got
            tickets let us in".      After that it became crowded and
            loads of people started pushing behind us.         I noticed
            that there was a crowd building up behind us.         She
            noticed a mounted police Officer.         They got quite
            close to him.     He was shouting for everybody to go
            back, they w e r n 1t going to get in if they were pushing
            It didn't seem to make any difference at all the the
            situation.At t'his point T/shilst still outside the perimete:-
            gates they decided to retreat but found that they
            coundn't get out of the crowd.         She then describes
            coming through the outer perimeter gates and finishing
            up near blue concertina gates.         At that point there
            were not many people about and in fact she said they
            asked where to go and he suggested they go into the
            ground and they would worry about that when they got
            inside.   This was outside the blue concertina gate
            and she says there were not very many people around.
            Her impression was that the perimeter gates which
            are patrolled by the mounted Officer were shut initially
            but then subsequently opened.         She does not really
            know how.   This lady approached a Stewart whi was
            stood near the staricase and was told to go down the
            tunnel.   The tunnel was relativly clear.        They enterei
            the terraces on the left and she caught a glimpse of
            the pitch and noticed that players were either on it
            or perhaps had even started playing,

Once they got on the terrace she was seperated from
her boyfriend and was pushed towards the net.      I aske 1
 "Did you hear whilst on the terrace, did you hear
people shouting"?     "Yes" was the answer.   "Once we
got through the tunnel people were shouting Stop
pushing from behind, we are getting crushed here,
move back" but it didn't make any difference it was
just getting worse.     On C92 she marked the plan where
she heard the people shouting.      She then describes
how she was pushed towards the front and how two men
assisted her.    She was asked "Did you see any police
Officers on the far side of the perimeter fence"?
Her reply was "Yes I did, I saw then standing up and
when people were trying to climb over they were telli lg
them to get back in.     The men around me was shouting
to try and tell them what was going on inside but
they could not hear'j . We also heard them telling
people to move back but we just could not do that'.'
Thing then became even tighter and she went on to
say that once the police realised what was happening
they began to tear down the front.      This was after
the match had stopped.     She was adamant that it was
police officers who were pulling the fencing down.
She could not remember any fans doing i t . She said
the activity was more or less opposite to where she
was. The enclosure somehow cleared and she
 eventually left back through the tunnel.     She was cross
examined by Mr. Manning, she confirmed that there wens
 Dthers trying to get tickets and that she did not see
 the police landrover outside the gate.     In reply to
 tor. King she confirmed that she joined the crowds
 Dutside the perimeter gate at about 2.45 p.m.     She
 tfasprobed about the position of the police officer at
 the perimeter fence.    She was asked "The people who
 rere trying to get out and the police officers trying
 io get back in saying Get back in, what were they
 :rying to get out of, what was the problem that they
 rere trying to get out of"? Answer "The fact is I
:hink at that point there were actually people on the
 jround who had died and they were trying to explain
:his to the policemen at the time, they just wanted
 :o get out because you couldn't move".     Question "They
 wouldn't move, the people who wanted to get out"?
 Answer "No they were sort of crawling on top of
everybody". Question "How far was the police man fror
 :hat scene".   Answer "He was just in front of it he
 <ras just outside the fence standing".    Question "So
 is far as you could see was looking into what you were
describing"?    "Yes"   Mr King went on "I get the
 .mpression it was sometine before the police realised
 what was happening and then they started to pull down
 the fen cing, is that right"?     "It seemed like thatr
 at the time, yes".    Cross examined by Miss Adelman
 she said she knew that people were on the floor
 because she was standing on some of them herself.

         at the ground &t 2.45 p.m.   He did not hear any
         public announcements from the police landrover but
         he did see three mounted Officers.    He thinks one was
         outside the perimeter gates.   He was somewhat concerned
         for the safety of his son in the area outside the
         turnstiles but eventually he was able to get through
         gate C . As he entered somebody went past him and he
         heard him say "I told you we wouldn't need a ticket"
         or words to that effect........ passage down the
         tunnel and entered pen three.   When he entered the
         players were still kicking the ball about.    He did not
         know that it was sectioned into pens.   They were movinc
         over towards the right, unfortunately Paul       was
         knocked, spun round and knocked over.    He bent down
         himself to try and hold onto him but was himself
         knocked over and seperated from Paul and finished up
         near the gate.    I asked him whether the mounted
         Officers were doing anything, he said his impression
         was that the one nearest was trying to bring some
         kind or order but it was not having any effect.    In

NAME;      Ross Mark Wright.


DESIGNATION:         Supporter


STATUS:


ASSESSMENT:      Interesting witness.  Very good vantage point within the
                 ground. Not confused by turnstiles.   Heard loud speaker but
                 he and people around him nevertheless went forward.   Felt
                 that better organisation might have prevented the build up
                 and the problems.  Pens looked satisfactory at 3.03 p.m.



          Mr. Wright travelled by coach from Cornwall arriving
          in Sheffield without any problems at 1.30 to 1.45 p.m.
          This witness says that at 2.15 p.m. when they parked
          there were only 3 coaches in the parking area though
          a short time later there were about 25.  For various
          reasons they were delayed because of problems with
          their tickets and they eventually arrived at Leppings
          Lane about ten to three.

          Because for various reasons when they were walking
          round they saw supporters walking about. Some of
          these were carrying one and some were carrying four
          cans.  He thought that only a minority of the total
          number of people were carrying alcohol.    The
          atmosphere was happy and jolly.   As he approached the
          turnstiles he saw a Landrover with a P.A. system.    He
          could hear comments like "Take your time everybody
          will get in".   He first heard the announcement when
          he was perhaps a couple of houses back from the sweet
          shop.  He also recollects seeing three or four
          mounted Police Officers who he says were located
          around the Landrover.   THe positioned the Landrover
          outside the perimiter gates but close to the fencing.
          He was entering through the perimeter gates outside
          turnstiles one to sixteen and at 2.50 p.m. he thought
          they were open.   He was going through the one at the
          left extremity looking at the ground. Ofiine inside the
          turnstile area things got tighter and tighter.    He
          did not see any horse mounted Officers in this area
          but does recollect one Police Officer between the
          turnstiles and the wall.   He describes considerable
          tightness and difficulty in extracating oneself from
          this area, which he agreed was due to the fact of
          people following from the back.   In fact as he was
          following somebody through he hurt his shoulder in
          that area.  They got through just at kick off time
          judging from the noise.   He did not go along the
          tunnel although he knew it was there this was because
          in the previous year they had found that the mesh
          of the fans when you were near the front obstructed
           the view.  They had therefore chose another vantage
          point and they had decided to go to it this time.         <
PAGE 2         ROSS MARK WRIGHT.


This entry time to the ground I                was
quite different about 1.30 to 2.00 p.m.  Very few
people were making towards the enclosure seven which
is where he was aiming for.  He knew the way, he
confirmed that there were no signs.  There were some
Officers in the area in fact he recounts some
altrication between them and other supporters who
were cross with them because they wanted them to go
outside.  They entered enclosure seven with no
problems, took up their vantage position, Plan C

at which point the match had already kicked off.     He
thought it was about three minutes past three.    Havin' \
taken up their position they looked around . He
said there was a lot of singing and shouting in the
pens behind the goal and we were thinking to ourselves
"Cor we wish we were in there because we always stand
aehind the goals".   Having formed that impression we
:hen noticed that fans were beginning to climb right
Dver onto the perimiter.   He went on to say first of
all we thought it could be a bit of a protest because
we had the smaller end, but then we started to notice
they were not encroaching onto the pitch, everybody
was standing behind the line.    He then noticed that
Liverpool had a shot at something and they hit the
crossbar at the Nottingham Forrest end, he glanced
over and looked back again and by then the pens were
different.   He went on to say it is hard to explain
to people if you are in a tight situation you use
your elbows and they did not seem to be doing much.
In other words at two or three minutes past it looked
o.k. with people chanting but after the hit on the
crossbar things had changed within the pen.    When
asked the witness said that he noticed the penswere
being opened, the gates to the pens were being opened
and shut and he went on to say that he is positive
that he remembers that this happened after the player 5
left the field.   He also said that he fcobweedhfehat
Officers were pushing people back and banging on thei::
knuckles at about 3.15 p.m.   Mr. Hale pressed him
about consumption of alcohol and he responded "I saw
 people as I said before, they had some cans but I
san't say anybody was really happily under the
unfluence of drink.   Mr. Payne in his cross
sxamination asked the witness to demonstrate his
location in pen seven and he noted that his position
his location in that enclosure was the equivelent
Df the police observation post at the other end of thu
Leppings Lane terrace.   He repeated that from that
position at his match viewing position at about three
 ninutes past three the fans in pens.   He said that
you could see that there were a lot of people in the
area compared to the pens on the side but everybody
was happy, they were singing and shouting.    So the
 conclusion you would draw was everything was alright
 sort of thing.  On cross examination with Mr. Manning
 le agreed that despite the police appeals he was
 Deing carried forward by pushing from behing him.     He
 irew a contrast between 1988 and 89 in that he said
 in 88 people were filtered out.who didn't have tickets
 whereas this didn't happen in 89. You should of course
remember that the time of arrival of the two matches
PAGE 3                ROSS MARK WRIGHT

was different. This witness felt that people were
annoyed with the end, that they didn't have a
sufficient quota of tickets, that to his knowledge
people would turn up without tickets and that despite
the lateness of the hour people were still comming
in behind him at the turnstiles.     Gross examined by
4r. King he confirmed that there was a cordon of
police Officers across Leppings Lane near the round-
a-bout end where people without tickets were turned
away.    When asked by Mr. King anybody who didn't have
a ticket in 1988 just wouldn't have got into Leppings
uane from that round-a-bout, he replied " I expect
some would have found some way to get through but
the ... He also recollects that the Police Officers
tfere checking tickets as you got towards the extra
jates towards the perimeter in Leppings Lane.     He
corrected his earlier evidence as to ticketless fans
jy saying that he had assummed that the crowd contain*
ticket less fans because they hadn't been these check
but he hadn't himself see people without tickets.
 (Remember there is a difference in time) You may
then remember we had quite a long session discussing
the labelling of the turnstiles as A, C B and the
 differences on the tickets.    I thought Mr. Wright
 gave a rather significant reply when he was asked
 -’id it surprise you in view of that some people as you
Slave said were confused as to where they were going"?
 3is reply was "That is right, on our own coach there
 nrere people on the coach that had like section B and
 they didn't know where it was".    I certainly
 inderstood that reply to mean that people were unaware
 3f where to go, not because of the labelling though
 :hat no doubt added to the confusion, it didn't help
 jut because they did not know the layout of the grounc
 fou will also recollect that although Mr. Wrights
 :icket said B he went to the turnstile labelled A and
 lid so I think deliberately as he knew he wanted to
 jo to closure seven and he thought that was a more
 iirect route.    The       would have been through
 turnstiles A to G and it would then have been
 necessary to have turn left through a gap in the wall
 VIr. Wright agreed with Mr. King that he did not have
 the impression that people were deliberately trying
 :o             the situation but he also said that
 everybody just seemed to want to get in before the
 cick off.    Mr. King probed the response of the three
 Officers within the concourse area who apparently
 lad been told about the conditions outside, but who
 yere not taking any action.    He said " I am not tryinc
 :o be unfair to those Officers but was the impression
 rou gained from that, that they were making it very
 :lear that they were not interesting in what the
 supporters were saying to them".    Answer "The police
 have got to handle this situation all the time".
 Response "They are always getting complaints about
  different things I suppose, but I suppose on hearsay
 they just thought it was another load of supporters
 moaning about the conditions or something like that".
 Duestion    I was interested in what you say " Otherwis^
 we will nick you"    That presumably meant they were
  going to arrest then? Answer "Yes because they were
  quite adamant in their protest towards the Officers".
PAGE 4             ROSS MARK WRIGHT


Question "Did they say what they were going to arrest
them for"? Answer "No".      Mr. King then turned to
another aspect and put to the witness that he was not
put there in that enclosure to keep an eye on the cro' /d
behind the goals "That was not your function was it"
Answer "No". , Question "You are only giving your
evidence of your impression having a look across the
crowd"? Answer "That is right, I can only say what
   saw".   This witness thought that somebody at the
aack of the crowd would have a job telling what was
going on at the front of the crowd.      He further
explained that he realised that people were, that
this was not a protest when he recognised that the
spectators were not encroaching onto the pitch, i.e.
the playing area.    The witness was asked again about
Police Officers hitting people on the knuckles and
re reconfirmed that he saw this but he also added tha
some of the Officers were brilliant.      Mr. Keen put it
Some Officeres realised what was happening and were
desperate to help, some Officers just thought it was
crowd trouble"? Answer "Correct".      He was also asked
it he formed an,, impression of the lack of cordination
and he said "Yes".     We then spent a considerable
time going over the lettering and numbering markings
at the turnstiles which I do not think add very much
to this witnesses evidence.     I finally put to Mr.
bright the questions as to why people when they ....
    ......... the people did not themselves stop.     His
response to that was "No we just carried o n " . I said
:o him "You are not suggesting are you that the only
?ay you would stop is if somebody told you to stop,
ye are talking about you now, supposing you were
ipproaching a brick wall" Answer "If somebody had
:ome and said right hang on where you are, no further
rou would have stopped".     Question "Isn't that what
  he man in the landrover was saying"? Answer       "But
le was saying that there was a P.A., but he wasn't
saying stop to what I could reasct to, I think he
was just saying everybody take their time, everybody
was going to get in".     Question   " I was really asking
you this,"Are you saying that if you approach, this
is a rather ridiculous example but I want to make
a point,a closed door or a wall that you would
 contine walking unless somebody says stop"? Answer
 "No, you would stop".

NAME:      P.C. LOMAS

DESIGNATION :      p c


STATUS;    p o lic e Sergeant   2305   Serial   23

ASSESSMENT:




           This was a Doncaster Officer. He was instructed to patrol
           part of Middlfewood Road , Minto Road and Wadsley Lane.

           He described the briefing which he received and then
           he started patrolling. He started at about ten minutes
           past eleven and finished at around three o'clock when
           he went down to Leppings Lane entrance.

           His evidence was that he saw many hundreds of thousands
           of people, that he was approached by very many people
           asking where they could get something to drink or park
           a car. This questioning reduced after twelve thirty.
           He says that he saw a vast amount of alcohol consumed
           and in his view he had never seen so much before in his
           life. All types apart from hard spirits. His evidence
           was it was foul language and that he had received complaints
           from residents but he did not arrest anybody because
           on the whole when people were spoken to, they became
           very amenable and in his view realised that if they continue!,
           they would be arrested. In any event he thought it was
           technically correct not to arrest persons just because
           they were swearing. He saw his duty as one of containment.
           His instructions were to be fair but firm. He agreed
           that the fans were not aggressive towards him, though
           there ma y have been somewhat boisterous and swearing.
           He also said that he saw a number of people who were
           clearly the worst for drink and his Inspector Humphries
           asked for help with a group of people near the car park
           of the Park Hotel but no trouble, in fact, ensued..

           He was asked about ticketless fans and he noticed there
           were m a n y fans without tickets. He was approached by
           a number asking how they could get some. In addition
           he saw fans approaching others for spares. He had taken
           up his position at the junction of Middlewood Road and
           Catch Bar Lane where he could see Leppings Lane.

           His evidence was that until about 2.30 the vast majority
           of fans were making their way away from the ground from
           his position. He said that at 2.30 the switch had been
           flicked to flow changed and people started coming towards
           the ground. They came at the normal walk, though some *
P. C. LOMAS (contd.)

appeared the worst for drink. Because of the congestion
and the over-spill onto the road, he stopped traffic
going down Leppings Lane at 2.30 which he did on his
own initiative. The flow of fans eased up at about five
to three. He recounted that he had heard radio trans­
missions which he thought were from Superintendent Marshall
saying that the turnstiles were blocked and requesting
that kick-off be delayed.
When asked what time he thought this message was trans­
mitted, he thought it was just after five to three. He
thinks that he had opened the road by that time. He
felt the message came from Superintendent Marshall because
he seems to recollect the name and the call sign, though
he did not know him at the time. He heard no response
to that request.
He heard various other radio messages. In particular
he says he heard Superintent Marshall request that the
gates be opened on three or four occasions. In the end
he said that if the gate wasn't opened there would be
a catastrophy. He could not remember if it was said
in the singular or in the plural. On the last occasion
the order came back for the gates to be opened.

According to Mr. Lomas, the request to postpone the match
came before the request to open the gates.

Eventually he did go-down to the Lane and formed a cordon
across it, keeping out about a hundred and fifty to two
hundred fans. Most of these he thought had tickets.
In fact, he says they said, "I've got a ticket, why can't
I go in?".                                     /
Mr. Lomas was taken to the operational order and with
which he agreed as far as it affected him.

He agreed with Mr. Payne that there were thousands of
people going towards the ground and up to two thirty
they had been standing around eating and drinking
They were coming down Wadsley Lane towards Leppings Lane
and towards the ground.
On cross-examination by Mr. King, he did ascertain that
he had not been given a specific task about keeping an
eye on the flow of the crowd and he responded that his
job was to ensure that the public could walk along the
street safely.

He was questioned quite closely as to whether he sent
any messages to alert the people on the number of people
coming down the lane but he explained that he did not
as it would have been obvious to people at Leppings Lane
end that there were a lot coming down as the road was
blocked.
P.C. LOMAS (contd.)

When pressed by Mr. King about the humour of the residents,
the incidence of swearing and obscenities and general
feel of the situation, he also said that he thought there
might have been a thousand fans going down the road and
that the vast majority were the worst for drink.
He was asked by Mrs. McBrian whether it wouldn't have
been better rather than close off the road to have confined
the fans to the pavements. His response was that there
were too many for this to be done. He explained this
on the basis of if a bottle-neck was created at one
point, there would be congestion at another. Mrs. McBrian
put it to him that people have to obey law to keep law
and order, people must obey rules for safety reasons.
Sergeant Lomas agreed but said it was impossible to be
effective on this occasion.
In answer to Mrs. McBrien, he also said that if he was
told that the request for the kick-off   was made by
somebody other than Superintendent Marshall, he would
accept it.
In response to Miss Adelman, he said that there people
with no tickets who were going to the ground. He said,
"That is correct, sir. I heard many people asking for
spare tickets, say 'come on, we will get in' and I just
couldn't understand it because without a ticket, how
would you get in past the turnstiles"? He thought the
remarks were made after 2.30.
He was asked how many officers he thought would be needed
to put up a defective cordon and he said he thought it
would have to be at least three officers deep aJid would
take about 50 men and in response, Mr. Ross-Leigh thought
they would have had to know about it prior to 2.30. In
his view he had never seen such a large crowd arriving
so late. This was in response to Mr. Payne. He also
agreed with Mr. King that the impression he had formed
from the briefing was that people were expecting the
crowd to arrive much earlier.
He was asked by Mrs. McBrian whether he thought it was
necessary to filter ticketless fans and he felt that
it was unnecssary because he honestly believed that they
would not get into the ground, though he agreed that
he was perhaps naive. He was asked to think again about
his estimate of ten thousand and he said that he night
well be wrong. What he was trying to say was that there
were an awful lot of people coming down the lane.

DESIGNATION:       T
— :
  ----------       Local resident

STATUS:


ASSESSMENT:




        This gentleman says it takes him a few minutes, six
        or seven to get home normally. He saw loads of
        supporters and on the whole formed the opinion that
        these were supporters of Liverpool.   They were sat on
        walls in Claywheels Lane and as he walked along they
        jumped up and asked him if he had tickets to sell.
        The nearer he got to home the bigger the crowds
        became and more people asked him for tickets.    He
        thought he could have sold 50 tickets easily with no
        trouble.   In addition he noticed that there were
        people, particularly in a road known as Beawood Road
        who urinated without any hesitation as he put it, and
        he also noticed that they were carrying cans of beer
        and some were drinking from wine bottles.    He saw
        youngsters near the Gate Public House drinking.
        Having got home his friend Mrs. Sweet was there.    It
        was their intention to go out and look at the Police
        horses.   This was standard practice as Mrs. Sweet
        apparently was very keen on thehorses.    They did in
        fact leave at about 2.40p.m.   Having entered Leppings
        Lane he noticed that even for a semi-final there were
        an unusual number of people still getting to the grour
        He put it there were hundreds and hundreds of them,
        there were people walking on the pavements and the
        roads.   As soon as they got into the lane people who
        had been sitting on the walls of peoples gardens
        jumped up and rushed to them, about twenty or thirty
        all asking for tickets.   He said he told them he
        he didn't have any and he mentioned that these were
        carrying cans of beer and drinking.   They were singinc
        football songs which he found offensive..    He was
        asked whether   in fact at that point he felt he ought
        to turn round and he said "No" that he didn't feel
        threatened.   They proceeded towards the entrance, wher
        they got to within 15 yards of the gates almost
        opposite the sweet shop he realised that they would
        not be able to proceed and he said to Connie (Mrs.
        Sweet) "There is no way we can get through there love,
        we will go across the other side of the road".    They
        crossed over to the other side onto the bridge and
        were again approached by people asking for tickets.
PAGE 2        Joseph Randall Tom Bartholomew

He had noticed that the people who were sat on the
bridge and laid on the floor were drinking alcohol.
They carried on to the other side of the bridge and
climbed up a small embankment to see what was going
on.  He said they could hear screeming and shouting.
There was real panic in that area beacuse nearly all
of Leppings Lane was blocked off.    He said from that
vantage point he could see Police Officers in the
crowd, but in his view it was hopeless.    Everyone
was pushing forward to get to the turnstiles.     You
could see people stood at the turnstiles but not
goign in because they were that tightly packed they
couldn't move.   They noticed young people being
lifted up a metal partition wall and policemen stood
on top were lifting then up and passing them over
into the ground to stop them being crushed.    The
vantage point which they were at was about 4 0 yards
from the turnstiles and about 40 ft higher than the
turnstiles.   It seemed to him to be pandemonium.
When they got to the top of the vantage point they
heard what sounded like a policeman asking, saying
"This is a police message, this is an urgent message
to the Liverpool supporters,    would you please stop
pushing forward people at the turnstiles are being
crushed".   It was as clear as the day he said.    The
message was being repeated every three or four minutes.
He went on to say that it appeared to have no effect
at all on the crowd, none at all.    He then noticed a
mounted officer entering the crowd halfway between
the perimeter gate and the wall and he appeared to
be cutting the crowd off to stop the pressure on the
people at the front.    He confirmed that he saw severe
horesmen there and that it didn't appear to have mucl:
effect.   He saw that other mounted Officers came
through the crowd and positioned their horses head
to tail across the entrance.    He thought that that
did hold the crowd a little but people in his words
wer rushing down Leppings Lane and they disappeared
and he thought 'Well they are going under the horses
bellies and heads'    it didi not appear to have any
effect. He assessed the situation and said to Connie
"If nothing is done here somebody is going to get
killed".   He then noticed that one of the gates near
to the sweet shop was starting to move and he indicatjed,
He went on to say I assumed they were trying to push
it down to either get into the ground or eleviate
the pressure.   He then noticed a gate on the right h
hand side opening and shortly after a gate on the lefjl
I took him to mean with regard to these gates the
gates, the one on the right being gate C and the one
on the left   gate A.   Indeed he confirmed that.    Mr.
Bartholomew said he could see the landrover when he
was at        maybe six or seven minutes after having
left his home but he could not hear an announcement
at that time.   There was a lot of noise from the crowji.
It was deafening.   When aske whether he first heard
the announcement when he reached this vantage
position hight up he said they first heard it, the
announcement asking them to stop pushing when they
were on the other side of the road at ground level.
He confirmed that this ground position was at the lefjt
hand side of the bridge across the river Don.     He
also said that he heard the message from the landrove
PAGE 3                Joseph Randall Tom Bartholomew


change to "Will the Liverpool supporters please move
by the horses" or something like that.    Again there
was no responce that he could notice.    He was then
asked about the pushing and he said " As we slowed
down we couLdn1t go any further, you had to put
your arms out to prevent yourself from being pushed
tot he floor, people were putting their arms in you
and pushing you out of the way to get through.    In
otherwords people were trying to get through to the
front rather faster.  He thought that gate C opened
at about 2.55 p.m. and he could hear the roar of the:
crows which he took to be the kick off.    He also saic
that they were converging on the turnstiles after th:
but he did not see a large crowd, they were steady,
coming down nice and steady.     Mr. Bartholomew said
he had been going down to look at the horses for
about eight years with Connie Sweet.    In reply to
Mr. Payne he said that he did not recollect having
seen such a lot/ many people arriving at the ground
at twnety minutes or quarter of an hour before kisk
off.  It was Mr. Bartholomews view that people could
hear the announcement, he heard it from 40 yards
away and some of them must have been right close to
the landrover.  When asked by Mr. King about the
opening of the gates he said he couldn't see them but
he had deduced that they must have been opened at
some point because the policeman/haa formed the
cordon he had described ahd come up , the main
entrance to the ground up the side of the river.     He
agreed with Mr. Payne the point when he was at his
vantage point with a solid mass of people the
situation was out of control.    He went on to say " I
don't think a thousand people could have controlled
that line".  In addition he also told us that lita
addition to the horses he also saw two police horses
within the turnstile area kfeto he thought were trying
to split the crowd into two sections. He agreed
that he didn't think it would be possible for the
crowd to get in before kick off.    Mr. Bartholomew
was asked by Mr. McBrien whether he heard any
announcement about the postponement and he said he
did not.

DESIGNATION:      Local Resident


STATUS:


ASSESSMENT:




        Mr. Lindley is a local resident and lived at 46
        ............ Rdad for about 52/53 years.    He lookes
        after some             rented garages on a piece of
        land at the back of his house.    He went onto the groui d
        with his wife at about 12.00 with the object of stopping
        people parking and fans urinating on the land.    This
        was nothing unusual it happened at every match.    He
        stayed until about 3.00 p.m.   He explained that when
        the fans came onto the ground in ones and twos    it was
        possible to send them away but when they came in
        groups of five or six they didn't take much notice
        and carried on anyway.   He I:thought about fifty came
        onto the land.   He gave an interesting account of
        hearing the roar of the crowd within the stadium
        which he took to be the kick off.    Shortly thereafter
        he says there was a terrific surge of hundreds of
        fans running down Leppings Lane intending to get intc
        the ground.  He says "We were amazed, we stood and
        watched them and to describe it was just like puttinc
        a lid on a boiling kettle when they got to the ground
        I don't thinkany policeman no matter how many there
        were could have stopped them.   Prior to that Leppings
        Lane had been relatively empty.    The crowd was in its
        hundreds but not thousands".   He then went back into
        the house and having switched on the T.V. learned
        shortly thereafter of the disaster.    He was asked by
        Mr. Payne whether he had ever seen so many people
        arriving just before kick off, he said "No never so
        many, normally we get three of four cars at around
        five to three just on the last two or three minutes,
        they just come and dump their cars and off they go.
        The number of people who usually finish for about
        ten minutes to, five minutes to three unless there
        was a late     ..... Cross examined by Mr.
        he confirmed that when he looked at the enterance of
        Leppings Lane he saw there was astill a crowd of
        people there which was then joined by the group whom
        le had previously described. Mr. Lindley was asked
        about positioning of Officers along the side roads
        leading off Leppings Lane and he confirmed that they
        were present at this time but had not intervened.

Further cross examination by Mr. Payne, he said that
he didn't think that they could have done anything,
the crowd was too big and too heavy.   Mr. King then
asked if he saw a cordon of officers across the

23. A LINDLEY                                 LOCAL RESIDENT

Looking after rented garages. Stopped fans urinating. Single fans
responded to request but groups of five/six did not. About 50 in
this category. Heard a roar from the crowd, thought it was match
start (query players coming out). Saw large surge of hundreds
running down Leppings Lane. Feared trouble. Lateness was
exceptional. No police action in preventing people going down
Leppings Lane but it would not have been possible.                        57

                                              AND BAKERY WORKER

Walked up Claywheels Lane to his home, 17 Farndale. Saw many people
who he felt were ticketless, saw people drinking at Gate Inn and
carrying cans, behaviour - urinating, chanting, singing, swearing.        64, 65,
Noticed pushing at rear of crowd.                                          68
Arrival time very late, densely packed, realised dangerous situation,     62,   63,71
someone would get killed if nothing done.                                 74,    65
Gate A open.                                               64
Noted Landrover at 14.47.
Message - stop pushing                                               68
Message changed, noise ++ but able to hear ground's tannoy. No
response. Saw cordon formed, crowds still advancing, ducking under
horse, officers trying to split crowd. Crowd appeared out of control,
would have needed thousands of officers!                                  75
DAY 4

20.     J D SHELLEY

Conspiracy theory. Bar.- of "Matilda". Very few fans. Invited to
go to match with some supporters. Explained no ticket. Neither had
they, claimed that they never had ticket but always got in. Strong         72
i o £ L»&wce of ticketless fans getting in but, in view of timing, would
they have had much opportunity to influence things. Must have
arrived at ground after 3 pm because taxi was delayed.

Another independent observer. "Sicey" pub. Conspiracy theory.
Overheard three men, one from Notingham, two from Liverpool, discussing
the method of getting into the grouind, including creating a crush to
force gate to be opened. If correct, remarkably accurate description of
what happened but in view of large numbers, even if it had been the
intention, it may still not have been implemented.                         78


DAY 4 AND DAY 5

22. M TISSINGTON                                 P.C. SERIAL 28
                                                                           &
Initial task was parking minibuses. There from 11.30 to 2 pm, about
17 minibuses. Organised buses, no alcohol, private ones did have some      90, 92
(private pub!), behaviour good, no problems.
Then after 2.30 onward checking in Halifax Road, cans ++. Went to          35, 43
stadium just before match, met Insp. Charles and then proceeded to         95, 21 (5)
concourse. Found fan in the area, thouight it was a fainting episode.
Did not realise gravity of situation initially. Went into tunnel/
terrace, no play, quite a few people leaving via tunnel. Tunnel
eventually became blocked, many supporters were co-operative.
Insisted that he saw Supt. Greenwood with megaphone organising             101 , 102 ,
chain, taking hold of situation.    Also saw Supt Nesbitt tearing down     38, 39,
fence.    Also discussed public order and safety in the operational        48, 49 (5)
order.                                                                     41
DAY 4

16. J L TAYLOR                                NOTTS SUPPORTER

Parked near Wadsley Bridge just before 2 pm. Had arrived with numerous
coaches. Saw fans exhibiting adverse effect of alcohol, carrying cans,
probably urination, chanting, agressive to Police. Worse behaviour       27, 28,
seen. Was 50/100 people estimated being ticketless.   Exhibit C.282      29, 41
exhibits Police activity.
Went to Nottingham end at Penistone Road roundabout. On the whole
pedestrians were on pavement. Did not .think very much more could
be done.


17.   E L LEE                                 LOCAL RESIDENT              O

Young girl, went in and out a lot. 2 pm Leppings Lane, busy but not
crowded. 2.45 to 2.59 large crowds. People crawling between others       48
legs, people being squashed, everyone moving forward. Heard requests
not to push. Was at the rear of the crowd. Crowded at turnstile,
realised this but everyone was just joining at the back of this crowd
which got bigger and bigger. Perimeter gates appeared shut but not
shut all day. Saw people affected by alcohol staggering and holding
each other up.                                                           51, 53

18.   D G L WATTS

Conspiracy theory. Freemasons Arms. Conversation with some Liverpool
supporters. Spoke to two young people, claimed they were ticketless      59, 60
but "they won't stop us, we haven't done yet". Did not feel menaced.

19.   P K MARJORAM

At pub (Pheasant). Two Liverpool supporters were leaving it rather
late to go (2.45) but seemed to indicate that they were not expecting
any problems about getting in. Assumed at the time that they knew
someone who would be able to let them into the special entrance.
       DAY 4    (xi.W.lp)

       15. A HOCKENHQH               LOCAL RESIDENT - CARPENTER

       Lives in Leppings Lane. Described large numbers urinating in garden,
       they said "it is only lager". Consistent with large match, but more.
       Peaked between 2.30 and 3.05. Some aggression. Control over garden
       established by police officer.
N.B.   1)   Indicates compliance to police authority on one hand but must
       be remembered that the garden wasn't where the fans were actually
       intending to go.
       2) Makes it more difficult to justify behaviour if they are able
       to stop when P.O. blocks the way (unless they went somewhere else).


*      DAY 10/13

       40.     J McGAULEY            LOCAL RESIDENT, WADSLEY LANE

       His evidence differs from other local residents.
       Watching fans between 1.30 and 2.30 with baby.
       Well behaved, less problems than normal, moving down towards ground
       and not away (per Sg. Lomas), saw nobody carrying alcohol, no
       urinating in garden, people on pavement only. Not regular supporter.
       Attended match 11.2.89 (Sheffield Wednesday vs Manchester United),
       previous attendance 1980. At Leppings Lane at 14.50, estimated 500
       people. Strong police presence, didn't think they would get in before
       kick-off. Went to Spion Kop. During the first 15 minutes saw people
       being pulled into the stands from Leppings Lane terrace, reason not
       known. No idea what happened at Leppings Lane with crowd. No
       idea whether they came in on time. Noticed some fans being escorted     Day 13,
       round the perimeter track from Kop to Leppings Lane, groups of 20/30.   P 92, 98
DAY 3 (cont...)
12.   L STEVENSON              SHOP ASSISTANT

Small shop. Fans complained about traffic delays. Boisterous,
swearing but not that unusual. Lots of cans, breath terrible,
saw people running down road at about 14.45. Earlier crowd had been
"drunk" but well behaved.

13.   J ACKFORD                EMPLOYEE OF BRITISH STEEL WORKS

In traffic at Neepsend Road 2.30 to 2.45.   Masses of people.
N.B. in Nottingham section).

14.   S M GUNSTONE             PSYCHIATRIC NURSE TEACHER

Travelled to babysitters passed numerous pubs with supporters
spilling onto road, boisterous and gesticulating but when added
up perhaps not that many people. She felt there was a difference
in atmosphere between Nottingham and Liverpool supporters when she
passed respective areas.
7.    D KNIGHT                 LICENCEE, COMMERCIAL HOTEL, CHAPELTOWN

                                (VARIANCE FROM OTHER LICENCEES)

40 supporters, behaviour hectic, some intoxicated.
Average consumption 3 to 5 pints.
Quite happy to see supporters go.

8.    EUNICE BERGEN             SHOP ASSISTANT,MIDDLEWOOD ROAD

Frequent requests for directions to pubs etc.
Smell of alcohol on breath of people in shop.   Biggest part     were
carrying alcohol cans etc.

9. OLIVE MAYHEW                 PETROL PUMP ATTENDANT

Confused witness with regard to road closure. Confused as to team
identities but nevertheless pretty clear about number of bags of
empty cans she had to pick up (seven bags), and re urinating. Used
an interesting word -    "the alcohol gave them COURAGE".


10. A FOSTER-ASH

Difficult witness. His impression was that a good 50% were carrying
cans of alcohol near the "Horse and Jockey". Did not think there
was more tr*aff|c than normal, just more people. Felt fans were
boisterous^ertftgoing (query alcohol induced), friendly.
Identified Police presence being represented on photograph at 14.25.


11.    D F GUILLAND-CUMMINGS    DOCTOR OF BIO CHEMISTRY

Out shopping. Noticed groups, relatively small, purchasing alcohol.
Felt a tense and agressive atmosphere. Long convoluted discussion
regarding assumptions re ticketless fans. Possibly slightly weak
on facts but good on her feelings.
DAY 2       ( 2 0 -I).

3.    P BUCK                        LICENCEE, FOX INN

6.    K N OLLERENSHAW              THE OWL

Claimed 600 customers, half and half, very excessive drinking
by quite a lot.                                               39


DAY 15

54.     R SALT                      THE OWL

File with Mr Ollerenshaw, Licencee of The Owl.
Disagreed re sales, maximum number 300 people, total takings
£1,192, equals 1,000 pints approximately. Said he had never
seen so many £20 notes.
Interesting that in many       respects evidence coincides with Ollerenshaw
e.g. discussion re extra       stock, warning about damage, increased staff,
telephone messages, also       invoices re bottled beer suspect in view
of ability to sell these       by crates.

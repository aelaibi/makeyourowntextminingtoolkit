LORD JUSTICE TAYLOR'S FINAL REPORT - STATEMENT ON MONDAY



1 .Thank you for your minute of 24 January enclosing a draft
Q and A briefing.

2. The Minister is happy with it but would like to make one
addition to the answer to question 3. He would like the first
sentence to read:-

"The Department of the Environment will initiate discussions
with the football authorities and the specialist companies as
soon as possible with a view to devising an effective and
tested membership scheme in the event that Lord Justice
T a y l o r 's package of measures do not achieve his objectives of
"minimising or eliminating hooliganism" and it should then
prove necessary to introduce one."

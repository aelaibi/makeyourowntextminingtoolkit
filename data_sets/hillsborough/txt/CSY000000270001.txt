FIRE PREVENTION - COMMITTEE OF INQUIRY INTO CROWD SAFETY AND CONTROL
AT SPORTS GROUNDS - INTERIM REPORT

1.   As requested at the meeting of the Fire Service Committee on 6th June,
     1 9 85 I am now able to provide further information regarding the safety
     provisions in sports grounds within South Yorkshire.

2.   Following the events which occurred at the Bradford City Football Ground
     on 11th May, 1985 a survey of sports grounds in South Yorkshire was under­
     taken to identify stadia to which the Safety of Sports Grounds Act, 1975
     might be applied should the safety standards be considered unsatisfactory .

     In addition       to   the    5    majo r   football   club   grounds   the   survey   revealed
     stadia at

              9     Association football grounds
             10     Cricket grounds
              5     Rugby football grounds
              4     Greyhound tracks
              1     Joint speedway/greyhound/rugby ground
              1      Horse racing course
             40     General sports grounds

     The 40 sports grounds provide mixed activities such as football, tennis,
     cricket, bowling, rugby and athletics.   Included in this number are botl
     private clubs and others that are local authority controlled.

3.   Of the 70 grounds visited only 13 required attention.   Work to improve
     the standard of fire safety has been agreed and includes :

       (i)    Fire proofing and means of escape work at -

              (a)     Doncaster Greyhound Stadium.

              (b)     Dons Rugby Club, Bentley.

      (ii)    Roof repairs at -

              (a)     Elsecar Cricket Club.

              (b)     Dodworth Miners Welfare          Ground.

     (iii)    Improved housekeeping and fire equipment at 9 stadia, all of which
              are considered to be of a satisfactory standard.

4.     A resolution to fire proof the main stand at the Hillsborough Stadium,
       Sheffield has been agreed and the major part of this work will be com­
       pleted before the start of the 1985/86 season. It has also been suggested
       that a new roof be provided for this stand and work has already commenced
       on the design and structural specification. It should be completed before
       the start of the 1986/87 season.

5.     Work is still progressing at the .Bramall Lane Ground, Sheffield with a
       view to the authority issuing a general safety certificate in the near
       future.

6.     Doncaster Rovers Football Club have applied for a general safety
       certificate following the coming into operation of the 1985 Designating
       Order S.I.1985 : 1063. A considerable amount of work has already been
       carried out to improve the fire resistance of the main stand and additional
       work is being undertaken to improve the final exits from the ground.

7.      Only the usual maintenance work is considered necessary at the Barnsley
        and Rotherham Football Club grounds.

8.     The Interim Report of Mr. Justice Popplewell became available to the
        County Fire Service early in August. It is a detailed document of
        almost 100 pages, including much technical data. The Report concludes
        that the Bradford fire was caused accidentally and that there were two
        causes of the fire and the resultant casualties; the presence of litter
        under the seating and the absence of sufficient exits. The Report
        comments that, had the safety advice contained in the Home Office Guide
        to Safety at Sports Grounds (Football) - the "Green Guide" - been
        followed, the tragedy would not have occurred.  It must be added that, at
        that time, the Ground had not been designated by the Secretary of State
        under the Safety at Sports Grounds Act, 1975. As regards the
        Birmingham City incident, the Report concludes that a substantial number
        of Leeds United Fans, full of drink, had gone to Birmingham to cause
        trouble, and thereby sparked off the Birmingham City supporters whose
        subsequent behaviour was as bad as, if not worse than, that of the visiting
        supporters. The Report states that it is not possible to be sure how the
        brick wall came to fall, but feels that the most likely explanation was
        the surge of people.

9.     The Report makes a number of recommendations. These, together with the
        Government's responses to them, are set out in Annexe "B" of the copy
        of Home Office Circular No. 54/1985 attached as an Appendix to this
        Report. To satisfy these recommendations, the Joint Officer Working
        Party has already discussed the implications with the Club Managements
        and steps have been taken to satisfy them.

10.     It is considered that from this additional information now made available
        all reasonable steps considered necessary have been undertaken to ensure
        the safety of members of the general public at sports grounds in the
        County of South Yorkshire.

11.     Following Mr. Justice Popplewell's further detailed consideration of his
        findings and the production of a final report it is expected that the
        Safety of Sports Grounds Act, 1975 will be amended and the content of
        the Green Guide modified. The effects of such changes will be reported
        to the Fire Service Committee when known.

consi de r as a matter of u rg en cy what steps they should take as
n ec ess ar y in their p a rt ic ul ar local c ir cu ms t an ce s to give effect -
where possible in time for the start of the 1985/86 football
season - to the r e c om me nd a ti on s that relate to their responsibilities.
Althou gh a number of the points will have a lr e ad y been dealt with
either as a result of the recent e x erc is e by chief fire officers
(see Part B below) or, in the case of des ig na te d stadia, by existing
s af et y cert if ic at e conditions, c er ti f ic at i ng author iti es are no netheless
req ue st ed to review their c ert if i ca ti o n proced ur es and existing
ce rt if i ca te s so as to incor po rat e as n ec e ss ar y the I n q u i r y ’s interim
r ec omm en da tio ns .  In so doing, a ut h or it ie s should bear in mind that
it is not c on s id er ed that action upon the I n q u i r y ’s recommended
a m en dme nt s to the Greei Guide should wait upon the issue of the next
e di ti on of the Green Guide.        (This will not be prep ar ed until after
the Final Report is received.)

5.         The specif ic points for c o n s i d er a ti o n by the re sponsible
a ut ho ri t ie s are as follows:

(a)   C e r t i f i ca t in g a ut ho ri t ie s are asked   to -
      (i)         ensure that the pol ic e form part of the issuing
                  team for safety ce rti fi ca t es (Rec omm en da ti on 1);

      (ii)        consider in clusion of a c o nd it io n within safety
                  c er ti fi ca te s for adeq ua te first-aid facilities
                   (Reco mm en da ti on 8);

      (iii)       consult chief fire officers over the adeq ua cy of
                  exits at all sports g rou nd s with the aim of
                  r ef l ec ti ng the advice in new or existing safety
                  c er ti fi ca te s as necessary, b ea r in g in mind
                  s p ec ta to r nu mbers to be per mit te d into the ground

      (v)         give p r e l i m in a ry thought to how best a sports ground
                  register might be set up and used - see also
                  par ag ra ph 7 below ( Re c om m en da ti on 17);

                  is likely to attract s i g n i fi ca n t crowds (Recommendation 4);

      (vii)        consider w he th er sa fe ty c e r t i fi c at e conditi on s relating
                   to manned exits require a m p l i f i c a t i o n or amendment, and
                   how best to implement (e.g. p ro te c ti o n of stewards by a
                   police presen ce on exit gates) and ensure compliance
                   ( Re co mm en da ti on 11); and

                                                              are provisional. They fall into two groups: those

    certificates in respect of designated grounds should, as heretofore,

    Certificating authorities and chief officers of police will be
    invited to act upon these recommendations (see also Recommendation 10).




    RECOMMENDATIONS


    6.       Those managing sports grounds not governed by safety certificates
    should give serious consideration, with the assistance of fire authorities,
    to the presence in a ground of suitable fire fighting equipment.
    (Paragraph 3.5*0


    7-       Stewards at all sports grounds should be trained in fire fitting.
    (Paragraph 3-55)


    8.       In designated grounds it should be a term of the safety certificate
    that an adequate first-aid room should be provided.     (Paragraph 3.99)




                                           1
 10.      Stewards in all grounds should not only be trained in fire
 precautions and fire-fighting (see Recommendation 7 above) but should
 also be trained in how best to help the police in evacuation.
 (Paragraph 3-10*0


 l1).    Suitable and adequate exits should be provided in all sports
 grounds.    (Paragraph 3.138)

15.      No smoking should take place in combustible stands, that this
should be a condition of entry to the ground that signs to that effect
should be prominently displayed and this should be a condition of
entry to the ground.    (Paragraph 3.1*11)


The relevant sports authorities will be invited to draw the attention
of sports grounds managers to these recommendations, and certificating
authorities will be asked to consider reflecting the recommendations
in new or amended safety certificates as appropriate in the case of
designated grounds.    The fire and police services will be asked to stand
ready to advise on equipment and assist with training as appropriate.




RECOMMENDATION


9.       There should be urgent consultation between the Health and Safety
Executive and the fire authorities and local authorities as to how best
to co-ordinate and communicate their inspections and reports.
(Paragraph 3.95)


The HSE has appointed a member of its Executive to review liaison
arrangements between its inspectors and the fire authorities.    He will
consult Government Departments and others in this review, the results of
which will be made public.




RECOMMENDATION


     •   Fire Authorities should identify and visit all sports stadia in their
areas and should prohibit or restrict the use or any stands which, in their
view, constitute a risk to spectators because of the inadequacy of the fire
precautions. (Paragraph 3.1*12)
     Chief Fire Officers in England and Wales were invited by the Home Secretary
     on 16 May to inspect all sports grounds and were reminded of the powers
     available to them to take emergency action if, in their view, fire hazards
     constituting a risk to spectators are revealed.    The Secretary of State
     for Scotland similarly asked Firemasters to inspect sports grounds in Scotland.
     Reports received show that fire brL&dez   have not hesitated to recommend
    emergency action where necessary, including in a number of cases a prohibition
     on the use of stands or a restriction on the number of spectators allowed
     into them.




    RECOMMENDATION
I

    17.    In order to ensure a complete record of sports grounds a
    local registration system should be set up.     (Paragraph 3-150)


    Consultation will take place with the local authority associations to
    establish how such records may best be compiled and maintained.     The
    recent visits of the fire brigades f see Recommendation 16) should have
    in practice marshalled much of the relevant data already.




    STRUCTURES


    RECOMMENDATION


    13-    Building of new permanent stands of combustible materials
    should be prohibited as a general rule.    (Paragraph 3.132)


    This recommendation will be given speedy and urgent consideration
    by the Departments who are responsible for building regulations.




                                     3
GREEN GUIDE


RECOMMENDATIONS


       The Green Guide should be amended to include in Paragraph 11 a
provision that, wherever practicable, roads within a quarter of £
mile of a sports ground should be kept entirely free of parked vehicles.
(Paragraph 3-35)


11.    Paragraph b.1^.6 of the   Green Guido snould be amended to read:
"All exit gates should be manned at all times while the ground is used
by the public and be capable of being opened immediately from inside
by anyone in an emergency."   (Paragraph 3-111)


12.   The Green Guide should be amended to contain a specific provision,
in relation to stewards,


       (i)     that they should be trained and instructed to
       deal with any emergency relating to fire or evacuation
       (see also Recommendations 7 and 10);


       (ii)    that they should be given written instructions
       about the action to be taken in cases of emergency;


       (iii)   that they should receive practical instruction
       and training appropriate to their responsibility,


       (iv)    that no one should be employed as a steward
       unless they have been so instructed and trained; and


       (v)     that they should be adequate in number, physically
      and mentally capable of performing their duties, effectively
       deployed, effectively supervised and readily identifiable.
      (Paragraph 3.117)


19.   The next edition of tne Green Guide should make it clear
that it applies to all sports grounds.   (Paragraph 3-15*0
These points will be noted for inclusion in the next edition of the Green
Guide which will be needed after the Inquiry’s final report is received.
Action will not however depend upon the availability of a fresh edition and
certificating authorities and chief officers of police (Recorrmendation 4)
will be invited to take such steps as are open to them now.




CROWD MANAGEMENT


RECOMMENDATIONS


5.     Consideration should be given to making it a criminal offence
in England and Wales to have a smoke bomb or similar device at sports
grounds.   (Paragraph 3.42)


22.    There should be a specific offence of throwing a missile at
sports grounds. (Paragraph 6.57)


The case for inviting Parliament to create new criminal offences on
these lines will be studied urgently in connection with the Government's
intention of introducing legislation in the next session of Parliament
following its review of the law relating to public order.




RECOMMENDATIONS


20.    Urgent consideration should be given by football clubs in
England and Wales to introducing membership system so as to exclude
visiting fans.     (Paragraph 6.48)


23.    Football clubs should review their arrangements for entry and
the organisation of their turnstiles.     (Paragraph 6.62)


Both these recommendations are for football authorities and clubs, but the
Government hopes that they will be given serious consideration.    The
Government has been encouraging the Football Association and the Football
League to introduce a scheme of membership cards and the options are currently



                                      5
 being considered in a Football League working group: that group's
 attention will therefore be drawn to the Inquiry’s Recommendation 20.
 The governing bodies’ attention will also be drawn to Recommendation 23
 which might be influenced by decisions upon Recommendation 20.




RECOMMENDATION1


21-    Closed circuit television should jbe introduced at League football
grounds in England and Wale?, and in the ?rn ®:.er Division in Scotland.
(Paragraph 6.5*0


Ine Football Trust has allocated £500,000 for the provision of CCT7 equipment
in League grounds during the 1925-%$ season.    Ins Trust’s attention, and
that of the Football Associations and th« Fco’
                                             :baii Leagues, will be drav:n
to this recommendation.




MISCELLANEOUS


RECOMMENDATIONS


3-    Early attention should be given by the; Home Office Directorate
of Telecommunications to consider the practicality of producing a more
suitable personal radio for the police.   (Paragraph 1 . 3 ' )


18.   Consideration should be given as hov best to deal with temporary
stands and marquees   (Paragraph 3-151)


24.   Consideration should be given to the design of a standard,
efficient perimeter fence, with proper exits.    (Paragraph 6.63)


Each of these will be studied as the Inquiry advises.       Recommendations
18 and 2*4 may best be taken forward in the context of the Inquiry's next
stage and when it turns to examine the Green Guide as a whole.
PROVISIONAL RECOMMENDATIONS


(To be reviewed in the Final Report)


1.     I am minded to recommend that in England and Wales the police should
be given the unfettered right of search before entry to football grounds by
statute.'   (Paragraph 3-^1)


2.     I am m i n d e d   to recommend that Section 10 of the Fire Precautions Act 1971
should be amended with a view to giving the Fire Authority power in cases other
than those which are regarded as wholly exceptional        (Paragraph 3.61)


3.     Linked with the above, I am         Rinded to recommend that consideration
should be given to introducing legislation giving powers for the Fire Authority
to apply to the High Court for an injunction (or to the Court of Session for
an interdict in Scotland) under Section 3.0 of the Fire Precautions Act 1971.
(Paragraph 3-61)


4.     I am minded        to recommend that Section 10 of the Safety at Sports Grounds
Act 1975 should be amended in like manner to Section 10 of the Fire Precautions
Act 1971 (see Provisional Recommendations 2 and 3) and an application to the
High Court for an injunction (cr to the Court of Session for an interdict in
Scotland) should be an alternative remedy.        (Paragraph 3-76)


5.     I am minded to recommend that the Secretary of State should exercise his
powers to designate all sports grounds, whatever their size to include indoor
as well as outdoor activities.       (Paragraph 3.1^5)


6.     I am minded to recommend immediate designation of any ground
capable of holding over 5,000 spectators, to cover all sports grounds,
not merely football grounds.        (Paragraph 3.14b)


7.     I am minded to recommend that consideration should be given to
providing the police with additional powers of arrest under the
Public Order Act, 1936.       (Paragraph 6.66)


8.     I am minded to recommend that consideration should be given to
creating a specific offence of chanting obscene or racialist abuse
at a sports ground. (Paragraph 6.67)


These are noted and the Government will stand by to assist the
Inquiry in its further consideration of the matters.

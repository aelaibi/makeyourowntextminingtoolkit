                           states :
          1,      I was born on 16th February, 1939.
          2   .   I am a Qualified Ambulanceman and joined SYMAS in February,
                  1975.       I received no ambulance training before that date.
                  My   first year with SYMAS was a probationary period,                      and

                  included undertaking a two week basic training course in

                  Sheffield.        Thereafter, I attended Markfield for a six week
                  residential       course.        I became   a Qualified Ambulanceman



      â€¢
                  after one year's service.             I have no paramedic training.

          3       I am based at Maltby Station, and was on duty on Saturday

                  15th April,       1989.        I was actually on the day shift.              I

                  specifically recall early on Saturday afternoon receiving a
                  call from Control asking my driver,                                   , and I

                  to stand by on a house fire on Balby Road in Doncaster.                      I

                  would say that the time was between 1430 and 1450.                    Control

                  then informed us that we were no longer required in relation

                  to this house fire, and were requested to return to Maltby

                  Station.      It was about 1510 when we were approaching Maltby

                  Station,    at which point in time              I telephoned Control to

                  inform     them    that   we    had   returned    to   base.         We   were

                  immediately       requested      to   proceed    directly      to   Sheffield
                  Wednesday Football ground,            and that an incident had taken

                  place which had caused a large number of injuries.                          We

                  travelled to the football ground immediately on emergency.

                  As we were approaching the football ground, we were informed
                  by Control to make our way over to the gymnasium,                     at the

                  Penistone Road end of the ground.               I directed                   ~|




3 0   /
     on the quickest route to the ground, which was via Bawtry
     Road,    Brightside     Lane,   up    Well   Street    and    Herries   Road
     South.       As our vehicle was approaching the ground along

     Herries Road, a large number of supporters were making their

     way out of the ground up along Herries Road.                       I could

     clearly see that large numbers of the crowd looked very
     dazed and were crying.
4.   At the junction of Herries Road South with Penistone Road,

                      turned left on to Penistone Road,               travelled
     down approximately 50 yards and then turned 180 degrees back

     up the other side of Herries Road,              a manoeuvre which was

     carried out under police directions.             At the first entrance

     to the ground, which is marked A on the attached plan, our

     vehicle was brought to a standstill.                  At this point, the
     volume of traffic and spectators was far too heavy to enable

     us to manoeuvre along Penistone Road.                  I recall a police

     officer informing me at this point in time that there were
     some injured people behind the South Stand.                                    ]

     drove down along the perimeter road inside the ground behind

     the South Stand.         When we reached the Owl Club which is

     marked B on the attached plan, we were stopped by a number

     of fans who were helping one casualty.                 This casualty was
     holding   his   chest    and    was   clearly   having       difficulty   in

     breathing.      I would say that the time was approximately

     1535.                     1 stopped the vehicle and I immediately

     got out to help the casualty into the rear of the ambulance.

      I asked the casualty if he wanted              to lay down,        but he
replied that he was able to sit up.                   I put him on an oxygen
mask to help him with his breathing.                   I then got out of the

vehicle and a few yards away I noticed a police officer

carrying out cardiac massage on a casualty on the floor,

situate     at point C on         the   attached       plan.       The     police

officer asked me if we had a suction unit as the casualty

had swallowed his own vomit.                 I took out the suction unit
from the ambulance vehicle,             and I aspirated the casualty
whilst                        gave    further cardiac massage.                  This
casualty was breathing very poorly indeed and his pulse was

extremely weak.           As a large number of people were milling

around     this   casualty,       I   made     the    decision   to       get   the

casualty into the ambulance and away to hospital as quickly

as possible, whilst there was a still a chance of saving his

life.       I took a cot out of the vehicle with the help of

some fans, helped load the casualty on to the cot and then
back into the ambulance where the cot was secured on its
brackets.

The     police    officer    assisting         then    requested      a    police

motorcyclist to give us an escort to the Northern General

Hospital.         It was at this point that I noticed that the
casualty to whom I had provided the oxygen mask had actually
left the vehicle.          I did not see this casualty again.

                   turned the vehicle            around and we left the

ground at the point where we had entered, with the police

escort in front.          We turned left on to Penistone Road, and

I   understand     that     the   police       directed   us   across      on    to


                                        2 iS
Herries Road South up towards the Northern General                       Hospital.

The    police   officer who had          assisted        with    the     stretcher

patient had     got ontoour vehicle, and we were both working
on the patient in an effort to keep him alive.                                 I was

carrying out cardiac massage, whilst the police officer was

aspirating the patient.             I specifically recall that at the
top    of   Herries       Road,    just       past   the        Moonshine       Lane

roundabout,     that      the     patient's     colour          had    started    to

deteriorate, and I could not find a pulse beat.                            I would
say that we arrived at Northern General Hospital, Casualty

Department,     no       more    than    five    minutes         after    leaving

Hillsborough,    where we were immediately met by a medical
team    including    a    female    doctor      in   a    red    dress.          She

immediately     examined the stretcher patient,                  and     certified
the patient as dead.

_____________ and I were told to take the fatality into the
plaster room inside the Northern General Hospital which was

being used as a the temporary mortuary.                         As we took the
fatality into the plaster room, I noticed five or six other

deceased     already      laid    in    the    plaster      room       which   were

uncovered.      After laying out our fatality on to the floor

between two hospital cots,                                 and I returned to

our vehicle where we radioed Control.                     We were instructed

to return to Hillsborough, to the gymnasium.                          We took the

police officer who had accompanied us up to Northern General

Hospital, back to Hillsborough.               As we reached the junction

of Herries Road South and Penistone Road, we were guided on
to Penistone Road by a number of police officers, and joined

a queue of ambulances which were waiting to gain access into

the ground.          After about 15 minutes,          and before entering

the    ground,     Mr   David    Jones    instructed   us   to   go   to   the
Herries Road Bus Depot and standby with a number of other
vehicles.          When we arrived at the Bus Depot,             I estimate

that another 15 or 16 vehicles were already present,                       and

after we had parked a number of other vehicles arrived soon

afterwards.          At approximately 1730,          Station Officer Paul
Eason briefed all ambulance crews waiting at the Bus Depot.
 The ambulance crews who had driven up from the Nottingham,

Derbyshire and West Yorkshire areas were thanked for their

assistance,        and were informed that they could go back to

their own base.            At the same time,          the SYMAS afternoon

crews were advised that they could go back to their own
Stations.

Mr Eason held back five crews,              including ours, at the Bus

Depot and we were then instructed to drive to the gymnasium

area inside Hillsborough.                We entered the ground at the

gate marked D on the attached plan and parked the vehicle

along with the other four crews.                  After a short period of

time, Station Officer Eason or Roger Morley requested

             and    I to attend the mortuary at Northern General

Hospital,     I believe on the instructions of Professor Usher

who is the Senior Pathologist for the South Yorkshire Area.

We    were   instructed     to    bring    back    twelve   bodies    to   the

gymnasium, which was being used as the temporary mortuary at
the ground.              It was envisaged that four crews would each
take three bodies back to the gymnasium.                            When we arrived

at the Northern General Hospital,                      the fatalities were not

inside body bags, rather they were all wrapped in blankets.
After     collecting       the    bodies       and    loading      them    on    to our

ambulance,                              and I took them straight to the
gymnasium at Hillsborough.

At approximately 2000                                      and I were then sent

back to the Northern General Hospital in order to collect a

ten year old fatality,             and to bring the body back to the
ground.           I would say that we arrived back at the ground

with the body at approximately 2100 just as the first bus

load    of    relatives          and    friends        were       arriving       at    the
gymnasium,        presumably       to    identify          the    dead.         Station

Officer                     helped      me     to    take    the    body     into      the

gymnasium whilst ______________ parked the ambulance in the
car park just outside.                  I then re-joined                                1

Shortly afterwards,           one of the five crews was then stood
down to its own Station, leaving four crews at the ground.

After   the       relatives      had    identified          the    bodies,      we    were

instructed to take the bodies to the Medico Legal Centre in

Sheffield.         All bodies were now in body bags, and on each

journey      to    the    Medico       Legal    Centre, three             bodies      were

carried, together with one police officer for each body.                                 I

believe      we    made    six    journeys          down    to    the   Medico       Legal
Centre, and transported 18 bodies from the gymnasium.                                 The

last journey was made at approximately 0200 on Sunday 16th
     April,    1989,      and    on   this   particular       journey,   we    took    a

     member of staff from Rotherham in our vehicle so that we

     could drop him off at his own base.                    On leaving the Medico

     Legal Centre in Sheffield, we also gave a lift to a police

     officer       to    Hellaby,      which     was   on    our   route      back    to
     Rotherham.          I would say we arrived at Rotherham Station at

     approximately 0240, and at Maltby Station at approximately

     0250.                             and I began to clean our equipment,

     but     the   night    crew      informed    us   that    they   would     finish

     cleaning the equipment and told us to go home.                      I would say
     that                        and I signed off at
     3 a.m., and we both went home.


Dated this              day of          1989.

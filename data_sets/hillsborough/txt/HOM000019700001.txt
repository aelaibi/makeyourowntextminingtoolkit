LORD JUSTICE TAYLOR'S VISITS TO SCOTLAND
Thanks for your letter of 27 September, On the basis of that and our
telephone conversations In recent days, I attach a draft programme for
the 14 October visit. I will be meeting Rangers FC people on a separate
issue on 4 October and I have made arrangements with them to go
through the finer details of the visit to Ibrox then. But for the moment,
can I say that Rangers are genuinely pleased that Lord Justice Taylor
wishes to visit their ground, that they and the Strathclyde Police will be
happy to show his Lordship round all of the facilities, as he wishes, and
that, having seen Ibrox myself in recent days, I am sure that the visit
on 14 October will be extremely interesting, particularly those aspects
concerning stewarding, computer control of turnstiles and the
predominance of seating facilities.
You may also wish to mention to Lord Justice Taylor that my Permanent
Secretary, Mr Russell Hillhouse, will be attending the match as a guest of
Rangers FC, Mr Hillhouse has in fact had a long-outstanding Invitation
from the club to attend a match at his convenience, and Mr Hillhouse
feels that it would be particularly opportune for him to attend this match,
in order to gain an Impression of how the match is policed and some of
the behind the scenes arrangements at such a major match. In other
words, Mr Hillhouse would not propose to accompany Lord Justice Taylor
on all aspects of his visit to Ibrox and would very much be content to
watch the match itself after seeing something of the pre-match
preparations etc.
I would welcome early confirmation that his Lordship is content with the
attached programme.
As regards the 26-28 October visit, I have yet to finalise details, but the
programme so far is shaping up quite well. The picture looks like a late
flight on 28 October, staying overnight in Glasgow. Mr Ernie Walker the
Secretary of the Scottish Football Association is undoubtedly a person
whom Lord Justice Taylor should meet if at all possible. Mr Walker is
flying out to Stockholm early on 27 October, so the only possibility for a
meeting with Lord Justice Taylor would be over dinner on the evening of
the 26th. I have mentioned this possibility to the Strathclyde Police, who
have suggested that their Chief Constable, Mr Sloan, puts on a small
dinner for Lord Justice Taylor. The Police are due to come back to me
in the next few days but, if that proposal falls through, I would expect

E0201602.109                        1.
Mr Walker to be available himself for a private          dinner with Lord
Justice Taylor (at SFA expense, of course).
On 27 October, I suggest that Lord Justice Taylor base himself at
Alhambra House, our office in Waterloo Street, Glasgow for either a
single, or a series of meetings with the Scottish Football League, the
Association of Chief Police Officers (Scotland) and the Fire and Ambulance
Authorities   in    Scotland.     This    session   could   be   completed
9000hrs-1300hrs. After a light lunch, Lord Justice Taylor could then
depart for a tour of Hampden Park (1345-1530) followed by a tour of
Celtic Park (1545-1715), The arrangements for dinner that evening are
somewhat uncertain as yet, and It may be that, if the Chief Constable is
unavailable on the 26th, he may wish to host a small gathering on the
evening of the 27th,
The Secretary of St Johnstone FC has confirmed that the club would be
delighted if Lord Justice Taylor was able to visit their ground in Perth.
This would involve a departure from Glasgow at 9000hrs for a tour of
Mcdlarmid Park from 1000-1100 approximately.          This ground has a
capacity of about 10,000 all-seated and was completed in August this
year. It was constructed by developer's money after the Club had sold
their previous elderly ground for the construction of a supermarket. It
Is an e x c e lle n t example of a less obvious way to modernise facilities,
incidentally, crowds have Increased markedly since the new ground was
opened and the Club is thriving at the top of the Scottish First Division.
The Scottish Rugby Union would be delighted to have Lord Justice Taylor
as their guest for the Scotland versus FIJI match and his party would, of
course, be invited for the pre-match lunch. You may wish to bring to
Lord Justice Taylor’s attention the fact that Her Royal Highness the
Princess Royal will also be attending, as will the President of Fiji,
together with Mr Michael Forsyth MP, Minister with responsibility for sport
in Scotland. It is also possible that the Prime Minister of Fiji, and my
Secretary of State will also attend.Therefore, the security arrangements at
the ground that day may be slightly different to that for a more normal
major fixture. Having said that, I have no doubt that it would still be
possible for Lord Justice Taylor to examine closely the configuration of
the ground and the arrangements made for the handling of a major rugby
crowd at Murray field.
I will contact you as soon as possible on the finer details of the
26-18 October visit.

                   barriers         which       blocked          off     the      r o a d at    Leppings            Lane     at   its     junction

                   with Bickerton               Road,          this    measure        preventing                 football     fans       from

                   wpalking        down      B i c k e r ton R o a d      and      possibly          causing         distress        to    the,

                   residents          along         that       stretch       of    road.

                   W h i 1st m a n n i n g      the       barriers,          I witnessed             very         large     numbers       of y o u t h s

                   going      to    the      match,           females     included,            the     majority           of w h i c h    seemed

                   good     humoured           and       w ell   behaved,          however        amongst           the     majority       of    the

                   people        were       youths        who    I would          consider        as       * idiots*        and   possible

                   trouble         causers,             again    a good        proportion            of      the    large     gathering          of

             t1    youths        were       drinking           either     b eer     or    l a ger \f r o m / c a n s ,       some    I saw w e r e

                   carrying         plastic             carrier       bags     full      of    what       must      have? b e e n    cans       of    til

Throughout               my    duty        an    the    barrier          f r o m -1 100-1505             hours       although           the

people         going          to t he m a t c h were; r e a s o n a b l y w el l                    behaved,           certain

a n d Sgt.          Wilson,             but     because       of    the      continuous             stream        of    people

walking         by       the       particular           individuals              could        not     be    identified.

Again      whilst             on d u t y at the b a r r i e r s at a b o u t                       1445 h o u r s        I envisaged

th e     match       being          delayed           for    say    15 m i n u t e s         due    to     the    s ti l l      l a rge

amount         of    people             walking        by ma       along        Leppings           Lane,      I clearly            saw

groups         of y o u t h s           sat     on    the    wall      to    gardens          opposite           me,    not

attempting               to    walk        to    the g r o u n d but j us t              sat       dirnking          out     of    cans          of

b e er    or    lager,,             I understand              th a t     the     match        was    an all          ticket        affair,'

evidently Liverpool                           and     Notts       ForeaZsupporters                    did     not      heed       the.

information               as       1 saw and           heard/continuous                  youths          shouting          and asking

for      ' s pa r e s ’ those              s p a re v i s i n g     tickets         to       qet in the           ground.-

At     approximately                    150d--1505 h o u r s           I could          he a r     the     crowd       within          the

ground         shouting             and       cheering        as    the      match       got       under      way,       I was         ve r y

surprised            at       this       due     to    the    s t i ll      large       amount        of    supporters             st ill

walking         to       the       gates.            Between .this time,                 perhaps           nearer       to      1505 hour

I could         n ea r        on S g t.         Wils.on's r ad i o           that       there       was     s o me     s or t     of

disturbance               in       the     West       Stand,       however,         no m a t t e r         how    intently             we

both      tried          to    listen           to    the    transmission               it wa s      very        incoherent,,                I

did not k n o w w h a t wa s                     happening          although            I made       out      from      the       message

that      all       available              officers          were      re q i u ^ e d    in      the g r o u n d ,         I then made

my     w a y with Sgt.                  WiYL so n     to the                    where        1 sa w a h u g e          amount          of

people         from       the       gate's s t r e t c m n g           b ac k    towards           Vere     Lane.          I estimated

the      crowd       to       be    the       full w i d t h of L e p p i n g s L a n e              going        back       for

approximately                  75 y a r d s          this    is    only     an    approximation.

As     I attempted                 to    get     nearer       to    the     gate        at    the    Leppings           Lane       end       I

understood               that       officers           successfully              entered           the     ground,         at     this

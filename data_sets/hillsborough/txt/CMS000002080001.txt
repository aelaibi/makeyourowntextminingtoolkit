HILLSBOROUGH INQUIRY COSTS - FIS RETURNS


After detailed consultation with Mr Preston in G1 Division, we
have now submitted the second quarter FIS returns.      I thought you
might like to see how the picture      developing.


2.   On present estimates, we appear likely to spend in the
region of £930,000 during the current financial year.      This is
somewhat lower than our very first estimate of £1,177,000
(submitted to Fin Div 1 by G1 on 2 May) and our first quarter FIS
return of £1,150,000 submitted in July, but it matches closely
the provision of £900,000 set by the Treasury and reflected in Mr
Moriarty's note of 18 July to Alan Turney.


3.   On the whole, I think we should be pleased with our
forecasting.    Our original estimates have proved (to date)
surprisingly accurate.     The only sub-heads to show major changes
since the last FIS returns are office services (Stationary and
Printing), and Other Current Expenditure (General Expenses).         The
explanation for the former lies in HMSO information on precisely
which costs the Inquiry will bear (see explanatory note behind
FIS form).     For the latter, we have been able to give much more
accurate figures in the light of experience and bills actually
received.    That is reflected in the adjustment downwards of total
spend for the first three Quarters.     The fourth Quarter figure
has also been revised downward, although it remains slightly more
problematic in the light of uncertainty about future research
expenditure.     Nevertheless, there is sufficient leeway to cope
with most eventualities.


4.   One other matter, we have yet to confirm formally with G1
that the Home Office will not be required to defray the
Assessors' salary costs.     At some stage which shall need to
confirm the position.

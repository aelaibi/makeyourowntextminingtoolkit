           Dear Ms Firth,

  C ^ today

           I refer to our telephone conversation earlier this we«.k and
           confirm, that I have now received copies of the article
           appearing iu the edition of Today published on 30th January
           last together with a. copy of the final Report of Lord Justice
           Taylor into the Hi 1.1sborough Stadium disaster . l set out my
           comments below.

           1.                   Lord Justice Taylor* s; Rep o rt

                                The article appearing in Today purports to set out Lord
                                Justice Taylor's findings.   In this regard, the article
                                concentrates principally on. Chapter 1 of the Report -which
                                levels criticism at both the Football Association and The
                                Football League. That criticism is contained mainly in
                                paragraphs SI and S2 under the heading "Poor Leadership"
                                and can be summarised as follows

  ( )                           (a I           The Administration (including The Football Leaque)
                                              'has not taken a lead in securing reasonable safety
                                               and comfort fo.r the spectators and in enforcing
                                               good behaviour*

                                (b)             The Football Association and The Football League
                                                have not seen it as thoir duty to oHf«r guidance t:o
                                                clubs on safety m atte r s.

                                                have been much concerned to avoid pitch invasions
                                                because they interfere with the smooth progress of
                                                the fixture list and incur criticism and penalties                                                                            H*ui£Knna

             2.       The Article iij_ Today

                    ■The foamier headline on the front page of the editi on of
                    Today published on 30th January last reads "Treated Like
                  . Dirt" and contains a' photograph of victims           of the
                    Hillsborough Stadium disaster.      A separate ha ad line* at
                    the top of the front page reads HCondemnedx the football
                    bosses w h o _put fans in a living and dying hell". Against
                    that headline appears, inter al i a , a photograph of the
                    President of The Football League, Mr Pox with the caption
                    "Guilty, League Chief fox".      in our view,, this headline
                    is d«famatory and is actionable both by The Football
                    league and by Mr Fox.      The imputation is that The
                    football League (and its President) have been found
                    guilty by Lord Justice Taylor of. causing the in-fury and
                    death of supporters at the Hillsborough‘stadium’on” lSth
                    April 1989. Any imputation which m a y ‘tend to lower: a.
                    person, in the estimation of right thinking members of
                    society or to expose that person to hatred, contempt nr
                    ridicule is defamatory arid a c t i o n a b l e T h e common
                    defences to defamation ace justification or truth, honest
                    expression of opinion on a matter of public interest and
                    fair comment*     There- are also defences of absolute or
                    qualified privilege.      It seems unlikely that any of these
                    defences would succeed at trial although they are, of
                    course, likely to be raised.

                      There are other references to The Football League in the
                      article which on balance we also regard as defamatory
                      although these 'statements are less clear cut. For
                      example

                      (i)         It is stated in the left-hand column on the front
                                  page in lines 14 to 20 that;-

                                        ’"Lord Justice Taylor pinned the blams on The
                                        Football Association, The Football League,
                                        the Directors of the big clubs and players.
                                        They encouraged hooliganism and the'"cult of
                                        excessive drinking* by their complacency and
                                        mismanagement of -the soccer industry."

                                  There is n o .suggestion in the Report that The
                                  Football League "encouraged” hooliganism and
                                  excessive drinking although criticism is levelled
                                  at the Football League-for failing to take a lead
                                  in enforcing good behaviour.

                             The Report does not in fact draw this conclusion,
                             nor does it single out Mt Fox for criticism.
                             However, it is (as 1 have said-above) critical of
                             The Football Leagu® in a number of respects.
  O                 The re are numerous other passages in the article which
                    are £al««t and/or materially inaccurate and which we also
                    regard as defamatory. However, the passages in .question
                    are principally directed at individual Club Chairmen and
                    would not be actionable by- The Football league. I do not
                    propose to deal with these passages in detail but set out
                    briefly below some examplesi­

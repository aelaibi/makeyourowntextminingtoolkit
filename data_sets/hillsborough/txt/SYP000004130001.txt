               I am                    and I live at the above address.



               At approximately 1420 hrs on Saturday 15th April,          1989 <150589)

               I was at home which is

                                                                      When I was looking

               through the bedroom window of my house I could see hundreds of

               Liverpool    football    club fans walking along Leppings Ln in the

               direction of the ground.



               I can honestly say that the majority of the fans were either drinking

               from beer cans or carrying       packs of four beers   in their hands.



               Upon looking directly down from the bedroom window I could also see
                                                                               PAGE
                                                                               S413

about 30 youths sitting on my wall

                         I could see that the majority of those youths

were drinking from beer cans a l s o .      However    I must     point out that

those youths did not appear to be drunk and were not causing any

trouble.



At approximately 1445 hrs the same day I left my house to visit my

Mom who lives in Langley     in S h e f f i e l d , as I left,   the youths were

still sitting on my wall     drinking.      As I had to cat ch a bus to my

M o m ’s house I walked to the bus stop whi ch is

             jther side of the football ground in Middlewood R d .

This meant   I had to walk   passed the ground,        as I was walking      past   it

I could see there was a large       crowd of y o u t hs queueing to get into

the ground but I d i d n ’t see if they were drinking or not,            however,

as I approached the garage on the right just passed the ground I

could see about 40 y ouths sitting on the g r a s s , I also noticed that

some of them were drinking from beer cans.



I then caught my bus which travelled back past the ground,                this was

at about £.55 pm (1455 h r s ), where I could see that the fans appeared

to be orderly and I c o uldn’t hear any singing and cheering.



About half a mile past the ground I saw about 60 - 70 youths sitting

on a grassed area the majority of which had packs of 4 beers                 in their

hands,   this would have been nearly 3pm        (1500 hrs) by then, and they

d i d n ’t appear to want to go to the football ground,           however,   they

were wearing scarves and hats      coloured red and white.



Later that day I heard on the TV of the tragedy at Hillsborough due

to the crowds.
                                                                                     PAGE   3
                                                                                     S413



           I think that if the fans had arrived at the ground earlier and queued

           as normal this might not have happened,   however,   t h a t ’s only my

           opinion.




                                                                                 SIGNED

    ^    were drinking from beer cans also.            However I must point out that

         those youths did not appear to be drunk and were not causing any

         trouble.

         At approximately '144!=Nhrs the same day I left my house to visit

         Horn who lives in Longley^Vn sYveffield, as I left, the youths were

         still sitting on my wall          drinking.   As I h*d to catch a

         Mam's house I walked to the bus stop

                the other side of the football ground in Middlewood R d .

a        This meant I had to walk passed the ground, as I was walking past it.

         I could s t ^ t h e r e was a large crowd of youths queueing to get into

         the ground b u t \ d i d n ' t   see if they were drinking or not, however,

         as I approached the\garage on the right just passed the ground I

         could see 'about 40 yoirbtqs sitting on the grass,        I also noticed that

         some of them were drinking from beer cans.



          I then caught my bus which travelled back past the ground, this was

          at abotR^g.jS pm (14-55 h r s ), where I could see that the fans appeared

          to be orderly and 1 couldn’t hear any singing and cheering.



          About hai>xa mile past the ground I saw about 60 - 70 youths sitting

          on a g rassed>a ^ a    ^he majority of *hich had packs of 4 beers in their          ;

          hands, this would nave been nearly 3pm (1500 hrs) by then, and they

          did n ’t appear to want to go to the football ground, however*         they

          were wearing scarves and hats coloured red and white.

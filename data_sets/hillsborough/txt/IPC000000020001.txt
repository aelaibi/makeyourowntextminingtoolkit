 NOTE TO EDITORS
 The Police Complaints Authority, set up under the Police and Criminal
 Evidence Act 1984 , is an independent body whose purpose is to see that
 whenever a complaint.is made about the conduct of a police officer it
 is dealt with thoroughly and fairly. The Authority supervises investigations
 into the most serious complaints and considers the report of every
 investigation into a complaint against a police officer whether or not it
 was supervised.

being       got        out       of    the       pen       through             it.           Thera       was       by       now    a    wall          of

people          on     top       of    the       front             fencing          pulling             people          out .

The    pressure                 in    the       crowd          slowly          started             to    ease       avid      I managed                to       move

forward.               I got          to    within             about       1G-12             feet       from       the       front       fencing                when

    sameone          reached           down          to    me       from       on       to p of         the    f ence .            I    reacI"!ed              up

and    grabbed              his       hand       but       because             I was          still       pinned             in    I    c o u l d n ’t          p ul l

myself          out,.           Just       then       a    man          behind          me    told       ms    to       put       my    foot          on       his

knee       to    get        o ut.          He    seemed             to    be    in a          crouching             position             so       1 did

just       that        and       managed             to    raise          myself             up    out    of       the       crowd,,             X reached

out    and       grabbed              the       top       of       the    fencing             to    steady          myself.,             From          here          I

looked          down        and       to    my       left          where       I saw          a    man    lying             o n t he     f 1o o r at                tne

front       of       the        pen.        It       was       a    white       male,             about       25    yrs       o ld,      shoulder

length          da rk       c u r 1y       hair.           hie      had    no       sh irt         on

                                      He    was       very          pale       and          lifeless          ana       I knew          that          he       was

aead

                                                                                                                                                 c row d „           I

could       see        another             man       lying          on    the       floor          with       another             man    over          him

giving          him       mouth        to       mouth.              It    was       a       white       man,       youngish             with          ginger

ha i r .        H is      shirt        was       also          off.        Again             I got       the       impression                that          this

man    was       also           dead.           There          was       still          a    crush       in    the          pen    and       I    could             see

the    agony           on       p e o p l e ’s       faces          as    they          tried       to    push          back.

I    had    no       energy           left       and       was          coughing             badly.           I struggled                off          the

fence       onto          the        pitch.           I    lay          down    on          the    pitch       for          several          minutes,

there       were          many        other          people          who       had          got    onto       the       pitch          but       all       I

remember             is     a    scene          of    confusion.                    I got          up    after          a    while       and          remember

seeing          people           lying          down,          scattered                all       over    the       goal          area.           I    could

see    that          other           fans       were       using          advertising                   boards          to     carry         injured

fans       away        to       safety.

MARTIN LONG

POLICE CONSTABLE 2739




At 8.30 a.m.             on    Saturday         15 April 1989,       I was on duty            in uniform at

Doncaster Police               Station in company with other Officers.

At    9-00     a.m.       on     the     same     date,      we   were     conveyed     to      Hillsborough

Football Ground to perform duties in respect of the Liverpool -v- Notts

Forest semi-final football match.

On    arrival       at    the    ground      we    attended a briefing          of all Officers            from

where    I was        deployed under supervision of Police                      Sergeant          Hodgetts    to

commence duty on Middlewood Road.

I was paired             to work with Policewoman Johnson                    and we were          informed to

perform        foot       patrol       along      Middlewood       Road     from    the      junction      with

Leppings Lane to the junction with Croft Road (our brief was to prevent

football fans from looting any shops).

Police      Constable          Johnson       and myself       patrolled      one    side     of    the   street

from approximately 11.15 a.m.                      onwards.        Throughout       this   time there was

a steady       and       constant       flow of Liverpool           fans    walking     in the direction

of the       city     centre.          The   fans,   for     the most,       were   in a good mood and

were well       behaved,             although     they were       somewhat    excitable.           However,    I

did     see     a     lot      of     fans      carrying four       packs     and   sixpacks        whilst

constantly          asking       Police      Constable Johnson and myself               the       whereabouts

of    the     nearest         pub.     The    rest   of    the morning        carried      on     in the same

vein but with more people asking the same question.

At approximately 2 o'clock,                       I recall looking at my watch and saying to

Police Constable                Johnson      " W e ’ll get    a cup of tea soon because all the
fans    will        be    making       their       way into       the     ground to     get    the    atmosphere

before the game starts".

It   was     about       this      time     when      we   were    approached         by   one   of     the     local

residents who informed us that fans were parking in the street and then

peeing up the sides of the houses.

As kick off time neared I was surprised to see that Liverpool fans were

still on the street and some were arriving off SYPTE buses with cans of

drinks, which were discarded when empty.

There        was    no    trouble         on     the       street       and     we continued          to      patrol

Middlewood Road where we later liaised with Police Sergeant Hodgetts at

the junction with Leppings Lane.

We were about to walk back along Middlewood Road when we were informed

that    we    had been directed                to attend at the ground.                    When I asked what

for, somebody said that there was fighting.

When    we    arrived         at    the   Leppings         Lane    end of       the    ground,       there      was    a

large      crowd of Liverpool                fans      outside      the     gates,     obviously       trying         to

get in, but being told by other Officers that they couldn't go in.

I remember          telling one youth                 to get      back and hewas very agitated and

produced a          ticket shouting " I ’ve paid good money for this".                                He carried

on shouting and had to be pushed back, as did others.

At   this        stage    I     had    no      idea    what     had     happened       other     than      we    were

required to stay at the gate.

Police       Constable        Johnson        and myself         then      saw    an   ambulance       inside      the

gates      but     outside      the ground and a $>Qdy was                      lying at      the side of         it.

My   first       thought      was     that     the Q @ d y     appeared to be dead,              but I thought

”No it can't be".

I then realised that people                      seemed to be coming out of the ground in a

confused         state,       others      were     distressed         and     others    were     shouting        "You




                                )
»                                                                                                                      Re^47t
«

    should be in there".

    At    this    point       I    still    was not       aware      of what       had    happened       although       it

    was    obvious          that    something     serious            had    taken       place.      I    then    looked

    across       to    the    access       road   running           around     the      ground     and   I   saw     some

    bodies       which       were    obviously       dead,          layed    out     on    the     ground    directly

    opposite          the    gate    which    gave    access          to    the    Leppings      Lane    end    of     the

    stadium.

    A Senior Officer then instructed myself to stand with other Officers in

    front    of       the    bodies    to    prevent       fans      leaving       the    ground being          able    to

    see them.

    By    this    time       the    fire    brigade       had       attended      the     ground    and ambulances

    were coming and going.

    I was    then       deployed      with other Officers                   out    onto Leppings Lane with a

    brief to keep fans moving away from the ground.

    On our return to the ground I attended a debriefing                                      from where I had a

    meal    at    Ciaywheels          Lane    before       returning         to    Doncaster        Police      Station

    and completing my tour of duty at 7-^5 a.m.

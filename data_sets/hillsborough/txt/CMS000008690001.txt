Dear

Thank you for your letter of 9 April to Mr
Moynihan which has been passed to this
department in view of our responsibilities for
safety at sports grounds.

I am sorry that we are unable to send you a
copy of the recommendation contained in Lord
Justice Taylor's Final Report on the
Hillsborough Stadium Disaster. However, the
Report is available from Her Majesty's
Stationery Office bookshops (code no. ISBN 0
10 109622 4) at £10.50. The nearest HMSO is
at 49 High Holborn, LONDON, WC1V 6HB (01 2V1
5656).

I hope this information is of use to you.

                                    Yours sincerely



                                    MR S BIBLE

Dear S i r ,
          I am an "A" Level student who,       as an integral part of my
course,     is    considering comparing the- various facilities offered
to football supporters and also the various stadia particularly
in  the London area.         I would be extremely grateful if you     could
help me.
        My     survey    will concentrate on the facilities offered by
the  various       stadia and how these are likely to    change    in   the
future,      I would     therefore be grateful if you could send me       a
copy/synopsis       of   the   recommendations contained in   the Taylor
report on the Hillsborough disaster.         As a football fan myself     I
care passionately         about the future of the game and I would be
particularly       grateful    if you could spare any  of your valuable
time to put your views on paper,.
      If you have         any   further comments I would be      extremely
grateful       if    you     could   include   them    in your      prompt
reply (preferably by the 23 of this month).
      I enclose a stamp in order to subsidise your postage costs,
and I wait in anticipation of your prompt reply.
     Thank you for your most kind assistance.
     YoUrs faithfully,

At 11.20am                (1120)   tftat day,      togethe r with the 3 off infers I commenced

my duty in the Aar                  pa r k, towards the rear of th^^Sj/uth stand the W e s %

stand.

Bar r i ers were placed across the c a r p a r k ,/be 1ow gate 22,                 from the wall

of the South stand to the boundary wal1/adjacent to the river.

Further     bar r iers had also been placed across the car park e n t r a n c e , at

Leppings Ln.                The area between the barriers was a ’sterile'              area, were

television equipment and vehicles were                        located.     Nottingham Forest

suporters were entering the ground below the barriers at the South

s t a n d , whilst Liverpool                   supporters were entering the ground above the

barriers at the Leppings Ln end of the                        car park.    A further serial

of officers were deputed to cover both these barriers.                           Supporters

attending at the wrong end of the ground we re adv ised to w a 1k around

the ground,               to the correct e n t ra nc e.      However,    adults accompanied by

young children,                old people and women, were escorted through the

’ster ile * area.

Dur i ng the following hours                      I remained inside the    ’sterile'   area

together with the other officers on that duty.                            I had 4 v/ew of both

barr iers and observed suporters of both teams ente r ing the ground

without     incident.

I realised a build up of supporters at the Leppings Ln end of the
                                                                                            ^375

1084 HQDtjjg/TT who was at the barrier at the rear of the South stand.

Chief     Inspector McKAY walked backed towards ,the jfeppings Ln end and as

he passed me he advised me to watch the s V t u a t y S n on the barrier at

the Leppings A.n end a nd if there w e r ^ j m y               probi ems to attend the re to

give support to officers on that duty.                       Not long afterwards       it became

obvious       ynat there was a considerable ^build up of supporters at that

end.      Unattended there with PC CRVUG1E and PC F A I ^ C L Q U G H .               The

officers on the bar r ier were not               i n any parjtict/lar difficulties but

the p o t e n t i a l   was obvious owing to the            la/ge numbers of supporters.

In retrospect the time would have b e e n jE.3 0 pm (1430)                  o r just

thereaf t e r .
             The entrance to the c a r p a r k up to the bar r ie r s was full
                                S o !
to heaving with pe o p l e . The cr.owd/ were onto Leppinqs Ln and onto the

bri d g e .    It did not appear that Vl/tey were              reducing or getting          into the

ground.        On several     occasions h-Qrses moved from t i y 4 sterile area

into the crowd in order to force them back.                       Thi©^ were unable to do

so.     At the barrier women and young               children were allowed around the

barrier because they M e r e          distressed,      owing to the large numbers of
                                                                        Vab9i
supporters unable t# enter the ground.                       I noticed the concertina doors

being o pened by po/i ce o ff ic er s.            The gate we re open for /bout 5-10

minutes at very n»ximum.               (In retrospect the time would have been 3-7

minutes.)         When/the build up of supporters whi ch had ^ e e n              in the

entrance to \tijf car park had entered the ground the/concertina doors

were pulled closed by o f fi c er s.            This allowed the#nounted Se ct ion

present to move the supporters back towards Le pip ngs Ln and ch anne1

them towards the turnstiles.                The conce rt i na d/ors were open about .2

f eet and I saw supporters entering by showing^ tickets.                        I spoke to PC

CRAIGIE about the doors being opened.                       (N o V i N POCKET BOOK*    - PC

CRAIGIE wondered^how many weapons had been taken into the ground by
supporters - I was relieved that the doors had been opened as I

believed there would have been serious        injures had they remained

closed.     ALSO NOT ENTERED IN MY NOTES - I allowed a man and his

daughter around the barrier to escape the crush,             she was crying whilst

he was upset and a n g r y . He stated that after    coming all this way they

were not going into the ground.        This was prior to the gates being

opened.     I am not sure if they entered the ground.)

The supporters now appeared to be under control, whilst they were

still   crowding back from the turnstiles onto Leppings Ln.              At this

point I remember checking my watch.         The time w         minutes     past 3 .    I

commented to another officer that the game must have started.                  After a

short period of time, a maximum of 2 minutes         I heard      ’All   police

personnel onto the pi tc h’ . 1 remember thinking there was no qualifying

sections,    serials or even available personnel.        Together with other

officers    I ran down the car parkland entered the South stand by the

gates   19-22.   As I went down the/ steps of the South stand I saw that

players were on the pitch.       Bej/ind the goal ,area of the West sta nd I

saw supporters on the playinjf area and on the tr a c k .          I thought

there had been a pitch     invasion.    As I ran through the Nottingham

Forset supporters they were shouting        ’get them o f f ’.

There were numerous    officers behind the goal area.            I went to

supporters walking around on the pitch in front of the South

enclosures of the West stand. Moved them to the edges of tn* Z ra c k

where they sat.     I remember wondering where we were going to place all

the Liverpool    spectators who were on the field when the match started,.

I spoke to 2 supporters who / e r e    on the pitch.     The^appeared        to have

broken f i nge r s . I took thafi to the St. Johns Ambujfence representat i ve

in the corner of the grjiund situated at the j j r o j r t   of the south

enclosure,   of the W s t a n d .    I told them to sit down unti 1 I got an

ambulance.

         My attention was drawn to a young hjfy ^ h o had difficulty breathing,                       he

         was on the pitch in that corner o f tl/e ground.             I placed him in           the

         recovery position on the pitch.           I examined him.      He complained about

         a pain in the region of his stomach.           His   legs and arms were alright.

         I had difficulty understanding him at first.              I then saw a hearing aid

         had come out ofcfTiis left ear.     He replaced       it and tolji me who he was:
         _______________ M_____________________________

         number            He said he was with his brother         11 years, who
                    iy                             ------
         was    in the crowd.  I told him to stay there ancf'that I would take care
                                                                             \



         of him until       I found his brother.

         I saw an ambulance drive around the track and stop at the rear of the

         goal    in front of the West stand.       I ran towards the ambulance           in order

         to bring    it to the    injured child.     I did not reach the ambulance.              I

         saw two men working on a boy aged 12-14 y e a r s , one was giving heart

         massage and the other mouth to mou th.          They were on the pitch,              to the

         South end,      of the centre South enclosure.        I asked if they knew what

         they were doing and if they required help.             The man giving mouth to

rk       mouth was "a 'do'ctor and the heart massage was a nurse/.                The doctor had
? V t\                                                     R # S * !S .
         dark hair and blood on his for eh ead .        The nurse waj6 wearing a white or

         light    coloured shirt.     The doctor   requested o x y q q ^ .       I ran to the

     ^   ambulance.        I remember thinking   it would be tragic          if someone died.

         As I approached the ambulance I stepped over a number of young men.

         One appeared to be dead. His       coat had been placed over his head.                  At

         my request the ambulance dr iv er *attendant gave me the oxygen bottle

         from the rear of the ambulance.           I ran back to the child.            The doctor

         removed the mask part of the apparatus and told me to turn it on.                       I

         turned the red knob to the       'on'   position until     it would not turn any

         further.     The doctor    placed the tube in the chi Ids mouth and gave him

         mouth to mouth.       He stopped and asked if I had turned it on.                1

         checked by reading the instructions on top of the red knob.                     It was

    turned on.       The doctor    looked at the dial at the front and said it was

    e m p t y . He then requested a mouth res uscitator.               I ran to the ambulance

    which was still behind the goal.                There were even more bodies          lying

    around.     They appeared to be dead.              The driver/attendant gave me two

    mouth pieces.       I ran back to the doctor. He used both mouth pieces but

    the child vomitted into them.               The doctor     continued to give mouth

    to mouth,    whilst shouting          'come on breth y o u r s e l f .    He started to

    breath.   Someone brought a stretcher.              I assited to carry the child to

    the ambulance a t the back of the goal.                  On arrival      there were S dead

    people in the back of the ambulance.                An Inspector shouted        "get the

    dead people out and the injured inside*.                   The two bodies were brought

    out of the ambulance.         I got into the ambulance on the offside trolley

    with the child.       I lay him in the recovery position on his right side,

    facing towards the outside of the ambulance.                    I could hear him

    breathing.       The doctor went to help others.              A man was placed onto the

    trolley on the nearside.              His son was with him.         The man was     conscious

    but had pains in the region of his               chest      I later discovered them to

    years and weighed about            18 stone.     He was semi-conscious.          I pulled

    him intothe ambulance sliding him onto the floor between the two

    trolleys.     I turned him on his right side in the recovery position.                           I

          child, who was in the recovery position.           The two had their backs

          against each other.        The   child I brought to the ambulance    remained i

          breathing upon arrival at the Norjfhern General Ho s p i t a l . The     child was

          arrival at Northern Genelal jfos pi tal        I accompanied him into casualty

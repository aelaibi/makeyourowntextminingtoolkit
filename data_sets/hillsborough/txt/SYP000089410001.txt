I d o n ’t know where           these    lads    lived.

At about      1100 am on the morn i n g of S a t u r d a y             15 April 89         (150489)       the

time was the driver

                    was also       irT^he mini         bus.     I joined them and we went a n d

collected                                from his home.

At about      1115 am we a r r i v e d at the home of                               in

                   from there we          picked up                      himself,         Tony OWEN,

I was    sitting                                   by                                  and

As    far as    I can recall G a r y CH U R C H was sitting towards                            the front of

the mini       bus     in a double seat on the drivers                     side,      I cannot          be sure

but    I think Tony OWE N was sitting                   next to him.

We tra v e l l e d direct        to S h e f f i e l d we e x p e r i e n c e d   n*T travel          d e l a y s , the

only time we stopped was at a Police                         road che/fk         in S h e f f i e l d not far

from the H i l l s b o r o u g h Stadium.            The Policjj/got on to the mini                        bus and

c hecked to make sure              there was       no al c o j/6 l    on- the vefu c l e . I think they

also    checked our t i c k e t s .

During    the journey            I had no direct          conversation w ith Gar y CHURCH,                         I

had not been introduced to                                     friends.          The a t m o s p h e r e     duri ng

the journey was            good everyone was happy and we were all                              engaged       in

general       conversation as a group.                  I cannot        comment       par t i c u l a r l y about

G a r y CH U R C H other     than he seemed to be a normal                       happy        lad,    who was

like the       rest of us        looking forward to a good day out.

We got    into S h e f f i e l d by the H i l l s b o r o u g h ground and were                      d i r ected       by

the Police        to   car park on a factory estate where we                           parked the m i n i ­

bus,    this    car    park was about           ten minu t e s walk awa y from the ground.

             towards    us. One of the other                lads said we w o u l d all meet either

            outside     the ground or back at the mini                       bus after        the game,     then myself

            an d                                     went off towards            the. N S t a n d turnstiles.

            happy.

            Prior    to our arrival           at the ground          I had seen the odd lads drinking

             cans of b e e r .       I had not seen any signs                 of disorder,            drunkeness    or

            fighting      during our walk            to the ground.

            We had not        received any escort or d irections                       from the Po l i c e to the

            s e a rching pj^iple as they went                through.         T here were a few other Police

s tand at about £.5 0         pm    (1450).

Whilst       entering    the ground        I had not seen any other                  gates open other

than the turnstile           gates,       I had not w i t n e s s e d any una u t h o r i s e d entry

to the ground.

I had not seen an y signs                of disorder            betw e e n entering     the ground and

finding      our seats.       I did not see anyone                  consuming alcohol          in the

ground.

M y s e l f and                                      were       seated    in the N S t a n d about      15

rows from the         rear an d roughly           in line w i t h the goal            line at the S p i o n

I did not see a barrier                 break    in pen number            three.

towards      the L i verpool       fans    in the terraces               behind the goal at the

Le p p i n g s Ln end of the g r o u n d .           I could see at that time                that the

centre of the terraces              behind the goal was very o v e r c r o w d e d.                  I could

see that there was a lot of swaying backwards an d forwards                                    in the

crowd a n d       I thought at the time that the                    people at the front             of the

terraces w o u l d be getting             crushed.          I            saw at this time that the

I   saw the referee stop the g a m e,

I   did not see at anyt i m e a n y t h i n g      that     I w o u l d describe         as a surge.

I   was not injured myself,          I did not witness                any deaths, I was not                 in a

position to assist an y of the dead or                      injured.

went    to a       Police s t a t i o n and reported him as a miss i n g                  person.       I

think    it was Tony O W E N who gave G a r y ’s details                  to the Police.

F r o m the Police       station we were        d i r ected to a nearby             community hall

where we were a d v i c e d to wait for news of Gary,                      at this hall we were

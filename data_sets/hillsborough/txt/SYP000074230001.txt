the serial was Supt Greenwood.                After the briefinmg   I consumed a

packed lunch.

The duties of serial feN^as to man barriers to be erected at the rear

of the South Stand at entrance E adjacent to the car park and barriers

from turnstiles A--G at Leppinqs L>a_ae end.               The area between the two

barriers was to remain sterile.                Liverpool   supporters were not to be

permitted entry.            The only persons allowed entry were to be authorised

persons and persons with tickets                   entrance E of the South Stand,          ie

numerous Liverpool           supporters who had be re-directed from that

location to the turnstiles at Leppings LAne,                 vias Penistone Road.

Most of the crowd appeared to be in goo^\humour with the exception of

a few who were atmoyed at having to walk q u i l K ^             long distance to

Leppings Lane.           At alvout ,2.40pm I became aware of aH a r g e      build up of

fans taking place at t h e \ s p p ^ n g s Lane turnstile area.          It was at that

time that 6 mounted officersNiere               let through our barrier to attend at

that     rea.        From our position we were able to see a small           proportion

of the crowd that had built up.                Whilst this was happening a large

number of Liverpool           fans were also being directed away the South stand

area to the Leppings Lane turnstiles via Penistone Road.                     A large

number of the fans were without tickets a nd on numerous occasions                     I

was aked by those fans to escort them through the turnstiles.

All    these requests were denied and the fans were told to leave the

arga.     A steady flow of Nottingham Forest supporters were still

ente r i n g W i e    g round after 3 p m .

At around 3 . 0 6 pm^t^ga 11 went out to the effect there was numerous

Liverpool       fans on the playing area and together with other officers                   I

went    into the ground via the gates next to turnstile E, through a

small standing area „onto the pitch.                Once on the playing area I saw

that there were o t h e ^ ^ f f i.cers       in attendence behind the Leppings

Lane goal.         A large number Taj1 fans were climbing over the security

fence and also             climbing up intoSjhe West stand from the terrace.

There were numerous fans on the pitch at that stage, although play was

still     in progress.         The central   terrace area was packed solid with

fans although there appeared to be ample room for fans                   in the pens

either side.              I went to the fences and realised that due to the amount

of people       in the centre       pen that fans were beYqa       crushed against the

f ro'rsl^J.e n c in g .    At this stage   I assisted fans trying to climb over the

fencing and onto the playing area.                  I then went   into vfrgpleft hand

side    pen to ass i st cX^he r fans.        As    I entered the pen I looked into the

centre pen ^nd saw numerous people of both sexes                   lying on the terrace

steps.       These        p¥qpie were unconcious most of which appeared to be

dead.      I stayed o n \ h e      terraces but after a short time was called onto

the field to form a corsj^n across                the playing area preventing fans

fighting Liverpool            fans running across the pitch to the spion kop.

I retired from duty at 7.30pm.

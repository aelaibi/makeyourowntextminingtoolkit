     D                Sir Cecil Clothier,
                      10 Great George Street,
                      London SW1                                        V f




                      I am writing to request that you institute an immediate enquiry
                      into the propriety of the remarks passed yesterday by Police
                      Officers of the South Yorkshire Police Force about the conduct of
                      fans at the FA Cup Semi-Final at Hillsborough on Saturday last.

                  Given that the Home Secretary had announced the judicial enquiry
                  into the disaster the day before, and the solicitor for 30 of the
                  victims' families had begun proceedings against the Chief
                  Constable and his Force these remarks should never have been
                  made.

                  By what right did Police Officers make statements calculated to
                  be prejudicial to the reputation of Liverpool football club and
                  its supporters, and which seem to be part of a smokescreen of
                  propaganda aimed at diverting attention from the truth.

                  Lord Denning once said that "be they ever so mighty they are not
                  mightier than the law". I trust that you will use your good
                  offices to examine how such statements came to be, and on whose
                  authority they were issued. Perhaps you would let me know what
                  guidlines exist.

                  What guidelines exist for the publication of statements once a
                  judicial enquiry has been announced.  I am copying this letter to
                  the Rt Hon Douglas Hurd MP .

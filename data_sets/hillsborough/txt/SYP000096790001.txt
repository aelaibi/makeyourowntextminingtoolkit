               Further information

               As this visit has been arranged at extremely short notice
               publicity is somewhat limited, therefore large crowds are not
               expected at either of the Hospitals. There are likely to be
               however large numbers of staff present and there will also be
               numerous members of the press. Extreme tact is needed therefore
               in dealing with these persons.    In the event of either serial
               anticipating difficulties in handling the crowd present a third
               serial under the command of Inspector Cooper will be held in
               reserve.   All Inspectors are asked to use their initiative in
               deploying manpower. If crowds are orderly, small and well behaved
               there is no necessity to deploy a full serial if the remainder can
               be held in reserve a short distance away and able to render
               assistance if necessary.

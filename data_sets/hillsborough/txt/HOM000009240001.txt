Dear Mr Stoker

JUDICIAL SCRUTINY OF HILLSBOROUGH DISASTER

You contacted me May this year and indicated that there were still various papers relating
to the Judicial Scrutiny of the Hillsborotigh Disaster which you had not received from the
Library of the House of Commons. I am sorry that it has taken some time to reply.

The list you enclosed was actually a list of the appendices submitted by the Hillsborough
Family Support Group to the Scrutiny, rather than all the evidence considered by the
scrutiny. I am enclosing copies of the HFSG appendices together with copies of the other
material relating to the Scrutiny.

Yours sincerely




M J Pyne

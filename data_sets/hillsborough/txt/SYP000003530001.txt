           I live at the above address                      I have lived there ever

           since I was born.

           My mother lives at                                Li verpool

           I have supported Li verp^oolyf ootbal 1 Club for the last four seasons.

           I go to every home game.         The game at Hillsborough was the first

           away game I had been to.

           On ffaturday, 15th April 1989 <150489) I had arranged to travel to the

           game at Hi 1lsborough with a relative.                          who lives at

           the same address as me.

           I got my ticket for the match on the 7th April        1989 (070489) and I

           got the ticket for the coach on the 13th April 1989 (130489).
                                                                            PAGE
                                                                            W W m/m

We left home at about 9.45 am (0945) on Saturday 15th April              <150489)

and walked up to the coach Depot,        in Woodend Ave, Speke,      / h e coach

left at about 10.30 am (1030) a nd stopped once at Chi ld^el 1 to jyiek

up some supporters.      The na#rte of the coach company was Affib^/line and

thei r Depot is in H o o d e y f Ave, Speke,

The onljy'tfelay in getting to Hillsborough was that roadwifrks on the

H&2 ma(orway and the short stop before we left Liverpool to pick

passengers up in Childwel1

There were no disturbances on the coachyrfuring the journey to

Hillsborough,    the only time any of tjare other passengers were asked

about carrying alcohol was when tKe coach stopped at Childwel1 and

the driver said to everyone, 1m e coach is going to be searched in

Sheffield, and that if anj^rie had any alcohol they had better get rid

of it.

We arrived at Sheffield at 1.00 pm <1300>.            The coach stopped by a

brewery .   I don't know exactly where it wa^/but it was five minutes

walk from the ground.      A policeman boajroed the coach and told

everyone if they had any al eohol ,\jfiPS'an*t have a ticket, they wouldn’t

be let into the ground.

Before going into the ground we went into a shop and each got a tin

of coke, a policeman gave us d i r e c t i o n to the Leppings Ln entrance.

We got to the entrance at abo^t 1              pm <     a ^ o ^ i e ^ a m told us to

drink the coke before we went into the ground, there were no queues

at the turnst/f 1es, we were able to go straight through the turnstiles

after handing in our tickets.        X was searched by a policeman on the

outside of the turnstile before being allowed in.            I did not see any

Stewards about this area.

         a, ,                                                 ^             on

looking through the entrance to the tunnel I saw the pitch.

I walked through the tunnel and onto the terraces.            I was able to
                                                                                           PAGE
                                                                                           S353

                 walk along and go into each pen to find the best viewing position,

       ? )       there were very few people about at this time and 1 decided to go
  \
                 into Pen 3 and go towards the fence at the front.           I did not see any

                 police or stewards at this time.

      ^0         Up until about ten minutes before the kick-off the crqytfwas quite

                 normal then suddenly everyone started to push yfojnrard at once.           I

                 do n ’t know why they did it.       I felt myself being crushed and people

                 were screaming to be let out.         I couldn’t breathe,   I saw black
             b
                 lines.      I felt as though I was suffocating.     There was a poli e^man on

                 the °ther side of the fence who was shouting at everyone to shut up

                 and saying that we only wanted to get onto the pitch.

                 I can't really remember anything else as I think I must have passed

                 out at this point, the next thing I remember is waking up on the

                 pitch.      I was on a stretcher.

                 I could see people clawing at the fence to try and get out,          I was not

                 able to help because of the injuries I hajjk-suffered,

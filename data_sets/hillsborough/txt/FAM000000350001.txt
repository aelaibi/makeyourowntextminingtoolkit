    SUMMARY OF AGREEMENTS WITH DEFENDANTS

    1.           Undertaking to pay compensation                                                                        |

                     Attached to the Bulletin is a copy of the letter from                                              ?
                     Hammond Su^da;£diS, dated the 15th December 1989. In addition?
                     to categories 3 and 4, they have also subsequently agreed                                          *
                     to pay a child who saw a parent injured or killed or later                                         |
                     found them inj ured or dead also, they have agreed to pay                                          1

                     It is important            to note that the letter from       Hammond                              j
                     Suddards should           be regarded as an open offer to all
                     claimants to pay          compensation and if you have not    already                              i
                     formally accepted         this offer you should do so at this stage.                               J
       You should note inparticular that in the one case which the
       Defendants did not appeal then on the basis of the House of
       Lords decision he would, in fact, have failed.

       You should also note the terms on offer were made to
       existing members of the Group and automatically to any new
       claimants instigating claims before the end of 1990.    The
       Insurers advised us that claims initiated between the
       beginning of 1991 and the end of the limitation period •
       should be looked at on their own merits but would not
       automatically be covered by the agreement.      It has also
       been agreed by the Insurers that they will pay interest on
       damages from the date of the disaster and this, of course,
       applies only to general damages which would normally carry
       interest from the date of service of the Writ, with special
       damages carrying interest from the date of the disaster in /
       any event.

       It has also been agreed with the Defendants that they will,
       where they are liable to pay compensation under the
       agreement,   make   immediate   payment   in   respect   of
       disbursements for medical reports.

2.     PROCEEDINGS

A.     Limitation

       The disaster    occurred  on the    15th April   1989,  and
       proceedings must therefore be commenced before that date in
       1992. No agreement has been reached on a global basis with
       the Insurers in respect of extension of the limitation
       period.     The  Committee   suggest   that  if  there  are
       difficulties in commencing proceedings then it would be
       necessary for Solicitors to negotiate individual agreements
       with the Insurers.

B.     Procedure

(a )   High Court

       In High Court cases agreement was reached with the Insurers,
       and reported in Bulletin 12, as follows :

            If in any case figures cannot be agreed and the matter
            has to proceed to trial, it has been agreed that this
            can be dealt with under the provisions of Order .1.8,
            Rule .21, to ensure a speedy resolution.

            I would draw your attention to this rule in the White
            Book.   All that is necessary is a Writ - against the



                              -   2
                                  -
            single Defendant    "The Chief    Constable    of  South
            Yorkshire" and a simple endorsement referring back to
            the Order of Mr Justice Steyn: the Plaintiffs claim is
            for damages    for personal    injuries   sustained   at
            Hillsborough Stadium Sheffield on the ,1.5th April 1989,
            and payable by the Defendant under the terms of the
            Schedule to the Order of Mr Justice Steyn, of the 20th
            December 1989 in the case of Chapman -v- The Defendants
            and Others.

            An application under Order 18, Rule 21, for trial
            without pleadings should be made to which the First
            Defendants will consent and the matter should proceed
            on the basis of a letter setting out details of the
            injuries and loss involved.

            However, it is, perhaps worth pointing out that under
            Order 18, Rule 21, no Defence has to be served. . This
            could prove important if the Defendants were at any
            time to allege that the claim was fraudulent because
            under the rules as changed in the last year or so such
            a matter has to be specifically pleaded.

(b)   County Court Proceedings

      In Bulletin 26 it was reported that the Committee was trying
      to reach a similar agreement with the Insurers because there
      is no equivalent to Order 18, Rule 21 in the Rules of the
      County Court.   Unfortunately, it has not been possible to
      do so.                                                 -'

      There are two suggested methods of approach :

      i.    The Particulars of Claim should repeat the paragraph
            suggested as a simple endorsement to the Writ set out
            above and attach a c o p y .of the letter from Hammond
            Suddards, dated the 15th, December 1989.

or,   ii*   The alternative would be to utilise the allegations set
             out in Chapman or Rimmer, respectively pens 3 and 4,
             against the Chief Constable only, (copies available at
             the Law Library).

(c)   Injuries outside the ground

      A mention should be made of persons who were injured outside
      •the ground or as they came into the ground but not in pens
      3 or 4.     Initially, it was envisaged that there would be
      a test action in respect of this area of concern but no
      suitable.action ever came to light.    In deed, the Insurers
did say that they woul-d look at each such case ,on its own
merits and provided that there, were not too many they would
give sympathetic consideration to them.    If anyone   has a
case involving this scenario it may be that the Chief
Constable's Insurers will attempt to apportion some of the
blame towards the Club as occupiers of the ground.

I can give no specific guidance as to how to proceed with
such a case.   However, a paper    was submitted to the Taylor
Enquiry by the Royal Institute of British Architects which
was particularly scathing of the set up at the turnstiles.
That document, together with the findings of the Taylor
Enquiry should serve as a preliminary basis for drafting
allegations of negligence.

I suggest that if you have a case in this category - there
should be very few, if any - it should be issued as a matter
of urgency.

GENERIC COUNSEL

I attach to the Bulletin a list of Junior Generic Counsel
whom you may wish to instruct in the individual cases.

MISCELLANEOUS MATTERS

You will recall that the Insurers have ceased funding the
activities of the Steering Committee and this means that the
trouble shooting facility has now lapsed.

However,  the Insurers have agreed to continue to be
responsible for the cost of co-ordination of psychological
examinations and if you require an initial report or a
follow up report from one"of the Consultants who travel up
to London on a periodic basis you should, as in the past,
address your request to Nicola Harrison C/0 Mace and Jones,
30 Sherborne Square, Huyton, Merseyside L36 9UR (DX 15 ,453
HUYTON).

This arrangement will be determinable on three months notice
being given by the Insurers.

PRE-DEATH PAIN AND SUFFERING

These matters were heard by the House of Lords on the 29th
January  1992,   and  if necessary a further Bulletin,
explaining the consequences of the decision, will be issued.

CONTRIBUTIONS BY INDIVIDUAL SOLICITORS FIRMS
     You will recall that members of the Group were asked to
     contribute £100.    To date this has been used largely to
     defray expenses incurred by Liverpool Law Society and it is
     anticipated that there will be no difficulty in obtaining
     reimbursement of those accounts from the Insurers.     There
     will be some costs which will not be recoverable from the
     Insurers such as those incurred in respect of the test cases
     in relation to remoteness and it is the intention of the
     Committee to use the monies to defray any such unrecovered
     costs.   It will take some considerable time- to sort out
     costs in these cases and it is proposed that at some future
     date the matter will be covered by a letter or short article
     in the Liverpool Law Society Journal.

Finally, the Steering Committee wish to record its thanks to Ben
Hytner, QC, and Tim King, QC, for the tremendous work that they
have done and also for the way in which they have done it.   Ben;
Hytner has produced a memorandum and a copy is attached.

Yours sincerely,


MICHAEL HUMPHREYS ^

  Dear Sirs,

                                        Hillsborough
           Chapaan and Rlmjeer -v- Chief Constable of South Yorkshire and Others

  We are writing on behalf of the Chief Constable of South Yorkshire and his
  insurers.

 It hae been decided that, whatever the rights and wrongs of the Hillsborough
 stadium disaster, it is inappropriate for persons who were injured at the
 g r o u n d to be kept waiting for compensation. Accordingly, without a decision
 as to liability and subject to the terms below, all bona fide claims for
 contpenaafioii by those injured and the dependants of those who died at the
 g r o u n d will be paid on a conaaon law basis to be agreed if possible or, failing
 a^reesteiit', to be assessed by the Court.

 Compensation will be paid for nervous shock cases, if they would be entitled
 to damages by law.  Our clients would include in this category, without
 further ado, the cases which fall into categories 1-4 and 15 put forward by
 yourselves, listed in Appendix ’A 1 to this letter.  In all other categories
 cases will be defended on the basis of repioteness, proof of injury and quantun
 only.     .

 This, offer applies to the deceased and those injured in, or escaping frcun,
 pens 3 and ‘4 at the g r o u n d . Our clients will also give consideration to the
 cases o f persons injured elsewhere within the precincts of Hillsborough
 stadiu* on receipt of details.

 The Chief Constable will pursue action against the other Defendants to the
 test actions, with a view to recovering suras expended pursuant to this offer.




                                                                                                                                         /...contd

O u r clients        : willing'to proceed upon the basis of an acceptance of this
o f f e r by 'this   llsborough Steering Committee.   The offer is made to all
claimants currently co-ordinated by the Cosuaittee.        It will be the intention
o f our clients to Rake the same offer, to m i x j claimants not currently
r epr esented by the Coausittee and also to claiaants who have not y e t come
forward, but who do so within twelve month* from the date of this letter.         Our
c l i e n t s would not rule out Making the ease offer to claimants coating forward
a f t e r the expiry of that deadline, but would not, at thisstage, wish to give
an indefinite conraitalent for the future.

A n y unresolved questions as to the means of putting this offer into effect
*hall be decided by application to the Court under ten# 1.         If jurisdiction is
r e f u s e d because no action has been commenced in a particular case,then the
d i s p u t e shall be resolved by action.



Terms

1.      These actions will by consent, be stayed until further Order, with
        liberty to apply for the purpose of putting the terms of this offer
        into effect.  .

2.   f r v Within six Months of the acceptance of this proposal:

         (a)    Each claimant shall, through his Solicitors, put forward a
                statement-of the factual basis of his clai», including the best
                particulars he can give as to the following:

                Time of arrival at ground.

                Whereabouts when injured/deceased.

                Cause of injury.

                Nature of injury.

               ' Confirmation whether Amended Statement of Claim in Chapman (Pen 3)
                 or Rinuner (Pen 4) adopted a s .statement of claimant's case.

        Our clients accept that the "best particulars" in this connection may
        be very limited in cases of bereavement and indeed in some cases of

                                  M E M O R A N D U M




I have been asked to provide a short note to explain the decision of the                    House

of    Lords     in   these    cases.   Whilst it     is .clearly    disappointing    that    al i

appellants       lost,    it is important to emphasise that the decision represents             a

welcome       advance in the law. ' It may be of 1ittie comfort to the clients,              but

they have not fought these cases in vain.            The decision w i 1i be of considerable

benefit to many future plaintiffs,            including some who were at Hillsborough,




In. general no damages are awarded for psychiatric illnesses in the absence                    of

physical      injuries.      The exception,   for nearly a hundred years,     has been where

certain       plaintiffs nave suffered such i ii.nesses due to shock when, fearing           for

the safety of certain others.




The     restrictions on this class of case have been threefold;             (a) the class     of

person who.could sue,         (b) .the proximity in time and place of that person to the

incident giving rise to the shock,            (c) the means of perception of the event.




Until     the    House    of Lords decision,      the class of person who    could    sue    was

restricted to fathers,         mothers and spouses of the "victim".         We argued for an

unrestricted class,          that is that anybody could sue-       We succeeded.     The House

of Lords have decided that in certain circumstances even a total stranger to
 the victim can sue,             and they have further accepted our argument that it is not

necessar*^ in           those, circumstances for there to be fear for the                                safety     of     a

victim, but that a scene of horror would suffice.




They have,        however,        taken the relationships of spouses,                       parent/chi ldren             and

■chi ldi'en/parents           as ..the basic           norm    of    love.          Others,        e.g.        brothers,

brothers-in-law,              uncles,        fiancees,       will have to         call evidence of         a      similar,

relationship.            In     the cases of fiancees and common law spouses this                               will      be

simple.         They will be equated with spouses.                        In other cases,          proof        will      be

difficult.         Ironically both we and the other side argued against this concept, •

and I can see appal ling evident iai problems arising.                                  However,     this is one of

the few arguments we did lose.
                                         ■   i

The     House     has    remained            silent     on my argument             that    the     more remote         the

relationship,           the greater the need for a horrifying scene, but I am reasonably

confident        that on a case, by case development of the law this will follow,                                        and

that     a   "normal”          uncie may succeed if the scene giving rise to the; shock                                   is

particularly gruesome.                  Of course,          if it is real IV.'gruesome he wiil succeed in

any event, just as a stranger would.




The evidence in the case of Mr.                       Alcock was that he and his brother-in-law Were

particularly        close        and     that         the    two    families;, were        closely         interlinked

emotionally.            Similarly Mr. Harrison was a loving brother.                            The decision maJces

it clear that something closer was necessary - something akin to a parent/child

relationship.           Thus,     .an older brother who has fostered a much younger brother

would succeed.




On     proximity        in     time     and       place,      we failed      to    convince        the    House        that

identification           of     bodies           in   the mortuary nine           and    more    hours      later        was
sufficient.         We     argued, that this was a culmination of a           search       and     rescue

mission.        Both the Court of Appeal and House of Lords were siient on this.




The Court of A p p e a r rejected television as a sufficient medium of perception of

the event/        Three of the five accepted our argument that it was sufficient, one

appears .to .have agreed with the Court of Appeal,               and one was silent.              This in

principle was a considerable victory.




We lost on the facts.             This may outrage the Hillsborough families and therefore

requires        explanation.       Cases in the past have distinguished between seeing                     a

loved     one    .killed    and    being    told   of . the   death.    The    latter          event     has

traditionally been held not to give rise to an action.                  Two recent decisions in

favour of the plaintiff have been held by the House to be. "probably wrong"/




Thus,     it remains the shock of seeing the death or other event giving                         rise     to

fear for the safety of the loved one which remains the criterion.                          In order to

succeed on perception by television the'plaintiff would either have to see                               (a)

the     loved    one being killed or otherwise in danger,              (b) a scene        of     gruesome

norror




Scenes     of gruesome horror are unusual on television unless a warning has                            been

given.     Contemporaneous television is subject .to strict guidelines.                        In my view

if the guidelines are broken (e.g. if at Hillsborough the cameras had zoomed in

on    a blue and battered face,            recognised by a father) the        television          company

rather than the tortfeasors would be liable.




In    this case the Law Lords held that the scenes shown were not                    in        themselves,

gruesome, and that no sudden shock was caused, but that the scenes intimated to

the viewers that a tragedy was. unfolding and that deaths had occurred,                           and     it

was     this intimation that gave rise to anxiety and dread which,                   together          with
         the     bereavement      itself gave rise to the illness.     In other words,        that     the

         scenes were rt'ore of a news item than scenes in themselves-gruesome




 4.      In the end the Law Lords were saying no more than many families would concede -

         that     they ,were      equally affected by radio commentaries       and   telephone       calls,

         giving news of death.         The law,   in rejecting foreseeability on the sole test of

         liability,       but importing the need for proximity,      draws lines which to members

         of     the    public   must seem to.be artificial and unfair.         So they   do    to    many

         lawyers.        However, for the time being,    if A kills B, and predictably, on being

         told of B's death his wife,         father and son suffer a depressive illness,             noone

         can recover damages.         If they see the tragedy,   they can.:




15.      A     final   victory,    which does not affect the relatives        of   victims,   was     the

         decision that not only rescuers but also participators in the events leading to

         the tragedy may recover.                                        >

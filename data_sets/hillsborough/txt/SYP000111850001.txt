T:he e n t r a n c e         to    the    stand       consists             of     two       swing metal            gates         which

lead     directly, to a n                 enclosed             stairwell             which affords                a c c e s s "into the

upper        seated          level       of    the W e s t       Stand.              Seven     stewards            employed            by

the     ti'ub.were a l s o               present.

W e were          instructed             by    Inspector             White        to    rerhain        in the          enclosed          part

and     clown the            stairs       to       enable       f r ee     access.

For    a long           period       of       time    very       fe w      fans        entered         this       particular             gate

and     we     chatted            with    fans       and       stewards.               At    this      time       the     fans       were

very     jovial             and    obviously          very       excited             about     the         forthcoming              m a tc h .

There        were       a    large       amount       of f a m i l i e s          entering.                These       f a ns    were       we l l

behaved           and       were    not       in drink.

At    one      stage         a fan       did       enter       the    seated area              without, a t i c k e t ,                but

was    seen        by a s t e w a r d a n d           ejected             by P o l i c e      Constable            1618 S h e a r w o o d

At    approximately                 2.30       p.m.       as    the       fans       entered        in a         steady         stream,          we

were     beckoned             by    one       of    the    stewards             at     the    b a se       of    the     stairs        who

pointed           to a n u m b e r        of y o u n g         fans       climbing           over      the w a l l        of     the

turnstiles              off       Leppings          Lane.

Several           officers          at    the :t u r n s t i les           were        requesting               them     to     comf. d o w n

but    t h e y w o u l d n ’t a n d            they       remained           on      the     wall.

By    t hi s      time       the    rear       of    the W e s t          Stand        was    heavily            congested with

fans     miking             their    way       to    the       terraces           and       stand.

Once       at    the       Police       Room ,         the    circumstances                were       outlined          to    the

 inside         the       ground       was       congested,             we    sa w a p p r o x i m a t e l y      30 men        standing

of    us    to a r r e s t        everybody,             we       split       up a n d a p p r o a c h e d        all    those

As we       passed          the    turnstiles                we    were       approached             by f a n s    who       were

of    the       fans      were     obviously             drunk          and       arguments          took    place       between

END          OF   REPORT
My full name is Sandra Fairclough Police Constable 31?Q* I am currently stationed at
Raokenthorpe Police Station,Occupation Lane,Sheffield. I am a comwaity constable for the
Qleadless        area"«£ ®y sttb '"division*'-I-.,feave years, service w|th/South Yorkshire Polie«
 Ctr Saturday- 16 th A^Pil 1989 I commenced duty at Hackenthorpe Police Station at 8*3Qas» for
Jaties In ,  connection with the F.A. Semi Cup Final between Liverjwtol f.C* and Kottingha®
'f&rest E.G. to be held at Hillsborough Football Stadium.       ■      t          ;•
 Along with other officers I was transported from Hackenthorpe to the football ground where
 upon my arriT^'l Attended,, a briefing in The North Stand. At, 10am that date we fere spoken
 to by Chief superintendent Duckenfield who was in overall command q £ the match*

%'-4 uties:on.'teis date were those employed by seriall3 under the direct supervision o t-:r r
Ps 2001 Burman.Our duties mr& the supervision of Liverpool, supporters in' the West Stand,| •
         situated off Leppings Lane. " -                         '? ■
Inspector Bullas was in overall command of our section of the stand.         ,
                                                                             s

At 11%15am we took up duties in the upperssction of the Vest Stand,at this time there were
no supporters present*
At 11.50am in company with Pc 1618 Shearwood I was directed by Ps 2001 Burntan to supervise
the South eater&nce gates to the upper level of Y and Z,The West Stand.
Our aim was to supervise entry by the supporters,and to help the club stewards prevent
entry to unauthorised persons.                                                                   j
The enterance to the stand consists of two swing metal    gates which lead directly to an
enclosed stairwell which affords access into the upper    seated level of the West Stand.
Seven stewards employed by the d o ! were also present.
We were instructed by Inspector White iso remain in the   enclosed part of the stairwell Qn the
middle level in order to stop fans running up and down    the stairs to enable free access.
 For a long period of time very few fans entered this particular gate and we chatted with
 fans and stewards. At this time the fans were very jovial and obviously very excited about
 the forthcoming match* There were a large amount of families entering. These fans were
 well behaved and were not in drink.
 At one stage a fan did enter the seated area withouta ticket b#t was seen by a steward
 and ejected by Pc 1618 Shearwood and myself.
 At approxiaatly 2.30pm sis the fans entered in a steady stream we were beckoned by one of
 the stewards at the base of the stairs who pointed to a number of young fans climbing
 over the wall of the turnstiles off Leppings Lane.
 Several officers at the turnstiles were Requesting them to come down but they wouldn't and
 they remained on the wall*
 By this time the rear of the West Stand was heavily congested with fans making their way to
 the terraces and stand.
 At 2*40pm my attention was drawn to a group of approximatly six men,they were stood urinatisj
 against the outside walls of the toilets at the rearof theWest stand near to the tunnel.
 Pc Shearwood and I approached the group,several on seeing us stopped urinating but one
 continued. Together with Pc Shearwood I took hold of                born         of
                             dverpool* He was taken to the police detention room.
 began to struggle en route to the detention room and was placed in an arm lock by Pc Shear­
 wood ,this caused some of the fans to use foul language towards Pc Shearwood and myself.
Once at the po ice room the circumstances were outlined to the custody officer and it was
decided to eject          from the ground. His details were obtained and then together with
Pc Shearwood I ejected '        from the ground*
 Together with Pc Shearwood I began to return to the West Stand,as we walked near to the
 turnstiles off Leppings Lane there was a hiiticable differance in the atmosphere,the area
 inside the ground was congested,we saw approximatly 3 0 men standing along the walls
 unrinating,because it was impracticable for the two of us to arrest everybody we split up
 and approached all those urinatiftg threatening to evict them from the ground if they didn't
 stop. M&st did,it was blatently obvious that most had been Krinking.
 As we .passed,the turnstiles w    e    .   ,     w     e    r    e      demanding somthing be ^■■
'flaps? about thr crowd outside|ks thf^'haS ju|jt7 p^shl*d.,their: fway through .into, the ground#
;we .returned to the bottom 0f^|ie-,stpp3 lead&g ^ o ^ e upper level of the West Stand,it was
 obvious'that the; stewards -w®r^:*Stru|gJ.lng because:':of the sheer number on faps,rather than, ,
 argUe'' about' the .'Validity ;Of-ilie' ticket 'they .isere allowed to enter the stand. Some .of the . .
 fins Were'QbTiously'dj^a^ 'iM arguments, took, place betwwen fans,stewards and ourselves,
:^ e t o i^.con^stic^i'and the'pushing it was impossible to physically stop the fans from
 Olifflibing-stairs, '     ;
 Due to the congestion one of the metal swing gates;wassslmt and stewards stood on the
 inside of-.it allowing, fans through the right hand one whichwas open,Pc Shearwoodand myse^i
.tri«(|i*tos'i^stail some sort' of order-and insisted on 'checking tickets,*;'Thoep with blue and
 whit&-ticl^fs were''directed to th^-terrac©^*. /V-,.                       . ' -v\/V-- -v    .. "a:
 Whilst at .this, enterance I%a^ ..suddenly.aware of ,a '.larges,amoiiiit of fans surging^towards us,
 both Pc Shearwood. and Myself were pinned against th»:^M^a3L gates and it became impossible ,
 'to,...restrict,.access to the upper level,
We then tried to restore normality to tlfeVft&waa*' Mtadio •aged1''oea*- approached us shoutiag'
words to the effect '"There, are people dying in that stand being crushed what are you going
to do about it"‘
At .this point both' Pc Shearwood/and m y s e l f .were'still pinned .against the gates and were ,
un&laie to raove.Pc She?£rwood indicated to apprpximatly eight officers and a:supervisory
who were stood in a group near the tunstiles and asked that he go and explain to them*
He continued to shout at Pc Shearwood "On© six one eight I want you to do something1'
 Several minutes later the number of fans depl&ted near our eiiterance and together with
 Pc.Shearwood we were able to move and we approached the man again and asked what the
 specific-problem was.He complained of people pushing-and .shoving and 1 said I would -help,
 he appologised to us for shouting. However on looking down the tunnel at the rear of the
 West Stand I saw some fans milling about but did not see anyone injured or anyone who
 looked as though they needed any assistance, Pc Shearwood began to walk down the tunnel
 I requested him to reutum and I began attempting to radio through to the control to
 advise them of the complaint. At this point a number of serials began- running. through
 the ground and towards the pitch area near ground control. I was unable to get through to
 ground contol.
 I had heard nothing on my personal radio and I assumed that fans were fighting,both
 Pc Sliearwood and myself remained near the ttttmel and we were approached by a,teenage fan
 who complained of chest pains. We took the fan to the first aid room near the gym,left
 him and returned to the rear of the West Stand. On our return, the whole area behind the
 stand was littered with casualties lying on the floor,there was a large Mount of other
 people and.' police,officers* '
 It was quite obvious that some were dead lying on the floor,Pc Shearwood and myself split
 up and went to sender first aid*
 Many of the injured were placed in the recovery position,some supporters were helpful but
 others were directing obscene language towards other officers and myself*
 I rendered first aid to the injured which werelaid in the alleyway at the rear of the
 West Stand, Inspector Sykes and his men were moving dead people and officers were stood
 infront of them so the injured could not see the dead*
 The Fire brigade arrived and the alleyway at the rear of the ground was cleared of vehicles^
 to enable one way traffic for the flow of ambulances required.                             '
                                                                                           .           ..J

 A docotr appeared on the scene,checking the injured and deciding who would need to go in
 ambulances first,i was Just assisting him get ambulances and placing people on stretchers.
 When all the Ca^malties had gone a Doctor and a female, first aider came,together with Pc
 Shearwood we took them to the Gymnasium*
 On our return ,we went to the large blue gates and closed it to hide the site of the dead
 as the’ground'was now being, emptied*''
-.i.$e th».,|aiis were leaving the stadium a police corden was .set up so that the fans didn't com

                9.-O0 a.-ffl: on duty at- Eeeieefieid.

                9.45 a.m.      in North Stand at Hillsborough for briefing,            nice sunny day

                for a fo ot bal 1 m a t c h .



                11.15   a.m.    at rear of Leppings Lane Stand for a short briefing with

                Inspector Sykes.



                11.40 a.m.      outside ground on turnstiles to Leppings Lane S t a n d ,

                centre portion,      took turnstile No.       16,    turned out to be a bad m o v e .



                12.04 p.m. my turnstile opened up, had a chat with the op e r a t o r .                No

                supporters going to the ground and only a handful                in the r o a d ,
                                                                                   PAGE

1.00 p.m.       very q u i e t , half a dozen people passed through my

turnstile,       coaches dropped fans off right in front of the

turnstiles.           I didn't count the coaches, maybe six, perhaps a dozen,

the fans did not enter the ground.               I didn't see one go to the

turnstiles,       they all walked off a 1 long Leppings Lane in both

directions.           I just stood around with Jeff Alexander and the others,




By 2.00 p.m.          there were a few more people about,        some going through

the turnstiles          into the ground,    no problems,     no queues.



2.15 p.m. now an endless stream of people * smal 1 orderly queues

forming at the t u r n st il es .



A m a n , late 50' s , early 60' s , wearing a Notts Forest cap and scarf

approaches the area outside the turnstiles,                he appeared to be a bit

slow.      He was carrying a plastic carrier bag and a tan coloured

ladies purse.           I spoke to him and told him that he was at the wrong

end of the g r o u n d , he seemed a bit c o n f u s e d .    I asked him for his

ticket so I could direct h i m .           He said he h a d n ’t got o n e .   He pointed

to his purse and s a i d , "I've got ten p o u n d s , do you know where I can

buy o n e " .    I directed him to the Penistone Road end but advised him

to go h o m e .



By now it was about 2.30 p.m.,             it was very busy a lot of people

about.      I spoke to several youths who were hanging about in small

groups and told them to go into the g r o u n d , they d i d n ’t, they h a d n ’t

got t i c k e t s .   I told them to go away,      I was wasting my breath.         I

became aware of ever growing groups of p e o p l e , y o u t h s , late teens

early t w e n t i e s , stood a b o u t , a lot sat on walls n ear the p ri<jge.

Suddenly Leppings Lane is full of people,        just a mass moving towards

us.   I ’ve worked dozens of matches at Hillsborough,        a few of the

other semi's,    but I've never seen anything like that.        Next thing,

the queues have disappeared,       there was just a mass of people in the

enclosure,    a lot had got the wrong area.      People with tickets for the

North Stand and standing tickets in our enclosure,         getting bad now.

People pushing to get in and out of the enclosure.
                                                                                      ■<

                                                                                      i
Found myself right    in the corner next to the large metal f e n c e .        I      J
                                                                                      I
could see through a small gap of about 4" next to the wall           into the

standing terraces queues,     people were getting squashed badly.         It must ;

have been 2.45 p.m. by now, but I ’m not s u r e .     Young l a d s , teenagers      j


had climbed on top of the barrier to escape the crush,          some came into

our e n c 1o s u r e , others cl imbed onto the brick wall over the top of the

turnstiles    into the ground.     I 've no idea how many cl imbed over into

the ground,    but a lot did so.



The horses outside were totally ineffective,         it looked like they were         !

being pushed by the crowd instead of the other way r o u n d .       I got some

young l a d s , early teens off the b a r r i e r , they had tickets for the

t e rr ac es , I pushed them to the front and through turnstile N o . 16

into the ground to get them out of the c r u s h .     The man on the

turnstile appeared not to be checking ti c k e t s , he had his foot on the

pedal and the turnstile was just going r o u n d .     It seemed that if

someone had a ticket they were i n .      I saw no one refused entry.



I was trapped in the corner,       couldn't move easily,   people,   grown men

now c 1imbing over the barrier from the crush at the other s i d e .           Not    j
                                                                                      i
much better this side,     heard people crying out and shouting for help,             j

people standing on my head and shoulders as they climbed jpver into                   ]
                                                                                                PAGE

our e n c l o s u r e .   I suddenly became worried and concerned for my own

safety.       I managed to grab Jeff and together we pushed along the

barrier to the front of the e n d o s u r e .               Together we tried to close

the gates at the f r o n t , no c h a n c e .          A mounted officer saw us and

moved his horse over            in    front of the g a t e s .       The right hand gate was

pushed shut and after a               struggle the bolt put into the f l o o r .               We

tried to close the other s i d e , got thumped by a fan for my t r ou bl e,

c o u l d n ’t manage to close the g a t e .



Leppings Lane seemed f u l 1 of people as far as I could s e e , fans now

climbing over the gate we had s h u t .                 Some fans smelled strongly of

b e e r , one or t w o , not many,       still drinking from c a n s , not soft

d r i n k s , beer and l a g e r .     Saw one drinking from a brown bottle,                    it

looked like Pi Is l a g e r ,         c o u l d n ’t stop t h e m , I c o u l d n 't get t h e m .   I

c o u l d n ’t see any other Pol ice Officers except the mounted lads who

were totally swamped with p e o p l e .             I know the others were there I

just c o u l d n ’t see them.        The crowd just kept c o m i n g , pushing and

shoving f o r w a r d s .    The turnstiles c o u l d n ’t c o p e .        I d i d n ’t know what

to do, we c o u l d n 't stop them c o m i n g .         I thought to myself             (someone i

going to get hurt h e r e ) .



I then saw Gate           ’A ’ to the North Stand o p e n , people poured t h ro ug h.

After a couple of minutes the crush eased but there were still

hundreds of people a b o u t .          I could see some of the other officers

near the turnstiles.             The plastic dust bin that I had been putting

cans in was still           in the c o r n e r , but    it was squashed flat,             the cans

that had been in it were strewn all o v e r .                    Someone nearby s h o u t e d ,

"Get ins ide t h e y ’re on the pi t c h " .           I went through one of the

turnstiles,        I d o n ’t know which o n e , I followed some other 1 a d s .
                                                                                       PAGE

Once inside I saw a large number of officers running towards the

South Stand end behind the Leppings Lane stand.                   There were forty or

fifty officers.          I followed into the South stand.            I saw people on

the edge of the pitch and the last couple of players                   leaving.        There

were quite a few officers on the edge of the pitch near to the goal,

fans were climbing over the perimeter fence onto the edge of the

pitch area.        I got down to the edge of the field but I couldn't see

or tell what was happening.              Police Sergeant John Morgan ran passed

me back towards        the South Stand.        He shouted,     "Come on round the

back".     I followed,       as did Jeff.      We ran back round to the rear of

the Leppings Lane stand and into the centre tunnel which was just

about empty.        There were no injured people in the tunnel.                John

M o r g a n , myself and Jeff got to the end of the t u n n e l .         There were

three or four other officers with us but I d o n 't know who they w e r e .



I started grabbing hold of people p u l 1ing them back and shouting at

them to get back and go o u t .           People in the stand above me were

h y s t e r i c a l , shouting and pointing to the front of the t e r r a c e s .        I

c o u l d n ’t understand them,       it was   1 ike a foreign la ng u ag e, but I

realised that something was very w r o n g .            I pushed forwards pul 1ing

people back and shouting for them to leave to go back as I d i d .                       John

Morgan was near me and was doing the s a m e .              I got to the first

b a r r i e r , I found a man in his mid t w e n t i e s , slumped over the

barrier.      He was on the bottom side near the p i t c h , I pulled him u p .

he had blood coming from his m o u t h , quite a bit,             he was having

difficulty b r e a t h i n g .    He was p a l e , c r y i n g , asking for help and

s a y i n g , "Get me o u t ” .   I pushed him under the barrier and as 1 did

two fans came from the back got hold of him and dragged him off

towards the tunnel.
                                                                                    PAGE
                                                                                   R51

I turned to go towards the front and went under the barrier.                       1 was

still pulling people back.           I was kicked two or three times o n the

legs,    it was not by accident.          One man spat   in my face from just a

couple of feet away.          I thought    (what's wrong with these people).

Suddenly I lost m y footing on the steps and fell, my helmet came

off.     I was terrified for a few seconds.           I got to my feet faster

than I ’ve ever done before,         someone pulled me up as well,         I d o n ’t

know who.      I was confronted by a man screaming at me,             I c a n ’t

remember what,         but I got the gist.     I remember one sentence,

"people are dying down there,          do something” .     He grabbed me, my tie

came off, my jacket was pulled open.             I pushed passed him and pushed

him towards the tunnel.           I still c o u l d n ’t see the front of the

terraces,    people were still climbing the perimeter fence.



I saw three or four Pol ice Officers pul 1ing at the fence from the

pitch side,     trying to pull the wire mesh from the frame.              I looked

d o w n , there were two fans k n e l t , one was giving mouth to mouth and

the other was doing heart massage on what I think was a young l a d .

He looked very dead to m e , a s h e n .      I bent to h e l p , his lips were

b l u e , I felt sick.      I shouted at them to move him b a c k , give him

air.     People around me had started to move back a little.                 There was

an area towards         the tunnel starting to clear.       I again turned to the

f r o n t , oh hell,    bodies under the wall,    t e n , f if te en , I pushed

f o r w a r d s , to my r i g h t , bodies almost to the top of the wall,         ten feet

back from the wall.          The ones on top were d e a d , a s h e n , blue lips eyes

open,    al1 young.       One at my feet wear ing a red s c a r f , I grabbed him,

pulled,   dragged,       carried him out up the tunnel to the rear of the

stand.    There was noise,       shouting,    confusion everywhere.        I put him

down, he d i d n ’t seem dead.       I got on my knees and attempted to give

him mouth to mouth.          I d o n ’t know how long for, not long,       someone

         waiting for a relative to identify your body.                No one came for mine.

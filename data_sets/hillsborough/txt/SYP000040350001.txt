     For the attention of Chief Inspector Drabble


     Dear Sir,

          I refer to my telephone conversation of 6th October 1989, with
     Chief Inspector Drabble, and to the correspondence forwarded to me
     by West Midlands Police on 27th September 1989, relating to a
     questionnaire completed by I

          Attached is a copy of my letter to the Hillsborough Enquiry Team
     at Nechells Green Police Station, and which is self-explanatory,
     together with copy statements taken on 6th October 1989 at Liverpool.

                                        Yours faithfully,




                                        Superintendent

      Football Spectators Bill: amendments for report


             We have been considering a number of amendments; this letter contains
      instructions         on       most        of   them.They   result       from      undertakings         given        in
      Committee. points raised from within the Department, discussions with the Home
      Office and others.,             and yet other matters which                     came up       in the   course of

      debate.                   -      ...                  ..... . ........ . .



      1..       To require..the Secretary of State, to discuss with the FMA the matches
      he plans to ^’designate before.layiiig :the Draer before Parliament (Col .180 - 4th
'     .Sitting).,    "*1               '' - '



      We do not want the Secretary of State to be                                  obliged         to undertake formal
      consultation with the EMA about whether matches^sfaould be designated, but we
      do wish that the FMA should have the opportunity^ make representations which
       can then be taken Into.account by the Secretary*** State                                        when making his

       decision.




                    - To    specify the              constitution and        composition           of the FMA     (eg to
       include supporters’ representatives, an "independent" Chairman) (Col 292 - 6th
       Sitting and Col 336 - 7th Sitting).
 /
M explored such a proposal with you some time ago and your letter of 4 July
refers. We prefer one of the precedented approaches mentioned in paragraph 5
of your letter.


            (i) We wish it to be specified in the Bill that the FMA must have an
            independent Chairman ie. a Chairman who has "no such financial or other
            interest as is likely to affect prejudicially the performance of his
            functions" (Schedule 2, paragraph 2(a)).


           " -{ii') The FMA to have between 4 and 8 members,,           50%   to be nominated. by
            the .Secretary of State          and the rest to be approved by him - both
            initially and also when changes in the membership of the Board occur.
              t
                  *

             (iii)     In considering the nomination            of members     we   also want    the
            Secretary of State to be obliged to consult such people..-as appear to
            him to represent the interests of Football supporters.


 In view of the requirements mentioned above it seems to us that it wc?\il:d; be
 appropriate:/for. the..Secretary, of State not "to designate a body as the FMA
 •unless      satisfied       that   the   Articles   enabled    him    to    ensure--that      those
 requirements         could    be    fulfilled,   (Were   the - Articles - to -be     changed     the ,
 Secretary of State could, as you suggested, withdraw designation).




 3 .'“ ;      - To require the Secretary of State to lay a report before Parliament
 on any decision to withdraw designation of FMA within a certain period                          (Col
 309 -7th Sitting).


 We want the Secretary^~State to be obliged to lay a report before Parliament
 in the event of him^Withdrawing the designation                       of the FMA.      We   do not
 consider however that this should be required to be done within a specific
 period.          It might be, for example, that the reason for withdrawal is connected
 with matters which are subject to Court action or Police investigation,,                          in
 which case it would be inappropriate for the Secretary of State to report
 immediately.
                _ to   require the FMA to consult,               inter-alia,     the Weisn FA before
exercising any of its functions under Clause 4(2) - ie. the Welsh FA to be
added to the bodies there mentioned.                  (Col 385 ~ 9tb Sitting).




5.          -    To    require    National      Membership       Scheme    application    forms    to    be
available in Welsh (Col 432 - 10th Sitting).



£           To    provide      that    the   licensing " authority        can,   in   effect,   ban     away

supporters from certain grounds.


                 I’-We envisage the possibility that a particular club or clubs may have
 particular problems with visiting supporters, either generally or associated
 with     another        particular club or clubs, and we would therefore wish that it
 could be a condition of the licence that away supporters be banned even though
 they are members of the scheme.                   If you agree that at present the Bill does
 not include provision to do this we would be_grateful for an amendment giving
    the - licencing Authority"power 'to ban                    certain' spectators,      albeit. 1they, are




                We have discussed with the Council on Tribunals and we have agreed

    •hat*                                                s'~


                 a) provision should be made in the 3ill to require the FLA to notify
                 the applicant for a licence if it is proposed to refuse to grant a
                 licence unless certain conditions are complied with.


                 b) if the FLA refuse to grant a licence, they must give                        reasons for
                 doing    so     in    writing,    and    an      opportunity     must    be    given      for
                 representation to be made against the refusal similar to those which
                 are set out in        Clause   12(4)(b) in respect of revocation or suspension

                 of a licence.



     8.          We have discussed with the Home Office the impact of the FLA’s powers
     on theprocedures of              local authorities under the Safety of Sports grounds                 Act
     1975.        Section 4(8) of the 1975 Act requires local authorities to consult

We are still                  considering the question of appeals under Section 5                                             the 1975
 Act.    It is not clear to us to what extent (if at all) these provisions apply
 in the event of action by the FLA under Clause 13(2) - can you help?                                                         W^Home
 Office considers that the right of appeal by the interested parties there
 m^^ioned ought in those circumstances to lie to a magistrates’ court, but we
 JKd      not wish to hamper the use by the FLA Of its powers under Clause 13

  9.       The Home Office have been anxious to provide a defence, or a further
  defence, in relation to the offences created by Clauses 2,9 and 10. This has
  been raised in debate - see the Report on 5th Sitting, col 215-                                                              We have
  agreed that it should be a defence in each case that the person concerned was
  acting on lawful authority.                           However, this ~defence is not to be available to a
  person charged under Clause 2 if that person was at the time of the offence
  disqualified ‘"from                being -a member-of the scheme- ..                                               .......



  10 . ': ^                                                                                                                   scheme in
                                                                                                                                Thus if
  the police -officer in■charge, fearing serious disorder outside a ground, were
   to order the gates to be opened, no offence would thereby arise except under                                                                    /    j
   Clause 2 in relation to a person disqualified from membership.                                                  If the "lawful
   authority” defence would not have this result,                                                       we wonder whether Clause
   5(2) (i) is wide enough to enable the Secretary of State to require the scheme
   to    allow the               police           to     override          its        provisions.             If   that       again     is
   insufficient,-could we please have an amendment to achieve the result we want?



   11.          During discussion on defences,the question was raised as to whether a
   turnstile operator could be a "responsible person"; the Home Office expressed
   the view that he could.                             We would not want a turnstile operator, or anybody
   else at a similar level of the hierarchy, to be a "responsible -person" who
             /
            ■*

        /
    /
    '' could be charged with an offence under Clause 10 or 11, particularly since the
        defences      available under    those Clauses    do not seem appropriate            to such a
        person.       If you consider that such a person could be a             "responsible person",
        is it practicable to amend the definition so as to exclude him?                      If that is
        not practicable, we would need to consider what defence ought to be available
        to him.




                    We .have also discussed the commencement and running of the mandatory


        «
        the ban may
                    s (Clause 7 (3)) •' We have agreed that the ban should commence at the date
                    of conviction, rather than as determined under the scheme.
                           run concurrently with a longer           custodial    sentence.
                                                                                              It follows that
                                                                                                A Court
        convicting a person of a relevant offence should be required to notify that
/
    ^   person of the commencement and effect of the 'ban.




        -13.        -We wonder whether the reference to           "designated agencies"       should be
        removed from the long title..                    7          ■

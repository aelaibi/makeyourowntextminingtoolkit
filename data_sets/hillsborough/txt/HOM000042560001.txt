HILLSBOROUGH STADIUM DISASTER INQUIRY


I have now shown Lord Justice Taylor your letter of 31 January.
He has asked me to say that, contrary to what you suggest in the
first paragraph of your letter, he did make clear that there were
a number of exceptions to the general picture of the football
scene which he described (paragraph 32 is one such reference).
If you feel that Bristol Rovers are making particular efforts to
deal with the kinds of criticisms Lord Justice Taylor had in
mind, he wishes you good luck in your endeavours.



                                                                  )

      IN THE
    COMMUNITY
It is Bristol Ravers' intention to promote closer links with the Local
Community in the building of their new stadium at Carson's
Road, Mangotsfield.

The Football Club has many ideas to put before the residents of
Kingswood and its surrounding areas, which they feel would be of
interest in this venture.

The Club would like to associate itself with Kingswood Senior Citizens;
by assisting with, or contributing to various projects.




SENIOR CITIZENS

Annual contributions and donations,
towards functions, including
Christmas Dinners, outings etc.

Organised shopping trips.




 A large area of accommodation will be. allocated to such organisations as
 the Scouting and Guiding associations, pensioners-arid especially the
 Disabled bodies where they would administer and run their events at no
 costs to themselves as a Village Hall or Community Centre for the
 nearby areas.
The Stadium would also include in this space such things as an Over
50's social club with free admission. Free membership during a period
from 12 pm to 3 pm some 2 or 3 days weekly, where they could enjoy
these facilities, and where also a luncheon at reasonable prices could be
served. This area could also be used for Bingo and Tea Dances, and a
Fitness and Dancing class could be held. A creche could possibly be
 incorporated for those mothers who wish to use this facility.
 This would be supervised.



           OVER 50'S SOCIAL CLUB


   TEA DANCES
BALLROOM DANCING
   WHIST DRIVES
      BINGO
A Community gymnasium, medical and weights room would be
available to those organisatons who wish to avail themselves of this
facility at times when not in use by the Football Club at nominal
charges.

       LOCAL CUP FINALS ETC.
                          CLUB ROOMS

                       Will indude areas for:-
                Girl Guides, Boy Scouts, Play Groups
                  Day Centres, Matchday Creche.

During school holidays the club would hold coaching sessions for young
boys and girls. We would wish to expand on these ideas when and
where possible and would like close links with the local bodies, e.g.
Councils, Police etc. and hope they would co-operate with us in this area
to bring enjoyment and a community spirit to all those who wish to
involve themselves in this project.

                                   WITH THE PLAYERS

                                               Training w ith the
                                               players.

                                               dub in operation).

                                               Coaching sessions
                                               for boys and girls,
                                               either at the
                                               Training Ground or
                                               thoughout local
                                               schools and
                                               Assodations.

                 Coaching D isabled and the H andicapped
                 assisting them to form their own teams.
Other thoughts and ideas would be to create a closer tie with local
schools by visits by our playing staff and also visits to local hospitals
and other centres of this type. We would also encourage local school
parties to come to our League matches and our training sessions when
possible.

                  COMMUNITY MATCHES

FREE ADMITTANCE at all matches for local school and youth
associations. (By arrangement).

This programme should convince anyone doubting the integrity of this
club that we intend to involve those in the Local area who are interested
in involving themselves.

This project would be a fore-runner of future developments to come, in
that a Community provision is being made inside an ultra modern
stadium complex - the first of its kind in the country.

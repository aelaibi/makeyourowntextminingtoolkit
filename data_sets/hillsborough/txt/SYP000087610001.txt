c hi l dr e n who        had some w it h          relatives who             really had drunk too m u c h

al cohol      to be       in control          of them.         As the       time was       getting        very near          to

kick off       the fans were a s k e d to vacate                        the    pub a nd make           their w ay down

Wads 1ey Ln to the ground.                      This        they did,       a n d we    f o ll ow ed    in the

Tr a ns i t   van.       At this       point we were             r e q u e st e d to pick up a P o li c e

approximately 3.10pm                   (1510)       we were         r e q u es t ed to a t t e n d outside            the

van at this           time were aware what was                       happening.         We t r a v el l ed along

C a t c h ba r Ln.       We were not told a n y t h in g                of what        had h ap p en e d      inside        the

s t ad i u m just       to wait and see          if we were          needed,       there s ee me d to be

c o n f us i on everywhere.            I w a l k e d down to the outside                gates     of the g round

an d was a s k e d to wait             there    until     e m e r g e n c y vehicles       had arrived,

still      no-one       could tell me what             had h a p p e ne d or didn't want                to.

S u pp o r t e r s    then st ar te d to       come out of the ground,                  some were        in a

state of distress,               shock,       ill a nd drunk.         T he y were       shou ti ng at the

P ol ic e O f f i ce rs       that   it was all        our fault,       spit ti ng at us,              trying    to

fight,       the scene was           one of pandemonium.              P e op le were a sk in g w here            they

could telephone               home a nd were         pointed     in the d i r e c t i o n of the             public

call     boxes.        Others    had       lost their     b e lo ng in gs     including       tickets         home

and their            shoes.    At this       point    I was    still    u na ware       of what        had

happened.            A space was made          for    the e m e r g e n c y vehicles         to get as         far

into the ground as               possible.       During       this   time a fan h an de d to me a

S e i ko w a t c h and just s ho u t e d to me he had                  picked       it up on the

terraces.            This was    later       handed    in. Fans      that had         lost    r elatives        or

friends        tried to get back              into the g r ou nd       to look for them,                all    this

s ee me d to go on for a very                  long    time,     bodies were          brought         out of the

g r o u n d a nd      laid at the side of the              river      until      vehicles       could get to

remove       them.      It w a s n ’t u n t i 1 a bout 4 ,30pm         (1630)       that     I f ound out the

e n o r m i t y of what        had h a p p en ed and was         g iv en the e m e r g en c y number            that

we    could give         people      to ring for enquiries.                 T h r o u g h o u t all    this    I did

not    have a radio nor did any of my                      coll ea gu es a r o u n d me.          I did hear

the    radio stations a w a i t i n g          her    interview.          I was    informed by her             that

this was         not the      case and that she had never a s k e d to see them a n d                            I

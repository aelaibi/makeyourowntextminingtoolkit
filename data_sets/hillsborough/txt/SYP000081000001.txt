          I got       to       my     seat        at     2.30pm          and     sat       with                                      , there           were          no

          outside           two       were        pretty           empty.

          Shortly           after          the      match          began        i > was         obvious          that       there           was    a       problem

                          was,        she     was        unable          to     say,       except          that       she       was     still          in       the

          c a n ’t    remember               if     it       was    a    gate        or    where       the       mesl'j/nad b e e n               bent          away:

          and    I    layed           h er    on       the     pitch.           She       was    still          co/fscious.             I made             sure

          they       were        both        alright           and       then        went       back       to    the       fence        to    see          if    I

          could       help,           but      it      was     difficult              to    know       whether             I was        being          a    help          or

          a hinderance.                    I saw         a    mate       who     I know          by    sight.          We       asked        each          other          if

          we    were        alright,              which        we       were.        I then          returned,             to    the        girls          and

          had    no       feeling            in     her       legs.        However,             someone          decided             s he    would          have          to

          go,    so       we     put       he r     on       the, sj^retcher               and       carried          her       off     the       pitch          out

          was    obviously             injured.             The       Police        officer          came       quickly            back     to     me      and

          pulled       me       around       the       other          sii       of     the      ambulance              and     made       it     clear          to

          walked       away.

          Eventually             another          ambulance              arrived        and       helped          g et               in,

             the    fans,       it    seems       that          in    general            tj^y         have     a    bad      attitude           towards

C b M M & Z T supporters.            When    the       crowds             w e ra/’o u i 1 d i ng        so     late          before       the    kick       off

             the    police       outside          should             have        contacted             the     ground          and    made

             arrangements             for    the       k-ick         off       to^-be        delayed.

             If    the    fences       dividing                the-^pens           on    the      terraces              hadn't       been       there       the

             fans    would       have       been       able          to       spread         al onjj// t h e       terraces.

             I feel       the    ground          was       a    poor          c ho i o " * o f    venue,           it    could       only       be    unequal

             in    the    number       of    t i ^-st.g          a1              f.y H _ w h e r e a s ,       if       it   was     played          at

             Manchester          the       tickets             co^ld          have      bean      allocated              equally.

                                                                                                                                                 'S I G N E D

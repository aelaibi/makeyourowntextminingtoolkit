 •                     There was a further directions hearing before Mr. Justice Rose on
                       24th May, when ac Order was made fixing the commencement date of
                       the trial of the contribution action as Tuesday, 2nd October.  The
                       trial will take place in Manchester.             ■----------

       v       __       For reasons to which I shall refer below, neither I nor Counsel yet
           I(_? /       know which South Yorkshire Police Officers we shall wish to call as
                        witnesses.   It m a y well be that the trial is largely concerned-with
v <                     expert evidence and legal argument, with the factual background
 jv.                    being either agreed or put in by reference to statements or
                        transcripts of evidence given to the Inquiry.     Nevertheless, I
                        think that it would be prudent to warn those Officers who are most
                      * likely to be called.     David Duckenfield is an obvious candidate
                        but, as he is suspended from duty, I think that I should write
                        direct to his Solicitors.     Officers who might be warned via
                        yourself would be Bernard Murray, Roger Greenwood, Roger Marshall
                        and I would suggest all the Officers of Inspector of qhipf Tnsnert-nr
                         rank who were stationed or had responsibilities in respect of the
                         sectors between, say, the north end of Leppings Lane and the pitch
                         perimeter fence to the Leppings Lane terraces.    As we are
^                       effectively the Plaintiff in the case, our witnesses will be heard
v                       first and the likelihood, therefore, is that the relevant time will
v                       be the first three weeks in October but, obviously, if anyone is
^                       away on'annual leave or secondment, it should be possible to fit
^                       them in at another time.

                         The Team will prepare a report for my signature addressed to Superintendents
                         Murray> Greenwood and Marshall together with all officers of inspector rank
                         upwards who on IS April 1989 had responsibilities at the Leppings Lane end
                         of the ground from the pitch, through the concourse including the turnstiles
            I l o b      and also the outer perimeter area where managecent of the crowd approaching
                         the ground was a responsibility.

                         The purpose of the report will be to inform them that the contribution action
                         is scheduled to commence on Saturday 2 October 1990 and will outline in
                         broad terms the intention of the proceedings, namely, to determine degrees
                         of liability between the parties involved.

                         Further that whilst at this stage it is impossible to say who in terms of
                         police witnesses will be called it may be that a number cf officers will
                         be required to give evidence in support of the police case.       It is also
                         possible that the other parties may call police witnesses on their behalf.

                         Once more precise informationis available all concerned      will be notified
                         so that those both attending and not attending will beaware of the position.
                         Officers should avoid talcing      annual leave during the month commencing
                         1 October and if any leave is    already booked then we need to know in order
                         to inform bur solicitors.
      One reason for aiy not being able to say who is required is that we
      d o not kno w the extent to which facts will be agreed. A mechanism
      for agreement has now been ordered by the Court: each party"is to
      mar k up copies of the interim_and final Taylor reports by
      underlining those aspects of the report which they do not admit for
      the purposes of trial.    Neither I nor Counsel can find anything
      exceptionable in the final Taylor report but, obviously, there is a
      good deal of the interim report with which we do disagree.     I
      enclose a copy of the report with under linings which Counsel and I
      would propcse to make.    Appreciating that you will have many other
      tasks to a-rer.c to after returning from leave, I should be most
      grateful if you could consider this draft and let me know the extent
      to which ycu are in agreement with it.    I would be prepared to
      travel to Sheffield on the afternoon of Wednesday, 30th May to
      discuss the detail with you, if this would assist. There are
      unfortunately, two reasons for haste.    First, and practically' 1 am
      leaving the office on Friday, 1st June for a two week holiday in
      France.   Secondly, Counsel has suggested that the underlined draft
      should be copied to the Officers who are subject to specific
      criticism in the report, i.e. specifically David Duckenfield     '  ''
      Bernard Murray and Roger Greenwood, so that they can have a n ’
      opportunity of commenting before a final version is served.
      Obviously, I would like to put that in motion as quickly as
      possible, bearing in mind that the date for service of these
      documents is set at 22nd June.




        2. Taylor Report

        The Taylor Report will be used at the Trial and its findings accepted as
        evidence except where the various parties have indicated they do not wish
        this to occur.  Attached is an abstract from the Interim Report which has

        been marked as to the areas where we do not agree judicial notice of the
        contents. This decision has been arrived at after long consultation between
        Mr Woodward and Peter Metcalf.

        Ke are asked to consider the same document to see if there are other parts
        which we would advise be not admitted in evidence.      The lawyers make the
        point that this is in no way a brain-storming exercise.       The purpose of
        the contribution action is to apportion liability between the parties and
        it is therefore very different from a normaT cTvIl action.

^\y    The Action Team will consider the abstract and if they can identify any
'      area where additional judicial notice should not be agreed then they will
       indicate that area with reasoned argument as to their decision.

        Peter Metcalf is sending a copy to Chief Superintendent Duckenfield and
        Superintendents Murray, Greenwood and Marshall for then to make comment
        before the final version is served.    The service date is 22 June and our
        considerations must be completed well before this date.

       Once a consolidated abstract is available which identifies those parts
       thereof with which we do not agree together with those other parts which
       the other parties also disagree, then it will be sensible to circulate these
       to the police witnesses we will call and to hold a meeting to discuss the
       logic of our disagreement so that in evidence tHey can take this into
       account.

                                                about two thousand people entering the ground
                                                through Gate C at the second opening.


                                                  1 would not suggest that a lot of work is

*                                                     done on this but if wcrk has already

                                                      know.

                                                    not as cogent. This is particularly
                                                    significant because the Taylor report is
                                                    quite critical of our alleged failure to
                                                    pick up the blocking of the tunnel on
                                                    a debrief.          If stewards were also involved,
                                                    then the failure on the part of the club
                                                    is at least as great and if the instruction,
                                                    or request,to block the tunr.el car* from
                                                    stewards or from Hr. Lock then the :lub's
                                                    responsibility is correspondingly increased.




                                           b.     1988 tunnel closure - ex-sergeant Higgins has given a
                                                  statement to West Midlands Police saying in essence in 1988
                                                  just before the kick-off he "received orders to close the
                                                  tunnel because the pens were full*.

                                                  Other officers have said they remember the same instruction
                                                  being given but none of them by whom.

                                                  It is believed that none of the above     was actually given
                                                  in evidence at the public Inquiry.

                                                  Two Liverpool fans - Peter Jfletcalf to supply names - have
       N   '                                      given statements that they saw stewards and police sealing
                                                  the gate and in fact there were more stewards than police
                                                  officers.                                       "

                                                  The above needs to be pursued.      Who was on duty at that
                                                  end of the ground in 1988?    What do any of these officers
                                                  remember of the tunnel closure and alleged verbal order
                                                  to do that?    It may be that the instruction to close the
                                                  gate came from the Club.     If it can be shown that many
                                                  stewards were involved then the Club through their agents
                                                  (stewards) should have known of this and their arrangements
                                                  subsequently, ie 1989, seemed to have failed to take account
                                                  of the 1988 experience which increases their liability.

                                4.               The preparation of such a plan is an essential
                                                     part of our case that the collapse of the
                                                     barrier was the factor which turned an already
                                                      serious incident into a major disas*er.     It
                                                     cannot be denied that there would h&ve been
                                                     fatalities and serious injuries in the absence
                                                     of that collapse because it is clear that
                                                     there were some fatalities in pen 4 . The
                                                     evidence which we already have does tend to '
                                                     show, hoever, that much of the fatal!tv occurred
                                                     in the area in front of the collapsed'barrier.
                                                     At present our evidence consists of the rather
                                                     limited plan placed before the Enquiry and the
                                                     factual statements of the officers directly
                                                     concerned in the rescue. My feeling is that
                                                     this evidence would be stronger if presented

                                                     produced at the Inquest,     we have an Order that
                                                     such material c a n b e received in evidence at
                                                     the trial and it would be much more difficult
                                                     for our opponents to attack a plan prepared
                                                     directly from the Inquest naterie.l t*an it
                                                    would be in respect of a case dependant
                                                    principally on oral evidence.

                                  Peter Metcalf has been informed by West Midlands Police that they do not
                                  have such a plan.    we need to collate the evidence given to the recent
                                  Inquest and to prepare a plan, possibly colour coded for ease of reference

                 5.   Whether anyone can re member what was the reason for
                        the Police suggesting that there ought to be a
                        second gate in at least one of the raiial fencec
                        when alterations were being made to the ground
                        in the summer of 1985.


                 5.   The reference here is to a letter of 2nd May 1985
                             from South Yorkshire C.C. to Eastwoods, their
                             response of 8th May 1985 and finally the
                             South Yorkshire C.C. response to Eastwoods
                             of 10th May 1985. You will see that in the
                             last letter there is a reference to the
                             proposed additional gate in the radial fences
                             being included primarily at the request of
                             the South Yorkshire Police.




                  5* Summer 1985

                  There is evidence of correspondence between County, the police and Eastwoods
                  concerning new fences and of the police asking for an additional gate in
                  the radial fences. Copies of any correspondence on this issue by all parties
                  to be recovered and highlighted together with any information we have as
                  to why the police made this request.

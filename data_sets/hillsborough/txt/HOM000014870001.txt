Dear Sirr

I write to ask you most strongly to ensure that Hr. Wright
Chief Constable of South Yorkshire is held responsible for his
officers actions and the honourable thing is done by accepting
his resignation.


I also enclose a copy letter which if you read it will show you
another case of bad management at work.

Having written to you on two occasions before and not receiving
the courtesy of even an acknowledgement I hope to receive a
reply to this letter.

Yours faithfully,
 The Managing Director,
 Wembley Stadium Limited,
 We,bley
 LONDON

                                         15th August 1989

 Dear Sirs,

 On Saturday 12th August I attended Wembley Stadium for the
 Charity Shield match between Liverpool and Arsenal.

I left St. Helens at 8.15 a.m. and arrived at Wembley at
1.05p.m.     At 1.30 p.m. I made my way to the Stadium.    I
went in Block F as per my ticket and eventually found
Entrance 78 as per my ticket.         I was stopped at the
entrance 78 by a Steward who looked at my scarf and said
you are a Liverpool      fan you have to go to another
entrance.      He told me the number and pointed in the
general direction.     I proceeded to this other entrance
where I was again told to go to another entrance.          I
eventually arrived at this entrance and a man took my
ticket off me without a word and handed me another ticket
and then said "You on your own, this is a good seat -just qo
up there”.

I climbed up yet more stairs and then I started on a walk
which I thought was never going to end.            I later
discovered I had had to walk from Block Fwhere my original
ticket was for to Block D.   I walked and walked along this
corridor which I later found out was the Olympic Gallery.
Eventually feeling very hot and bothered I found the seat I
had been re-allotted.    When I sat down in it I could not
see properly as there was a sort of yellow rail in front of
me and the only way I could have seen was to bend my head
right down.

By this time I was very annoyed.  I went out to the Steward
and asked to see someone in authority, he asked me what was
wrong I explained, and he said just sit anywhere and I said
and supposing someone comes in with a ticket for the seat I
am sitting in, I will have to move again.    He said it was
not his fault and I told him that was why I had asked to
see someonein authority.
He went away and returned with a gentleman in grey pants,
white shirt and carrying a walkie talkie in one hand and a
wad of tickets in the other hand/ who asked me what the
trouble was.    I told him.    He said just pick your seat
and I will give you a ticket for it.     I said the seat I
wanted to sit in was the seat I had purchased at the
Anfield Ticket Office the day after the tickets went on
sale for the price of £15.     I told him I did not want to
sit up in the Olympic Gallery away from all the Liverpool
Supporters, away from my two daughters who were in another
part of the ground closer to to the original place I should
have been sitting and whom I was to meet outside Block F at
the end of the game.

He could see I was getting agitated and said that it was
not ills fault when I asked him why X could not sit in the
seat I bought a ticket for.    He said that the Aragnai and
Liverpool fans had both been given tickets for the «anMj>
area and that they had decided to move the Liverpool fans.
When I again complained he said it was not his fault and I
asked him whose fault it was and the n he said 'those famous
words we heard so often last- year nit was just an
unfortunate happening*.


3 started the day with a £15 ticket for Block F Row 20 Seat
No- ‘4 which 1 purchased fran the Anfield Ticket Office
after .handing in the appropriate voucher from my Paddock
Match Book.     That ticket was taken from me and I was
handed a £35 Olympic Gallery ticket when I c mplained about
the view from that seat I was handed yet another £35
Olympic Gallery ticket.

I wish to protest most strongly as follows

How was it possible for tickets to be sold at Anfield to a
season ticket holder and also to be sold to Arsenal fans ?

Who is to blame for this ?   It is not "just an unfortunate
happening" it is gross bad management.

Why was this not realised before and why were the Liverpool
fans the ones to be moved ?

Why were we shoved upstairs to the Olympic Gallery which
was full of business men, foreigners and to add insult to
injury for me personally I was sitting next to two Arsenal
fans with an Arsenal fan sitting behind me.     I was told
the reason I could not sit in the seat I had purchased a
ticket for was because of the Arsenal fans being there but
I ended up sitting between the self same fans and infront
of then.

The ticket I purchased was from Anfield, I gave the
appropriate voucher in and paid my £15 the day after the
tickets went on sale.   If I had bought the ticket from one
of the many touts who were selling then outside the stadium
and along Wembley Way I could have understood it but as
things stand I can see absolutely no valid reason for me
having   to go through such a terrible time and end up in a
seat I   did not want to be in surrounded by Arsenal fans and
other    people who were definitely not Liverpool Season
Ticket   Holders like myself.

I await to hear from you with an explanation of the above.

Yours faithfully,

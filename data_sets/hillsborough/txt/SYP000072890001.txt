Dated                      130589


               I am M r                          =* and     I isive at the above address with my wife

               a n d family.          I have   been a Liverpool                fan as       long as      I can remember

               and    I have      been going     to the games for                16 or      17 years.



               A friend of mine,                                got me my ticket and                  I tra v e l l e d down

               to S h r e w s b u r y on the a f t e r n oo n of F r i d a y            14 April   1989    (140489)     to

                                       came down wit h me



               We all    set      off from S h r e w s b u r y at about 9am on S a t u r d a y              15 April      1989

               (150489)     to go to S h e f f i e l d     in two       cars.

                                                                                                         S1715



We stop p e d at about 20                   past 9    (0920)        at H a p p y Eater   cafe for    some

breakfast.               I don't       know exactly where               it was.



We set off a gain at about                     10am    (1000)        and apart    from stopping          once    for

petrol          for a few minutes             we d i d n ’t    stop a g a i n until      we got    to the

g r o u n d and        parked up at           about    half past 1'1am (1130).              We    parked    in

the       car    park of a pub called the Sportsman,                         the same     place    that we

parked          last year,          about     15 minutes from the ground.



We had a smooth journey to S h e f f i e l d with no delays and                            it      was    very

cft^iet whe n we got there                   because    it was        so early.
      \

The       s p o r t s m a n was     just    opening and so we want              in there    for a drin

We    had a r r a n g e d to see my dad,                                                 and my sister,

                                  , and my dad *s trie n d ,                          , at the     pub as       they

were       travelling          up     from Liverpool.



We st a y e d there            for two and a half              hours and       I had a drink and a few

bottles          of beer.           We all    left the        pub at about 2 pm (1400 hrs)                and

took       the    15 minute walk             to the ground.



There        were no Police            on the way to the ground other                    than 2 vans       full

outside another                pub closer        tothe        ground.



                                     ground the
                                                                                            'v
people          just    full      from the     turnstiles           to outside     the main gates.



We s t a r t e d making             our way towards           the    terraces     turnstiles      on the

right.           We only knew w hi c h way to go because we had been there                                before.
                                                                                                         PAGE
                                                                                                         81715



There were       two moun V M l        officers          in the      crowd    inbetween the t u rnstiles

a n d the   gates and they were                trying        to move       everyone     back but they

d i d n ’t seem to know exac t l y what                  to do.        When    I was    in the middle          of

the    crowd    it was getting            u nc o m f o r t a b l e   but   then for some        reason    the

m o u n t e d officers     just       left and then there was                  chaos.        I was   pushed

f o r ward s and to my          left    until      I was        in the      left hand corner where

the    side wall        meets    the turnstile wall.



The    crush got        bad and there were                kids       in there and      I. remember      a man       by

me    panicking about           his    lads    safety.           We had to      push against         the wall

to    prevent    him and us from getting                     squashed.



It was      so bad that         I c o u l d n ’t move        the short        distance       to the turnstile

on my right.            It was a real           struggle         to get across         and    it must    have

taken me 30 to 35 minu t e s                to get        from the         outer gates       into the

turnstile,       a distance           ois o n i y 20 to 25 yards.



I could see         people were         getting          ntTrt in the        crush and       I remember

people      being    pulled over the             small       railings        on the    right.        I also

remember       seeing     people       s truggling         to    push themselves         back out       towards

Leppings       Ln but     it was       v ir tu a l l y    impossible against            the    push of the

crowd.



I e ve nt u a l l y got    into the turnstile and                      the old guy in there            took ages

to    check my ticket and              let me through.               He was    very slow and          infact    he

gave me      back   the wrong          part    of the ticket.



When    I got through there was                  no      crush at all,         it was about          10 to 3 pm

(1450 hrs)       an d    I went       to the     toilet.

I then rnet up with                                    in the    c o urtyard and      I remember      seeing

some S t e wards            on the    inside    of the turnstile         I had come thro u g h and

some Po l i c e Officers             by the gate on the           right of those t u rnstiles as                I

had    come     through w h i c h was          shut.



I w a n te d to go to the N o r t h West                upper terrace where we went               last year

but                 5 aid    that you    c o u l d n ’t get    through so,     beings as      it was

getting        lat^ and we were w or ri ed about miss i n g                  the match,     we just went

straight        into \ ^ t u n n e l      w hi c h was    the only way we         could see       to get to

the    terraces.



We    gcTt''>Uirough the tunnel               without any       probPswis and we went         into     tne

pen to the           l§ft     of the    tunnel.        It was about          to 3pm     ( 1455 h r s ) and

it was        packed        in there    but    it was    bearable.        3. then noticed that           1 had

g o t s e p e ra t e d f r o m



W i th in 3 or 4 minutes               or even    less,       it got   bad    in there and       3. knew

that     I s h o u l d n ’t have       come    through the tunnel            into the    pens.     I h a d n ’t

w a n t ed    to o ri g i n a l l y but we      c o u l d n ’t see any other way down to the

terraces        and            r had said that we             c o u l d n ’t get through w he re we went

last year.



It was        hot    in there a n d      it was     like being         in a vice with someone

s t e a d i l y t i ghtening         it up.     I was    slowly     pushed forwards        towards       the

front        of the     pen.



 efore        the kick off           I had got    turned arouncfSend I c o u l d n ’t turn back

to §«e       the match.          I m i ss ed    the kick       off and    I ^ s   having t r o u b l e

A couple       of blokes were          helping me and giving me encouragement.                         They

said that        they were going         to try and get me to the front and out                        over

t h e fence.



My    right arm had got           trapped      inbetween some       people and          it went      totally

dead and        I couldn't      feel    it or move      it.



I remember        near to the front            there was an e 3.cler 3.y white rnan in his

5 0 ’s w ith black hair who was                lying   on the   floor      near       to a barrier.

His    face „was blue and fte was              o b v iously dead.       I d i d n ’t want       to   look at

hi m too       closely b e cause       I was    in a bit of a bad way and ever y t h i n g was

getting        hazy.



The    next     thing    that   I remember was         being    back at the top of the

terraces        by the tunnel.          I d o n ’t know how      I got there or who              helped me

but    I was     in a state       of shock and         I just went      back out along           the

t u n n e 1.



I saw people           dead on the      floor w ith      coats over       them and       people working

on them and          I remember     looking to see         if any of them were my mates                    but

they were        not    luckily.



I remember        seeing about 23 Police O f f icers              come      into the         courtyard

thro u g h the gate        that    had been on the         right as       I had       come    in through

the    turnstiles        earlier.       That gate was open now.



E v e r yo n e was     shouting at      the Police to get        to the pens           to help       the

injured.         It a p p ea re d to    be a total      shock   to them and whilst             some went

down the tunnel           the   rest    just seined to mill         ar o u n d   in    a daze.

             It was     shortly after         that    the firemen a r r i v e d and then something           began

             to get done.          They knew what        they were      doing,     they were org a n i s e d and

             they got on with helping.



             I remember        seeing   some firemen          bring   out a young     teenage    lad that       had

             gone and the two of them w o r k ed on him and brought him back.                           They

             then     put him      into an a m b ul an ce and took       him away.



             I sat down on the steps              of one of the        portacabins      in the   next

             cou r t y a r d and had a cigarette and just sat there                    I suppose   I was     in a

             state     of shock.        I stayed      in the    courtyard a rea until        I had met     up

             with     everyone      I had tra v e l l e d with and we       then left the ground

             I had bruising              my   chest and       I was   unable H o    use my arm for a couple

             of days

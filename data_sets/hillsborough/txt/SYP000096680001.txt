HILLSBOROUGH INQUIRY - SOUTH YORKSHIRE POLICE


You will recall t h a t a t th e pre-inquiry m eeting on April 22th Lord Ju stic Taylor
indicated th a t any body against whom any allegation was to be made would be [nformed
of it and th e su b stan ce of the evidence supporting it.

You will a p p r e c ia te th a t th e task of assembling the evidence for th e Inquiry is a
form idable one. And s ta te m e n ts are still being tak en . However, it seem ed rig^it to le t
you have w hat m ust be a preliminary indication of critic ism s which may be levelled a t
the South Yorkshire Police as soon as possible befo re th e comrrver-.cement of th e
Inquiry,   We su sp ect th a t you are already aw are of the general th ru s t o i critic ism s
which have been m ade and th a t what is s e t o ut in this l e tte r will be no surprise to you.

T he-follow ing a re th e main gen eral criticism s which so fur appear from th e evidence
available to us:-

1.     Failure to ta k e any a d e q u a te step s to control supporters so t h a t the crush, which
       built up from about 2.20 to 2.30pm outside the Leppings Lane e n tran cb to th e
       ground and which led to the decision to open 'C' g a te because of a perceived
       danger to life, did not occur. In p articu lar, th e r e were not proper arran g e m en ts
       t rv r h u A o t '   tpnr\r   at   a      onougn     dicta.nrro   fronn   tno   ground   an<j   I n c u f f ic;«3nt
       officers w ere available to control th e crowd outside th e turnstiles,              Having
       regard to th e lim ited sp ace available, the disposition of mounted police may n ot
       have been of any use and may have c o n s titu te d a positive danger. It she uld
       have been an tic ip a te d th a t many supporters would arriv e shortly b e fo re £___
                                                                                          ic k - o f f
       and t h a t some would n ot have tick ets. Steps should have been taken to stop
       n o n -tick et holders g e ttin g near the ground and adding to the congestion.



                                                       1.
2.     Failure by officers outside to liaise adequately with those inside the g 'o u n d and
       vice versa. There w ere in addition problems with radio com m unications and th e
       noise of the crowd ren d ered such tannoy or loudspeaker announcem ents (if any)
       as w ere made ineffe ctiv e. When it was decided th a t a g a te or g a t e s must be
       opened to reiieve pressure outside (and the decision to open gates m ay Well have
       been a n ecessary one in the circum stances), th e re were no steps tak en to ensure
       th a t th e r e was any police or stew ard presence to p revent those en terin g going to
       the tunnel which led onto the already overcrowded Pens 3 and                 it ought to
       have been realised th a t without such presence all those coming in ':he gates
       w ere likely to go down th e tunnel because of inadequacy of signing and because
       the tunnel was the only visible way to the terracing.

       No step s were taken to monitor properly the s ta t e of Pens 3 and k. O fficers
       ought to have been s tatio n ed in the tunnel and/or a t the re a r of the pens and
       should in conjunction with those a t the front have ensured th a t the pens did not
       b ecom e too full. It was known t h a t- th e r e was likely to be a full house and th a t
       it svas essential to ensure an even distribution of sp e c ta to rs in all the pens on
                                                                    -      r   w   i *a v •    -w• ^w w*   w   *   V > ’wl I   ■   IVI   ( V t

       the te r ra c e s , p articu larly as the decision had been m ade to give Live pool th e
       smaller end of the ground.

       When people began to be crushed and to lose th eir lives, the o ffice rs in fro n t of
       Pens 3 and 4 took too long to r e a c t to what was happening. They s e e r r e d to be
       thinking in te rm s of prevention of disorder and pitch invasion rath er th an safety.
       There was no proper guidance given to the individual o ffice rs because r.o prop?
       plans had been m a c e to deal with overcrowding in th e pens. The g a te s leading
       on to the pitch w ere not opened in tim e and, when they were, o ffic e rs w ere
       initially trying to p revent people g ettin g out. O fficers seem ed not to know what
       they shouid do and, although many individual o ffice rs showed g reat p resen ce of
       mind and devotion to duty, valuable minutes w en t by before the n a tu re of what
       was happening was ap p reciated .

       There w ere inadequate contingency plans to deal w ith                         th e sort of em erg en cy
       which aro se. In p articu lar, the em ergency services may                    not have been called as
       expeditiously as they shouid have been and insu fficien t                      arra n g e m e n ts had been
       made to en able them to gain access to th e ground. Help                       for th e injured was not
       co -o rd in ated and no use was made of the tannoy system                     to explain to s p e c ta to r s
       w hat had happened or to organise assistance.

       Since th e r e was no chance th a t all th o s e trying to e n ter the ground wouid be
       able to do so by 3pm, consideration should have been given to d efe rrin g th e
       kick-off a t a much e a rlie r stage. It seerns th a t it was not until about 2.55 th a t
       this ste p was considered and by then it was thought to be too la te because the
       te am s w ere coming out.                  It shouid have been clear much earlie r tihat th e
       k i c k - o f f m u s t b e p o s t p o n e d and t h a t a d e q u a t e s t e p s w e r e t a k e n to g iv e
       assurance to those trying to get in th a t there was a postponem ent. Th:s might
       h a v e r e l i e v e d t h e p r e s s u r e an d o b v i a t e d th e n e e d to open t h e g a t e s .

Shouid any fu rth e r specific m a tte r s which might result in criticism s com e                                 to our
a tte n tio n , we shall of course le t you know of them.

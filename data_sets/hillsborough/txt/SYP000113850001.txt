            At 9 . 0 0 a m    on S a t u r d a y    15 April     1989     I commenced           duty at C l a y w h e e l s

            Lane Traffic Office,                   and w ith a driver          Police Con s t a b l e 3 9 2 Auty,             I

             commenced        patrol        in a liveried Police              Range Rover,          call    sign OHY'i.

            Throughout         the m o r n i n g we        inspected     the Ml M o t o r w a y and all            of the

             other    d e s i g n a t e d and      signed     routes    for    the      football      traffic.

            At a p p r o x i m a t e l y    1.40pm     the    same    day,    I collected         the Ass i s t a n t    Chief

            Constable         (Operations)           Mr.     Jackson,    from Police H e a d q u a r t e r s and

             conveyed him to the H i l l s b o r o u g h F o o tball                 Stadium.

            Whilst      en route           to   the gr o u n d along P e n i s t o n e Road,          I was    conscious

            that     the Pol i c e O f f i c e r work i n g          traffic at Hillf o o t Bridge was                  only

            a l l o w i n g a single            lane of traffic        to travel         towards     the    ground,      when

vehicles.              I looked towards L e D p i n g s                    Lane and saw what a p p e a r e d                     to

be     a mass          pitch         invas i o n with s p e c t a t o r s             climbing      over     the      perimeter

were    reaching              over        the    fencing          into    the    terracing.

As   I approached                   the    goal       area    im m e d i a t e l y    in front      of the         terracing,

I could see that                     the    perimeter             track was          filled wit h s p e c t a t o r s and

F!olice        officers             and a number             of    casualties were             being a t t e n d e d            by St.

           already d e a d „

           I. saw that        the       perimeter       gate      to No.        3 enclosure was open,               taut   it was

           b l o c k e d by   two       b o d i e s , the   lower one was            lying       face down and

           overhanging         onto       the    perimeter         track.

           I spoke      to u n i f o r m e d     officers         who were          near    the gate a n d told them to

           w ere    being     helped       t h r o u g h the gate            onto    the    playing area.

           Although       people were            being      pressed a g a i n s t          the   fence,     I could not        see

           any     bodies     on the       ground and no one a p p e a r e d                 to be dead,          although a

           number     were     in obvi o u s        distress.

           Throughout         this       time     people were            still climbing           over the       perimeter

           I returned         to en c l o s u r e    No.     3 and          I saw that       the gate was          still    not

           clear and the o f f i c e r s were                having          difficulty          in lifting a powerfully

                  It man who was            lying    face        downwards,          his    lower       body being       trapped

            y other      bodies         inside      the enclosure.                  I instructed the officers                to

           pull     the ma n t h r o u g h the          gateway         rather       than try to          lift    him.     This

           we e v e n t u a l l y did w i t h a number                 of    officers       taking       hold of the man

           an d    pulling     him t h r o u g h onto            the    playing       area.       Having     cleared the

           gate     it was     then       possible       to move            bodies    from the          enclosure.

           Police Officers              and s p e c t a t o r s    in       their    endeavours          to help,    were

           getting      in each others way.                      I then       physi c a l l y    pulled some away and

           told    them to make a chain and                       pass       bodies along the             chain onto the

           playing area.            I then w a l k e d along                 the    perimeter       track    towards

As   I was      returning             to the gate at No.             3 enclosure          I saw a small            boy

I lifted him up the                     fencing.        However,         his shoe      lace    became       entangled

in the wire              fencing        and    1 was    unable      to    lift     him further.            I then

shou t e d to D e t e c t i v e          Sgt.     Gutcher     who was        inside the        enc l o s u r e and he

reached over a number                      of bodies and         released the b o y ’s foot and                    I was

then able           to    lift       him up the fence w here                he was     lifted from the             top

by another           uniformed           officer.

I moved along              the       perime ter      track    to the        gate giving        access       to

enclosure No.              3 and        I saw a small         boy who a p p e a r e d to         be dead         pressed

against       the fence.                I could do nothing               to help this         small       boy as the

fence at that              point was           of a n a r rower       and smaller         gauge and as a

result      I could            not    get my hands         through        to take hold of him.

Throughout           this       time     I was       conscious       that    other     spect a t o r s were

walking       over        the    bodies        and   climbing       onto     the    perimeter       fencing.           On

reaching        the       gate to No.            3 enclosure,         I saw that once a g a i n Police

o fficers and spectators,                        in their     efforts        to get      people     out,        were

getting       in each others                  way and a c h i e v i n g     nothing.          I t h erefore moved

them back           from       the    gate and       told them once again               to form a chain.                 I

remained at              the    gate and wit h D e t e c t i v e          Sgt.     Morton,     Headquarter-

Seri o u s Crime           Squad,        I began to        clear     the     gateway      into the

enclosure.                At    this     stage I saw S u p e r i n t e n d e n t    G r e e n w o o d who was

standing        to        my    right      hand side.        He was       holding a loud hailer.                   I

told him to               get    up on the fence and to ask                      people to     back       off and      if

possible        lift       bodies        back      towards     the    rear    of the enclosure.                 Whilst

Superintendent                 Greenwood         continued to use            the    loud hailer,           I,

 be said that             there were m any other Po l i c e                       officers     involved,

    including       some       spectators.

 Once       the e n c l o s u r e    had been          cleared,         I returned to the            perimeter

 track and n o t i c e d            that    the       fencing        had been broken open and                  bent

    upwards.        I was       informed         by     Inspector          Dews    that this      had been done             by

 Police        officers         and as such             it had enab l e d a number of s pectators to

    clamber      thro u g h     onto    the      perimeter           track.

    It was     only after           I returned to the                 playing area that            I noticed that

 my trousers             and    shoes were            covered        in vomit and         I was    conscious          that

    I had    lost my hat and               gloves.          However,         shortly after         I returned to

 the    playing a r e a an officer                      returned my hat to me.

 Once No.         3 and 4 enclo s u r e s               had been           cleared,      I was aware      of

 height e n i n g        of t e n s i o n w ith verbal               a buse and threats           being      directed

 at Police          officers        from      s pectators            who    had    remained     on the       terracing,

    particularly          in enc l o s u r e No.          2.      Threats         and offensive          remarks were

 also       being    d i r e c t e d at Police            offic e r s       by spectators         on the       playing

 area.         I w a l k e d along         the    perimeter           track       speaking    to Sergeants,

 Inspectors          and told them to keep their                            serials      together        and not allow

 a n y officers           to become         isolated as              I b e l i e v e d that   there       could

    possibly      be a s s a u l t s    due to the             frustration,          anger and       overall

S h o r t l y after       this       I noticed that               spectators        on the          playing area were

•drifting        down the        pitch towards               the S pion Kop.              I. b o r r o w e d a radio

a nd   instr u c t e d G r o u n d Control              to ask Pol i c e           officers          on the Spion Kop

end of the          ground       to a d v a n c e     up the        pitch to prevent Liv e r p o o l                    fans

from getting             close       to the N o t t i n g h a m Forest             supporters.              1 also

inst r u c t e d    Inspe c t o r s an d S e r g e a n t s          to    take     their      serials           down the

playing are a a n d             to sweep         up and       hold       the Liverpool              fans    on the

halfway          line.      I also a s k e d G r o u n d Control                 to deploy           dog    handlers          on

the    perimeter          track       in front        of the S p i o n Kop to               prevent a pitch

invasion,

I was      joined at           the    central        circle        by S u p e r i n t e n d e n t    C h a p m a n who

having       heard my          i n s t r uctions      had m o v e d       up with the           officers          from the

S p i o n Kop      to the       half w a y     line.         He    remained there             in charge           of the

line     of officers.                My    i n s t r uctions were             that L i verpool          supporters

s h o u l d be a l l o w e d     to       remain on the            playing       area until           a d e c i s i o n had

been made as             to w h e t h e r     the    game w o u l d       continue.

I was      then joined           by A s s i s t a n t Chief             Constable        (Operations)             Mr.

J a c k s o n who was          in civilian           clothes.            He    informed me           that       the game

had now been a b a n d o n e d and                  it was a g r e e d that an a n n o u n c e m e n t              should

be made          over    the    public address               system       that     the    game       had ben

abandoned,          but a s k i n g        suppo r t e r s    to    remain       in the ground              until       the

fleet      of a m b u l a n c e s     had     left    the     s t a d i u m wit h      injured s p ectators who

were     being      taken       to hospital.

So m e t i m e    after 4.00pm,             having      established             that     the a m b u l a n c e s and

other e m e r g e n c y        vehicles        had    left        the    stadium,        it was a g r e e d to allow

spectators          to    leave       the     ground.         I directed Superintendent                         Chapman

and Chief          Inspector Su m n e r             to take a contingent                  of u n i f o r m e d officers

from the          cordon at          the    halfway      line       into Pen i s t o n e Road              to    prevent

As o f f icers          left    the     line      under S u p e r i n t e n d e n t Chapman,             I moved

o f f i c e r s across         the    pitch to m a i n t a i n a continuous                      line of u n iformed

officers          for    the    full       width    of the         playing area.              Once    the    spectators

had    left Leppi ngs Lane,                   I inst r u c t e d a number             of uni f o r m e d     officers

to    remain       inside       e n c l o s u r e No.     3 to      preserve         the    scene and also              to

collect       p r o perty w h i c h had been                 left     there.         They were also              told to

ensure       that       the    bro k e n    crush barrier,             broken        cross member           and broken

fencing were             to    remain       in situ until             they     could be          photographed           by

S cenes      of Crime Officers,

Having       secu r e d the          e n c l o s u r e and     having      been      informed        that    there were

no    problems          outside       the     ground,        I went       to the g y m n a s i u m where           a

temporary mortuary                   had a l r e a d y    been o r g a n i s e d under            the d i rective            of

D e t e c t i v e Chief        Superintendent             Addis and S u p e r i n t e n d e n t          Bates,

l was       then joined           by S u p e r i n t e n d e n t    B r o o k f i e l d who      told me     that

O p e r a t i o n Supp o r t      had      been    i m p l e m e n t e d and    that       large     numbers       of

offic e r s were a r r i v i n g            at    the    ground.          He suggested,            and     I agreed,

that       officers       a r r i v i n g with o u t any specific                 dutie       should be directed

to the       now    vacated N o r t h S tand              for d e p l o y m e n t where           necesary.

Superintendent                Brookfield          u n dertook       to arra n g e      this.

In concl u s i o n        I am s a t i s f i e d        that    the    broken        crush barrier           in enclosure

No.    3    played a crucial                part     in this        unfortunate            tragedy.         The    cross

m ember      had    broken at           the      'neck.’ of the           securing         stand.        Having

s n a p p e d the       cross member             still    under       c o n s i derable       pressure       appears          to

have       been    pushed f o r wards             and d o wnwards          towards         the    playing area and

the    leverage,          prior       to    it breaking,            had    partially          u p r ooted    the now

bent and d i s t or t e d other                  securing      stand.          The    position of the              dead

END OF REP O R T
CHIEF SUPERINTENDENT 3. A. NESBIT - OPERATIONS & TRAFFIC

I am a Chief Superintendent in the South Yorkshire Police and at the present

time I am the Divisional Commander for the Operations & Traffic Division.

At 9-00 a.m, on Saturday 15 April 1989, I commenced duty at Claywheels Lane

Traffic Office,     and with      a driver Police Constable 392 Auty,         I commenced

patrol in a liveried Police Range Rover, call sign 0HY1.

Throughout   the morning we        inspected the Ml motorway and all of the other

designated and signed routes for the football traffic.

At approximately     1.40 p.m.     the   same day,    I collected the Assistant Chief

Constable    (Operations)   Mr.    Jackson,      from Police Headquarters and conveyed

him to the Hillsborough Football Stadium.

Whilst en route to the ground along Penistone Road, I was conscious that the

Police Officer working traffic at Hillfoot Bridge was only allowing a single

lane of traffic to travel towards the ground, when quite clearly there is a

facility to allow two lines         to form at that point, with vehicles entering

Penistone    Road   from    Neepsend     Lane.      Therefore,   together    with   Police

Constable Auty I returned to that location positioned the Range Rover in the

centre of the junction and assisted the uniformed officer to form two lanes

of traffic as previously described.

I remained at Hillfoot       Bridge until        approximately 2.20 p.m.    by this time

traffic was beginning to ease and there was no congestion.                 I then resumed

patrol with Police Constable Auty              and we travelled back towards the City

Centre.

I remained on patrol with Police Constable Auty and at 2.58 p.m. I informed

Force Operations that the designated traffic routes were clear and having

travelled from the City Centre           to Hillsborough Stadium,    I arrived shortly

after   3.00 p.m.   , and   entered      the   stadium on foot   through    the emergency

entrance that gives access to the Gymnasium and the Police Room.               My driver,

Police Constable Auty returned           to West    Bar Police Station to re-fuel the

Range Rover which we had been patrolling in since 9-00 a.m.
                                                   -2-



As    I   approached         the   Gymnasium     entrance, I    was    approached       by    Inspector

Sewell, 'F' Division, who told me that the game had been stopped and that

evacuation       of    the    Leppings    Lane    terracing    was    taking place      and    that   he

believed a number of people had been injured.

I immediately went on to the playing area by way of the access gate at the

Penistone Road end of the North Stand which was clear of vehicles.                             I looked

towards Leppings Lane and saw what appeared to be a mass pitch invasion with

spectators climbing over the perimeter fencing and some were being assisted

by uniformed Police Officers who were reaching over the fencing into the

terracing.

As I approached the goal area immediately in front of the terracing, I could

see that the perimeter track was filled with spectators and Police Officers

and   a   number      of     casualties   were    being    attended    by St.    John's Ambulance

personnel and uniformed Police Officers.

Upon reaching the perimeter fencing of enclosure No. 3, to my horror I could

see bodies piled on top of each other with other spectators being pressed

against the fencing, a number of those appeared to be already dead.

I saw     that   the       perimeter   gate    to No.     3 enclosure    was    open,    but    it was

blocked    by two bodies,           the lower one was lying face down and overhanging

onto the perimeter track.

I spoke to uniformed officers who were near the gate and told them to remove

the bodies.       I walked along the perimeter track to enclosure No. 4, where I

saw Inspector Dews,           'D' Division and Inspector White,           'F' Division, who was

on the perimeter fencing helping spectators to climb out of enclosure No. 4.

The perimeter gate was open and people were being helped through the gate

onto the playing area.

Although people were being pressed against the fence, I could not see any

bodies on the ground and no one appeared to be dead, although a number were
in obvious distress.

Throughout      this time people were still     climbing over the perimeter fence

from enclosure No. 4 and jumping down onto the perimeter track.

I returned to enclosure No.        3 and I saw that the gate was still not clear

and the officers were having difficulty in lifing a powerfully built man who

was    lying    face   downwards, his   lower body   being   trapped   by other bodies

inside the enclosure.       I instructed the officers to pull the man through the

gateway rather than try to lift him.          This we eventually did with a number

of officers taking hold of the man and pulling him through onto the playing

area.    Having cleared the gate it was then possible to move bodies from the

enclosure.

Police Officers and spectators in their endeavours to help, were getting in

each others way.        I then physically pulled some away and told them to make a

chain and pass bodies along the chain onto the playing area.             I then walked

along the perimeter track towards enclosure No. 2.             I could see that there

was room in that enclosure, but the dividing fence was preventing any

lateral movement of spectators.         A number of Police Officers were assisting

the spectators to climb over the dividing fence and I told some uniformed

officers to enter enclosure No. 2 and attempt to alleviate the pressure in

enclosure No. 3 by moving spectators through the gate in the dividing fence

underneath the West Stand wall.

As    I was    returning to the   gate at No.   3 enclosure I saw a small boy in

obvious distress.        I reached through the fence and      hand over hand I lifted

him up the      fencing.    However his   shoe lace became     entangled in the wire

fencing and I was unable to lift him further.           I then shouted to Detective

Sergeant Gutcher who was inside the enclosure and he reached over a number

of bodies and relased the boy's foot and I was then able to lift him up the

fence where he was lifted from the top by another uniformed officer.
 I moved along the perimeter track to the gate giving access to enclosure No.

 3 and I saw a small boy who appeared to be dead pressed against the fence. I

 could do nothing to help this small boy as the fence at that point was of a

 narrower and smaller gauge and as a result I could not get my hands through

 to take hold of him.

 Throughout this time I was conscious that other spectators were walking over

 the bodies and climbing onto the perimeter fencing.                            On reaching the gate to

 No.    3 enclosure,           I saw that once again Police Officers and spectators, in

 their     efforts        to    get   people    out,     were    getting in       each others    way    and

 achieving nothing.              I therefore moved them back from the gate and told them

 once    again     to     form    achain.      I remained at the           gate and with Detective

 Sergeant       Morton,        Headquarter     Serious      Crime   Squad,      I began   to    clear    the

 gateway into the enclosure.                   At this stage I saw Superintendent Greenwood

 who was standing to my right hand side.                        He was holding a loud hailer.                 I

 told    him     to get     up on     the    fence    and    to ask people         to back off and        if

 possible       lift      bodies      back   towards        the rear     of the    enclosure.      Whilst

Superintendent Greenwood continued to use                       the loud hailer, I, together with

Inspector Harvey, Sergeant Gutcher and Sergeant Morton, began to clear the

No.     3 enclosure.           It has to be said that all of the bodies we managed to

extract appeared to be dead.

Whilst     carrying       out the evacuation I              saw that unformed officers           were now

removing        bodies    up the      terracing      towards the       tunnel     underneath    the West

Stand.      Once an open area had been achieved, valiant efforts were made to

revive people by mouth to mouth resuscitation and cardiac massage.                                 Whilst

not     being    able     to identify        all   of       the officers     involved,    I     can    name

Inspector       Harvey, Sergeants            Gutcher        and Morton    and     Detective     Constable

Humphries,       'C'     Division,     although it has to be said that there were many

other Police Officers involved, including some spectators.
                                                                                                        " W



                                                -5-



Once the enclosure had been cleared, I returned to the perimeter track and

noticed    that    the   fencing had    been     broken    open and bent upwards.               I was

informed by Inspector Dews that this had been done by Police Officers and as

such   it had enabled a number of spectators                 to clamber through on to the

perimeter track.

It was    only after I returned to the                playing area that I noticed that my

trousers and shoes were covered in vomit and I was conscious that I had lost

my hat and gloves.         However, shortly after I returned to the playing area an

officer returned my hat to me.

Once No. 3 and 4 enclosures had been cleared, I was aware of heightening of

tension with verbal abuse and threats being directed at Police Officers from

spectators who had remained on the terracing, particularly in enclosure No.

2.     Threats     and   offensive     remarks    were     also    being      directed   at   Police

Officers by spectators on the playing area.                   I walked along the perimeter

track speaking to Sergeants, Inspectors and told them to keep their serials

together and not allow any officers to become isolated as                      I believed that

there could possibly be         assaults due          to the frustration, anger and overall

distress which was apparent on many spectators faces.

Shortly    after    this    I noticed    that     spectators       on   the    playing   area    were

drifting    down    the pitch    towards   the     Spion    Kop.        I borrowed a radio and

instructed Ground Contrtol to ask Police Officers on the Spion Kop end of

the ground to advance up the pitch to prevent Liverpool fans from getting

close to the Nottingham Forest supporters.                 I also instructed Inspectors and

Sergeants to take their serials down the playing area and to                         sweep up and

hold the Liverpool fans on the halfway                line. I also asked Ground Control to

deploy dog handlers on the perimeter                  track in front of         the Spion Kop to

prevent a pitch invasion.

I was joined at the central circle by Superintendent Chapman who having
heard my instructions had moved up with the officers from the Spion Kop to

 the halfway line.        He remained there in charge of the line of officers. My

 instructions were that Liverpool supporters should be allowed to remain on

 the playing area until a decision had been made as to whether the game would

 continue.

I was then joined by Assistant Chief Constable (Operations) Mr. Jackson who

was    in    civilian    clothes.         He    informed    me    that   the   game had    now     been

abandoned and it         was     agreedthat an announcement should be              made over the

public       address    system     that    the    game     had    been   abandoned,     but      asking

supporters to remain in the ground until the fleet of ambulances had left

the stadium with injured spectators who were being taken to hospital.

Some time after 4.00 p.m., having established that the ambulances and other

emergency vehicles had left the stadium, it was agreed to allow spectators

to leave the ground.            I directed Superintendent Chapman and Chief Inspector

Sumner to take         a contingent       of uniformed officers from the cordon at the

halfway line into        Penistone Road to prevent any confrontation between the

rival supporters.

As officers      left the       line under Superintendent Chapman,              I moved officers

across the pitch to maintain a continuous line of uniformed officers for the

full width of the playing area.                Once the spectators had left Leppings Lane,

I instructed a number of uniformed officers to remain inside enclosure No. 3

to    preserve   the    scene    and   also     to collect       property   which had     been    left

there.      They were also told to ensure that the broken crush barrier,                      broken

cross member and broken fencing were to remain in-situ until they could be

photographed by Scenes of Crime Officers.

Having      secured the enclosure         and having been informed that there were no

problems     outside    the     ground,   I went     to the Gymnasium where           a temporary

mortuary had already been organised under the directive of Detective Chief
Superintendent Addis and Superintendent Bates.

I was then joined by Superintendent Brookfield who told me that Operation

Support had been implemented and that large numbers of officers were

arriving at the ground.                He suggested, and I agreed, that officers arriving

without    any    specific        duties      should    be directed to the now vacated North

Stand for deployment where necessary.                         Superintendent Brookfield undertook

to arrange this.

In conclusion I am satisfied that the broken crush barrier in enclosure No.

3 played a crucial part in this unfortunate tragedy.                              The cross member had

broken    at    the     'neck'    of    the        securing    stand.       Having snapped the cross

member         still    under     considerable         pressure       appears     to    have    been   pushed

forwards and downwards towards the playing area and the leverage, prior to

it   breaking,         had    partially       uprooted       the     now   bent   and    distorted         other

securing stand.              The position of the dead and injured people immediately

below the broken             barrier and on either side of the perimeter gate giving

access to enclosure No. 3, does, I believe, support my observation.

Some years ago I was present at a local 'Derby' between Rotherham United and

one of the Sheffield teams at Millmoor Football Ground.                                 The boundary wall

at the Tivoli end of the ground collapsed causing spectatoros to spill out

on   to   the    perimeter        track      and    playing        area.    Spectators         who   had   been

standing    well       back    from    the    wall     because       of a surge        in the    crowd were

catapulted      over     the     top of      the    people    who     had been    leaning       against     the

boundary wall which at Miilmoor is level with the playing surface.                                         This

could not have occurred at Hillsborough because of two significant points

(1) the terracing is approximately 2'6" lower than the playing surface, and

(2) people who were pushed forward would undoubtedly have collided with the

     perimeter fencing and then fallen on the top of people who were trapped

     alongside the perimeter wall.
                                    -8-



I remained on duty until 1.30 a.m., the greater part of my time being spent

within Hillsborough Stadium.

            To sum m a r i s e my evidence,            on arrival           at the     perimeter        track at the

            and    could see         bodies     piled on top of each other and other                           spectators

CHIEF SUPERINTENDENT
SOUTH YORKSHIRE POLICE


Further to my statement of the 19 April 1989 and my testimoney to the Tribunal
on Thursday 1 June.


To sunmarise my evidence, on arrival at the perimeter track at the Leppings
Lane end of the ground, I irrmediately went to Enclosure 3 and could see bodies
piled on top of each other    and other spectators being pressed upagainst the
fencing, a number of these appeared to be already dead.   From my observations
at that location, I can say that the pile of bodies was situated in Pen 3
between the barrier identified as 124A and the perimeter track fencing,
which is identified on Plan 1340/02 as the area in the squares 4, 5, 6, 7
and 8 of N, O and P.


It is difficult to accurately estimate the number of bodies which were entangled
in a pile four and possibly five deep.   However, taking into account it
took almost 20 minutes to clear Pen 3 I would estimate the number of bodies
to between 60 and 70 in total.


After assessing and instructing officers at Gate 3 I went to Gate 4.
The gate was open, people were being helped onto the playing area, and
although people were being    pressed against the fencing,I could not see any
bodies on the ground and no-one appeared to be dead.


I am satisfied from what I saw that the majority of spectators who
had lost their lives in this tragedy were irrmediately in front of the broken
crush barrier 124A.

           Furt h e r     to my s t a t e m e n t    of the      19 April       1989    (190489)    and my

            te s t i m o n y to the T r i b u n a l     on T h u r s d a y    1 June    (010689).

            To sum m a r i s e my evidence,             on arrival           at the    perimeter    track at the

            L e p p i n g s Lan e    end of the ground,             I i m m e d i a t e l y went to E n c l o s u r e 3

            and     could see        bodies     piled on top of each other and other                       spectators

            being     pressed up a g a i n s t        the fencing,            a number    of these a p p e a r e d    to

            be a l r e a d y dead.          F r o m my o b s e r v a t i o n s at that    location,       I can say .

            that    the    pile of bodies was               situated         in Pen 3 between the          barrier

            identified as            124A and the         perimeter          track    fencing,    which    is

            identified        on P l a n     1340/02 as the area               in the squares 4, 5,             6, 7 and

           8 of N, 0 and P.

            It is d i f ficult         to a c c u r a t e l y   e s t imate    the number of bodies which

           were     entangled         in a pile four and             possi b l y five      deep.     However,

            taking      into a c c o u n t     it took almost 20 m i n u t e s           to clear P e n 3 I would

            estimate       the      number     of bodies        to b e t w e e n 60 and 70 in total.

            After a s s e s s i n g and        instructing        o f f icers at Gate 3 I went            to Gate 4.

            The gate was            open,    people were         being he l p e d onto      the    playing area,

            and a l t h o u g h     people were       being      pressed against          the fencing,          I could

            not see any bodies               on the gro u n d and no-one a p p e a r e d to be dead.

       I saw other            officers and           public        on p i t c h .    Some memb er s       of    public were

       in a d i s tr es se d state.                Saw officers           deal in g w i t h      crowd    I then s ta r te d

       looking          for   the    people       that     I thought were fighting.                    I was m i s l e d due

       to phrase that               I h eard     "THEY A RE ON THE P IT C H. "                I thought         there       had

       been a pitch            invasion.           I w ould have          been better         informed         if I had,

       had my own personal                   radio.       W he n    I got to the L e p p i ng s Lane             end    I was

       still       looking for            people     fighting youths.                I then saw the            pile of dead

       and dying          people behind t he blue                   c ol ou re d fence.          I helped two          people

       over       the    fence and then went to a gate where^ftTher PC's were                                     he 1 ping

       to get       people       out.                led two dead           pj^ple     out of the         crowd and

       carried          them o n ? it a time              onto              f or them to get treatment.                      A

       St.    J ohn's A/fu>ulance man                che ckeik^them and             looked a fter        them.     I then

       went       back/Xo give further a ss i s t a n c e                 to other         officers at the gate

       who were          helping         people get        out.       I noted that         the    people       behi nd the

       bodies were            very a ng ry and a g i t a t e d           their anger        seem ed to be d ir e ct e d

       towa rd s        the Police.           I pulled out several                  people alive,         w i t h help from

       other       officers.             An officer,          I d o n ’t know gets a young               lad out,       I

       w o ul d say he w ould              be about        16 years       old.      He was       gasping       for breath.

       I take hold of this                   lad and       carry him onto            the    pitch.       I carr ie d him

       t hr ou gh a crowd of               people     throu gh a crowd of s u pp or te rs and had to

       force my way through.                     W he n    I placed the y ou th             on the floor a nd got an

       a m b u l a n c e man who          had a r r i v e d    by that      time     by my side to give

       t re at me nt      to the young            lad,     it was      then that       I saw down my            left arm

       a nd side white              coloured spit.               I. had been spat           on whilst      carrying the

       lad t hrough the              crowd.

        CORRESPONDENCE FROM HAMMOND SUDDARDS ABOUT ACCESS TO BRADE'S
        DRAWINGS


        I copied to you Mr Metcalf's fax to me of 8 September asking if
        the South Yorkshire Police could have copies of Brade's drawings,
        prepared at the request of the HSE for Lord Justice Taylor's
        Inquiry. We spoke about this on the telephone and your advice
        was that there was no problem about meeting this request.

        I have discussed it with Lord Justice Taylor. He is prepared for
        the South Yorkshire Police to have copies of Brade's drawings,
        subject to such a facility being made available to the other
        parties to the litigation before Mr Justice Steyn. Either you or
        I could therefore reply to Hammond Suddards to that effect, and
        write to all the other parties concerned.  I am quite happy to do
        it if you prefer. But I do not know who the other parties are.
        Could you kindly let me know?

        All this would be without prejudice to our retaining copyright
        and ownership of the drawings.

        Copies go to Mervyn Jones and Chris Nicholson.

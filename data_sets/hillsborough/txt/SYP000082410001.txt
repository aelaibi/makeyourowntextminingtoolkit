to     their         respective             turnstiles.                      This       w as     the      last     t im e     I saw Alan

Alan      had        only      obtained            the       ground              t i c k e t on F r i d a y        night         14th      April

and      whilst        we      were        talking           at     the          pub    on r o ute        to       the      ga m e      he t o l d    me

t ha t    he w a s n ’t l o o k i n g              forward              to       going       into        the    terraces           at     the

Leppings             Lane      end     because             of      the       crushing            he      had    been     involved             in     las

year      when were              played          the       same         match         against            Nottingham           Forest.

It     t oo k    about         10 m i n u t e s           for      me    to       get      into       the      ground.           I went

through          a turnstile                and       found         my way            to     the s t a n d        without            any problem

taking          my    s e at     at    about          2.45         pm.

I w as      seated          with       the       people            I h ad         travelled              down    with.

While       I was          waiting          for       the         game       to    start         1 looked          round         the      ground

and      noticed           how    crowded             the         centre          section           of    the    Leppings            Lane       ana

ground          and    j ust      a f t sjr      k i c k off            I noticed              pe o p 1 e           i n to        c 1 im b o v e r

the      p e r i m e t e r £ e jp 4 ? in g .

It     came      as    no      surpise           to me            because          it      looked         very     crowded           in     t h at

area.           More       and    more          people            came       o n to     the      pitch         behind       the      Liverpool

goal      and        eventually a Police                           officer             ran o n t o        the    pitch and              the     game

At     t hi s    time       1 certainly                   d i d n ’t r e a l i s e           the      seriousness             of     the

incident             and    fully          expected               the    pitch          to     be     cleared       of      supporters

and      the     game       would          be     continued.

carried away                on m a k e        shift           stretchers.                  Someone             sat     near          to me         had a

radio        and     said         that       someone             h a d died.              I then           began       to    realise               it was

a serious            incident.                We        all s t a y e d        together              in the S t a n d s .                A   police

obviously            to     deter          people          from       going         o n to      the       pitch.            We       decided            to

leav e       the     g r o u n d at         around            3.30     pm fay this                  time       I had        s e e n at            least       f:

people        carried away                   by L i v e r p o o l          fans       on       the     makeshift             stretchers.                      s*

left       the      ground         and      started            to m a k e        our       way       b a ck     to     the       mini         bus.

I s t o p p e d at          a     public         phone            bo;< to call             my       wife       to    assure           here         I was

okay.         As     we     were        walking            along          we w e r e       joined          by                                       .    We

arrived          b a ck at         the      m i ni       bus     at    about          4     pm.        A family             living            in a

house        by w h e r e         the      m i ni       bus    was     parked             invited          us       in g i v i n g           us    tea

and     allowing            us     to      use      their        telephone.                    At a b o u t         4.15     pm m y s e l f

              and        John      Murphy           decided           to w a l k          back       to    the       ground          to       see       if we

could        find        Ian C r a w f o r d            and    Alan Johnson.                        E3ut we         d i d n ’t       Find         them.

We    returned            to      the      house         and     the      occupier,                 a man       named                             d ro v e

myself        and John             Murphy           to     the    hospital                on    the       outskirts              of S h e f f i e l d .

As    we     walked         towards           the        reception             area        of       the    hospital              a    lady         came

towards          us a n d         said,       "Do        either        of y o u           know                                       '       1 said,

Yes."         She        turned         and      ran       back       into       the       hospital.                 We     ran a f t e r            her.

We    saw                -itting           in the          reception area                      he    d i d n ’t a p p e a r           to      be

I asked          him      if he         had      seen         Alan,       he     said          that       he    h a d n ’t a n d             was

obviously            shocked            that        Alan       was     not w i t h             us.        Someone           came to               us a n d

said       that      a    list        of     injured           people          w as       to    be     read         out     by a D o c t o r             in

one     of    the        canteens           so we          made       our      way        th e r e .       Alans          n a me     wasn't

Whilst         we w e r e         at    the        hospital            the       Doctor         who       had     read       out       the      names

At a b o u t        6 pm we t e l e p h o n e d                                   house         and asked              the    others            to     join

us at         the     hospital              in the           m i ni    bus.          They       arrived           at a b o u t         6.30       pm.

When      the        lads        turned          uH                   left       us.       we       then     decided          to m a k e          our

way      to    the        other        hospital              which        was     right         in S h e f f i e l d         City       Centre

where         we    made         enquiries.

We    checked             the     l i st s       of     injured              people          but      A l a n w a s n ’t on            them..        We

as    the      t i me       neared          9    pm we        asked              if we       could         go     to    the m o r t u a r y to

see      if A l a n was            there.               A member                of     the    Red      Cross           came w i t h       us

directing             back       to     the        football            g r o un d.

                          , John Murphy,                                               and      myself          got     out       of    the       rnin

bus      and       eventually               found        the       reception area                    of     the      temporary            mortuary

in a s p o r t s            hall       at       th e    ground.

 A Police             Officer           asked           us    to      examine          a display             of      Polaroid

photographs                 to   see        if we        could         recognise             anyone.              We    both       made         two

checks         of     the        photographs                 but      c o u l d n ’t r e c o g n i s e          Alan        on a n y      of      them.

 The      Police            Officer             went     away         then       came      back       and asked              me    to     t ak e

another            look      paying             particular             attention             to      p h ot o     No    30.        I looked

again         and     then asked                 the     Police           officer          if       it w a s      Alan       Johnson.                He

confirmed             it was           I looked              c lo s e r     and      saw     the       collar          of    his       b l ue     demin

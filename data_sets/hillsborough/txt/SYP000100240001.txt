    RE: HILLSBOROUGH DISASTER - SATURDAY 15 APRIL 1989




•
    On Saturday         the   15th of April          1989,    I commenced duty at Stainforth

    Police    Station at        8.00    a.m.    whereupon       I was    conveyed      to Divisional

    Headquarters,        Doncaster,      along with Police Constables 114 Bradley and

    297 Barnes to meet up with the rest of my serial.                            Upon my arrival I

    liaised with Police           Sergeant       2627 Ashton,         the serial Sergeant.           Our

    serial number was 30.

    We    then    travelled      from     Doncaster      to    Hillsborough       football       ground,

    Sheffield,          in    convoy     in     a    marked      Transit        van,   arriving          at

    approximately five minutes to ten.                       Upon our arrival at the ground we

    entered into the North- Stand where we were briefed by senior officers

    for    the     match      which     was     to   take     place     that     afternoon       between

    Liverpool      and       Nottingham       Forest.         During    this     briefing    we     were

    informed of what parts of the ground had                     been allocated to which fans,

    i.e. North Stand and Leppings Lane                       endto Liverpool and South             Stand

    and Spion Kop to Nottingham Forest.                       We were also made aware of where

    parking      facilities      for     each    set    of    fans     were-and    where     and    when

    trains       were    scheduled to         arrive    at the train           station at 1402 from

Liverpool.              The      briefing             and     points       raised            appeared           to me        to     be       of a

similar          nature        to     the     previous            semi-final               at     which        I had        worked           two

years       before          (Leeds         United        v Coventry).                   We      were     then        briefed          by

Police        Sergeant           Ashton          as    to     individual               duties.           We     were        informed

that       the    match        was     a n all         ticket        affair            w i t h all       tickets            sold      prior

to    t hat      date.

At    approximately                  1115     hours         I t oo k      up m y        ’point'          at     the     roundabout                 at

Leppings          Lan e ,      Penistone              Road North           and Herr is s                Road      North,           together

with Police             Constable            900       Dawson,          our       instructions                were      to a s s i s t

supporters             to    get      to    their       respective                e n ds     of    the       ground,         prevent

opposing          fans       meeting         and       general          crowd          control.

From       taking       up     our     *p o i n t ’ t h e r e       was       a    constant             stream         of    f an s      going

to    the     ground         from      the       direction           of    Wadsley              Bridge        railway            station,

mostly        on the         opposite            side       of    the     road         from       the    bus      station           and

where       we    were.         From        about       1 o'clock             the       stream          of    supporters              had

increased          quite        substantially,                    most     of w h o m           were     Liverpool

supporters.                 These      f ans      were        directed            to    the       North       Stand         or    Leppings

Lane       end    of    the     ground           via L e p g i n g s       Lane.             At    about        this        time,        I

noticed          that       many      of    the       f ans      were     carrying              four     p a c ks      and       some        even

had    two.        Many        of     them were             drinking          the       beer/lager              as     they walked

along       the    road.             Between          this       time     and      about          quarter         to    three         there

was    a    constant           group        of    people          ranging          for       about       l O D — lbO y a r d s           up

Penistone          Road        North,        sat       on w a l l s       and      drinking             from what            appeared              to

be    beer       cans.         When        they       h a d all     g o ne,        there          were       empty      cans        a ll      over

the    pavements             and      walls.           They       did     not      appear          to    be     in a n y         great

hurrytogototheground.

At a b o u t      ten       p as t    two    a    large          number       of L i v e r p o o l           fans      were       escorted

from       the    train        station           along        Penistone            Road         North        to L e p p i n g s       La n e .

They were          escorted            by    both       foot       officers             and       mounted.             I assumed              t hat

large        number              who     had      come          along Penistone                  Road      North           on    our s i d e          of

the     road who                 we     diverted            down     Leppings           Lane.            Some         of    these fans                had

obviously              been        drinking            and       a few w e r e         obviously             quite          drunk.

At    some         point         around          this       time     Leppings           Lane         was     closed             to       vehicular

traffic            due      to     the       volume         of    people        now     using         the        r o a d as          a footpath.

During           all     of      this        there         was    the     usual        behaviour             i.e.          shouting

slogans           and       singing           but      nothing           warranting              Police       action.

At a b o u t        two          thirty          I looked          up     the    length           of L e p p i n g s            Lane and             it

was     extremely                crowded          and       I remarked            to P o l i c e         Constable               Dawson              that

it    looked           like        a    ’s e a    of       bobbing        heads'.            Nothing             could          be       seen        except

the     heads          of     those          going         to    the m a t c h ,       there        were      no       gaps          on       the     road.

At    t his       time        everything               appeared           to    be     going        smoothly               and       there           were

no    incidents               of       note.

At 3 . 0 3         p.m.       we       liaised         with Police               Sergeant Ashton                   a n d th e                r est    of

the     serial,             together             with another              serial          and      an     Inspector                 outside              the

garage           at P e n i s t o n e         Road         North     and Leppings                  Lane,         on the          opposite

s ide       of    the       road.

We    then         commenced along                     Leppings            L a n e , as a         u nit     to     go       to       a       Police

coach        to     standby             as    per      our       briefing.             As we w e r e         doing              so       I    heard

via     a    radio,           presumably Police                      Sergeant           Ashton's,             as       he       was          the     only

one     in m y         immediate              vicinity            who     had    a     rad i o ,      a message                 saying             that

the m a r c h w o u l d                have      to    be       stopped        and     almost         immediately                    a       call     went

out     for       all       available             officers           on    standby              to a t t e n d        at    the          Leppings

Lane        stand.            These          messages            appeared         to    be       panicky          and       it       sounded              as

though           the     person          passing            them     was       unsure        as     to     the        exact          problem.
                                                                                           ,v

We    attended              at     the       Leppings            Lane     turnstiles               within         a    couple                of

There        w as      a group           of      people          gathered         outside           the     turnstiles                       a n d we

assisted            in      removing             them       from     this       a r e a,     and      then        formed             a       cordon

across           t his      entrance.                 We    remained           in t h i s        area      f or a b o u t            five

minutes        during          which        I he ard,            vi a    a    nearby          radio,          that     an a m b u l a n c e

was    on the        field       and        a few       seconds              lat e r     one      attended            where       we    wer e .

It    passed       through           the     cordon          and        I then         saw       bodies        being      brought          to

it a n d     others        obviously              injured          walking             to     it.        At    this     time       one     fan

walked       from       the     ground        saying             something             like,          "Is     it w o r t h    it,       there

are    dead       folk     in t h e r e ,         some       folk        have       died."             He     walked      off      a n d was

obviously          distressed.                I then             became        aware         of a m a n         who     was       lying      on

the    ground        beside          the     ambulance.                  There         was       no    one     near     him,       he     was

motionless.               An    officer           nearby          said        something               about     him     looking           'in a

bad way'.            We    were       at     this       time       unaware             of    exactly           what     was       happening

inside       the     ground.           There           were       announcements                   being       made      over       the

loudspeaker             system.

We w e r e     then       diverted           into       the       ground           where         we    then     passed        the

ambulance.              The     man whom           I had          seen        l y ing       on    the       ground      was       blue     in

the    f ace      and     did    not        appear          to    be     breathing,               I think         he    was       dead .

Beside       the     ambulance              there       were       two        ambulancemen                  giving      rnouth to

mouth       resuscitation              and        heart          massage           and      there        were     other       people

lying       all    around,           some     of w h i c h w e r e             in a         bad way,           some     of    them       were

only    partly          clothed and               others          were        obviously               injured.

We    then     passed          through        a    tunnel,              about       twenty            feet     wide     onto       the

terrace        behind          the    goal        at    the L e p p i n g s            Lane       end.         There      was      a    large

gap    on the        terrace          and     I could             see     that         the       wire       fencing      which

abutted        the      field        ha d    been       cut a n d            peeled         awa y ,      allowing         access          onto

the    fi el d .        There        were     officers             on        the    terrace            making         their       way    onto

the    fiel d,       where       there        was       a    large           number         of    people        lying        on    the

grass       and    walking           around.            I could              see ,a l ine             of P o l i c e    Officers

across       the     field       near        to    the       half        way       line.         Myself        and     Police

Constable          Dawson went               onto       the       field where                I could           se e    people          l y ing

on    the    ground,           apparently              dead,       many        with         jackets           over     their       heads. [

John's          first        aiders.             There          were    people           walking           about,         it    seemed,                 in

a state          of         shock,some            d az e d ,      s ome      being            physically             sick      and others                                 ;

lying/sitting                   around          apparently             suffering              injuries.              I asked             those

who    were        near         if    they       needed          help and           checked          with        many      of       them about

injuries.               I felt         awful          at    what       I was        seeing,          the       scale       of       it       left            me

numb.           I f elt         inadequate,                as    if t h e r e       was       obsolutely             nothing             I c o uld

do,    it       s e e m e d as        though          everywhere             I looked              there      was      another               dead

p e rson.         This          aside,          I felt          that    I was          still        within         myself           coping,

u n til     I saw a             very young             lad,       about        10— 12 y e a r s            old,      he   was        obviously

dead,       and a fi reman                  said       to a m a n           nearby        t hat      there         was    nothing              he

could       do a n d         placed         a jacket             over       the     boy.        The        man     became           totally

distraught.                  I felt         very       upset        but      carried           on,       I felt        I should               make

some      sort        of     contribution.                      About       th is      time        I lost        contact            with

Police          Constable             Dawson          and       everyone          else        in m y       serial.             I assisted

in    putting           bodies         onto       advertising                hoardings              as     fans      carried             the

bodies          b ack      and       forth       to    the       area       between           the    North         Stand        and          the

Kop,        A    lot       of     fans      on    the       f i e„ld w e r e        angry,          and      s ome     were         obviously

in s h o c k ,        there          were       people          crying       all       a r o u n d me.           I saw         a fireman

attempting              to      resuscitate                a man       by m o u t h       to m o u t h ,         and      I attempted                        to

assist          him     by      giving          heart       massage.              We     did       this      for     about          3—4

minutes          but       there       was       no    breath          or    pulse        and       eventually            a     jacket             was

placed          o ver      his       face.        I felt          drained,             this        only      contributed                 to    my

feelings          of       being       inadequate                and    unable           to    h e l p.        I spent          a    few

minutes          just        staring            into       space.           I didn't           know what             to   do.            I

decided          to        a t t e m p t to      find       o t h e r m e m b e r s of        my     serial        and      within

minutes          saw Police                Constable             243 Landers.                   We       t h e n a t t e m p t e d to          find                       [

some      of     the       others,          without             gain.        There        appeared            to     be   no

organisation                 on      the    field.              There       were       Policemen            and      fans       walking
                                                                                                                                                   1

been removed from the field.               Mr. Dalglish had spoken to the fans via

the loudspeakers and calls had been made for them to assist the Police

and other services.            Not long after I went onto the pitch the Forest

fans began singing, which upset the Liverpool fans, who became abusive

and aggressive,         some attempting         to get   to their end of the ground,

prevented from doing so by Police Officers.

Many of the fans were blaming the Police for what had happened, some

were blaming the F.A. and some poor organisation, saying that the same

had happened last year.

Eventually myself and Police Constable Landers made                       our way   through

the crowds when we were approached by Chief Superintendent Nesbit on

the field.      A short time later the match was officially abandoned and

myself and Police Constable Landers began to make our way back to our

original     points.      As   we    did   so we were      verbally     abused,   Liverpool

supporters were calling us murderers, black bastards, cunts, etc.                          We

were told that all we were good for was fighting and kicking miners.

We   walked    along     the    length     of   Leppings    Lane   to    the   roundabout,

suffering     this   type     of abuse     the whole way.      The people doing        this

were not all drunk or youths, some had been drinking, but the majority

of them were sober and many were middle aged.

Shortly after getting'to the roundabout we were joined by the rest of

the serial making their way home quietly.                  We had no further problems

and were stood down to go to Claywheels Lane at about 6.00 p.m.

Upon   our    arrival    at    the   garages     at   Claywheels   Lane,    there    was   an

uncanny silence. . I have never known it to be so quiet with so many

bobbies together.        There was no laughing, no jokes or anything, it was

deathly quiet.       It had obviously affected everyone.                Although food was

available,     there were very few who felt up to eating.                   We eventually

stood down from Clayweels Lane at about 7-15 p.m.

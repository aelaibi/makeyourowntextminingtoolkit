                                                               Act 1972 as amended
 Appointment of legal advice for the Authority.


        2      Recommendation

        (i)    That members authorise the Clerk and Treasurer to secure appropriate legal
        â€”^     advice and representation in connection with matters relating to the provision
                of financial assistance to police officers arising out of the Hillsborough
                disaster.

        (ii)   That under the provisions of Standing Order 34.1, tenders be not invited due to
                the urgency of the matter (SO 34.1(8)); and the absence of a reasonably
                satisfactory alternative (SO 34.1(1)).


 3     Background

 3.1   In the particular circumstances which have arisen in relation to the provision of financial
        assistance to Messrs Duckenfield and Murray, it is considered appropriate that the
        Authority secures independent legal advice to assist in dealing with this matter.

 3.2   This is a matter requiring immediate address and therefore it is important to secure advice
       without delay.

 3.3   Financial provision

        The Authority has a budget provision for legal advice. Sufficient funds will need to be
        earmarked within this provision for expenditure arising out of this report.

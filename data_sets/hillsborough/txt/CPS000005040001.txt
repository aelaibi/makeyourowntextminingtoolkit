       1 enclose herewith a-copy of a]letter sent by Mr George
       Howarth MP to the Lord chancellor about the DPP decision
       relating to Hillsborough. Voufwill note (despite the date on
       the LCD letter) that'it has now been transferred to the
       Attorney General.              i
       As you are aware, thfe Attorhey[General is anxious that Members
       of Parliament who se6k a hefcriag should not be turned away.
       He is however consci6us that tflis Member raises a particular
       case rather than a general issue. He has asked me to enquire
       whether the Director‘would be filling to see Mr Howarth and
       receive his representations' and comments about the
       Hillsborough decision.         I
                                                *
       No reply has yet beeft sent to Mr Howarth from LSLO and I
       should be grateful if you woula have a word with me as soon as
       you have an opportunity to tak^ the mind of the Director.

HTT.TfifiOROUGH DISASTER APRIL 15th. 1989

Account of events as witnessed "by_______
A spectator on the Leppings Lane Terrace.


I have been to Hillsborough before for both League and Cup games, this enabled
me to arrive by a service bus from the city centre at the Leppings Lane end.
Only myself and two friends were on the bus going to the game. We arrived at
the ground at 2.18pm.

( arriving at the entrance to the                  turnstiles I saw a mass of
people in front of the turnstiles. There were no queues for the individual
turnstiles just a large group of people. We joined the rear of this group.
Within minutes more people had arrived and we found ourselves tightly enclosed
on all sides by other people. I became seperated from ay friend who was also
 trying to enter this end.

A mounted policeman was isolated between the turnstile I found ayself being
taken towards and the one towards which ay friend was heading. At one point a
surge pushed me against the horse and nearly under it I had to push hard to
regain ground away from the horse. It was at this point that another mounted
officer tried to drive a wedge into the crowd to ny right. The officer soon
withdrew his horse, it seemed to have had no effect.

I tried to speak to the officer on the horse to my left and tell him to use
the horses to take the weight of people off the back of the queue, as he could
do nothing in the position he found himself in. Between the turnstiles was a
police constable on foot. He was outwardly calm and friendly as fans tried to
avoid being squashed against the wall or the officer himself. At this point,
no more than a metre from the turnstile, it was impossible to influence ay own
movement. A senior police officer situated to the right of the bank of
turnstiles was shouting at his men. He shouted for those on foot to go through
the turnstiles to avoid the crush.

I was propelled into the turnstile. I handed in ay ticket. On arriving inside
the ground there was a line of police, they seemed uncertain as to what to do
as they, like ay self, watched the crowd still outside. On finding ay friend we
moved towards the terraces. Th»— aaly marked standing area was the tunnel*
there were no stewards or police to direct you to anotner groundentrance.
Because 1 bad haap before I knew that by going to the ngnx> you i-tVdlJ icoch

I was situated to the side of the central pen. Like many others I did not
realise the scale of the tragedy until much later on that afternoon.




                Merseysiae.
  I am a Spion Kop season ticket holder and have stood there for home games for
  nearly 20 years. In addition, as I prefer to stand, I have stood on many
  terraces around the country watching foothall. My observations concerning the
  disaster are -

  1. There are occasions when the police lose control of the queues for games
  hut these are rare. At Anfield and Goodison the setting up and marshalling of
  large queues is good.

  Problems have occured at Wembley 1986 and 1988. On both occasions entry to the
  ground was only gained by being subjected to a crush.

^ 'roblems arose at Derby County last season, 1988, with severe pressure having
 "to be experienced to gain entry to the STANDS.

  At the league game at Sheffield this year it was difficult to enter the West
  Stand. In spite of having tickets I missed the start and had to endure much
  pushing to gain entry. There are a lack of turnstiles at this ground.

 Police on semi-final day had lost control of the queue earlier than has been
 stated. The situation was already out of control when we arrived. Experience
 said it could only get worse as kick-off approached. There were no proper
 queues at 2.18pm, which there should have been to speed entry. There was just
 a mass of people.

 2. The behaviour of people in the Leppings Lane area was not as some have
 suggested. I witnessed no drunkard fans trying to get in. People reacted well
 considering the crush they were subjected to. Once in a mass of people like
 that experienced at Hillsborough choice of action goes. To suggest that large
 numbers were drunk is false. To infer that even if a few were drunk it would,
 could, influence such a large force generated by thousands is equally
 incorrect and illogical.

 3. There should have been directions given inside the ground to prevent one
 pen becoming overcrowded, especially the one behind the goal which is the most
 likely to become over full. In terraces like the Kop sideways movement is
 possible and does occur. Given that there are pens at Hillsborough it is even
 more essential to evenly distribute the supporters. Once in the central pen
 the only way out was against the flow of people still entering.

 4. Should pens be constructed that allow such little movement of spectators.
 Why is entry and exit restricted to that one tunnel?

 5* On this, and other, visits to Hillsborough the Leppings Lane terrace has
 always seemed over full. It has been uncomfortable in the past. Is a capacity
 of 10,000 for this area realistic? Are the entrances and exits sufficient for
 a capacity 10,000 attendence?

 6. Average home attendances should be taken into account in providing venues
 for important games. Sensible planning could avoid many problems. The number
 of turnstiles and the space to form queues should be taken into consideration.
 The provision of 'away* ends at many grounds has resulted in many grounds
 being unsuited to a match involving two clubs each with an equal share of the
 tickets.

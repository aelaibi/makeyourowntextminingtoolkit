Dear Sir,
            Re :   Lord Justice Taylor’s Enquiry into the Hillsborough
                   Football disaster.

        With a view to early capture of relevant information, the attached
questionaires have been prepared for completion by officers of your Force
who have volunteered to provide evidence from off duty attendance at the
match.

        I would be grateful if you would assist in distributing them at
your earliest convenience. If you would be so kind as to collate the
responses at one central point, I will be pleased to arrange prompt collection.




                    Yours Sincerly,




                    D W THURSFIELD
                    Superintendent West Midlands Police.

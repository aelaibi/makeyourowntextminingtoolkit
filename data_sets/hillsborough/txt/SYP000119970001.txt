               At S.00am on Saturday,       13 April,    1969 (150489)    I reported on duty at

               Doncaster Police Station in order to be conveyed by the Force             coach

               to Hillsborough for the FA Cup Semi Final.              We arrived.at

               Hillsborough and. were briefed for the match at approximately 9. 50am

               (0950)

               At -t,his time     I was part of a serial    of which Sgt. Lindop was    in charge.

               At approximately       10.50am (1030)    X commenced    (together with the rest

               of my serial)      duty in C la y w h e e 1s Lane assisting with the parking and

               searching of the Liverpool supporters          coaches.     When the parking

               spaces were filled we were directed to a location outside a public,

               house called the Gate       Inn.

               At this    location we were preventing Liverpool          supporters from going

               any nearer the ground with alcohol.           Many supporters were stopped who

               were    carrying cans and bottles which had been purchased at local shops.

               At 3.00pm     <1500) most of the supporters had made their way past us on

               route to the ground and we were directed to return to ClaywheeIs Lane

               for meal.

               We had just set off to go to ClaywheeIs Lane when we were directed to

               the Leppirsgs Lane end of the ground by radio, with a message to the

               effect of crowd problems at that end of the ground.

                                                                                             R 3 58

->   We made our way            immediately to the Lappings Lane end. We went                into

     the stadium and            on reaching the large concrete area to the rear of

     the stand I saw a state of absolute                 chaos.       Liverpool    supporters were

     all over the area and I saw several                 people      laid out on the floor-

     receiving first aid treatment.                 The tunnel       leading to the terracing

     was packed and bodies were being passed through the t u n n e 1 and on to

     the forecourt area-           Liverpool        supporters were shouting and screaming

     about    people being trapped on the terracing.                    At this point myself

     and several         other officers from my serial              forced our way through the

     tunnel and out onto the terracing.

     On getting to the terracing              I made my way down onto the pitch.

     People were lying all           over the place and people were still               trapped

     down at the front of the terracing.                  I then assisted three Liverpool

     supporters who had an advertising board which they were using as a

     stretcher       to convey injured people to an ambulance                 point at the other

     end of the crowd.           We made several trips             in this way as well as •
              vx<\                              .         ,   ,
     t.annpy4HHg one or two others            whose     injuries were not so bad.         1his

     carried on for some time until things started to get sorted out.

     At about 3,00pm           (1700) an Inspector who            I d o n ’t know told us to go

     with him out on to Leppings Lane to direct Liverpool                         supporters back

     to their coaches.

     This we did and at about 5.30pm                 (1780) we began a check on all

     coaches to find out how many were missing off of each c o a c h .                      We then

     supervised the departure of Liverpool                    coaches returning to C l a y w h e e 1s

     Lane at about &.30pm           (1830),   and leaving for Doncaster at about

     7.00pm      (1 9 0 0 ).

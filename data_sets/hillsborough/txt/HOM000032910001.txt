                     Cross-Examined by MR. PAYNE;

vt.    Sergeant Goddard, just one general question, please,
       prefaced with this.  Can you tell the Jury how long
       you ha^e been a serving Police Officer? - A. I was a
       Cadet fot Sheffield City in 1959 and appointed Police
       Officer i\ 1962.

Q.     For how longxhave you been a Sergeant? - A. October
       1976.        \\ 'i.
                        \
Q.     Without going irko detail, as part of your duty you
       have to attend at\all manner of events and
       emergencies? - A. ^es s ir.
                                 \
Q.     I want you to put the \event when you were in the
       Control Box and you started to receive the calls from
       Mr. Marshall outside to open the gates because
       otherwise someone would ba killed, just put that in
       the circumstances in which \Lt happened, put that in
       the context of your experience as a Police Officer.
       How does this rank in terms of emergencies that you
       have been involved in? - A. The most dire emergency
       certainly.   I had never known anything before like
       this at all.

             THE CORONER:  Sergeant Goddardt\ I am most
        grateful to you for being here.   Thahk you very rwcrs
        for helping us.

             What we are now going to do is we ai 1 goia>; to
        hear Mr. Bichard in a moment.  We are going to press
        on today, but what I want to do is you will remember
        you were asking about the video, and I think.we will
        show this video now of the scene as far as we .have got
        it at Leppings Lane.  In fact, it was, of courae,
        taken by Mr. Bichard so it is a convenient time to
        actually look at it, but I am going to get Mr. K i U o c h
        who has actually selected the piece out that we need
        to describe it.

                                By THE CORONER:

 Q.     Give your name so we know who you are. - A. Sergeant
        John Killoch, sir, West Midlands Police.  I have just
        taken a short sequence from one of the South Yorkshire
        Police videos, which shows pictures taken from one of
        the CCTV cameras situated at the ground on 15th April.
        These show scenes inside Leppings Lane of the Leppings
        Lane pens, the West Stand.  I should mention, sir, X
        think the Jury are already aware but some of the

                     pictures are in what they call time lapse, so that it
                     will jump,
            B             THE CORONER:  Yes.  It is not very long, about 10
                     or 15 minutes.
                     Before we start, can you remember what time tne
                     sequence begins? - A. It starts, sir, a t approximately
                     15.02 and the first few frames are actually shown on
                     the concourse area, and then the camera moves into the
                     West Stand.

      THE CORONER:   Have got an identification number or
 something on the tape so that we know?

      mb  ifTiijDCH* Yes < sir.   The original
 identification is TB.l.    That is the West Midlands
 Police reference.

        THE CORONER:      Mr. Maxwell?
         MR. MAXWELL:    Sir, I am here today as you might
 have guessed in order to present to you written
 submissions on law of the Sheffield City
 would normally do that, of course, at the end of the
 evidence.      That may yet be possible, but perhaps not
 today, but we obviously want to comply with your
 timetable.      At the moment it is a bit like Blue Peter,
  H e r e is one I n.ade earlier"!    Sir, in due course, it
 will be presented.
       Sir there are certain matters I would wish to raise
  with you now and which might be better dealt with m the
  absence of the Jury, with our leave, sir.

    \                  (The Jury left Court)

             maxufil*      Sir, I have kept up with the evidence
  in t t e h ^ u e s t ^ withtny daily dose of transcript and




  of that in it.
        Sir, you may remember that case where the evidence
   that went k f o r e a n S ^ o a t was             f
   iceberg.   Normally, of ^>urse, i c e b e r g s get smaller but
   there is at least a r i s k / ^ r , of the evidence here
   getting larger in quantum and may be getting
   Alternatively it m l y be that        Jury is about to be
   asked to look unnecessarily belo^ the water line.

        I know you have considered thi* already but there
   are reasons why in my      r   e  submission you could

   a long time in these proceedings.                   their

   evidence*
        Sir I comfort myself in asking you to reconsider
   the position with two"thoughts.   The first is that you
   have always shown that as your own man, and as very   x

Dear Lord Justice Taylor

                                Fire Resistant Stadium Seats

I understand that, after you have issued your report on the Hillsborough
disaster, you are to issue a report on the wider aspects of safety in
football stadiums.

In this context, and with the Bradford fire in mind, I should like to
draw your attention to the fire properties of stadium seats. They are
usually made of wood, thermoplastic or fibre-glass, all of which burn
quite easily with the evolution of smoke and toxic gases.    Most were
fitted before fire safety became an important factor in football
stadiums.

At TBA Composites we manufacture a reinforced phenolic thermosetting
plastic compound which can be moulded into seat pans and backs. The
moulded item has a high degree of fire resistance, heat resistance and
in a developed fire yields very little smoke or toxic gas. It is one of
the few materials which has passed the London Underground's severe
fire/smoke test (results enclosed).

What is good for Underground                       trains must be good for stadiums, and
really the point of this letter                    is to make you aware that fire-resistant
hard plastic stadium seats are                     commercially available should you decide
to set a fire standard for such                    items in your report.

Yours faithfully

          INTRODUCTION


          The Fire Test Section of the LUL Scientific Services
          Division have performed smoke emission and Temperature
          Index Tests on samples of TBA Composites, Durestos PDMC
          1130 panel.




          RESULTS


          The panels were tested for smoke emission and Temperature
          Index, using the methods described in BS 6853 : 1987. The
          results are tabulated in Table 1.




          CONCLUSIONS


          The materials submitted for test would meet the LUL
          requirements in respect of smoke emission and Temperature
          Index for underground use.

Phenolic Pre-pregs
Ablative Applications
DURESTOS pre-pregs based on asbestos fibre are used
throughout the world for the production of insulating com­
ponents for use in rocket motors or associated launch
equipm ent Such parts are unique in providing a low cost
solution where thermal protection is required for a short
period against very high temperatures (up to 3000°C) and
against the erosive effect of very high speed gas streams
which sometimes also contain abrasive metal particles. New
additions to the range of ablative materials include both glass
and carbon fibre reinforced products, all based on TBA’s own                                                   $    ilM C

  faterials
A market need for a non-asbestos material for use as primary
thermal insulation in heated hydraulic presses led to the
development of DURESTOS AF. This is a fully finished
material (available as 1200 x 1200 mm boards in a range of
thicknesses), which is installed between the heated platen/
mould and the press head. Both surfaces are precision
ground to ensure accurate press alignment, and a soft
interlayer is also available to aid with badly mis-aligned
presses. DURESTOS AF is widely used in presses for the
fabrication of plastics and rubber articles, conveyor belting,
tyres, plastic laminates and num erous wood products such as
                                                                  ... .
chipboard, blockboard, and plywood.
As well as protecting the mechanical/hydraulic
sections of the press from excess heat, which
can cause dam age due to expansion and a
reduction in the working life of the press, the
installation of DURESTOS AF press insulation
yields a substantial energy saving. This reduc­
tion in energy costs quickly offsets the initial cost
of insulation.

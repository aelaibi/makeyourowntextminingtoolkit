TAYLOR OFFENCES: TICKET TOUTING


The Home Secretary and Mr Patten had a brief word yesterday
afternoon about the handling of the announcement of the 'H'
decision earlier this week to implement the recommendations on
new criminal offences in the Taylor report.

2    It was recognised that the Government was likely to be
pressed to give an undertaking to extend the Taylor ticket
touting offence to sports and events other than football matches.
Taylor was, however, quite specific in his reasons for limiting
the proposed offence to football. The potential for disorder was
the point which Ministers would need to emphasise in resisting
attempts to broaden the scope of the offence.

3    As to announcing the decision on the Taylor offences, the
Home Secretary had considered the case for an arranged PQ (now
suggested in your note of 25 October) but had concluded that it
would be better to announce it during his speech in opening the
expected Home Affairs day's debate following the Queen's speech,
which Mr Patten would wind up.

QUESTIONS FOR MR BICHARD



A few thoughts -


1.      Lord Taylor’s report says that the master screen flicked in rotation around the 5 police
cameras, and ‘made a video recording’. Is this right? Confirm it was Mr Bichard who
controlled what was recorded, that this was independent of what the master screen happened
to be showing at any particular time, and that he could and did record the output of any two of
the five police cameras at any one time.

2.      Where were the CCTV screens placed in the control box? Lord Taylor says they were
‘behind’ Murray, Goddard and Ryan in the front seats of the control box. But others (e.g.
Houldsworth) have told us they were ‘above’ them. Could Murray, Goddard and Ryan see
the screens at all from where they were sitting befond the window?

3.    There is no recorded output at all from camera 5 between 1423 and 1503 (both on
TB2). Was he looking at the camera 5 output during that time? Did he zoom, tilt, pan it?
What was it pointing at?

4.     Can he describe what was wrong with the output from camera 5? Why is this not
apparent when one looks at the camera 5 output from 1418 to 1423? Show TB2 extract
from 1503 - is this what he means by ‘flaring’, etc?

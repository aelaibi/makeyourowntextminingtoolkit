                I am a married man and I live at the above address with my wife and

                family.     I am the Managing Director of                                 based in

               Sheffield.        I have worked in the Sheffield area for four years and

                have been a supporter of football for over thirty years.                     I have

               attended at many Football Grounds over the years and have attended at

                the Hillsborough Football Ground on a number of occasions,                    and as a

                result,    I know the layout of the Ground quite well.

                I have become associated with Sheffield United Football Club over the

               years and I originate from the Nottingham area, although I do not

               support Nottingham Forest Football Club.

               When the semi-final was arranged to be played at Hillsborough,

                                , the Managing Director of Sheffield United Football Club

               offered me two tickets for the game I bought the tickets
                                                                                   PAGE
                                                                                   SI 970

for £12.50 and the^ were for seats              in the W

standing seating area.              The second ticket was for a friend of tnjrfxe,
     A / fl I 9       /
                          r who   is the General Manager                           in

Sheffield.

On Saturday 15th April              1989 <150489),   I went to work in the morning

and met                             at about midday.    We went out for lunch and

then made our way to                                   H i 1 lsborough.   One of the

employees then drove us to within 500 yards of the Ground in a silver

                            car where he dropped us off.

En route to the Ground I saw large numbers of supporters making their

way to the Ground,            but the crowd seemed normal at this.stage for a

capacity game.            At this time it was about 2.30 pm ( 14ft30 h r s ) .

We walked towards the Leppings Ln entrance to the Ground,                   and as we

reached the bridge which is next to the turnstiles,                  the scene which

confronted me was one of complete chaos.                 Thousands of people were

crowded intft the area in front of the turnstyles and they were

spreading back at least halfway across Leppangs Ln.                   Th^re were

hundreds of people shouting,              "Who wants tickets",    and I got the

impression that people were trying to sell their p i c k e t s because they

had decided to get into the Ground by one rneansyor another.

There was a tremendous amount of jostling and pushing in the crowd and

at this time I saw people climbing over the gates and the turnstiles

into the Ground.             Other supporters appeared to be trying to f b r e a .k down

fences near to the blue gate to the far right of the turns/iles a s you

look from Leppings Ln.               I am unable to describe what these people

looked like.

As                and I reached the end of the bridge, we were literally swept

into the crush of supporters by fans who were making their way to the

Ground behind us.             Once we were in the crush there was virtually no

way out.          It was like being      in a tin of sardines, we were pressed
                                                                      PAGE          3
                                                                      SI 970

together that tightly that you couldn't even move your arms, and you

were    literally carried forward by the crowd,   unabl^ to move

independently of the mass.     Because of the sitj/ation I was in,     I can't

really describe any of the people around me/ I was more concerned with

looking after myself.     I did notice that/& large number of people who

were around me smelt very strongly of /arink and the majority of people

around me were,    to one extent or another,   the worse the wear for

drink.

The    crowd were exhibiting a large number of emotions,     some people just

appeared intent on getting    in the Ground,   I myself was quite

frightened.     I have never experienced anything   like it in my whole

life.    There were children in the crowd who had been lifted off their

feet and were being held aloft by adults;      some were crying.     The crowd

was just    like a pack of animals.

People were trying to push the crowd and were trying to get to the

front of the crowd,    despite the fact that there was nowhere to go.          At

one point I was pushed in the back by a person who was obviously

trying to get to the front.     I braced myself   in a reaction to this and

turned my head to look at the person who was      pushing me.    I saw a

white male, aged in his mid-twenties;      he was wearing a white sweater,.

He was clean shaven, he had fai r hai r and he/looked to be quite fit.

When I looked at him he h eld a broken beer/glass up towards me w i th

his right hand in a threatening m a n n e r V He said to me something to

the effect of,    "Move old man",   in a Liverpool accent.    This youth

smelt strongly of drink and I would say that he Was drunk.          Despite

the crush I let the person past because I didn't want to get         i/nvolved

in any trouble.

I could see four or five Police Officers around the c r o w ^      but to be

honest I don't feel they could have done anything      in the

circumstances,    and I can't describe them.

There was   a Police Officer on a horse whoywas       in among the crowd about

3 feet to   my right at one stage.     He ap/eared to be trying to split up

the crowd and stop the people at the /ront from being crushed.               In my

mind he was doing a fantastic job, yflespite the risk to himself.             The

horse appeared to be actually lifted from the ground at one stage,               but

he did his best,    even when a numTier of supporters tried to pull him

from his horse.     In the panic-/idden situation I can't describe what

they looked like.

After   I had been in the crush for quite a long time,       I had   been pushed

with          almost to th'e turnstiles.       As we neared them I saw a large

blue gate to my right open and a large number of pepple entered the

Ground through it.     The gate ^was open for about a/minute or so before

they were closed.     After tttis had taken place, /he      pressure from the

crowd noticeably eased.    /\   feel that lives haya been definitely in

danger outside the Groymd before this took /lace, and that whoever

opened the gate had ruo alternative     in the circumstances.

It was only a couple/ of minutes     later that I e n t e r e d the Ground

through a turnstil/.     There was no pressure at the/ turnstile when I

went through.     I had my ticket   checked.    I then/made my way with

        to the upper seating area of the W Stanti.        There were a lot of

people at the rear of the stand,      but as I know the Ground quite well,

I made my way directly to the stand and I d i d n ’t really notice^any

stewards or Police Officers at this time.

When I got into the seating area,      I showed my ticket to ay^teward, who

directed me to my seat.     This seat was occupied by a L i / e r p a a l

supporter, who moved to let me sit down.         I d o n ’t knot/ what my seat

number was as I no longer have my ticket,        but I have indicated my

position in the Ground on a map of the Football Ground/which I produce

                                                                                          S 197.0

The time would have now been about 3.02 pm <1502 h r s ) , as the game had

just kicked off.        I could see that there was some panic in tlye central

standing pens,      but I c ou ld n’t see very well      from my position and I

c a n ’t describe any of the people       in the pen.

I saw some people climb from the terraces             into the W §4y6nd and there

were also people/climbing onto the pitch from the terraces.                          At t b f i s

point I realised that there was something wrong ^hd I saw peopj4                             lying

on the pit<

At this     iint           left the Ground.       I would estimate that the time

would be about 3.10 pm <1510 h r s ) .       I stayed for about a further five

minutes before I left the Ground.           The scene on the pitch was

absolutely horrific,       but because of the numbers           involved and where I

was sitting,       I could only see a very confusing silruation on the pitch.

When I left the Ground and got to the area at t / e                  rear of the W S t a n d ,

there were a lot of people leaving the G r o u n d and a large number of

people lying on the Ground,        receiving F i r s y A i d    from Police O f f i c e r s ,

St. Johns staff and members of the public/               There d i d n ’t appear to be

arty people who w e r e n ’t being 1ooked\afJ^5 r , so I began to walk back to

the Mazda dealership where        I had left my car.           All    I wanted to do was

get out.     I c a n ’t describe the injured people, all              I know is that I

saw a young lad and an elderly man being given the kiss of life

outside the Ground.        I c a n ’t really give a better description of them.

When I got out of the Ground I noticed the road was littcVed with

hundreds of beer cans.        I also saw gangs of Liverpool                 fjgns roaming

around;    they were making threats towards         individual Paflice Officers

and I heard someone in one gang say,          " L e t ’s get t h e ^ o l i c e " .       I c a n ’t

describe the youths,       nor can I say that I saw any acts of disorder.

I walked the mile back to the                             .             _            I

               Whp n   T qnt. to the   premises   I locked myself            in with

and other sales staff,
                                                                                        PAGE
                                                                                        SI 970

    There were a lot of supporters walking past and they appeared to be

    distressed.             A couple of people were let into the premises by

    to use the             ’phone,    but I had no contact with tfhemy

    At some time between 4.00 pm and 4.30 pm ( ffiQO-^>30 hrs),                    I heard a

    bang outside the premises and saw a f lashf and'smoke which, as I have

    been in the Army,                I recognised as a f IsJ r e .   This appeared to have been

    directed at a minibus                in Langsett Rd which contained Nottingham Forest

    su p p o r t e r s .

    After      this happened I went             into a back o ffice where I stayed until

    about 5.30 pm (1730 hrs) when the area around the Ground was virtually

    clear.        I then drove home.

    When     I went to the game I was wearing a grey sports jacket and grey

    flannel       trousers.           I would describe myself as a white man, 57 years

^   old, 6 ’2 tall,            of s t o c l ^ build.   I ha ye collar length bl^ck ty /i r which
y                7
    i s greying ayd I ani/slightly baldir/Q.                  I wear gold rimmed spectacles

    and am clean shav/n;                however,   there is nothing overtly distinctive

    about rny appearance.

    As far as I am concerned the people outside the Leppings Ln entrance

    behaved like animals,                and I was frightened amongst them.        I feel that

    many were innocent victims of the minority of hooligans who should

    take responsibility for what happened.

    I am prepared to attend at any inquiry if I am required to do so.

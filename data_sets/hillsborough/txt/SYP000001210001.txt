            climbing           over     me    and      I had        I o s t s i g ht       of    C h rist in e .        I eventually        made

            my    way     back     up    the       terracing             to       comparative         safety.

            When     circumstances                 allowed          it       I made      my     way   back       down    the   terracing

            not    succesful.

            I walked           along     the       pitch       and       found       her      lying     on    t he     touch   line     near

            the    goal.        I saw        that      her     own       jacket         was     covering         her    face   and    I knew

            sn     was        dea d «

            I then        Identified              my   wife     to       police         sergeant        2638,

            i. w i l l    say     that       at    the    1 3.m e    of       the    surge       from      the    back?    the    qates     to

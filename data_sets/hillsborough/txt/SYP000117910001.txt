Action— Cause o f—Xervcus Shock—Practical Joke causing—Remoteness of
                              Damage.

        The defendant, by way of a practical joke, falsely represented to the
     plaintiff, a married woman, that her husbaDd had met -with a serious
     accident whereby both his legs were broken. The defendant made the
     statement with intent that it should be believed to be true. The plaintiff
     believed it to be true, and in consequence suffered a violent nervous shock
     which rendered her ill:—
       E tld, that these facts constituted a good cause of action.

 a jury.
    On April 9, 1896, Thomas W ilkinson, the husband of the
plaintiff, w ent to a race-meeting, and on the evening of the
sam e day the defendant came to the plaintiff's house and repre­
sented to her that her husband, while returning in a wagonette
w ith some friends from the races, had m et with an accident aad
had both his legs broken, that he was lying at T he E lm s public-
house at Leytonstone, and had desired the defendant to request
th e plaintiff to go at once with a cab and some pillows to fetch
h im home. These statements were false. T hey were meant
by the defendant to be believed to be true, and the plaintiff so
believed them , with the result that she became seriously ill
from a shock to her nervous system. She also on the faith of
the defendant’s statement incurred a small expense for railway
fares of persons whom she sent to Leytonstone to see after her
husband. T he jury assessed the expense of the railway fares
at Is. lOJd., and the damages for the injury caused by the
nervous shock at 100/.
   I t was contended on behalf of the defendant that so far as
the damage caused to the plaintiff by nervous shock was
concerned the action could not be supported.

in an accident, and was lying at Tho E lm s at Loytonstono              tho act. ■ T his wilful injuria is in law malicious, although no
with both legs broken, and that she was to go at once in a              malicious purpose to cause tho harm which was caused nor
cab with two pillows to fotch him home. All this was false.             any motive of spite is imputed to the defendant.
Tho cffcct of tlio statement on the plaintiff was a violent shock          I t remains to consider whether tho assumptions involved in
to her nervous system, producing vomiting and other more                the proposition arc mado out. Ono question is whether tlio
serious and permanent physical consequences at one time                 defendant’s act was so plainly calculated to produce some cffcct
threatening her reason, and entailing weeks of suffering and            of tho kind which was produced that an intention to produce it
incapacity to her as well as expense to her husband for medical         ought to ho imputed to the dofendant, regard boing had to tho
attendance. These consequences were not in any way tho                  fact that tho effect was produced on a person proved to bo in
result of previous ill-health or weakness of constitution; nor          an ordinary-state of health and mind. I think that it was. It
was there any evidence of predisposition to nervous shock or            is difficult to iiuagino that such a statement, made suddenly
 any other idiosyncrasy.                                                and w ith apparent seriousness, could fail to produco grave
   In addition to these matters of substance there is a small           effects under the circumstances upon any but an exceptionally
claim for Is. 104cZ. for the cost of railway fares of persons sent      indifferent person, and therefore an intention to produce such

  with th e former. I t is true t h a t the bus did not strike th e pursuer ; but,                 ■                    -
                                                                                                   . !b a f t
  owing to rhe fact t h a t the pursuer and h e r sw e e th e a rt were proceeding

  was not disputed, was ju st the same in legal efiect as if she had been
                                                                                                   •nr
 knocked over by co n tac t with the bus. T h e incident, she sa ys— and it is
 proved— gave h e r a te rrib le fright. T he defe n der was ad m itted lv in fault
 in driving as he did ; a n d ; as the fright led to nc-rvous shock, th e pursuer
 was e ntitled to recover compensation for t i.e i t juries th u s directly
 occasioned to her.
     But ihe finding of th e ju r y is; " T h a t th e defender was negligent. and
 that, as th e d irec t result of his breach of c u : y to the pursuer, the p u r ­
 suer sustained person?.! injury resulting in nervous shock involving
 apprehension for h e r own safety ag g ra v ate d by an x ie ty for th e safetv of

 verdict I read as a sub stan tiv e statem ent t h a t th e nervous shock was cue
 to apprehension in part f.-.r h e r own safety an d in part for th e safetv of

 these two separate itears or causes t h e y assessed the dam ages at £ 1 3 0 —

 on record.
     Now, th a t th e verdict redrcts and gives effect to the law as laid down
 to the ju ry by the t r ia l judge is indisputable. Two exceptions are ta ken
 to this charge.           "We are ehierly concerned w ith the second of these
 exceptions, th e first resting on the assum ptio n t h a t th e nerv.-.us shock
 suffered by th e p u r s u e r arose solely from appreh en sion for h e r companion,
a situation nor affirnjed by th e jury. I should like to                     howevei. that,
as a t present advised, th e first exception is. to my mind, well founded,
 when th e charge given to the ju r y is considered in th e iisrht of the direc­
tion which th e ju d g e refused to give. T he judge, however, also c h a ir e d
t i e j u r y “ t h a t on t h e hypothesis t h a t t h e d r iv e r of the bus was guiltv
of a breach of bis d u t y to exercise care to w a r d s th e pursuer, if the nervous
shock sustained by th e pu rsu er was associated with a t prehension for her
own safety, the n t h e whole of the damages suffered by h e r ar e recoverable
even though the y " ' t h a t is th e d a m a g e s <. “ are agg rav ated bv the fact
th a t her companion was involved in th e ca ta stro p h e ." This was excepted
to, and his L o rd sh ip was requested to direct the ju r y “ t h a t if th e p u r ­
suer's nervous shock is proved to have been p a r tly due to reasonable
apprehension of im m ed iate personal in ju ry to herself an d p artlv due to
excitement otherw ise arising out of or following on th e accident, dam aces
are due only for the former.'' H is L ord sh ip refused to j i v e this direction.
    Now, it appears to me t h a t the dir ection here given bv th e jurire does
not. while th e dir ection he refused to give does, express t h e law on the
m a tte r : and t h a t a n x i e ty or alarm, •.•ecasioijerd to A bv th e sic ht of an

             too remote. Sir R. Couch, in delivering judgment (3), says                           disclosed a cause of action. In giving judgment, K ennedy J . (3)
             this : “ According to tho evidence of the female plaintiff her                      says t h i s : “ I t is not, however, to be taken that in my view
             fright was causcd by seeing the train approaching and thinking                      every nervous shock occasioned by negligence and producing
             they were going to bo killed. Damages arising from more                             physical injury to the sufferer gives a cause of action. Thoro
              sudden terror unaccompanied by any actual physical injury,                         is, I am inelinod to think, at least ono limitation. The shock,
              but occasioning a nervous or mental shock, cannot, under                           where it operates through the inind, must bo a shock which
              such circumstances, their Lordsliips think, bo considered a                        ariseB from a reasonable fear of immediate personal injury to
              consequence which, in tho ordinary course of things, would                         oneself. A. has, I conceive, no legal duty not to shock B .’s
              flow from the negligence of the gate-keeper. If it were held                       nerves by the exhibition of negligence towards C., or towards
              th at they can, it appears to their Lordships that it would be                     the property of B. or C.” In introducing this limitation tho
              extending tho liability for negligence much beyond w hat that                      learned judge relies upon a reference by Wright J. in tho
               liability has hitherto been held to bo. N ot only in such a                       ease of Wilkinson v. Downton (4) to a previous decision in tho

                  and Ireland, and pjronounccd by Lord Shaw to bo no longer                    cm a point of law raised in tho pleadings. The decision
                 a decision of binding authority. O11 tho other hand there                     is plainly right. Tho caso is important for the dictum of
                 is a series of cases in which, in varying forms of action, injury             Kennedy J . which Branson J . followed in the present case,

                 recover damages. I will confine myself to tho English cases.                  mind m ust bo a shock which arises from reasonable fear of

                 R y. Co. (2), in 189G, a signalman was held to havo been inca­                rectness of this dictum later. I do not see that Philliinore J.
                  pacitated from em ploym ent by reason of accident, where tho                 expressed any definite opinion upon this point. Finally,
                 incapacity was duo to shock caused by the excitem ent and alarm               in Janvier v. Sweeney (3), a private detective made falso
                  of successfully averting an accident to a train. Thero was                   representations in the nature of threats to a female servant,
                  no apprehension of danger to tho signalman, and tho members                  in order to obtain information from her. Tho representation
                  of tho Court seem to havo considered that tlio fright was the                found by tho jury was : “ You are tho woman wo want, as
                  accident, and tho shock and consequent incapacity tho result                 you havo been corresponding with a German sp y.” Tho
                  of the accident. I 11 Smith v . Johnson tfc Co. (3), referred to             alleged German spy was a man named Neumann, who was
                  by Wright J. in his judgm ent in Wilkinson v. Downton (4),                   then interned, to whom tho plaintiff had been engaged for
                 a Divisional Court consisting of Bruce and Wright J J . decided               live years. Tho Court of Appeal held that tho plaintiff was
                 that where a man was killed in tho sight of tho plaintiff by tho              entitled to recover damages for injury caused by shock, tho
                 defendant’s negligence, and tho plaintiil became ill from tho-                result of tho representations. The jury had found that the
                 shock of seeing the man killed, tho damage was too remote                     statements were calculated to cause physical injury, and were
                 a consequence of ncgligence. N o further particulars are                      made by the defendant with tho knowledge that they were
                 available ; tho caso was presumably a county court caso,                      likely to cause injury. I t does not clcarly appear whether
                 and it docs not appear what facts had been found. Tho                         tho fright of tho plaintiff was of evil consequences to herself,

                          What is now being considered is the question of liability,                     “ I was going to get it or not.’’ She saw nothing of the actual

 guarantee was increased.
      Taiwo as principal debtor was bound under clause 6 of the
 guarantee to accept a copy of these accounts of the principal
 contained in the bank’s books of account as conclusive evidence
against him of the amount for the time being due to the bank.
He submitted to judgment for the full amount stated in the
'original account as being due from him to the bank. B y clause 7
of the guarantee the judgment obtained against Taiwo was binding
aDd conclusive against the respondent. On this footing the bank
would be entitled to judgment for the full amount of £10,023

swarded by the trial judge. The bank is now content to accept
the lesser sum as representing an approximation of the amount
which would be due if the various accounts had in truth been
operated as one. They were not operated as one and the question
is whether the respondent has been substantially prejudiced by
the way in which the accounts were in fact operated. Their Lord­
ships are of opinion that by acting as it did, outside the terms
of the guarantee, the bank increased the burden on the respondent
as guarantor and that the respondent’s guarantee was discharged
whichever construction of the document is adopted.
- They have accordingly humbly advised Her Majesty that the
appeal be dismissed.                                  .1

                   caused by the defendants’ negligence, in which 90 persons were
                   killed, took place at Lewisham. Tbe plaintiff’s late husband
                   immediately weot to the scene of the accident and helped in the
                 • rescue activities until six o’clock the following morning. As a
                   result of his experiences that night, he became psychoneurotic.

                   estate of her late husband who had died in 1962 from causes

                   for his own safety or for that of his children (post, p. 9 20 b , c).

                               the subject of argument. These are: (1) Are damages recoverable

                               by fear for his own safety or the safety of his children? (2) Is fore­
                               seeability of injury by shock a necessary ingredient? (3) Did the
                               defendants owe a duty to Mr. Chadwick, who was not their
                               servant but had come to their aid? (4) Would the fact that the risk

                               extraordinary susceptibility that he ought not to have been in the
                               contemplation of the reasonable man?
                                   Dealing with the first one, are damages recoverable for injury                n
                               by shock where the injured man’s shock is not caused by fear for
                               his own safety or for the safety of his children? The earliest
                               authority to which I wish to refer is Dulieu v. White & Sons.1 E-
                               That was a point of law decided on the pleadings. The plaintiff
                               had sustained a shock when the defendants’ van was driven into ' M : .
                               the bar in which the plaintiff was serving. The decision was that

                                                                                                      - ■'i'1 ■
tf t'L *i                      and the court held that the action would lie. The reasoning of the

                               Phillimore J., was inclined to think that the shock must be one
                               arising from a reasonable fear of immediate personal injury to
                               oneself, and he said *:
                                         “ It is not, however, to be taken that in my view every
                                    nervous shock occasioned by negligence and producing
                                    physical injury to the sufferer gives a cause of action. There        G
                                    is, I am inclined to think, at least one limitation. The shock,
                                    where it operates through the mind, must be a shock which
                                    arises from a reasonable fear of immediate personal injury to
                                    oneself. A has, I conceive, no legal duty not to shock B.’s
                                    nerves by the exhibition of negligence toward C, or towards
                                    the property of B or C. The limitation was applied by

His diagnosis was in these terms:
        "This man is suffering from a post-accident neurosis with depress­
    ion the main symptom. There is no alteration in his psychiatric state
    since he was last seen in August’’.
The prognosis was this:
        “ It is essential for this man’s well-being that any suggestion o f
    compensation may be settled as soon as possible. As I suggested be­
    fore, with his present neurosis which may well become chronic, and
     his age, it is not going to be easy to get lum to return to crane driving.
     It is possible he could do light work o f a non-exacting nature’’.
The plaintiff himself gave evidence in some detail about liis m ode o f life
since the accident. He said he spent lus day just “ mooching” about. He
did not take an interest any longer in his hobby o f watching football or
even assisting his wife in the household chores. He summed up his situ­
 ation in these words: “ I just surrender and don’t feel I can cop e” . Both
 his wife and Dr. Beattie, who has known the plaintiff since 19SS, des­
 cribed the change which has taken place in his character and personality.
 Dr. Beattie said that prior to January, 1969, the plaintiff “was not only
a determined and forthright man, but he could be aggressive to the
 point o f rudeness” , whereas now, “the plaintiff is withdrawn, hyper-
anxious, depressed, and his whole character is withdrawn”. Me has had
suicidal thoughts and presents a picture o f symptoms normally associated
with an anxiety state and depression.
     Dr. Beattie's conclusion is expressed in these words: “ I think he will
improve when these proceedings are over, but I think for a very, very
long time any stress will produce a deterioration” . Mrs. Carlin says this

         “ He has a terrible temper. The accident has made a difference in
     all ways. He is not interested in anything. He wakes up in the middle
:: o f the night with nightmares. He cries, and I luivc never known him
     do that before. He sits about and looks into space. I have to keep
     pushing him. He forgets everything".
     This kind o f case presents an unusually difficult problem lor any
 tribunal called upon to assess general damages. Having regard to the
 whole o f the circumstances, I think a fair sum to award for general
damages is one o f £1,750. Accordingly, there will be judgment for the
 plaintiff for a total sum o f £ 8 7 5 , plus £ 1 ,25 0 , plus £ 1 ,7 5 0 , which I
 make a total o f £3,875. There will be interest at 3 per cent on the
 special damages o f £875 from the date o f the accident which amounts

The plaintiff’s husband and three children were involved in a road accident caused by the
negligence of the defendants. One of the plaintiff's children was killed and her husband g
and other two children w ere severely injured. At the time of the accident the plaintiff
was at home two miles awav, She was told of the accident by a motorist who had been
at the scene of the accident and was taken to hospital where she saw the injured members
of her family and the extent of their injuries and shock and heard that her daughter had^
been killed. As a results of hearing, and seeing the results of, the accident the plaintifi
suffered severe and persisting nervous shock. The plaintiff claimed damages against the ^
defendants for the nervous shock, distress and injury to her health caused by the
defendants’ negligence. The judge dismissed her claim on the ground that her injury
was not reasonably foreseeable. On appeal, the Court of Appeal held that the plaintiff
was not entitled to claim against the defendants either because as a matter of policy a
duty of care was not to be imposed on a negligent defendant beyond that owed to persons
in close proximity, both in time and place, to an accident, even though the injuries
received by the plaintiff might be reasonably foreseeable as being a consequence of the
 defendants’ negligence, or because the duty of care owed by a driver of a motor vehicle
 was limited to persons on or near the road. The plaintiff appealed to the House of Lords.

 H eld - The test of liability for damages for nervous shock was reasonable foreseeability
 of the plaintiff being injured by nervous shock as a result of the defendant’s negligence,
 Applying that test, the plaintiff was entitled to recover damages from the defendants
 because even though the plaintiff was not at or near the scene of the accident at the time
 or shortly afterwards the nervous shock suffered by her was a reasonably foreseeable
 consequence of the defendant’s negligence. The appeal would accordingly be allowed

      rurring). In the area of nervous shock caused by negligence on the highway, the sole test
    a of liability is reasonable foreseeability without any legal limitation in terms of space,
      time, distance, the nature of the injuries sustained or the relationship of the plaintiff to
      the victim (although those are factors to be considered), since (per Lord Bridge) there are
      no policy considerations sufficient to justify limiting the liability of negligent tortfeasors
      by some narrower criterion than that of reasonable foreseeability. If (per Lord Scarman)
      public policy requires such a limitation, the policy issue where to draw the line is not
      justiciable but a matter for legislation (see p 310 b to h, p 3 11 r to g. p 3 17 ft p 319 / t o
      j and p 320 e tog, post).
         Per Lord \ \ ilberforce. The application of the reasonable foreseeability test in nervous
      shock claims ought to be limited, in terms of proximity, so that what is foreseeable is
      circumscribed by the proximity of the tie or relationship between the plaintiff and the
      injured person, the proximity of the plaintiff to the accident both in time and place, and
    £ the proximity of communication of the accident to the plaintiff through sight or hearing
      of ihe event or its immediaie aftermath (see p 303 d t o / a n d p 3 0 4 / to p 305 e, post).

A ppeal
The plaintiff, Rosina McLoughlin, appealed against the judgment of the Court of Appeal
(Stephenson, Cumming-Bruce and Griffiths LJJ) ([1981] 1 All ER 809, [1981] QB 599) g
given on 16 December 1980 dismissing her appeal against the judgm ent of Boreham J
on 11 December 1978 whereby the judge dismissed her claim against the defendants,
Thomas Alan O’Brian, A E Docker & Sons Ltd, Raymond Sygrove and Ernest Doe Si Sons
Ltd, the respondents to the appeal, for damages for shock, distress and injury to her
health. The facts are set out in the opinion of Lord Wilberforce,
                                                                                       f
Michael Ogden QC and Jonathan Haworth for the appellant,
Michael Turner QC and John Leighton Williams for the respondents.

Their Lordships took time for consideration.

6 May, The following opinions were delivered.                                              g

L O R D W I L B E R F O R C E . My Lords, this appeal arises from a very serious and tragic
road accident which occurred on 19 October 1973 near Withersfield, Suffolk. The
appellant’s husband, Thomas McLoughlin, and three of her children, George, aged 17,
Kathleen, aged 7, and Gillian, nearly 3, were in a Ford motor car; George was driving.
A fourth child, Michael, then aged 11, was a passenger in a following motor car driven fr
by Mr Pilgrim; this car did not become involved in the accident. The Ford car was in
collision with a lorry driven by the first respondent and owned by the second
respondent. That lorry had been in collision with another lorry driven by the third
respondent and owned by the fourth respondent. It is admitted that the accident to the
Ford car was caused by the respondents’ negligence. It is necessary to state what followed
in full detail.                                                                             j
   As a result of the accident, the appellant’s husband suffered bruising and shock; George
suffered injuries to his head and face, cerebral concussion, fractures of both scapulae and
bruising and abrasions; Kathleen suffered concussion, fracture o f the right clavicle,
bruising, abrasions and shock; Gillian was so seriously injured that she died almost
immediately.
   At the time, the appellant was at her home about two miles away; an hour or so
afterwards the accident was reported to her by Mr Pilgrim, who told her that he thought
    HL                 McLoughlin v O'Brian (Lord Wilberforce)                            301

      .George was dying, and that he did not know the whereabouts of her husband or the
. a condition o f her daughter. He then drove her to Addenbrooke’s hospital, Cambridge,
      There she saw Michael, who told her that Gillian was dead. She was taken down a
      corridor and through a window she saw Kathleen, crying, with her face cut and begrimed
       with dirt and oil. She could hear George shouting and screaming. She was taken to her
      husband who was sitting with his head in his hands. His shirt was hanging off him and
       he was covered in m ud and oil. He saw the appellant and started sobbing. The appellant
  b was ^ e n taken to see George. The whole of his left face and left side was covered. He
      appeared to recognise the appellant and then lapsed into unconsciousness. F in a ll y , the
      appellant was taken to Kathleen who by now had been cleaned up. The child was too
      upset to speak and simply clung to her mother. There can be no doubt that these
      circumstances, witnessed by the appellant, were distressing in the extreme and were
      capable of producing an effect going well beyond that of grief and sorrow,
  c      The appellant subsequently brought proceedings against the respondents. At the trial,
      the judge assumed, for the purpose of enabling him to decide the issue of legal liability,
      that the appellant subsequently suffered the condition of which she complained. This
      was described as severe shock, organic depression and a change of personality. Siumerous
     symptoms of a physiological character are said to have been manifested. The details were
      not investigated at the trial, the court being asked to assume that the appellant’s condition
  d         keen caused or contributed to by shock, as distinct from grief or sorrow, and that the
     appellant was a person of reasonable fortitude.
         On these facts, or assumed facts, the trial judge, Boreham J, gave judgm ent for the
     respondents holding, in a most careful judgm ent reviewing the authorities, that the
     respondents owed no duty of care to the appellant because the possibility of her suffering
     injury by nervous shock, in the circumstances, was not reasonably foreseeable,
 e       On appeal by the appellant, the judgm ent o f Boreham J was upheld, but not on the
     same ground see [1081] 1 All ER 809, [1981] QB 599)- Stephenson LJ took the view that
     the possibility of injury to the appellant by nervous shock wus reasonably foreseeable and
     that the respondents owed the appellant a duty of care. However, he held that
     considerations of policy prevented the appellant from recovering. Griffiths LJ held that
     injury by nervous shock to the appellant was ‘readily foreseeable’ but that the respondents
 f owed no duty of care to the appellant. The duty was limited to those on the road
     nearby. Cumming-Bruce LJ agreed with both judgments. The appellant now appeals
     to this House. The critical question to be decided is whether a person in the position of
     the appellant, ie one who was not present at the scene of grievous injuries to her family
    but who comes on those injuries at an interval o f time and space, can recover damages for
    nervous shock.
 g      Although we continue to use the hallowed expression ‘nervous shock’, English law,
    and common understanding, have moved some distance since recognition was given to
    this symptom as a basis for liability. Whatever is unknown about the mind-body
    relationship (and the area of ignorance seems to expand with that o f knowledge), it is
    now accepted by medical science that recognisable and severe physical damage to the
    human body and system may be caused by the impact, through the senses, o f external
 h e^ents on the mind. There may thus be produced what is as identifiable an illness as any
    tuat may be caused by direct physical impact. It is safe to say that this, in general terms,
    is understood by the ordinary man or woman who is hypothesised by the courts in
    situations where claims for negligence are made. Although in the onlv case which has
    reached this House (Hay (or Bourhill) v loung [1942] 2 All ER 396, [1943'] AC 92) a claim
    for damages in respect o f ‘nervous shock’ was rejected on its facts, the House gave dear
/ recognition to the legitimacy, in principle, o f claims of that character. As the result of
    that and other cases, assuming that they are accepted as correct, the following position
    has been reached:
         1.     W hile damages cannot, at common law, be awarded for grief and sorrow, a claim
    for damages for ‘nervous shock’ caused by negligence can be made without the necessity
    of showing direct impact or fear of immediate personal injuries for oneself. The
    reservation made by Kennedy J in Dulieu v White & Sens [1901] 2 KB 669, [1900-3] All
    ER Rep 353, though taken up by Sargant LJ in Hambrock v Stokes Bros [1925] 1 KB 141,
302                            All England Law Reports                    [1982] 2 All ER

[1924] All ER Rep 110, has not gained acceptance, and although the respondents, in the
courts below, reserved their right to revive it, they did not do so in argument. 1 think a
that it is now too late to do so. The arguments on this issue were fully and admirably
stated by the Supreme Court of California in Dillon v Legg (196S,: 29 ALR 3d 1316,
    2. A plaintiff mav recover damages for ‘nervous shock brought on by injury caused
not to him or herself but to a near relative, or by the fear of such injury. So far (subject
to 5 below), the cases do not extend beyond the spouse or children of the plaintiff
(Hambrook v Stokes Bros [1925] 1 KB 141, [1924] All ER Rep 110, Boardman v Sanderson £
[1964] 1 WLR 1317, Hm~ v Berrv[i97o] 1 All ER 1074, [>97°] * QB 40, including foster
children (where liability was assumed), and see King v Phillips [ i 9 5 3 ] > All ER 617, [19 5 3 ]
 1 QB 419).                                              ,       ,    ,, ,       . .        ,
     3. Subject to the next paragraph, there is no English case in which a plaintin has been
able to recover nervous shock damages where the injury to the near relative occurred out
 of sight and earshot of the plaintiff. In Hambrook v Stokes Bros an express distinction was c
 made between shock caused by w hat the mother saw with her own e^es and what she
 might have been told by bystanders, liability being excluded in the latter case,
     4. An exception from, or I would prefer to call it an extension of, the latter case has
 been made where the plaintiff does not see or hear the incident but comes on its
 immediate aftermath. In Boardman v Sanderson the father was within earshot of the
 accident to his child and likely to come on the scene; he did so and suffered damage from
 what he then saw. In Marshall v Lionel Enterprises (197 0 - 5 DLR (3d; 141 thewifecame
 immediatelv on the badlv injured body of her husband. And in Benson v Lee [1972] \ R
 879 a situation existed with some similarity to the present case. The mother was in her
 home 100 vards a wav, and, on communication by a third party, ran out to the scene of
 the accident and there suffered shock. Your Lordships have to decide whether or not to
 validate these extensions.                                                                         e
      5. A remedv on account of nervous shock has been given to a man who came on a
 serious accident involving people immediately thereafter and acted as a rescuer of those
  involved (C hadw k v British Transport Commission [ 19 ^ 7 ] 2 All ER 9 45 , [>967] 1 " LR
  91 2). ‘Shock’ was caused neither bv fear for himself nor by fear or horror on account of
  a near relative. The principle o f‘rescuer’ cases was not challenged by the respondents and
  ought, in mv opinion, to be accepted. But we have to consider whether, and how far, it f
  can be applied to such cases as the present.
      Throughout these developments, as can be seen, the courts have proceeded in the
  traditional manner of the common law from case to case, on a basis of logical necessity.
  If a mother, with or without accompanying children, could recover on account of fear for
  herself, how can she be denied recovery on account of fear for her accompanying
  children? If a father could recover had he seen his child run over by a backing car, how g
  can he be denied recovery if he is in the immediate vicinity and runs to the child s
  assistance? If a wife and mother could recover if she had witnessed a serious accident to
  her husband and children, does she fail because she was a short distance away and
  immediately rushes to the scene? (cf Benson v Lee). I think that, unless the law is to draw
  an arbitrary line at the point of direct sight and sound, these arguments require
  acceptance of the extension mentioned above under principle 4 in the interests of justice, /j
       If one continues to follow the process of logical progression, it is hard to see why the
   present plaintiff also should not succeed. She was not present at the accident, but she
   came very soon after on its aftermath. If, from a distance of some 100 yards (cf Benson '
   Lee), she had found her family by the roadside, she would have come within principle 4
   above. Can it make any difference that she comes on them in an ambulance, or, as here,
   in a nearby hospital, when, as the evidence shows, they were in the same condition, j
   covered with oil and mud, and distraught with pain ? If Mr Chadwick can recover when,
   acting in accordance with normal and irresistible human instinct, and indeed moral
   compulsion, he goes to the scene of an accident, may not a mother recover if, acting
   under the same motives, she goes to where her family can be found?
       I could agree that a line can be drawn above her case with less hardship than would
   have been apparent in Boardman’s and Hint’s cases, but so to draw it would not appeal to
   most people's sense of justice. To allow her claim may be, I think it is, on the margin of
      HL                  McLoughlin v O'Brian (Lord Wilberforce)                              303

      what the process of logical progression would allow. But where the facts are strong and
      exceptional, and, as I think, fairly analogous, her case ought, prima facie, to be assimilated
      to those which have passed the test.
         To argue from one factual situation to another and to decide by analogy is a natural
      tendency o f the human and legal mind. But the lawyer still has to inquire whether, in
      so doing, he has crossed some critical line behind which he ought to stop. That is said to
      be the present case. The reasoning by which the Lords Justices decided not to grant relief
fr    to the plaintiff is instructive. Both Stephenson and Griffiths LJJ accepted that the 'shock'
      to the plaintiff was foreseeable; but from this, at least in presentation, they diverge.
      Stephenson LJ considered that the defendants owed a duty of care to the plaintiff but
      that for reasons of policy the law should stop short of giving her damages; it should limit
      relief to those on or near the highway at or near the time of the accident caused by the
      defendants’ negligence. He was influenced by the fact that the courts of this country,
C     and of other common law jurisdictions, had stopped at this point: it was indicated by the
      barrier of commercial sense and practical convenience. Griffiths LJ took the view that,
     although the injury to the plaintiff was foreseeable, there was no duty of care. The duty
     of care of drivers of motor vehicles was, according to decided cases, limited to persons and
     owners o f property on the road or near to it who might be directly affected. The line
     should be drawn at this point. It was not even in the interest o f those suffering from
(/   shock as a class to extend the scope of the defendants’ liability: to do so would quite likely
     delay their recovery by immersing them in the anxiety of litigation.
         I am deeply impressed by both of these arguments, which I have only briefly
     summarised. Though differing in expression, in the end, in m y opinion, the two
     presentations rest on a common principle, namely that, at the margin, the boundaries of
     a m an ’s responsibility for acts of negligence have to be fixed as a matter of policy,
e    Whatever is the correct jurisprudential analysis, it does not make any essential difference
     whether one savs, with Stephenson LJ, that there is a duty but, as a matter of policy, the
     consequences of breach of it ought to be limited at a certain point, or whether, with
     Griffiths LJ, one says that the fact that consequences may be foreseeable does not
     automatically impose a duty of care, does not do so in fact where policy indicates the
     contrary. This is an approach which one can see very clearly from the way in which Lord
f    Atkin stated the neighbour principle in Donoghue v Stevenson [1932] AC 462 at 580,
     t* 93 2] All ER Rep 1 at 11 :‘. . . persons who are so closely and directly affected by my act
     that I ought reasonably to have them in contemplation as being so affected . . . ’
        This is saying that foreseeability must be accompanied and limited by the law’s
     judgm ent as to persons who ought, according to its standards o f value or justice, to have
     been in contemplation. Foreseeability, which involves a hypothetical person, looking
g    with hindsight at an event which has occurred, is a formula adopted by English law, not
     merely for defining, but also for limiting the persons to whom duty may be owed, and
     the consequences for which an actor may be held responsible. It is not merely an issue
     of fact to be left to be found as such. When it is said to result in a duty of care being owed
     to a person or a class, the statement that there is a ‘duty o f care’ denotes a conclusion into
     the forming o f which considerations of policy have entered. That foreseeability does not
h    of itself, and automatically, lead to a duty of care is, I think, clear. I gave some examples
     in Anns v Merlon London Borough [1977] 2 All ER 492 at 498, [1978] AC 728 at 752, Anns
     itselt being one. I may add what Lord Reid said in McKVu- v Holland ir Hannen ir Cubitts
     'Scotland: Ltd [1969] 3 All ER 1621 at 1623:‘A defender is not liable for a consequence of
     a kind which is not foreseeable. But it does not follow that he is liable for every
     consequence which a reasonable man could foresee.’
/       We must then consider the policy arguments. In doing so we must bear in mind that
     cases o f ‘nervous shock’and the possibility of claiming damages for it are not necessarily
     confined to those arising out of accidents in public roads. To state, therefore, a rule that
     recoverable damages must be confined to persons on or near the highway is to state not
     a principle in itselt but only an example of a more general rule that recoverable damages
     must be confined to those within sight and sound of an event caused by negligence or,
     at least, to those in close, or very close, proximity to such a situation.
        The policy arguments against a wider extension can be stated under four heads. First,
304 ~                          All England Law Reports________[19 8 2 ] 2 All ER

it mav be said that such extension may lead to a proliferation of claims, and possibly
fraudulent claims, to the establishment of an industry of lawyers and psychiatrists w ho a
will formulate a claim for nervous shock damages, including what in America is called
the customary miscarriage, for all, or many, road accidents and industrial accidents.
Second, it may be claimed that an extension of liability would be un.air to defendants,
as imposing damages out of proportion to the negligent conduct complained of. In so tar
as such defendants are insured, a large additional burden will be placed on insurers, ond
 ultimately on the class of persons insured: road users or employers. Third, to extend
 liability bevond the most direct and plain cases would greatly increase evidentiary
 difficulties and tend to lengthen litigation. Fourth, it may be said (and the Coun o:
 Appeal agreed w ith this; that an extension of the scope o f liability ought only to be made
 by the legislature, after careful research. This is the course w hich has been taken in ew
 South Wales and the Australian Capital Territory.
    The whole argument has been well summed up by Dean Prosser in The Law cj Tcits c
(4th edn, 1971) P -56:
        'The reluctance o f courts to enter this zone even where the mental injur\ is
     clearly foreseeable, and the frequent mention of the difficulties o f proof, the *au*it\
     of fraud and the problem of finding a place to stop and draw the line, suggest that
     here it is the nature of the interest invaded.and the type of damages w hich is the real ^
     obstacle.'
     Since he wrote, the type o f damage has, in this country at least, become more familiar
 and less deterrent to recovery. And some of the arguments are susceptible of answer.
 Fraudulent claims can be contained by the courts, which, also, can cope with evidentian
 difficulties. The scarcity o f cases which have occurred in the past, and the modest sums
 recovered, giv e some indication that fears of a flood of litigation may be exaggerated,             g
 experience in other fields suggests that such fears usually are. If som e increase does
 occur, that may only reveal the existence of a genuine social need; that legislation has
 been found necessary in Australia may indicate the same thing.                                 ^
     But, these discounts accepted, there remains, in my opinion, just because shock in us
 nature is capable of affecting so wide a range of people, a real need for the law to pla^e
 some limitation on the extent of admissible claims. It is necessary to consider three                f
  elements inherent in any claim: the class of persons whose claims should be recognised,
  the proximity of such persons to the accident; and the means by which the shock is
  caused. As regards the class of persons, the possible range is between the closest of tami \
  ties, of parent and child, or husband and wife, and the ordinary bystander. Existing lav.
  recognises the claims of the first; it denies that of the second, either on the basis that sue
  persons must be assumed to be possessed of fortitude sufficient to enable them to endure            g
  the calamities of modern life or that defendants cannot be expected to compensate the
  world at large. In my opinion, these positions are justifiable, and since the present case
  falls within the first class it is strictly unnecessary to say more. I think, however, that it
  should follow that other cases involving less close relationships must be very caret ull\
   scrutinised. I cannot say that they should never be admitted. The closer the tie (not
   merely in relationship, but in care) the greater the claim for consideration. The claim,               h
   in any case, has to be judged in the light o f the other factors, such as proximity to the
   scene in tim e and place, and the nature of the accident.
      As regards proximity to the accident, it is obvious that this must be close in bot time
   and space. It is after all, the fact and consequence of the defendant s negligence that must
   be proved to have caused the 'nervous shock’. Experience has shown that to insist on
   direct and immediate sight or hearing would be impractical and unjust and that under                   y
    what may be called the ‘aftermath’ doctrine, one who, from close proximity comes ye
    soon on the scene, should not be excluded. In my opinion, the result in Benson '
    [1972] VR 879 w as correct and indeed inescapable. It was based, soundly, on irec
    perception of some of the events which go 10 make up the accident as an entire event, an
    this includes . . . the immediate aftermath’. The High Court of Australia s
    decision in Chester v Waverley Municipal Council (19 3 9 ) 62 CLR 1, where a child s          )
                HL                   McLoughlin v O'Brian (Lord Wilberforce)                             305

               was found floating in a trench after a prolonged search, may perhaps be placed on th?
               other side of a recognisable line (Evatt J in a powerful dissent placed it on the same side),
               but in addition, I find the conclusion o f Lush J in Benson v Lee to reflect developments in
               the law.
                  Finally, and by way of reinforcement of'afterm ath’ cases, I would accept, by analogy
               with ‘rescue’ situations, that a person of whom it could be said that one could expect
               nothing else than that he or she would come immediately to the scene (normally a parent
               or a spouse) could be regarded as being within the scope of foresight and duty. Where
               there is not immediate presence, account must be taken of the possibility of alterations
               in the circumstances, for which the defendant should not be responsible.
                  Subject only to these qualifications, I think that a strict test of proximity by sight or
               hearing should be applied by the courts.
                  Lastly, as regards communication, there is no case in which the law has compensated
               shock brought about by communication by a third party. In Hambrook v Stokes Bros
               [1925]                     1 KB 141, [19-4] All ER Rep 110, indeed, it was said" that liability would not arise
               in such a case, and this is surely right. It was so decided in Abram^ik v Brenner {1967) 65
    )         DLR (id) 651. The shock must come through sight or hearing of the event or of its
               immediate aftermath. Whether some equivalent of sight or hearing, eg through
•             simultaneous television, would suffice may have to be considered.
        !   d     My Lords, I believe that these indications, imperfectly sketched, and certainly to be
        ;     applied with common sense to individual situations in their entirety, represent either the
               existing law, or the existing law with only such circumstantial extension as the common
        ,     law process may legitimately make. They do not introduce a new principle. Nor do I see
        i     any reason why the law should retreat behind the lines already drawn. I find on this
               appeal that the appellant’s case falls within the boundaries of the law so drawn. I would
            g allow her appeal.

                 L O R D E D M U N D - D A V IE S . My Lords, I am for allowing this appeal. The facts                           'jfS U S fiE

                 Wilberforce, and both he and my noble and learned friend Lord Bridge have spaciously                                        si
                 reviewed the case law relating to the recovery o f damages for personal injury resulting
            f   from nervous shock. My own observations can, in the circumstances, be substantially
                 briefer than I had originally planned.
                     It is common ground in the appeal that, the appellant’s claim being based on shock,
                   . . there can be no doubt since Hay (or Bourhill) v. Young ([1942] 2 All ER 396, [1943] AC
                 92 that the test of liability. . . is foreseeability of injury by shock’(per Denning LJ in King
                v Phillips [1953] 1 All ER 617 at 623, [1953] 1 QB 429 at 441). But this was not always
                the law, and great confusion arose in the cases from applying to claims based on shock
                 restrictions hedging negligence actions based on the infliction of physical injuries. In the
                same year as that in which King v Phillips was decided, Goodhart perceptively asked why
                it was considered that the area of possible physical injury should be relevant to a case
                based on the unlawful infliction of shock, and continued (16 MLR, p 22):
                        ‘A woman standing at the window of a second-floor room is just as likely to
                     receive a shock when witnessing an accident as she would be if she were standing on
                     the pavement. To say that the careless driver of a motor-car could not reasonably
                     foresee such a self-evident fact is to hide the truth behind a fiction which must
                     disappear as soon as we examine it. The driver obviously cannot foresee that the
                     woman at the window will receive a physical injury, but it does not follow from this
                     that he cannot foresee that she will receive a shock. As the cause o f action is based                       $ m \d
                     on shock it is only foresight of shock which is relevant.’                                                   %■ s r f u i
                Indeed, in King v Phillips itself Denning LJ expressly held that the fact that the plaintiff                      ggUU? I
                                                                                                                                  f. Oi i l l t

                   It is true that, as Goodhart observed, in most cases the foresight concerning emotional
                injury and that concerning physical injury are identical, the shock following the physical                        a. e i a . i i

courts tended to assume that this must be so in all cases. But in fact, as Goodhart
laconically put it, ‘The area of risk of physical injury may extend to only X yards, while
the area of risk of emotional injury may extend to Y yards’. That error still persists is
indicated by the holding of Stephenson LJ in the instant case that the ambit of duty of
care owed by a motorist is restricted to persons ‘on or near the highway at or near the
time of the accident’ (see [1981] 1 All ER 809 at 820, [1981] QB 599 at 614), and by
Griffiths LJ to those ‘on the road or near to it who may be directly affected by the bad
driving. It is not owed to those who are nowhere near the scene’ (see [ 1981 ] 1 All ER 809
at 827, [ i° 8 i] Q B 599 at 623). The most striking feature in the present case is that such
limits on the duty of care were imposed notwithstanding the unanimous conclusion of
the Court o f Appeal that it was reasonably foreseeable (and even ‘readily’ so in the
judgm ent of Griffiths LJ) that injury by shock could be caused to a person in the position
of the appellant.
   Similar restrictions were unsuccessfully sought to be imposed in H awes v Harwood
[1935] > KB 146, [1934] All ER Rep 103, the plaintiff having been inside a police station
when he first saw the bolting horses and therefore out of sight and seemingly out of
danger. And they were again rejected in Chadwick v British Transport Commission [1967]
2 All ER 945, [1967] 1 WLR 912, where the plaintiff was in his home 200 yards away
when the Lewisham railway accident occurred. Griffiths LJ expressed himself as ‘quite
unable to include in the category of rescuers to whom a duty [of care] is owed a relative
visiting victims in hospital’ (see [1981] 1 All ER 809 at 827, [1981 ]QB 599 at 623). I do
not share the difficulty, and in my respectful judgm ent none exists. I am here content
to repeat once more the noble words of CardozoJ in Wagner v International Rlys 0 ( 1 9 2 1 )
 232 NY Rep 176 at 1S0:
          ‘Danger invites rescue. The cry of distress is the summons to relief. The law does
       not ignore these reactions of the mind in tracing conduct to its consequences. It
       recognises them as normal. It places their effect within the range of the natural and
       probable. The wrong that imperils life is a wrong to the imperilled victim; it is
       wrong also to his rescuer.’
   Was not the action of the appellant in visiting her family in hospital immediately she
heard of the accident basically indistinguishable from that of a ‘rescuer’, being intent on
comforting the injured? And was not her action 'natural and probable’ in the
circumstances? I regard the questions as capable only of affirmative answers, and,
indeed, Stephenson LJ so answered them.
   I    turn to consider the sole basis on which the Court of Appeal dismissed the claim, that
of public policy. They did so on the ground of what, for short, may be called the
‘floodgates’ argument. Griffiths LJ presented it in the following way ([1981] 1 All ER
809 at 823, [1 9 8 O Q B 599 at 617):

          ‘If the [appellant’s] argument is right it will certainly have far-reaching
       consequences, for it will not only apply to road traffic accidents. Whenever anybody
       is injured it is foreseeable that the relatives will be told and will visit them in
       hospital, and it is further foreseeable that in cases of grave injury and death some of
       those relatives are likely to have a severe reaction causing illness. O f course, the
       closer the relationship the more readily it is foreseeable that they may be so affected,
       but if we just confine our consideration to parents and children and husbands and
       wives, it is clear that the potential liability of the tortfeasor is vastly increased if he
       has to compensate the relatives as well as the immediate victims of his carelessness.’
He continued ([1981] 1 All ER 809 at 827, [1981] QB 599 at 623):
         ‘Every system of law must set some bounds to the consequences for which a
       wrongdoer must make reparation. If the burden is too great it cannot and will not
       be met, the law will fall into disrepute, and it will be a disservice to those victims
       who might reasonably have expected compensation. In any state of society it is
       ultimately a question of policy to decide the limits of liability.’

      Stephenson LJ expressed the same view by citing his own observation when giving the
  judgment of the Court of Appeal in Lambert v Lewis [1980] 1 All ER 978 at 1006, [1980]
* 2 WLR 299 at 331 that'There comes a point where the logical extension of the boundaries

  convenience’.                                                                             . ,
      My Lords, the experiences of a long life in the law have made me very familiar with
   this 'floodgates' argument. I do not, of course, suggest that it can invariably be dismissed
   as lacking cogency; on the contrary, it has to be weighed carefully, but I have often seen
   it disproved by later events. It was urged w hen abolition of the doctrine of common
   employment was being canvassed, and it raised its head again when the abolition of
   contributory negligence as a total bar to a claim in negligence was being urged. And,
   even before my time, on the basis of conjecture later shown to be ill-founded it provided
   a fatal stumbling-block to the plaintiff’s claim in the 'shock’ case of \ icron'an RlysCcmrs

C in stirring words which are quoted in the speech of my noble and learned friend Lord

         My Lords, for such reasons as those developed in the speech of my noble and learned
      friend Lord Wilberforce and which it would serve no purpose for me to repeat in less
      felicitous words of mv own, I remain unconvinced that the number and area of claims
    . in ‘shock’ cases would” be substantially increased or enlarged were the respondents here
      held liable. It is a question which Kennedy J answered in Dulieu v White <r Sens [ ' 9 0 1 ]
      2 KB 669 at 681, [1900-3] All ER Rep‘353 at 360 in the following terms, which
      commend themselves strongly to me:
             ‘I should be sorrv to adopt a rule which would bar all such claims on grounds of
           policy alone, and in order to prevent the possible success of unrighteous or
e          groundless actions. Such a course involves the denial of redress in meritorious cases,
           and it necessarily implies a certain amount of distrust, which I do not share, in the
           capacity of legal tribunals to get at the truth in this class of claim.’
       My Lords, in the present case two totally different points arising from the speeches of
    two of your Lordships call for further attention. Both relate to the Court of Appeal s
/ invoking public policy. Unless I have completely misunderstood my noble and learned
    friend Lord Bridge, he doubts that any regard should have been had to such a
    consideration, and seemingly considered the Court of Appeal went wrong in paying any
    attention to it. The sole test of liability, I read him as saying, is the reasonable
    foreseeability of injury to the plaintiff through nervous shock resulting from the
    defendant’s conceded default. And, such foreseeability having been established to their
    unanimous satisfaction, it followed that in law no other course was open to the Court of
     Appeal than to allow this appeal. I have respectfully to say that I cannot accept this
     approach, It is true that no decision was cited to your Lordships in which the contrary
     has been held, but that is not to say that reasonable foreseeability is the only test of the
     validity of a claim brought in negligence. If it is surmounted, the defendant would
     probably be hard put to escape liability.
 /)     Lord Wright found it difficult to conceive that any new head of public policy could be
     discovered (see Fender v Mildmay [1937] 3 All ER 402 at 427, [1938] AC 1 at 41). and,
     were Lord Halsbury LC sound in denying that any court could invent a new head of
     policy (seeJansen v Driefontein Consolidated Mines [1902] AC 484 at 491, [1900-3] All ER
     Rep 426 at 429), I should have been in the happy position of accepting the standpoint
     adopted by mv noble and learned friend Lord Bridge. But, as I shall later indicate, the
 j more recent view which has found favour in your Lordships’ House is that public policy
     is not immutable. Accordingly, whilst I would have strongly preferred indicating with
     clarity where the limit of liability should be drawn in such cases as the present, in my
     judgm ent the possibility of a wholly new type of policy being raised renders the
      attainment of such finality unfortunately unattainable.
         As I think, all we can say is that any invocation of public policy calls for the closest
      scrutiny, and the defendant might well fail to discharge the burden of making it good,
308                            All England Law Reports                       [1 9 8 2 ] 2 All ER

as indeed, happened in Rondel v W’orsley [ i 067] 3 All ER 9 9 3 ’ [>9 6 9 ] ■ AC 191. But that
is not to say that success for the defendant would be unthinkable, for, in the words of g
MacDonald" 1 in Seva Mink Ltd v Trans-Canada Airlines [ 19 5 1] 1 DLR 241 at 254;
          . . there is always a large element of judicial policy and social expediency
      involved in the determination of the duty-problem, however it may be obscured by
      the use of traditional formulae.’
   I accordingly hold, as Griffiths LJ did, that 'The test of foreseeability is not a universal £
touchstone to determine the extent of liability for the consequences ot wrongdoing .’see
[1981] 1 All ER S09 at S23 [ io S ijQ B 599 a! 618). Authority for that proposition is both
ample in quantitv and exalted in status. My noble and learned friend Lord \\ ilberforce
has already quoted in this context the observation of Lord Reid in McJv'ew v Holland &
Hannen & Cubit:s (Scotland) Ltd [1969] 3 All ER 1621 at 1623, and referred to his own
treatment of the topic in Anns v Merton London Borough [ 1977] 2 All ER 492 at 49S, [197S] q
AC 728 at 752. where further citations are furnished. To add yet another, let me
conclude by recalling that in Hedley Byrne cr Co Ltd v Heller & Partners Ltd [1963] 2 All
ER 575 at 615, [1964] AC 465 at 536 L o rd Pearce observed:
         'How wide the sphere of the duty of care in negligence is to be laid depends
      ultimately on the courts’ assessment of the demands of society for protection from
      the carelessness of others.’ (My emphasis.)                                        0
   I finally turn to consider the following passage in the speech of my noble and learned
friend Lord Scarman:
         ‘Policv considerations will have to be weighed; but the objective of the judges is
      the formulation of principle. And, if principle inexorably requires a decision which
      entails a degree of policy risk, the court’s function is to adjudicate according to e
      principle, leaving policy curtailment to the judgment of Parliament. . . If principle
      leads to results which are thought to be socially unacceptable, Parliament can
      legislate to draw a line or map out a new path.’
And at a later stage my noble and learned friend adds:
         ‘Why then should not the courts draw the line, as the Court of Appeal manfully ^
      tried to do in this case? Simply, because the policy issue where to draw the line ;s
      not justiciable.’
   My understanding of these words is that my noble and learned friend shares (though
for a different reason) the conclusion of my noble and learned friend Lord Bridge that,
in adverting to public policy, the Court of Appeal here embarked on a sleeveless errand, g
for public policy has no relevance to liability at law. In my judgment, the proposition
that ‘. . . the policy issue . . . is not justiciable’ is as novel as it is startling. So novel is it in
relation to this appeal that it was never mentioned during the hearing before your
Lordships. And it is startling because in my respectful judgment it runs counter to well-
established and wholly acceptable law.
    I restrict myself to recent decisions of your Lordships’ House. In Rondel v W’orsley fj
[1967] 3 All ER 993, [1969] 1 AC 191 their Lordships unanimously held that public
policy required that a barrister should be im mune from an action for negligence in
 respect of his conduct and management of a case in court and the work preliminary
 thereto, Lord Reid saying ([1967] 3 All ER 993 at 998, [1969] > AC 191 at 228):
         ‘Is it in the public interest that barristers and advocates should be protected .
       against such actions? Like so many questions which raise the public interest, a
       decision one way will cause hardships to individuals while a decision the other way
       will involve disadvantage to the public interest. . . So the issue appears to me to be
       whether the abolition of the rule would probably be attended by such disadvantage
       to the public interest as to make its retention clearly justifiable.’
    In Home Office v Dorset Yacht Co [1970] 2 All ER 294, [1970] AC 1004 your Lordships
         HL               McLoughlin v O'Brian (Lord Edmund-Davies)                                  309

         House was called on to decide whether the English law of civil wrongs should be
    s    extended to impose legal liability for loss caused by conduct of a kind which had not
         hitherto been recognised by the courts as entailing liability. In expressing the view that
         it did, Lord Diplock said ([1970] 2 All ER 294 at 324, [1970] AC 1004 at 1058):
                 .. . I agree with Lord E)enning MR that what we are concerned with in this
              appeal ’ is . . . at bottom a matter of public policy which we, as judges, must
              resolve".’

           And in British Rlys Board v Herrington [1972] 1 All ER 749 at 756-757, [1972] AC 877
        at So-, dealing with an occupier’s duty to trespassing children, Lord Reid said:
                 Legal principles cannot solve the problem. How far occupiers are to be required
              by law to take steps to safeguard such children must be a matter of public policy.’
    C       N.'.v l-orck' 'y1accordance with such a line of authorities, I hold that public policy issues
        are justiciable. Their invocation calls for close scrutiny, and the conclusion may be that
        its nature and existence have not been established with the clarity and cogency required
        before recognition can be granted to any legal doctrine and before any litigant can
        properl) be deprived of what would otherwise be his manifest legal rights. Or the
        conclusion may be that adoption of the public policy relied on would involve the
        introduction of new legal principles so fundamental that they are best left to the
        legislature: see, for example. Morgans v Launchbury[\i?7i] 2 Al! ER 606 esp at 61 5, [1973]
        AC 127 esp at 142. per Lord Pearson. And ‘Public policy is not immutable’ (per Lord
        Reid m Rondel v Worsley [1967] 3All ER 993 at 998, [1969] 1 AC 199 at 227). Indeed,
        \\ inheld described it as necessarily variable’, and wisely added ((1928) 42 Harv LR at 93):
                 This variability . . . is a stone in the edifice of the doctrine, and not a missile to be
             flung at it. Public policy would be almost useless without it. The march of
            civilization and the difficulty o f ascertaining public policy at any given time make
             it essential. . . How is public policy evidenced? If it is so variable, if it depends on
            the welfare of the community at any given time, how are the courts to ascertain
            it? Some judges have thought this difficulty so great that they have urged that it
            would be solved much better bv the legislature and have considered it to be the
            main reason why the courts should leave public policy alone . . . This admonition
            is a wise one and judges are not likely to forget it. But the better view seems to be
            that the difficulty o f discovering what public policy is at any given moment
            certainly does not absolve the bench from the duty of doing so. The judges are
            bound to take notice of it and o f the changes which it undergoes, and it is immaterial
            that the question may be one of ethics rather than of law.'
           In the present case the Court of Appeal did just that, and in my judgment they were
        right in doing so. But they concluded that public policy required them to dismiss what
        t e\ clearly regarded as an otherwise irrefragable claim. In so concluding, I respectfully
        hold that they were wrong, and I would accordingly allow the appeal.

h   LORD RUSSELL OF K ILLO W EN . My Lords, I make two comments at the
    outset. First, we are not concerned with any problem that might have been posed had
    the accident been not wholly attributable to the negligence of the defendants, but partly
    attributable to negligent driving by the injured son of the plaintiff. Second, the plaintiff
    is to be regarded as of normal disposition or phlegm; we are therefore not concerned to
  ^ investigate the applicability of the ‘thin skull’ cases to this type of case.
/      The facts in this case, and the physical illness suffered by the plaintiff as a result of
    mental trauma caused to her by what she learned, heard and saw at the hospital have
      een set out in the speech o f my noble and learned friend Lord Wilberforce and I do not
    repeat them.
       All members of the Court of Appeal concluded that that which happened to the
    P aintiffwas reasonably foreseeable by the defendants as a consequence of their negligence
    on the road. (In some cases, and at all levels, a reasonable bystander seems to be introduced
310                           All England Law Reports                    [1982] 2 All ER

as a relevant mind; I do not understand why; reasonable foreseeability must sureh be
something to be attributed to the person guilty of negligence.)                                 g
    But, if the effect on this wife and mother of the results of the negligence is considered
to have been reasonablv foreseeable, I do not see the justification for not finding the
defendants liable in damages therefor. I would not shrink from regarding in an
appropriate case policy as something which may feature in a judicial decision. But in this
case what policy should inhibit a decision in favour of liability to the plaintiff? Negligent
driving on the highway is only one form of negligence which may cause wounding or
death and thus induce a relevant mental trauma in a person such as the plaintiff. There
seems to be no policy requirement that the damage to the plaintiff should be on or
adjacent to the highway. In the last analysis any policy consideration seems to be rooted
in a fear of floodgates opening, the tacit question: what next? I am not impressed by that
fear, certainly not sufficiently to deprive this plaintiff of just compensation for the
reasonablv foreseeable damage done to her. I do not consider that such deprivation is c
justified bv trying to answer in advance the question posed, What next ? by a consideration
of relationships of plaintiff to the sufferers or deceased, or other circumstances; to
attempt in advance solutions, or even guidelines, in hypothetical cases may well, it seems
 to me, in this field, do more harm than good.
     I also would allow this appeal.
                                                                                                  d
L O R D SC A R M A N . My Lords, I have had the advantage of reading in draft the speech
 of my noble and learned friend Lord Bridge. It cannot be strengthened or improved by
 any words of mine. I accept his approach to the law and the conclusion he reaches. But
 I also share the anxieties of the Court of Appeal. I differ, however, from the Court of
 Appeal in that I am persuaded that in this branch of the law it is not for the courts but
 for the legislature to set limits, if any be needed, to the law’s development.                   g
     The appeal raises directly a question as to the balance in our law between the functions
 of judge and legislature. The common law, which in a constitutional context includes
 judicially developed equity, covers everything which is not covered by statute. It knows
 no gaps: there can be no casus omissus. The function of the court is to decide the case
  before it, even though the decision may require the extension or adaptation of a principle
 or in some cases the creation of new law to meeLthe justice of the case. But, whatever the f
  court decides to do, it starts from a baseline of existing principle and seeks a solution
  consistent with or analogous to a principle or principles already recognised.
      The distinguishing feature of the common law is this judicial development and
  formulation o f principle. Policy considerations will have to be weighed; but the
  objective o f rhe judges is the formulation o f principle. And, if principle inexorably
  requires a decision which entails a degree o f policy risk, the court s function is to g
  adjudicate according to principle, leaving policy curtailment to the judgm ent of
  Parliament. Here lies the true role of the two law-making institutions in our
  constitution. By concentrating on principle the judges can keep the common law alive,
  flexible and consistent, and can keep the legal system clear of policy problems which
  neither they, nor the forensic process which it is their duty to operate, are equipped to
  resolve. If principle leads to results which are thought to be socially unacceptable, h
  Parliament can legislate to draw a line or map out a new path.
      The real risk to the common law is not its movement to cover new situations and new
  knowledge but lest it should stand still, halted by a conservative judicial approach. If
  that should happen, and since the 1966 practice direction of the House (see Sole [1966]
  3 All ER 7 7 , [1966] 1 WLR 1 2 3 4 )it has becom e less likely, there would be a danger of the

  law becoming irrelevant to the consideration, and inept in its treatment, of modern j
  social problems. Justice would be defeated. The common law has, however, avoided
  this catastrophe by the flexibility given it by generations of judges. Flexibility carries
  with it, o f course, certain risks, notably a degree of uncertainty in the law and the
  'floodgates' risk which so impressed the Court of Appeal in the present case.
      The importance to be attached to certainty and the size of the 'floodgates’ risk vary
  from one branch of the law to another. What is required of the law in its approach to a
                                  McLoughlin v O'Brian (Lord Scarman)                                    311

      chain of causation in fact between his psychiatric illness and the death or injury of one
      or more third parties negligently caused by the defendant. Here again, this is not in
      dispute in the instant case. But, when causation in fact is in issue, it must no doubt be
      determined by the judge on the basis of the evidence o f psychiatrists. Then, here comes
      the all important question. Given the fact of the plaintiff’s psychiatric illness cased by
      the defendant’s negligence in killing or physically injuring another, was the chain of
      causation from the one event to the other, considered ex post facto in the light of all that
      has happened, 'reasonably foreseeable’ by the ‘reasonable m an’? A m om ent’s thought
      will show that the answer to that question depends on what knowledge is to be attributed
      to the hypothetical reasonable man of the operation of cause and effect in medicine.
      There are at least two theoretically possible approaches. The first is that the judge should
      receive the evidence of psychiatrists as to the degree of probability that the particular
      cause would produce the particular effect, and apply to that the appropriate legal test of
      reasonable foreseeability as the criterion of the defendant’s duty of care. The second is
      that the judge, relying on his own opinion of the operation of cause and effect in
      psychiatric medicine, as fairly representative of that of the educated layman, should treat
      himself as the reasonable man and form his own view from the primary facts whether
      the proven chain of cause and effect was reasonably foreseeable. In principle, I think
      there is much to be said for the first approach. Foreseeability, in any given set of
      circumstances, is ultimately a question of fact. If a claim in negligence depends on
      whether some defect in a complicated piece of machinery was foreseeably a cause of
      injury, I apprehend that the judge will decide that question on the basis of the expert
      evidence of engineers. But the authorities give no support to this approach in relation to
      the foreseeability of psychiatric illness. The judges, in all the decisions we have been
      referred to, have assumed that it lay within their own competence to determine whether
      the plaintiff’s ‘nervous shock’ (as lawyers quaintly persist in calling it) was in any given
      circumstances a sufficiently foreseeable consequence of the defendant’s act or omission
      relied on as negligent to bring the plaintiff within the scope of those to whom the
      defendant owed a duty of care. To depart from this practice and treat the question of
      foreseeable causation in this field, and hence the scope of the defendant’s duty, as a
      question of fact to be determined in the light of the expen evidence adduced in each case
      would, no doubt, be too large an innovation in the law to be regarded as properly within
      the corr., -jtence, even since the liberating 1966 practice direction (see .Vote [1966] 3 All
      ER 77. [ 1966] 1 WLR 1234), of your Lordships’ House. Moreover, psychiatric medicine
      is far from being an exact science. The opinions of its practitioners may differ widely.
      Clearly it is desirable in this, as in any other, field that the law should achieve such a
      measure of certainty as is consistent with the demands of justice. It would seem that the
      consensus of informed judicial opinion is probably the best yardstick available to
      determine whether, in any given circumstances, the emotional trauma resulting from
      the death or injury o f chird parties, or indeed the threat of such death or injury, ex
      hypothesi attributable to the defendant’s negligence, was a foreseeable cause in law, as
      well as the actual cause in fact, of the plaintiff's psychiatric or psychosomatic illness. But
      the word I would emphasise in the foregoing sentence is 'informed’. For too long earlier
      generations of judges have regarded psychiatry and psychiatrists with suspicion, if not
      hostility. Now, I venture to hope, that attitude has quite disappeared. No judge who has
      spent any length of time trying personal injury claims in recent years would doubt that
      physical injuries can give rise not only to organic but also to psychiatric disorders. The
      sufferings of the patient from the latter are no less real and frequently no less painful and
      disabling than from the former. Likewise, I would suppose that the legal profession well
      understands that an acute emotional trauma, like a physical trauma, can well cause a
      psychiatric illness in a wide range of circumstances and in a wide range of individuals
      whom it would be wrong to regard as having any abnormal psychological make-up. It
      is in comparatively recent times that these insights have come to be generally accepted
      by the judiciary. It is only by giving effect to these insights in the developing law of
                    HL                         McLoughlin v O'Brian (Lord Bridge)                                         313

                    negligence that we can do justice to an important, though no doubt small, class of
                   plaintiffs whose genuine psychiatric illnesses are caused by negligent defendants.
                       My Lords, in the instant case I cannot help thinking that the learned trial judge’s
                   conclusion that the appellant’s illness was not the foreseeable consequence of the
                   respondents negligence was one to which, understandably, he felt himself driven by the
                                                                                                                                 St
                   authorities. Free of authority, and applying the ordinary criterion of reasonable
                   foreseeability to the facts, with an eye ‘enlightened by progressive awareness of mental
                   illness (the language of Stephenson LJ (see [1981] 1 All ER 809 at 8 19, [ 1 9 8 il OB 509 at

                  Griffiths LJ, it was readily foreseeable that a significant number of mothers exposed to
                  such an experience might break down under the shock of the event and suffer illAess' (see
                  [19S 1] 1 All ER 809 at 822, [1981] QB 599 at 617).
                      The question then, for your Lordships’ decision is w hether the law, as a matter of
                  policy, draws a line which exempts from liability a defendant whose negligent act or
                  omission was actually and foreseeably the cause of the plaintiffs psychiatric illness and,
                  it so, w here that line is tobe drawn. In thus formulating the question, I do not, of course
                  T - -#r j        nt gllgIe" t as Prejudging the question whether the defendant owes the
                  plaintiff a duty but I do use the word ‘foreseeably’ as connoting the normally accepted
                  criterion o f such a duty.                                                          "    y
                    Before attempting to answer the question, it is instructive to consider the historical
                                                                                                                                                  rah
                 development of the subject as illustrated by the authorities, and to note, in particular
                 three features of that development. First, it will be seen that successive attempts have                                         li& i
                 been made to draw a line beyond which liability should not extend, each of which has in                                                   7
                 due course had to be abandoned. Second, the ostensible justification for drawing the line                                    ■    «   ;
               e has been related to the current criterion of a defendants duty o f care, which, however
                 expressed in earlier judgments, we should now describe as that of reasonable
                 foreseeability. But, third, in so far as policy considerations can be seen to have influenced

                     Perhaps the most vivid illustration of all three features is in the verv first case in the
                  series, the decision of the Privy Council in Victorian Rlvs Comrs v Coultas (1888) 13 App

   T wo Irish courts declined to follow this decision; Bell v Great Not tnei n R h Co of Ireland
(i 890) 26 LR Ir 42S, following Byrne v Crcat Southern and \\ estern Rly Co of Ireland (1884) g
unreported. The next English case followed the Irish courts lead. This was Dulieu v
White 6~ Sons [1901] 2 KB 669. [1900-3] All ER Rep 353 - The case was argued on a
preliminary point of law. The plaintiff, again a pregnant lady, pleaded that she had
suffered nervous shock when the defendants’ horse-drawn van was negligent]) drhen
into the public house where she was behind the bar. Kennedy J gave the leading
judgm ent of the Divisional Court in the plaintiff's favour. It is worth quoting the £
passage which is central to his decision, if only to show how far we have travelled in the
last eightv vears in the judicial approach to the kind of medical question presently under
consideration. He said ([ 1001] 2 KB 669 at 677, [ 1900-3] All ER Rep 353 al 3 5 8;-
         ‘For mv ow n part, I should not like to assume it to be scientifically true that a
      nervous shock which causes serious bodily illness is not actually accompanied by
      physical injury, although it may be impossible, or at least difficult, to detea the
      injury at the time in the living subject. I should not be surprised if the surgeon or
      the physiologist told us that nervous shock is or may be in itself an injuiious
      affection of the phvsical organism. Let it be assumed, however, that the physical
      injury follows the shock, but that the jury are satisfied upon proper and sufficient
      medical evidence that it follows the shock as its direct and natural effect, is there an\
      legal reason for saving that the damage is less proximate in the legal sense than
      damage which arises contemporaneously?’
   But earlier in his judgment Kennedy J had drawn a new line of limitation when he
said ([1901] 2 KB 669 at 675; cf [1900-3] All ER Rep 353 at 3 5 7 .:: The shock, where it
operates through the mind, must be a shock which arises from a reasonable fear of
immediate personal injury to oneself.’ He supported this by reference to an earlier case g
(Smith v Johnson & Co {1898) unreported), where the unsuccessful plaintiff suffered from
the shock o f seeing another person killed and said of such a case:
         'I should m vself. . . have been inclined to go a step further, and to hold . . . that,
      as the defendant neither intended to affect the plaintiff injuriously nor did anything
      which could reasonably or naturally be expected to affect him injuriously, there was ^
      no evidence of any breach of legal duty towards the plaintiff. . .
    The next landmark is Hambrook v Stokes Bros [1925] > KB 141, [1924] All ER Rep
 110. This was the case which turned on whether ‘nervous shock caused to a mother by
 fear for her children, who had just disappeared round a corner going up a hill when a
 runaway lorry appeared round the corner going downhill, and when, as it turned out,
 one o f her children was injured, gave a cause of action against the driver w h o s e negligence g
 allowed the lorry to run down the hill. The court by a majority held that it did. The
 leading judgm ent of Bankes LJ sought to demonstrate the absurdity of maintaining the
 boundary o f a defendant’s liability for ‘nervous shock’ on the line drawn by Kenned) J,
 saying ([1925] 1 KB 141 at 151, [1924] All ER Rep 110 at 113):
          ‘Assume two mothers crossing the street at the same time when this lorr) comes
       thundering down, each holding a small child by the hand. One mother is
       courageous and devoted to her child. She is terrified, but thinks only of the damage
       to the child, and not at all about herself. The other woman is timid and lacking in
       the motherly instinct. She also is terrified, but thinks only of the damage to herself
       and not at all about her child. The health of both mothers is seriously affected by
       the mental shock occasioned by the fright. Can any real distinction be drawn                   .
       between the two cases? Will the law recognise a cause ofaction in the case of the less
       deserving mother, and none in the case o f the more deserving one? Does the law
       say that the defendant ought reasonably ro have anticipated the non-natural feeling
       o f the timid mother, and not the natural feeling of the courageous mother? I think
                                      McLoughlin v O'Brian (Lord Bridge)                             315


                   Sareant LJ, in his dissenting judgment, nevertheless sought to uphold the distinction
               essentiallv on the basis that ‘nervous shock’ caused to a plaintiff by fear o f injury to
               himself occasioned by a ‘near miss’ is indistinguishable, so far as the defendant s duty is
                --oncerned, from injury by direct impact, whereas ‘nervous shock’ caused by the tear or
                sight of injury to another is beyond the defendant’s anticipation and hence beyond the
                ranee of his dutv.
                   When one comes to the decision of your Lordships' House in Hay [or Bourhill) v Young
                ri042] 2 All ER 396, [1943] AC 91 it is important to bear in mind, as the speeches
                delivered show, that the difference of judicial opinion in Hambrook v Stokes Bros remame
                unresolved, and indeed that their Lordships did not purport to resolve it. Furthermore,
                on the facts of that case, the result was surely a foregone conclusion. The pursuer was
                alighting from a tram when she heard, but did not see, the impact of a collision between
                a motor cvclist (on whose negligence in driving too fast her claim was based) and a car.
                 The motor cvclist, a stranger to the pursuer, was killed. There is nothing in the report
                 to indicate that she ever saw the body, but after the body had been removed she saw the
                 blood left on the road. In these circumstances I cannot suppose that any judge toda)
                 would dissent from the view that ‘nervous shock’ to the pursuer was not reasonably
                 foreseeable. Nor would anyone, I think, quarrel with the following passage from the
                 speech of Lord Porter as expressing a view of the law as acceptable in 1982 as it was in
    §>        / 1942 ([1942] 2 All E R 396 a t 409, [ 1943 ] AC 92 a t 11 7) :

                     reasonablv to have anticipated as likely to follow from his reckless driving, can e\er
                     form the basis of a claim is not in issue. It is not every emotional disturbance or
                     everv shock which should have been foreseen. The driver of a car or vehicle even
                     though careless is entitled to assume that the ordinary frequenter of the streets as
    & e              sufficient fortitude to endure such incidents as may from time to time be expected
                     to occur in them, including the noise of a collision and the sight of injury to others,
    I                and is not to be considered negligent towards one who does not possess the
                     customary phlegm.’

          { a preference for the dissenting view of Sargant LJ. Lord Thankerton and Lor

        t
        f    is neutral. Lord Wright expressed provisional agreement with the majority decision in

           g sighted passage ([1942] 2 All ER 396 at 405-406, [1943] AC 92 at 110).
         If
         fe              ‘What is now being considered is the question of liability, and this, I think, in a
                      question w hether there is a duty owing to members of the public who c om e within
                      the ambit o f the act, must generally depend on a normal standar o
                      susceptibility. This, it may be said, is somewhat vague. That is true; but definition
                      involves limitation, which it is desirable to avoid further than is necessary m a
                      principle of law like negligence, which is widely ranging and is still in the stage o
                      development. It is here, as elsewhere, a question of what the hypothetical reasonable
                      man, viewing the position, I suppose ex post facto, would say it was proper to
                       foresee. What danger of particular infirmity that would include must depen
                       the circumstances; but generally, I think, a reasonably normal condition, if medical
                       evidence is capable o f defining it, would be the standard. The test of the P ™ ™ " *
               1       extraordinary susceptibility, if unknown to the defendant, would in effect make he
                       defendant an insurer. The lawyer likes to draw fixed and definite lines and is apt to
                       ask where the thing is to stop. I should reply it should stop where in the particular

      Weverley Municipal Council ((1939) 62 CLR 1), where the court by a_majority held
      that no duty was made out. The dissenting judgment of E v a t t , J ., will demand the ^
      consideration of any judge who is called upon to consider these questions.
I shall return later to the judgment of Evatt J to which Lord \ \ right there refers-
    I need not consider in detail the subsequent English Court of Appeal decisions in King
vPhiIiirj[i953] 1 All ER 617, [>9 5 3 ] >QB 419. Boardman v Sander.™ [1964] 1 WLR 1317
and Hin^ v Berry [ 1970] 1 All ER 1074, [1970] 2 QB 40. In King v Phillips [1953]> All ER
617 at 623, [1953] 1 QB 4 2 9 at 441, Denning LJ said: ‘. . . there can be no doubt since Hay
(or Bcurhill; v. Young that the test of liability for shock is foreseeability of injury by shock.
    This observation was cited with approval in Oversea Tankship (I K) Ltd v Morts Do:k
and Engineering Co Ltd The Wagon Mound (So 1)[196'] 1 All ER 404 at 41 5, [1961] AC
 3 S8 at 426. I would add, however, that King v Phillips, a case in which the plaintiff failed,
would, as I think, clearly be decided differently today. By 1970 it was dear that no one
could any longer contend for the limitation of liability for ‘nervous shock to those w ho
 were themselves put in danger by the defendant’s negligence, so much so that in Hin^ v
 Bfrrv a mother who witnessed from one side of the road a terrible accident to her family
 picnicking on the other side of the road recovered damages for her resulting psvchiatric
 illness without dispute on the issue of liability, and the case reached the Court of Appeal
 on the issue of quantum of damages only. Lord Denning MR said ([i 970] 1 All ER 10,4
 at 1 0 7 5 , [1970] 2 QB 40 at 42):
         T h e law at one time said that there could not be damages for nervous shock; but
      for these last 25 years, it has been settled that damages can be given for nervous
      shock caused by the sight of an accident, at any rate to a close relative.
    The only other important English decision is Chadwick v British Transport Commission            e
[1967] 2 All ER 945, [1967] 1 WLR 912. The plaintiff’s husband lived 200 yards from
the scene of the terrible Lewisham railway accident in 1957 in which 90 people were
killed. On hearing of the accident in the evening he went at once to the scene and
assisted in the rescue work through the night until early next morning. As a result of his
experiences of the night he developed an acute anxiety neurosis for which he required
hospital treatment as an in-patient for over six months. After his death from unrelated             f
causes his wife, as administratrix of his estate, recovered damages for his ps>chiatric
illness. This was a decision of Waller J. It was not challenged on appeal and no one, I
believe, has ever doubted that it was rightly decided.
    I should mention two Commonwealth decisions of first instance. In Benson \ Lee
[1972] VR 879 Lush J, in the Supreme Court of Victoria, held that a m other who did not
 witness, but was told of, an accident to her son too yards from her home, went to the              g
 scene and accompanied the child in an ambulance to hospital where he died, was entitled
 to damages for ‘nervous shock’ notwithstanding evidence that she was prone to mental
 illness from stress. In Marshal v Lionel Enterprises Inc (19T1) 25 DLR (3d) 141 Haines J, in
 the Ontario High Court, held that a wife who found her husband seriously injured
 shortly after an accident caused by defective machinery was not, as a matter of law,
 disentitled to damages for the ‘nervous shock' which she claimed to have suffered as a                 fi
 result. On the other hand in Abram~ik v Brenner (i 967) 65 DLR (2d) 651 the Saskatchewan
 Court of Appeal held that a mother who suffered ‘nervous shock on being informed b\
 her husband that two of her children had been killed in a road accident was not entitled
 to recover.                                                                         .     .
     Chester v Waverley Municipal Council (1939) 62 CLR 1, referred to by Lord \ \ right in
 the passage quoted above, was a decision of the High Court of Australia. The plaintiffs                j
 seven-vear-old son having been out to play, failed to return home when expected. A
 search was mounted which continued for some hours. Eventually, in the presence of the
 plaintiff, his mother, the child’s dead body was recovered from a flooded trench which
  the defendant authority had left inadequately fenced. The plaintiff claimed damages for
 ‘nervous shock’. The majority of the court (Latham CJ, Rich and Starke JJ) rejected the
     HL                      McLoughlin v O'Brian (Lord Bridge)                                 317

   claim. The decision was based squarely on the ground that, the plaintiff’s injury not
 a being a foreseeable consequence of the defendant’s omission to fence the trench, they
   owed her no duty. But the judgm ent of Latham CJ contains an interesting example of
   th e ‘floodgates’ argument. He said (at 7-8):
              But in this case the plaintiff must establish a duty owed by the defendant to
          herself and a breach of that duty. The duty which it is suggested the defendant
          owed to the plaintiff was a duty not to injure her child so as to cause her a nervous
 D        shock when she saw, not the happening of the injury, but the result of the injury,
          namely, the dead body of the child. It is rather difficult to state the limit of the
          alleged duty. If a duty of the character suggested^exists at all it is not really said that
          it should be confined to mothers of children who are injured. It must extend to
          some w ider class but to what class? There appears to be no reason why it should
          not extend to other relatives or to all other persons, whether they are relatives or
          not. If this is the true principle of law, then a person who is guilty of negligence
          with the result that A is injured will be liable in damages to B, C, D and any other
          persons who receive a nervous shock fas distinguished from passing fright or distress)
          at any time upon perceiving the results of the negligence, whether in disfigurement
          of person, physical injury, or death.’
(j      In a powerful dissenting judgment, which I find wholly convincing, Evatt J drew a
    \ i\ id picture of the mother s agony of mind as the search continued, culminating in the
   gruesome discovery in her presence of the child s drowned body. I cannot for a moment
   doubt the correctness of his conclusion that the mother's mental illness was the
   reasonably foreseeable consequence of the defendant’s negligence. This was a case from
    New South Wales and I cannot help wondering whether it was not the manifest injustice
 g ot the result which led, a few years later, to the intervention of the New South Wales
   legislature, to enable the parent, husband or wife of a person ‘killed, injured or put in
   peril by another s negligence to recover damages for ‘mental or nervous shock'
   irrespective of any spatial or temporal relationship to the accident in which the death,
   injury or peril occurred.
       My Lords, looking back I think it is possible to discern that there onlv ever were two
f dear lines o f limitation of a defendant's liability for 'nervous shock’ for which any
   rational justification could be advanced, in the light both of the state of the law of
   negligence and the state of medical science as judicially understood, at the time when
   those limitations were propounded. In 18S8 it was, no doubt, perfectly sensible to say:
           Damages arising from mere sudden terror unaccompanied by anv actual physical
        injury, but occasioning a nervous or mental shock, cannot    . be considered a
        consequence which, in the ordinary course of things, would flow from . . .
        negligence.’
    See \ ictorian Rlys Ccmrs v Coultas 13 App Cas 222 at 225.) Here the test, whether of duty
  or of remoteness, can be recognised as a relatively distant ancestor of the modern
   criterion of reasonable foreseeability. Again, in 1901 it was, I would suppose, equally
h sensible to limit a defendant s liability for ‘nervous shock’ which could ‘reasonably or
   naturally be expected' to be such as was suffered by a plaintiff who was himself phvsicallv
  endangered by the defendant's negligence (see Dulieu v White & Sens [1901] 2 KB 669 at
  rr        ^ Ll^0 0 -^      ^ ^ eP 353 at 357 ). But once that line of limitation has been
  crossed, as it was by the majority in Hambrock v Stokes Bros, there can be no logical reason
1 ^ SIeVe[          limiting the defendant s duty to persons in physical proximirv to the place

  contusion in the authorities since Hay (or Bcurhill) v Young, including, if I mav sav so, the
  J gments of the courts below in the instant case, has arisen, as it seems to me, from the
   j f . e r e S - accor^ec^ notwithstanding the acceptance of the Hambrock principle, to

  Sens, and adopted in the dissenting judgment of Sargant LJ in Hamtrrock v Stokes Bros.
   My Lords, before returning to the policy question, it is, i think, highly instructive to (
consider the decision of the Supreme Court of California in Dillon v Legg (1968) 68 C 2d
728. Before this decision the law of California, and evidently of other states of the Union,
had adhered to the English position before Hcmhrook v Stokes Bros that damages for
nervous shock could only be recovered if resulting from the plaintiff s apprehension of
danger to himself, and, indeed, this view had been affirmed by the Californian Supreme
Court only five years earlier. The majority in Dillon v Legg adopted a contrary view in
refusing a motion to dismiss a mother’s claim for damages for emotional trauma caused
by seeing her infant daughter killed by a car as she crossed the road.
   In delivering the majority judgment of the court, TobrinerJ said (at 740-741):
          ‘Since the chief element in determining whether defendant owes a duty or an
      obligation to plaintiff is the foreseeability of the risk, that factor will be of prime
      concern in every case. Because it is inherently intertwined with foreseeability such
      duty or obligation must necessarily be adjudicated only upon a case-by-case basis.
      We cannot now predetermine defendant's obligation in every situation by a fixed
      categorv; no immutable rule can establish the extent of that obligation for every
      circumstance of the future. We can, however, define guidelines which will aid in
      the resolution of such an issue as the instant one. We note, first, that we deal here
      with a case in which plaintiff suffered a shock which resulted in physical injury and
      we confine our ruling to that case. In determining, in such a case, whether
      defendant should reasonably foresee the injury to plaintiff, or, in other terminology,
      whether defendant owes plaintiff a duty of due care, the courts will take into
      account such factors as the following: (i) Whether plaintiff was located near the
      scene of the accident as contrasted with one who was a distance away from it. (2)
      Whether the shock resulted from a direct emotional impact upon plaintiff from the
      sensory and contemporaneous observance of the accident, as contrasted with
      learning of the accident from others after its occurrence. (3) Whether plaintiff and
      the victim were closely related, as contrasted with an absence of any relationship or
      the presence of only a distant relationship. The evaluation of these factors will
      indicate the degree of the defendant’s foreseeability: obviously defendant is more
      likely to foresee that a mother who observes an accident affecting her child will
      suffer harm than to foretell that a stranger witness will do so. Similarly, the degree
      of foreseeability of the third person’s injury is far greater in the case of his
      contemporaneous observance of the accident than that in which he subsequently
      learns of it. The defendant is more likely to foresee that shock to the nearby,
       witnessing mother will cause physical harm than to anticipate that someone distant
       from the accident will suffer more than a temporary emotional reaction. All these
       elements, of course, shade into each other; the fixing of obligation, intimately tied
       into the facts, depends upon each case. In light of these factors the court will
      determine whether the accident and harm was reasonably foreseeable. Such
      reasonable foreseeability does not turn on whether the particular plaintiff as an
       individual would have in actuality foreseen the exact accident and loss; it
      contemplates that courts, on a case-to-case basis, analyzing all the circumstances, will
      decide what the ordinary man under such circumstances should reasonably have
      foreseen. The courts thus mark out the areas of liability, excluding the remote and
      unexpected. In the instant case, the presence of all the above factors indicates that
      plaintiff has alleged a sufficient prima facie case. Surely the negligent driver who
      causes the death of a young child may reasonably expect that the mother will not be
      far distant and will upon witnessing the accident suffer emotional trauma. As Dean
       Prosser has stated: “when a child is endangered, it is not beyond contemplation that
       its mother will be somewhere in the vicinity, and will suffer serious shock.”
       (Prosser, The Law of Tons (3rd edn, 1964) p 353. See also 2 Harper & James, The
       Law of Torts (1956) p 1039.) We are not now called upon to decide whether, in the
     HL                     McLoughlin v 0 ‘Brian (Lord Bridge)                                319

          absence or reduced weight of some of the above factors, we would conclude that the
          accident and injury were not reasonably foreseeable and that therefore defendant
          owed no duty of due care to plaintiff. In future cases the courts will draw lines of
          demarcation upon facts more subtle than the compelling one alleged in the
          complaint before us.’
        The leading minority judgm ent castigated the majority for embarking on a first
     excursion into the 'fantastic realm of infinite liability", a colourful variant of the familiar
b    "floodgates'argument.
        In approaching the question whether the law should, as a matter of policv, define the
     criterion of liability in negligence for causing psychiatric illness by reference to some test
    other than that of reasonable foreseeability it is well to remember that we are concerned
    only with the question of liability of a defendant who is, ex hypothesi, guilty of fault in
    causing the death, injury or danger which has in turn triggered the psychiatric illness.
C    A policy which is to be relied on to narrow the scope of the negligent tortfeasor’s duty
    must be justified by cogent and readily intelligible considerations, and must be capable
    of defining the appropriate limits of liability by reference to factors which are not purely
    arbitrary. A number of policy considerations which have been suggested as satisfying
    these requirements appear to me, with respect, to be wholly insufficient. I can see no
    ground whatever for suggesting that to make the defendant liable for reasonably
d   toreseeable psychiatric illness caused by his negligence would be to impose a crushing
    burden on him out of proportion to his moral responsibility. However liberally the
    criterion of reasonable foreseeability is interpreted, both the number of successful claims
    in this field and the quantum of damages they will attract are likely to be moderate. I
    cannot accept as relevant the well-known phenomenon that litigation may delay recovery
    from a psychiatric illness. If this were a valid policy consideration, it would lead to the
e   conclusion that psychiatric illness should be excluded altogether from the heads of
    damage which the law will recognise. It cannot justify limiting the cases in which
    damages will be awarded for psychiatric illness by reference to the circumstances of its
    causation. To attempt to draw a line at the furthest point which any of the decided cases
    happen to have reached, and to say that it is for the legislature, not the courts, to extend
    the limits of liability any further, would be, to my mind, an unwarranted abdication of
    the court's function o f developing and adapting principles of the common law ro
    changing conditions, in a particular corner of the common law which exemplifies, par
    excellence, the important and indeed necessary part which that function has to play. In
    the end I believe that the policy question depends on weighing against each other two
    conflicting considerations. On the one hand, if the criterion of liability is to be reasonable
    foreseeability simpliciter, this must, precisely because questions of causation in psychiatric
9   medicine give rise to difficulty and uncertainty, introduce an element of uncertainty into
    the law and open the way to a number of arguable claims which a more precisely fixed
    criterion of liability would exclude. I accept that the element of uncertainty is an
    important factor. I believe that the 'floodgates' argument, however, is, as it always has
    been, greatly exaggerated. On the other hand, it seems to me inescapable that any
    attempt to define the limit of liability by requiring, in addition to reasonable
    foreseeability, that the plaintiff claiming damages for psychiatric illness should have
    witnessed the relevant accident, should have been present at or near the place where it
    happened, should have come on its aftermath and thus have some direct perception of it,
    as opposed to merely learning of it after the event, should be related in some particular
    degree to the accident victim— to draw a line by reference to any of these criteria must
,   impose a largely arbitrary limit of liability, I accept, of course, the importance of the
    factors indicated in the guidelines suggested bv Tobriner J in Dilhn v Legg as bearing on
    the degree of foreseeability of the plaintiff's psychiatric illness. But let me give two
    examples to illustrate what injustice would be wrought by any such hard and fast lines
    of policy as have been suggested. First, consider the plaintiff who learned after the event
    of the relevant accident. Take the case of a mother who knows that her husband and

 her imagination of the agonies of mind and body in w hich her famil) d ,
 b l direcT perception of the event? Second, consider the plaintiff who is unrelated to the
 victims of the relevant accident. If rigidly applied, an exclusion of liability to him.would
 have defeated the plaintiff’s claim in Chadwick v British Transport Commission. The Court
 of Appeal treated that case as in a special category because Mr Chadwick v_as a rescuer.
 Now, the special duty owed to a rescuer w h o voluntarily pla.es himself i p» l ■ c
 danger to save others is well understood, and is illustrated by Havnes v Harwood L. o , 3 J ,
 KB 146, [1934] All ER Rep 103, the case of the constable injured in stopping a runawa)

 tr3My Lords J ha ve no^doubt that this is an area of the law of negligence where we should
 resist the temptation to trv vet once more to freeze the law in a rigid posture which
 would deny justice to some who, in the application of the classic principles of negligence e

  Tobriner J that the defendant’s duty must depend on reasonable foreseeabilm and
         ■must necessarilv be adjudicated only upon a case-by-case basis. We cannot now 1
       predetermine defendant’s obligation in every situation by a fixed category. no
       immutable rule can establish the extent of that obligation f o r every circumstance of
       the future.’
    To put the matter in another way. if asked where the thing is to stop I ^ ° u ld a m w e r
  in an adaptation of the language of Lord Wright and Stephenson LJ. \.h e r e in, the
  particular case the good sense of the judge, enlightened by progressive awareness of

    Damages - Personal injury - Psychiatric damage - Servous shock caused by damage to property
b   - Plaintiff suffering nervous shock caused by seeing her house on fire - Fire caused by defendants'
    negligence - Whether defendants liablefor plaintiffs psychiatric damage.

    Practice - Preliminary point of law - Question of far-reaching legal principle - Assumed facts -
    insuitability of procedure.

c The plaintiff engaged the defendants to install central heating in her house. While the
   defendants were carrying out the work the plaintiff returned home one afternoon to see
   smoke pouring from the loft of the house. She telephoned the fire brigade but by the
   time they arrived the whole house was on fire and by the time the fire was brought
   under control over four hours later the house and contents were extensively damaged.
   The defendants admitted liability for the fire and sealed the plaintiff’s claim for damage
d to the house and contents. The plaintiff also claimed damages for nervous shock and
   psychological reaction caused by seeing her house on fire. The defendants disputed that
   claim and when the plaintiff issued a writ the question whether the plaintiff’s claim gave
   rise to cause of action sounding in damages was tried as a preliminary issue. The
   defendants contended (i) that damages for nervous shock could only be recovered, as a
   matter o f law and public policy, if the shock was caused by fear of death or injur)- to a
 e person closely related to the plaintiff and could not be recovered if the shock was caused
   merely by damage to property and (ii) that the plaintiff’s nervous shock was not
   reasonably foreseeable as being a direct consequence of the defendants’ negligence. The
   judge gave judgment for the defendants and the plaintiff appealed.
   Held - Damages for nervous shock or psychiatric damage resulting from witnessing the
( consequences of the defendant’s negligence were not limited to psychiatric damage
   caused by witnessing a personal injury but could be recovered where the plaintiff
   witnessed the destruction of property, such as his home and possessions, as a result of the
   delendant’s negligence, eg in starting a fire, provided the plaintiff proved psychiatric
   damage and not merely grief, sorrow or emotional distress and provided that his
• psychiatric damage was reasonably foreseeable. Whether the plaintiff’s psychiatric
g damage was a reasonably foreseeable consequence of the defendants’ negligence was a
   question of fact to be decided at the trial. The plaintiff’s appeal would therefore be
   allowed (see p 458 c to f h j, p 459 a b, p 461/10 p 462 a, p 463 g, p 464 g to j and p 465 a

h     Per curiam. Questions of far-reaching legal principle, such as the conditions in which
   damages can or cannot be recovered as matter of public policy, are not suitable to be
   determined as preliminary issues on assumed facts (see p 457 h, p 462 a b h to p 463 a,
   post).
      Per Bingham LJ. ‘Nervous shock’ is a misleading and inaccurate term; it is preferable
 . to use the term ‘psychiatric damage’ as comprehending all relevant forms of mental
1 illness, neurosis and personality change (see p 462 d, post).

for the defendants. British Gas pic. on the trial of a preliminary issue, namely: ‘Can the

 i6June. The following judgments were delivered.

 D I L L O N LJ.  This is an appeal by the plaintiff in the action against a decision o 1 S:r ■
 Douglas Frank QC, sitting as a deputy judge of the High Court in the Queen s Bench
 Division, which was given on 19 December 19S6 by way of the determination ot a
 preliminary issue in the action.                                                                  ^
    As to the facts, in the summer of 19S1 the plaintiff, lived (as I apprehend she still does,
 at n Leaver Gardens. Greenford, Middlesex and the defendants, British Gas, were
 engaged to install central heating there. When she was returning home at about 4 pm
 on 1 July 19S1 she saw smoke coming from the loft of the house. She telephoned ^ ^ r e
 brigade but, bv the time the firemen arrived, the whole house was on fire and it took the
 firemen over four hours to get the fire under control. Obviously the house and its
 contents were extensively damaged.
    The defendants admit that the fire was caused by their negligence, i e by the carelessness
 of their emplovees who were working at the house, and we were told that the plaintin s
 claims for damage to the house itself and its contents have been settled. In this action the
 plaintiff’s only claim is for a different type of damage, namely damages for nervous
 shock; bv this is meant that, although she did not suffer any physical injury, the plaintin.
 as the result of seeing her home and its contents ablaze, has suffered a psychiatric or
  mental illness, the effects of which are set out in some detail in her statement of claim.
    The defendants dispute this claim of the plaintiffs, but in order to save costs, especial!)
 as the plaintiff has legal aid, the parties agreed, and the master ordered, that the f o llo w in g
 question should be set down for determination as a preliminary issue, namely:
         'Can the plaintiff recover damages for nervous shock caused by witnessing her
       home and possessions damaged and/or destroyed by a fire caused by the d e f e n d a n ts
       negligence while installing central heating in the plaintiff’s home?’
     CA                         Attia v British Gas pic (Dillon LJ)                               457

        For the purpose of this preliminary issue, the facts alleged in the statement of claim
 a  are to be assumed to be true; in particular it is to be assumed that the plaintiff has suffered
    a psychiatric illness which was caused by the shock of seeing her home and its contents
    ablaze. Causation does not therefore have to be considered on the preliminary issue,
    a though it w ill have to be considered at the trial if the preliminary issue is not answered
    in the negative, as the defendants would wish. The defendants say on the preliminary
    issue that the plaintiff cannot succeed in this action for either of two reasons, namelv
   ( i ; that it was not reasonably foreseeable that the plaintiff might suffer anv psvchiatric
    illness as a result of the defendants’ negligence in starting the fire or (2) that, even if it
    was reasonably foreseeable that the plaintiff might suffer psychiatric illness, damases for
     nervous shock can, as a matter of law and public policy, only be recovered if the^shock
   was caused by the death or injury of a person, or by fear of the death or injury of a person,
   normally a person closely related to the plaintiff, and cannot be recovered il'i’t was merely
 C caused by injury to property.
       The preliminary issue w as raised to test these two contentions of the defendants. The
   depun judge decided in favour of the defendants on the first contention and therefore
   uismissed the action. The plaintiff now appeals.
       The law as to nervous shock’ has recemlv been considered very carefullv and helpfullv
   by the House of Lords in SkLoughlin v O'Brian [19S2] 2 All ER 298. [10S3I 1 AC 410 and
 ° b>'the Hi? h Coun o f Australia mjaensch v Coffey {1984} 54 ALR 417. In SULoughlin v
   0 Brian M9S2] 2 All ER 29S at 3 11, [19S3] 1 AC 410 at 43 1 Lord Bridge said:

              The common law gives no damages tor the emotional distress which a n v normal
          person experiences when someone he loves is killed or injured. Anxiety and
          depression are normal human emotions. Vet an anxiety neurosis or a reactive
e         depression n:ay be recognisable psychiatric illnesses, with or without psychosomatic
          symptoms. So, the first hurdle which a plaintiff claiming damages of" the kind in
          question must surmount is to establish that he is suffering, not merely grief, distress
          or any other normal emotion, but a positive psychiatric illness.’
       The piaintift accepts this statement ot the law, and accordingly it is claimed that what
^  she has suffered, as described in the statement o f claim, amounts to a positive psvchiatric
   illness. \\ here exactly the line is to be draw n betw een p o s s ib ly extravagant grief, distress
   or other normal emotion and a positive psychiatric illness may perhaps be difficult to
   discern in w hat may for all I know be a matter of degree; but that is a matter for the trial
   and does not arise on the preliminary issue.
      In the next place it is to be assumed that the plaintiff is of a normal disposition or
g toughness, possessing, as it has been put in the cases, ‘the customary phlegm’. Whatever
   the position may be at the trial, on this preliminary issue we are not concerned with the
   possibility of it being shown that she has suffered psychiatric illness because, although
   the defendants did not know and she herselt may not have known, she was particularly
   or abnormally’ susceptible to some form of psvchiatric illness.
      A third point which emerges trom the cases cited is that damage for ‘nervous shock’,
h I® *or psvchiatric illness occasioned by shock, is regarded as a separate head of damage,
   distinct, tor example, from damage for personal injury. The law has developed step by
  step and is still developing. In those circumstances I would be particularly reluctant to
    ay dow n any general rule as to the conditions in w hich such damages can or cannot be
  recovered as a matter of public policy. For that reason the procedure of a preliminary
  issue on assumed facts, somewhat briefly stated, has disadvantages w here what is under
j consideration is how the law should develop in a matter ot some general importance.
      That said, however, as appears from the speeches in McLoughlin v O'Brian and the
  judgments in Jaensch v Coffey, a great deal of the difficulty which has been felt over the
     exelopment of the law as to damages tor 'nervous shock’ has arisen in relation to what,
  in the terminology ot the tort of negligence, is described as the question of proximity.
  How tar is it right that the law should allow a claim for damages against a w rongdoer,
  where the w rong done by the wrongdoer was primarily a w rong done to someone other
        than the claimant, and the claimant is a person of whom, at the relevant time, the
        wrongdoer had no knowledge and who may then have been far away from the scene ol g                         H
        the wroncdoer's act? This difficuhv is particularly concerned with whether the
        wrongdoer owed anv duty of care to the claimant. But that difficulty does not arise in
        the present case because in the present case there is no problem of proximity. The
        defendants knew about the plaintiff and unquestionably owed a duty ot care to her not
        10 start a fire in her house. If her claims for damage to the house and contents had not
        been settled, she would have brought the one action against the defendants in which she b
        would have pleaded the negligence of the defendants in starting the fire and would have
        gone on to assert that, bv reason thereof, she had suffered and was sufiering damage and
        loss, which would be put under two headings, namely (1} damage to the house and
        contents and \z-- damage for nervous shock, t h e issues at the trial, assuming the tacts
         pleaded, including the psvchiatric illness, were proved, would have been ,a causation
        and ;b. foreseeabilitv of the damage as a question of remoteness. 1 can see no good reason c
         whv. in such a context, the law should have refused to allow her damages for nervous
         shock’ if she could get over the hurdles of causation and foreseeability as an aspect ot
         remoteness. It cannot make anv diiierence that in the event her claim for damage to the
         house and contents has been settled; the duty was none the less there.
              1 am not therefore prepared to hold that the fact that the shock which caused the
         plaintiff's assumed psvchiatric illness was caused by damage to property must preclude
         her from recovering damages for 'nervous shock’ even it it was r e a s o n a b ly foreseeable
         that she might suffer psvchiatric illness as a consequence of the defendants negligence in
         causing the fire in her house.
              Are the defendants right, then, in asserting a priori that it was not reasonably
         foreseeable rhat the plaintiff might suffer any psychiatric illness as a result of their g
         negligence in starting the fire? It is not necessary that any particular psychiatric illness
         should have been foreseen.
              Whether it was reasonablv foreseeable to the reasonable man, whether a reasonable
         onlooker, or, in the context of the present case, a reasonable gas fitter employed by the
          defendants to work in the plaintiff's house, is to be decided, not on the evidence ot
         psvehiatrists as to the degree of probability that the particular cause would produce the ^
         particular effect in a person of normal disposition or customary phlegm, but bv the
         judge. reiving on his own opinion of the operation of cause and ettect in psychiatric
          medicine, treating himself as the reasonable man. and forming his own view from the
          primarv facts as to whether the chain of cause and effect was reasonably foreseeable .see
          .McLoughlin vO'Briiar: [19S2] 2 All ER 29S at 312, [ 1083] 1 A C 410 at 432 per Lord Bridge .
          The good sense of the judge is, it would seem, to be enlightened by progressive awareness g
          of mental illness ([19S2] 2 All ER 298 at 320, [1983] 1 AC 410 at 443 per Lord Bridge '.
          One consequence of this approach is, however, that the view of the courts as to what is
l i )     reasonably foreseeable is, in this field, likely to lag behind informed medical opinion.
          Another consequence is that a view which finds favour with the courts at one time mav
          well be considered unacceptable and out of date a few years later when progressive
          awareness has progressed further.                                                                 , ^
               The question which the deputy judge asked himself in the present case was whether it
           was readilv foreseeable by the defendants that the ordinary householder exposed to the
           experience undergone by the plaintiff might break down under the shock of the e v e n t
          and suffer psychiatric illness as opposed to grief and sorrow at losing one s home. It
           ‘reasonably’ is substituted for ’readily’, as the judge probably intended. I would for mv ^
           part indorse that as a correct direction. It is not, however, a test of probability as o p p o se d /
           to possibility.
               Was the damage, in the way of pyschiatric illness from shock, although of a d ifferen t
           kind from the damage to the house itself and contents most obviously f o r e s e e a b l e , none
            the less itself foreseeable? Would the reasonable man, endowed with a p p r o p r i a te ! )
            progressive awareness of mental illness, have regarded the danger of psychiatric illness
            from shock as so fantastic or far-fetched that he would have paid no attention to it or

         would he ha\e thought that it was something rhat the plaintiff might suffer from seeing
    a    her house and its contents in flames?
            That, if the house caught fire from the defendants' workmen's fault, the plaintiff
         would see and hear it burning was foreseeable. Bur how much she saw and heard, and
        how extensive was the damage to or destruction of the house and contents by the fire we
        are left to guess at on this preliminary issue. We are asked to say, in effect, that psvchiatric
        illness caused by the shock can never, as a matter of fact rather than law, be a foreseeable
        consequence when a woman sees her home and its contents burning down. I am not
        prepared to make any such general a priori ruling on such scanty material. Whether the
        plaintiff s assumed illness caused by the shock was or was not a foreseeable consequence
        of the defendants negligence must depend on the actual evidence given at the trial.
           Accordingly, I would allow this appeal, set aside the order of the deputv judge and
        leave this action to proceed to trial.
c            It follows that the a ttem p t to decide this action on a prelim inary issue has, in m y
        j u d g m e n t, failed. But, in view o f the expense and delays of litigation at the present time
        and o f the difficult position o f a defendant w ho is not legally aided when sued by a
        legally-aided plaintiff, I would not for m y part criticise the parties’ advisers at all for
        m a king the attempt.


                  T^ere ^ave nou been a series o f decisions by courts of the highest authority
  both in this country and in the Commonwealth dealing with the problems created by
  aaions for damages where the plaintiff is seeking to recover compensation for psvchiatric
  ■“ " - d u e to what has been colloquially called 'nervous shock’. On this appeal counsel
  on both sides relied on two of these decisions, namely the decision of the House of Lords
e in \kLcughlin vO Brian [19S2] 2 All ER ;oS, [1983] AC 410 and the decision of the High
  Court of Australia in Jaensch v Coffey '19S4) 54 ALR 417. However, the circumstances
  giving rise to the preliminary issue with which this appeal is concerned differ from the
  circumstances of those two decisions in two significant respects.
           The first difference is that in those tw o decisions the plaintiff was contending that she
        suffered her injuries because she had learnt that m em bers o f her family had been
f       involved in a serious accident as a result o f which they had either been killed or seriously
        injured while in this case no one had suffered any personal injurv. The plaintiff alleges
        that her injury was caused in consequence o f her seeing her home, o f which she was
        proud, on fire, a fire which continued to b u rn for over four hours before the fire was
        brought und er control by the fire brigade.
      The second difference is that in both o f the earlier decisions the plaintiff had not
g witnessed the accident which caused the injuries to their respective families and the
  judgments therefore focused on the question as to whether the plaintiffs were owed a
    ut\ of care by the defendants, it being contended by both defendants that it could not
  be foreseen that their acts could injure the plaintiffs. However, in this case undoubtedly
  the defendants owed a duty of care to the plaintiff in respect of the damage which was
  caused to her home and indeed she has been compensated for this damage. Furthermore,
  it the plaintiff, who entered the house to telephone the fire brigade, had been physically
  injured, as could have happened, then in relation to that physical injury the defendant's
  would have owed her a duty of care and she would be entitled to be compensated by
  them for that injury. The problem raised by the preliminary issue is therefore whether
  the damage actually alleged to have been suffered by the plaintiff is too remote and is not
  whether there was a breach of a duty of care. The distinction between the two situations
  was discussed in eloquent terms bv Denning LJ in King v Phillips [1953] 1 All ER 617 at
    " - 6 - 3 - [ i 9 5 3 ] 1 QB 419 at 439:

               W hat is the reasoning which admits a cause of action for negligence if the injured
            person is actually struck, but declines it if he only suffers from shock? I cannot see
            why the duty of a driver should differ according to the nature of the injury. I should
            have thought that every driver was under a plain duty which he owed to everyone

  remoteness of damage. He said ([1967] 3 All E R 6 S 6 a t 6 9 1 , [■ 96?] 1 AC 350 at aS5;.
     CA                        Attia v British Gas pic (Woolf LJ)                              461

              The defendant will be liable for any type of damage which is reasonably
 g        foreseeable as liable to happen even in the most unusual case, unless the risk is so
           small that a reasonable man would in the whole circumstances feel justified in
           neglecting i t . .

        In the same case a similar approach was adopted by Lord Upjohn, who said ([1967] 3
     All ER 6S6 at 715—7 16, [1969] 1 AC 350 at 422):
 b        _ The test in tort, as now developed in the authorities, is that the tortfeasor is liable
          ior any damage which he can reasonably foresee may happen as a result of the
          breach however unlikely it may be, unless it can be brushed aside as far fetched.’
     In deciding the preliminary issue in favour of the defendants Sir Douglas Frank (before
   whom the issue was argued, as it was before this court, on the basis that it raised a
 c question of duty of care) said:

              It is widely recognised that the burning of one’s home can be a frightening
          experience and can give rise to a sense of grief and sorrow at the loss of all that is
          embodied in the word home and of ones possessions. It can result in great
          inconvenience and sometimes hardship. Nevertheless, the loss of possessions from
          various causes happens to a large proportion of the population. A burglary can not
          °nl> result in the loss of valued and irreplaceable possessions but to some people it is
          a traumatic and frightening experience. Nevertheless, in mv judgment the ordinary
          householder endures such incidents and the shock of them without suffering mental
          illness. I think that the same applies to nervous shock caused bv a fire, albek in one’s
          own house, uniess the fire caused injury which in turn trisgered off the nervous
g         shock. T haus where I w ould draw the line. In my judgment, therefore, it was not
          reasonably foreseeable that the plaint i tt would suffer mental illness as a result of the
          defendants’ negligence and this action fails.’
         Especially if the question of foreseeability is approached in the manner indicated by
     Lord Reid, as I consider it should be, the deputy judge was not entitled to come to this
     conclusion. I can conceive of circumstances where it”would be readily foreseeable that
     intense distress would be caused to an ‘ordinary householder’ who saw her home being
    ucstroyed by fire particularly if the process w as as protracted as it appears to have been on
    t .e basis of the facts set out in the statement of claim, which for the purpose of the
    determination of the issue have to be assumed to be true. Such distress could well be of
    t e order of the acute emotional trauma [which], like a physical trauma, can well cause
    a psychiatric illness in a wide range of circumstances and in a wide range of individuals’
 9 see Lord Bridge in McLaughlin v O'brian [19S2] 2 All ER 29S at 312, [19S3] 1 AC 410 at
    ->33 *
        It appears from the passage which I have quoted that the deputy judge came to his
    ^•ecis;on in favour of the defendants not only on the basis of foreseeabilitv but also as a
    matter ot policy in accordance with the second ground relied on bv the defendants. With
 ^ regard to this part of SirDouglas Frank's judgment, differing views were taken bv the
    ■‘•ernDers of the House of Lords in Mc'L’ng!n':>! v O’Brian and bv the members of the High
   Court of Australia in Jaensch v Ccjfey on the question w hether, if the injury was
        -seeable, haoility could be excluded as a matter ot policy. Fortunately, for the purposes
        this appeal I do not consider that it is necessary to resolve this divergence of opinion,
      'e n assuming that the test is not confined to being one of foreseeabilitv, I cannot
j '•onceive that, it' the injury w hich the plaintiff alleges that she suffered was a foreseeable
   >-or,sequeni.e of the defendants negligence, there could be anv overriding policy reason
   j°r preventing her recovering damages. As I have already pointed out, she could well
     •ave sustained phvsica! injuries as well as the psychiatric injuries ol w hich she complains
   * rjien .                been entitled to damages and in my view there can be no reason of
   fOluv tor distinguishing between the two tvpes of injury.

  proven, rather than outline and assumed, facts. The second question is much more
g limited. It is whether on the facts pleaded it was reasonably foreseeable by the defendants
  that careless performance of their work might cause psychiatric damage to the plaintiff.
  This is a question of fact w hich, for reasons 1 shall give, cannot in my view be fairly
  decided at this stage.

   The question of principle
b     As Lord Russell pointed out in Hiiv (or Bcurhill) v Yeung [1942] 2 All ER 396 at 401,
   [1943] AC 92 at io i, what the defendant ought to have contemplated as a reasonable
   man is relevant both to testing the existence of a duty as the foundation of alleged
   negligence and to the question of remoteness of damage. The leading cases on psychiatric
   damage have very largely concentrated on examining what was reasonably foreseeable
   by the defendant in order to determine whether the careless defendant owed a duty of
C care to the particular plaintiff at all. This is understandable and perhaps inevitable. A
   defendant, how ever careless, cannot owe a duty of care towards the whole world. It is
   accordingly necessary to apply the tests of proximity and foreseeability derived from
   Lord Atkin’s classic statement in Dcnoghue v Stevenson in order to define the class to whom
   the defendant owes a duty and decide whether the plaintiff falls within it. This is a
   particularly necessary exercise in the psychiatric damage cases, where the defendant will
® ordinarily have no awareness of the plaintiff as an individual before the act of carelessness
   occurs. Unless, therefore, it can be shown that the plaintiff is a person who is so closely
   and directly affected by the defendant’s act that he ought reasonably to have him or her
   in contemplation as being so affected when he directs his mind to the acts or omissions
   which are called in question, the plaintiff cannot surmount the first hurdle which
   confronts any plaintiff in negligence, that of establishing a duty of care.
e      In this case the problem is somewhat different. Since the defendants were working in
   the house where the plaintiff lived, it must have been obvious to them that she would be
   so closely and directly affected by their performance of their work that they ought
   reasonably to have had her in contemplation as being so affected when thev carried out
   the work. It is not, I think, contested that the defendants owed her a duty to take
^ reasonable care to carry out the work so as to avoid damaging her home and property.
   But it is said that the defendants owed her no duty to take reasonable care to carry out
   the work so as to avoid causing her psychiatric damage. This analytical approach cannot,
   I think, be said to be wrong, but it seems to me to be preferable, where a duty of care
   undeniably exists, to treat the question as one of remoteness and ask whether the
   plaintiff’s psychiatric damage is too remote to be recoverable because it was not reasonably
— foreseeable as a consequence of the defendants’ careless conduct. The test of reasonable
   foreseeability is. as I understand it, the same in both contexts, and the result should be
   the same on either approach. So the question in any case such as this, applying the
   ordinary test of remoteness in tort, is whether the defendant should reasonably have
   contemplated psychiatric damage to the plaintiff as a real, even if unlikelv, result of
   careless conduct on his part.
/j     McL.’Hgfiiin v O'Brian [1982] 2 All ER 29S, [1983] AC 410 is the most recent House of
   Lords authority on psychiatric damage and the ratio of that decision is of course binding
   upon us. All members of the House were agreed that for the plaintiff in that case to
   succeed it was necessary for her to show that the psvchiatric damage which she in fact
   suffered was a reasonably foreseeable result of the defendant’s careless driving. A minority
   ot the House Lord Scarman and Lord Bridge} held that that, if causation was established.
j was all that the plaintiff need show and that it was not for the courts on policy grounds
   to limit a right to recover for reasonablv foreseeable psvchiatric damage caused by the
   defendant. Lord Wilberforce and Lord Edmund-Davies. although agreeing ir. the result,
    rejected the contention that reasonable foreseeability was the sole test of liability for the
   consequences of w rongdoing. It w as. they held, proper for the courts to limit on grounds
   of policy, w ithin the larger class of those to whom psychiatric damage was reasonably
464                            All England Law Reports________ [1987] 3 All ER

foreseeable, the class of those to whom a duty of care should be held to be owed, or
Russell accepted policy as something which might in an appropriate case feature in a g
iudicia! decision, but saw no policy requirement to restrict the plaintifl s.right to recov cr
on the facts of that case. The majority ratio of this decision is, theretore. if 1 have correa y
understood their Lordships’speeches, that reasonable f o r e s e e a b i l i t y of psychiatric damage
to the plaintiff is a necessary condition of a successful claim, but that even w e.e
reasonable foreseeability of such damage is shown a right to recover may be denied on
grounds of policy.                                                                              .
     Whether the psychiatric damage suffered by this plaintiff as a result of the carelessness
of the defendants w as reasonably foreseeable is not something which can be aeddeu as a
 question of law. In considering the present question of principle reasonable foresee0b^;.\
 must for the present be assumed in the plaintiff's favour. So the question is whether,
 assuming everything else in the plaintiff’s favour, this court should hoid this claim to Dc
 bad in law because the mental or emotional trauma which precipitated the p.amti s
 psvchiatric damage was caused by her witnessing the destruction of her home anu
 property rather than apprehending or witnessing personal injury or the consequences oi
 personal injury.                                                                                  ,
      It is submitted, 1 think rightly, that this claim breaks new ground. No analogous da.m
 has ever, to my knowledge, been upheld or even advanced. If, therefore, it were proper
 to erect a doctrinal boundary stone at the point which the onward march oi recoroeu
 decisions has so far reached, we should answer the question of principle in the negative
 and dismiss the plaintiff's action, as the deputy judge did. But 1 should for my j>art erect
  the boundary stone with a strong presentiment that it would not be long betore a case
  would arise so compelling on its facts as to cause the stone to be moved to a new and
  more distant resting place. The suggested boundary line is not, moreover, one that g
  commends itself to me as either fair or convenient. Examples which arose in argument
  illustrate the point. Suppose, for example, that a scholars lifes work of research or
  composition were destroyed before his eyes as a result of a defendant s careless conduct,
  causing the scholar to suffer reasonably foreseeable psychiatric damage. Or suppose t a.
  a householder returned home to find that his most cherished possessions had ceen
  destroyed through the carelessness of an intruder in starting a fire or leaving a tap j
   running, causing reasonably foreseeable psychiatric damage to the owner. 1 do not thin,
   a legal principle which forbade recovery in these circumstances could be supported. The
   onlv policy argument relied on as justifying or requiring such a restriction was the need
   to prevent a proliferation of claims, the familiar floodgates argument. This is not
   argument to be automatically discounted. But nor is it, I think, an argument which can
   claim a very impressive record of success. All depends on one’s judgment of the like y g
   result of a particular extension of the law. I do not myself think that refusal by this court
   to lav down the legal principle for which the defendants contend, or (put positively; our
   acceptance that a claim such as the plaintiff’s may in principle succeed, will lead to a
    flood of claims or actions, let alone a flood of successful claims or actions. Insist ence t at
    psvchiatric damage must be reasonably foreseeable, coupled with dear recognition t at a
    plaintiff must prove psychiatric damage as I have defined it, and not merely grief, sorrow /j
    or emotional distress, will in mv view enable the good sense of the judge to ensure
    (adopting Lord Wright’s language in Hav (or Bcurhill) v Yeung [1042] 2 All ER 396 at 4 0 5 -
    406, [1943] AC 92 at 110) that the thing stops at the appropriate point. H i s g o o d sense
    p r o v i d e s a better, because more flexible, mechanism of control than a necessarily arbitrary

      I would therefore answer this broad question of principle in favour of the plaintiff.         /

  The questicn offact                                                                ,

   or in Jaensch v Cofje\ (1984) 54 ALR 417, where the plaintiff was the wife, of the alleged
g tortfeasors immediate victim, although in each of those cases there was a full trial. But
   one must be \ery cautious in determining questions of fact on assumed facts, and the
   risk of doing so unfairly to one side or the other is increased w here, as here, the parties
   were by no means strangers to each other before the careless act occurred. In deciding
   what the defendants should reasonably have foreseen I would wish to have a much fuller
   picture than pleadings can give of the plaintiff’s personality and circumstances as
b manifested to, and known by. the defendants. I therefore decline to answer this question
   because I do not think it is fairly answerable on existing materials at this stage.
      I am accordingly of opinion that this appeal should be allowed. The case should be
   remitted to a judge for trial of all live issues related to reasonable foreseeabilitv, causation
  and damage on the footing that, if the plaintiff succeeds on all these issues, her claim mav
   in principle be upheld. \\ hether the parties wish to defer the assessment of damages, if
C any, is a question for them.

The respondents owned shares in a public companv, F pic, whose accounts for the vesr
ended 3 i March 19S4 showed profits far short of the predicted figure which resulted in
a dramatic drop in the quoted share price. After receipt of the audited accounts for the d
year ended 31 March 1984 the respondents purchased more shares in F pic and later that
year made a successful take-over bid for the company. Following the take-over, the
respondents brought an action against the auditors of the company, alleging that the
accounts of F pic were inaccurate and misleading in that thev showed a pre-tax profit of
some £ i ' - m for the year ended 31 March 19S4 when in fact there had been a loss of over
£400,000, that the auditors had been negligent in auditing the accounts, that the e
respondents had purchased further shares and made their take-overbid in reliance on the
audited accounts, and that the auditors owed them a duty of care either as potential
bidders for F pic because they ought to have foreseen that the 19S4 results made F pic
vulnerable to a take-over bid or as an existing shareholder of F pic interested in buving
more shares. On the trial of a prelfminary issue whether the auditors owed a dutv of care .
to the respondents, the judge held that the auditors did not. The respondents appealed to
the Court of Appeal, which allowed their appeal in part on the ground that the auditors
owed the respondents a duty of care as shareholders but not as potential investors. The
auditors appealed to the House of Lords and the respondents cross-appealed against the
Court of Appeal’s decision that they could not claim as potential investors.

H eld - (1 >The three criteria for the imposition of a duty of care were foreseeabilitv of ^
damage, proximity of relationship and the reasonableness or otherwise of imposing a
duty. In determining whether there was a relationship of proximity between the parties
the court, guided by situations in which the existence, scope and limits of a duty of care
had previously been held to exist rather than by a single general principle, would
determine whether the particular damage suffered was the kind of damage which the ft
defendant was under a duty to prevent and whether there were circumstances from
which the court could pragmatically conclude that a duty of care existed 'see p 573 h to

           (}) The auditor of a public companv's accounts owed no duty of care to a member of
b ft the public at large who relied on the accounts to buy shares in the company because the
        court would not deduce a relationship of proximity between the auditor and a member
        of the public when to do so would give rise to unlimited liability on the pan of the
        auditor. Furthermore, an auditor owed no duty of csre to an individual shareholder in
        the companv who wished to buy more shares in the company, since an individual
        shareholder was in no better position than a member of the public at large and the
c C auditor’s statutory dutv to prepare accounts was owed to the body of shareholders as a
        whole, the purpose for which accounts were prepared and audited being to enable the
        shareholders as a bodv to exercise informed control of the company and not to enable
  i    individual shareholders to buy shares with a view to profit. It followed that the auditors
  ■'   did not owe a duty of care to the respondents either as shareholders or as potential

A ppeal
The third defendants, Touche Ross S: Co (a firm}, the auditors of Fidelity pic, appealed
with leave of the Court of Appeal against the decision of that court (Bingham and Taylor
LJJ, O’Connor LJ dissenting) ([1989] 1 All ER 798- [1989] QB 653) on 29 July 1988 and
the order dated 5 August 1988 allowing in part an appeal by the plaintiff, Caparo
Industries pic (Caparo), against the order dated 15 December 1987 made by Sir Neil ^
Lawson ([198S] BCLC 387), sitting as a judge of the High Court in the Queen's Bench
Division in chambers, whereby, on the hearing of a preliminary issue in an action
brought bv Caparo against the first and second defendants, Steven Graham Dickman and
Robert Anthony Dickman (directors of Fidelity pic), and the auditors, claiming damages
against the first'and second defendants for fraud and against the auditors for negligence, .
the judge held that the auditors did not owe a duty of care to Caparo either as potential J
investors or as shareholders in the company in respect of the audit of the company’s
accounts for the year ended 31 March 1984/The Court of Appeal held that the auditors
owed a dutv to Caparo as shareholders but not as potential investors in the company.
Caparo cross-appealed against the dismissal by the Court of Appeal of their claim that the

     Their Lordships took time for consideration.
 b
     S Februarv. The following opinions were delivered.

     LORD BRIDGE OF HARWICH. My Lords, the appellants are a well-known firm of
     chartered accountants. At all times material to this appeal, they were the auditors of a
     public limited company. Fidelity pic 'Fidelity), which carried on business as manufacturers
 ' C and vendors of electrical equipment of various kinds and whose shares were quoted on
     the London Stock Exchange. On 22 May 1084 the directors of Fidelity announced the
     results for the year ended 31 March 1964. These revealed that profits for the year fell
     well short of the figure which had been predicted, and this resulted in a dramatic drop in
 ; the quoted price of the shares which had stood at u s p per share on 1 March ; 0S4 and
 ■! which, by the beginning of June 1984, had fallen to 6jp. Fidelity’s accounts for the year
: d to 31 March 19S4 had been audited by the appellants and had been approved by the
 •; directors on the day before the results were announced. On 12 June 1084 they were
 ! issued to the shareholders, with notice of the annual general meeting, which took place
 ] on 4 July 1984 and at which the auditors’report was read and the accounts were adopted.
 [      Following the announcement of the results, the respondents Caparo Industries pic
 | fCaparo; began to purchase shares of Fidelity in the market. On 8 June 1984 they
" e purchased : 00,000 shares but they were not registered as members of Fidelity until after
     12 June 19S4 when the accounts were sent to shareholders although they had been
     registered in respect of at least some of the shares which they purchased by the date of
     the annua! general meeting, which they did not attend. On 12 June 19S4 they purchased
     a further 5c.000 shares, and by 6 July 19S4 they had increased their holding in Fidelity
     to 20-cr. of the issued capital. On 4 September 19S4 they made a bid for the remainder
     at i2op per share, that offer being*mcreased to i2 jp per share on 24 September 1984.
     The offer was declared unconditional on 23 October 1084, and two days later Caparo
     announced that it had acquired 91-8* of the issued shares and proposed to acquire the
     balance compulsorily, which it subsequently did.
        The action in which this appeal arises is one in which Caparo alleges that the purchases
     of shares which took place after 12 June 19S4 and the subsequent bid were all made in
   * reliance on the accounts and that those accounts were inaccurate and misleading in a
     number of respects and, in particular, in overvaluing stock and underproviding for after­
     sales credits, with the result that an apparent pre-tax profit of some f i-jm should in fact
     have been shown as a loss of over £400,000. Had the true facts been known, it is alleged.
     Caparo would not have made a bid at the price paid or indeed at all. Caparo accordingly
     commenced proceedings on 24 July 1985 against two of the persons who were directors
     at the material time, claiming that the overvaluations were made fraudulently, and
     against the appellants ;rhe auditors), claiming that they were negligent in certifying, as
     they did, that the accounts showed a true and fair view of Fidelity’s position at the date
     to which thev related. The substance of the allegation against the auditors is contained in
     para 16 of the statement of claim which is in the following terms:
 /              'Touche Ross, as auditors of Fidelity carrying out their functions as auditors and
              certifiers of the accounts in April and May 19S4, owed a duty of care to investors
              and potential investors, and in particular to Caparo, in respect of the audit and
              certification of the accounts. In support of that duty of care Caparo will rely upon
              the following matters:— (1) Touche Ross knew or ought to have known (a, that in

       Fidelity required financial assistance. 2) Touche Ross therefore ought 10 h av e                   :
       foreseen that Fidelity was vulnerable to a take-over bid and that persons such as                  1
       Caparo might well rely on the accounts for the purpose of deciding whether to rake
       over Fidelity and might well suffer loss if the accounts were inaccurate.’                         I
   On 6 July '.05- Sir Neil Lawson, sitting as a judge of the High Court in the Queen's ^
 Bench Division in chambers, made an order for the trial of a preliminary issue, as follows: t
         \ . . whether on the facts set out in paragraphs 4 and 6 and in sub-paragraphs ;                  :
       and '2, of paragraph 16 of the Statement of Claim herein, the Third Defendants,                     j

 Paragraphs 4 and 6 ot the statement ot claim are those paragraphs in which are se: out
 the purchases of shares by Caparo to which I have referred and in which it is claimed that            I
 the purchases made after 12 June 1984 were made in reliance on the information                       <5
 contained in the accounts. There is, however, one correction to be made. Paraerarh 4                  I
alleges that the accounts were issued on i2 ju n e 1984'to shareholders, including Caparo’             j
 but it is now accepted that at that date Caparo, although a purchaser of shares, had not              j
 been registered as a shareholder in Fidelity's register of members.                                   j
   On the trial ot this preliminary issue Sir Neil Lawson, sitting as a judge of the Queen's           |
 Bench Division, held i) that the auditors owed no dutv at common law to Caparo as
investors and ii) that, whilst auditors might owe statutorv duties to shareholders as a
class, there was no common law duty to individual shareholders such as would enable an
individual shareholder to recover damages for loss sustained by him in acting in reliance                  !
on the audited accounts see [ 198S; BCLC 3S- ;.                                 ^                          |
   Caparo appealed to the Court of Apgeal, which, by a majority ;0 ’Connor LJ dissentine;
allowed the appeal holding that, whilst there was no relationship between an auditor and              ^
a potential investor sufficiently proximate to give rise to a duty of care at common ’aw,
there was such a relationship with individual shareholders, so that an individual
shareholder who suffered loss by acting in reliance on negligently prepared accounts,
whether by selling or retaining his shares or by purchasing additional shares, was entitled
to recover in tort fsee [1989] 1 All ER 79S. [19S9] QEr653). From that decision the
auditors now appeal to your Lordships’ House with the leave of the Court of Appeal, and               S
Caparo cross-appeal against the rejection by the Court of Appeal of their claim that the
auditors owed them a duty of care as potential investors.
   In determining the existence and scope of the duty of care which one person mav owe
to another in the infinitely varied circumstances of human relationships there has for
long been a tension between two different approaches. Traditionally the law finds the                     u
existence of the duty in different specific situations each exhibiting its own particular
characteristics. In this way the law has identified a wide variety of duty situations, all
falling within the ambit of the tort of negligence, but sufficiently distinct to reauire
separate definition of the essential ingredients by which the existence of the dutv is to be
recognised. Commenting on the outcome of this traditional approach. Lord Atkin, in his
seminal speech in Dcncghue v Stevenscn [1932] AC 562 at 579-5S0. [1932] All ER Rep 1                      .-
at 11, observed:                                                                                      '

         T h e result is that the Courts have been engaged upon an elaborate classification
      of duties as they exist in respect of property, whether real or personal, with further
      divisions as to ownership, occupation or control, and distinctions based on the
      particular relations of the one side or the other, whether manufacterer, salesman or
      Al; £ n g i * n d L a w R e p o n s   S M a t c h T9&0

               landlord, customer, tenant, stranger, and so on. In this way it can be ascertained at
               anv rime whether the law recognizes a duty, but only where the case can oe re,erred
               to some particular species which has been examined and classified. And vet the: .m y
               which is common to all the cases where liability is established must logica..y be
               based upon some element common to the cases where it is tound to exist.
       It is this last sentence which signifies the introduction of the more modern approach ot
       seeking a single genera! principle which may be applies in all circumstances to deie. .„ine
       she existence of a duty of care. Vet Lord Atkin himseif sounds the appropriate note of
       caution by adding:
               T o seek a complete loeical definition of the general principle is probably to go
            bevond the function of the judge, for the more ge.neral the definition the more
            likely it is to omit essentials or to introduce non-essentials.
       Lord Reid gave a laree impetus to the modern approach in HomeCjfice v Do-set Yacht Co
       I_w'[!0;c]2 All ER 2*04 at - 97 , 1 >9ro] AC i o n at io2tf-ic2-. where hessiu.
                     ‘In later vears there has been a steady trend towards regarding the law ot
                  negligence as depending on principle so that, when a new point emerges, one should

                   [io -o ] AC 1004, the position has now been reached that in order to establish that a
                   dutv of care arises in a particular situation, it is not necessary to bring 'he facts ot
                   that situation within those of previous situations in which a duty of care has been
                   held to exist. Rather the question has to be approached in two stages. First one has
                    to ask whether, as between the alleged wrongdoer and the person who has suffered
                    damaee there is a sufficient relationship of proximity or neighbourhood such _that,
                    in the'reasonable contemplation of the former, carelessness on his pan may be likelv
                    to cause damaee to the latter, in which case a prima facie duty ot care arises.
                    Secondly, if the first question is answered affirmatively, it is necessan to consider
                    whether, there are anv considerations which ought to negative, or to reduce or limit
                     the scope of the dutv or the class of person to whom it is owed or the damages to
                     which a breach of it may give rise (see the Dorset Yunt case L197c] 2 All ER 294 at

   damage, necessary ingredients in any situation giving rise to a dutv of care are that there
  shouid exist between the party owing the duty and the party to whom it is owed a
  relationship characterised by the law as one of'proximity' or neighbourhood’ and that
  the situation should be one in which the court considers'it fair, just and reasonable that
  the law should impose a duty of a given scope on the one panv tor the benefit of the
  other. But it is implicit in the passages referred to that the concepts of proximitv and
  tairncss embodied in ihese additional ingredients are not susceptible of any such precise
  definition as would be necessary to give them utility as practical tests, but amount in
  effect to little more than convenient labels to attach to the features of different specific
  situations which, on a detailed examination o f all the circumstances, the law recognises
  pragmatically as giving rise to a duty of care o f a given scope. Whilst recognising, of
 course the importance ot the underlying general principles common to the whole field
 ot negligence, I think the law has now moved in rhe direction o f attaching greater
 significance to the more traditional categorisation of distinct and recognisable situations
 as guides to the existence, the scope and the limits of the varied duties“of care which the
 law imposes. We must now. I think, recognise the wisdom of rhe words of Brennan I in
 the High Court ot Australia in Sutherland Shire Council v Hreman : j oS5; 60 ALR 1 at
 4 4 , where he said:                                         '      '

          It is pre.e.able in m\ \iew, that the law should develop novel categories of
      negligence incrementally and by analogy with established categories, rather than bv
      a mass:\e extension of a prima tacie duty of care restrained onlv bv indefinable
       considerations which ought to negative, or to reduce or limit the scope of the dutv
      or the class ot person to whom it is owed”.’
    One of the most important_distinctions always to be observed lies in the law's essentially 1
 ditterent approach to the different kinds of damage which one panv mav have suffered (
 in consequence of the acts or omissions of another. It is one thing to owe a dutv of care
 to avoiu causing injury to the person or property of others. It is auite another'to avoid
 causing others to suffer purely economic loss. A graphic illustration of the distinction is
 embodied in the proposition that—
         In case ot a wrong done to a chattel the common law does not recognize a person f
      whose on! v rights are a contractual right to have the use or services of the chattel for
      purposes ot making profits or gains without possession of or propertv in the chattel.
      Such a person cannot claim for injury done to his contractual rig h t. ’.

    The proposition derives from Cattle v Stocktcn Waterworks Co ; )S75‘ LR 10 QB 453,
[ 1874-80] All ER Rep 220. It has recently been reaffirmed in Candlewood \a\igation Corp
Ltd v Mitsui OSK Lines Ltd, The Mineral Transporter, The WarakiMaru [19S5] 2 All F.R 935.
[ 1p86] AC 1 and Leigh & Sillavan Ltd v Aliakmon Shipping Co Ltd, The Aliakmon [ 1ps6] 2 All
ER 145, [1986] AC 7S5. In the former case Lord Fraser, delivering the judgment of the
Privy Council, said ([1985] 2 All ER 935 at 945, [1986] AC 1 at 25
        Their Lordships consider that some limit or control mechanism has to be imposed
     on the liability of a wrongdoer towards those who have suffered economic damage
     in consequence of his negligence. The need for such a limit has been repeatedly
     asserted in the cases, from Cattle's case to Cahex [stt Caltex Oil !AustraliaPrv Ltd v
     Dredge U illemstad '1976) 136 CLR 529), and their Lordships are not aware that a
     view to the contrary has ever been judiciallv expressed.’
   The damage which may be caused by the negligently spoken or written word will
normally be confined to economic loss sustained by those who rely on the accuracy of
the information or advice they receive as a basis for action. The question what, if anv
duty is owed by the maker of a statement to exercise due care to ensure its accuracy arises
t'pically in relation to statements made by a person in the exercise of his calling or

                plaintiff invested monev in a limited company m reliance on accounts 01 the company
                prepared by the companv's accountants at the^equest ot the managing director, w nicn
                were shown to the plaintifl and discussed with him by the accountants ;n the knowledge
                that he was interested as a potential investor in the company. The accounts were
J
                inaccurate and misleading and the plaintiff, having invested in the company in reliance
                on them, lost his monev. Denning LJ, in his dissenting judgment, held the plaintiff
                entitled to recover damages for the accountants' negligence.
              9     In the H edlex B \r n e case [ 1963] 2 All E R 575- [> 964] AC 465 bankers were asKed about
                the financial stability of a customer ot the bank. They gave a favourable reference, albeit
                with a disclaimer of responsibility. The circumstances or the inquiry made it clear to the
                bankers that the party on whose behalf the inquiry was made wanted to know if they
                could safely extend credit to the bank’s customer in a substantial sum. Acting on the
                reference given, the plaintiffs extended credit to the bank s customer who in due course
                defaulted. Although the House held that the bankers were protected by the disclaimer
                of responsibility, the case provided the opportunity to review the law. which led to the
                 reinstatement of C ann v W illson, the overruling of' the majority decision in the Candler
                 case and the approbation of the dissenting judgment of Denning LJ in that case._
                    The most recent decision of the House, which is very much in point, is that ot the two
                appeals heard together of Smith v Eric 5 Biisk (a firm ), H arris v U \ r e Forest DC „;pS 9 ] 2 All

                 purchased in reliance on valuations of the properties made by surveyors acting for and
                 on the instructions of the mortgagees proposing to advance money to the plaintiffs to
                 enable them to effect their purchases. In both cases the surveyors fees were paid by the
                 plaintiffs and in both cases it turned out that the inspections and valuations had been

negligently carried out and '.hat ihe proper!) was seriously defective so that the plaintiffs
suffered financial loss, in Smith's case the mortgagees were a building society, the
surveyors who carried out the inspection and valuation were a firm employed by the
building society, and their report was shown to the plaintiff. In Hurra's case the
mortgagees w ere the local authority who employed a member of their own staff to carry            j
out the inspection and valuation. His report was not shown to the plaintiff, but the              j
plaintiff rightly assumed from the local authority's offer of a mortgage loan that the            j
property had been professionally valued as worth at least the amount of the loan. In both         i
cases the terms agreed between the plaintiff and the mortgagee purported to exclude any           I
liability on the part of the mortgages or ihe surveyor for the accuracy of the mortgage           ■
valuation. The House held that in both cases the surveyor making the inspection and               I
valuation ow ed a duty of care to the plaintiff house purchaser and that the contractual           ;
clauses purporting to exclude liability were struck down by ss 2.2; and j 1(3; of the Unfair       j
Contract Terms Act 1077.
    The salient feature of all these cases is that the defendant giving advice or information
was fully aware of the nature of the transaction w hich the plaintiff had in contemplation,
knew that the advice or information would be communicated to him directly or
indirectly and knew that it was verv like! v that the plaintiff would rely on that advice or
information in deciding whether or r.ot to eng2ge in the transaction in contemplation.
In these circumstances the defendant couid clearly be expected, subject always to the
effect of any disclaimer of responsibility, specifically to anticipate that the plaintiff would
rely on the advice or information given bv the defendant for the very purpose for which
he did in the event relv on it. So also the plaintiff, subject again to the effect of any             j
disclaimer, would in that situation reasonably suppose that he was entitled to rely on the
advice or information communicated to him for the very purpose for which he required
it. The situation is entirely different where a statement is put into more or less general
circulation and mav foreseeablv be relied on bv strangers to the maker of the statement
for any one of a varietv of different purposes which the maker of the statement has no
specific reason to anticipate. To hoid the maker of the statement to be under a duty of
care in respect of the accuracy of the statement^o all and sundry for any purpose for
which they may choose to re!v on it is not only to subject him, in the classic words of
Cardozo CJ, to 'liability in an indeterminate amount for an indeterminate time to an
indeterminate class’ [see Ultramares Corp v Touche (1931) 155 NY 170 at 1791, it is also to
confer on the world at large a quite unwarranted entitlement to appropriate for their
own purposes the benefit of the expert knowledge or professional expertise attributed to
the maker of the statement. Hence, looking only at the circumstances of these decided
cases where a duty o f care in respect of negligent statements has been held to exist. I
should expect to find that the ‘limit or control mechanism . . . imposed on the liability of
a wrongdoer towards those w ho have suffered economic damage in consequence of his
negligence’ see the Candlewood case [1965] 2 All ER 935 at 045, [19S6] AC 1 at 25 rested
on the necessity to prove, in this category of the tort of negligence, as an essential
ingredient of the ‘proximity" between the plaintiff and the defendant, that the defendant
knew' that his statement w ould be communicated to the plaintiff, either as an individual             j
or as a member of an identifiable class, specifically in connection w ith a particular
transaction or transactions of a particular kind ^eg in a prospectus inviting investment;
and that the plaintiff would be very likely to rely on it for the purpose of deciding
whether or not to enter on that transaction or on a transaction ot that kind.
    I find this expectation fully supported by the dissenting judgm ent of Denning LJ in
Candler v Crane Christmas & Co [1051] 1 All ER 426 at 433-436, [1051 j 2 KB 164 at 170-               j

        ‘Let me now be constructive and suggest the circumstances in which I say that a

  I            to examine books, accounts, and other things, and to make reports on which other
              people— other than their clients— rely in the ordinary course of business . . .
              Secondly, to whom do these professional people owe this dutv? I will take
 S            accountants, but the same reasoning applies to the others. Thev owe ;he dutv, of
 j            course, to their employer or client; and also, I think, to anv third person ;o whom
 j            they themselves show the accounts, or to whom thev know their empiover is going
 b            to show the accounts so as to induce him to invest monev or take some other action
 j            on them. I do not think, however, the duty can be extended still further so as to
 J            include strangers of w hom they have heard nothing and to whom their empiover
 !            without their know ledge may choose to show their accounts. Once the accountants
 !            have landed their accounts to their employer, they are not, as a rule, responsible for
              what he does with them without their knowledge or consent . . . The test of
              proximity ;n these cases is: Did the accountants know that the accounts were
              required for submission to the plaintiff and use bv him? . . . Third! v to what
              transactions does the duty of care extend? It extends, I think, onlv to those
              transactions for which the accountants knew their accounts were required. For
              instance, in the present case it extends to the original investment of f o c c which
              the plainntl made in reliance on the accounts, because [the accountants! knew that
              the accounts were required for his guidance in making that investment; but it does
              not extend to the subsequent £2.20 which he invested after he had been two months
              with the company. This distinction, that the duty onlv extends to the v ery
              transaction in mind at the rime, is implicit in the decided cases. . . It wil! be noticed



             would be going too tar to make an accountant liable to any person in the land who
             chooses to rely on the accounts in matters of business, for that would expose him. in
             the words ot C a r o o z o . C.J., in I'tramares Corpn. v. Touche O . 1 9 3 1 ; 2 5 5 NY 373 at
              179 /. to "liability in an indeterminate amount for an indeterminate time to an
             indeterminate class.” Whether he would be lifeble if he prepared his accounts for the
             guidance of a specific class of persons in a specific class of transactions, I do not sav. I
             should have thought he might be. just as the analyst and lift inspector would" be
             liable in the instances I have given earlier. It is, perhaps, worth mentioning that
             Parliament has intervened to make the professional man liable for negligent repons
             given tor the purposes of a prospectus: see s. 40 and s. 43 of the Companies Act,
              1048. That is an instance of liability for repons made for the guidance of a specific
             class ot persons— investors in a specific class of transactions— applying for shares.
             That enactment does not help one way or the other to show what result the common
             law would have reached in the absence of such provisions, but it does show what
             result it ought to reach. My conclusion is that a duty to use care in statement is
             recognised by English law, and that its recognition does not create anv dangerous
             precedent when it is remembered that it is limited in respect of the persons by
             whom and to w hom it is owed and the transactions to which it applies.’
      It seems to me that this masterly analysis, if I mav say so with respect, requires little, if
   any, amplification or modification in the light of later authority and is particularly apt to
   point the way to the right conclusion in the present appeal.
1.     Some of the speeches in the Medley Byrne case derive a duty of care in relation to
J negligent statements from a voluntary assumption of responsibility on the part of the
   maker of the statements. In his speech in Smith v Eric S Bush [19S9] ; All ER 514 at 534,
   [1989] 1 WLR 70c at Si 3 Lord Griffiths emphatically rejected the view that this was the
   true ground ot liability and concluded:
                  ‘The phrase "assumption of responsibility" can only have anv real meaning if it is
  AH Engiano Law Beoorts   S March 1990

          understood as referring :o the circumstances in which the law will deem the maker
          of the statement to have assumed responsibility to the person who acts on the
          advice.'
  I do not think that in the context ot the present appeal anything turns on the difference
  between these two approaches.
     These considerations amply justify the conclusion that auditors of a public company's
  accounts owe no dutv of care to members of the public at large who rel’v or. the accounts
  in deciding to buy shares in the company. If a duty of care"were ow ed so widely, it is
  difficult to see any reason why it should not equally extend to all who relv on the
  accounts in relation to other dealings with a company as lenders or merchants extending
  credit to the company. A claim that such a duty was’owed bv auditors to a bank lending
  to a company was emphatically and convincingly rejected by Millert j in M Saudi San sue
  t Clark Pixiey :a firm, 11 psoj 3 All ER 3 6 1ope] 2 WLR 344, The onlv support for an
  unlimited duty of care owed bv auditors for the accuracv of their accounts to all who
 may foreseeably rely on them is to be found in some jurisdictions in the United States of
 America, where there are striking differences in the law in different states. In this
 jurisdiction I have no doubt that the creation of such an unlimited dutv would be a
 legislative step which it would be tor Parliament, not the courts, to take.
     The main submissions for Caparo are that the necessary nexus of proximitv between
 it and the auditors giving rise to a duty of care stems from (i; the pleaded circumstances
 indicating the vulnerability of Fidelity to a take-over bid and from the consequent
 probability that another company, such as Caparo. would rely on the audited accounts in
 deciding to launch a take-over bid or 'z; the circumstance’ that Caparo was aireadv a
 shareholder in Fidelity when it decided to launch its take-over bid’in reliance on the
 accounts. In relation to the first of these two submissions. Caparo applied, in the course
 of the hearing, for leave to amend para i6 'i: of the statement of claim bv addins the
 words 'or alternatively that it was highly probable that such persons would relv on the
 accounts for that purpose’.
    The case which giv es most assistance to Caparo in support of this submission is S.v::
Group L:d v McFarlane [io-S] 1 NZLR 553. The audited consolidated accounts of a New
Zealand public company and its subsidiaries overstated the assets of rhe group because of
an admitted accounting error. Under the relevant New Zealand legislation "its accounts
were, as in England, accessible to the pubifc The circumstances of rhe groups affairs
were such as to make it highly probable that it would attract a take-over bid. The
plaintiffs made such a bid successfully and when the accounting error was discovered
claimed from the auditors in respect of the shortfall in the assets. QuilliamJ held that
the auditors owed the plaintiffs no duty of care ,;see [ i p r s j 1 NZLR 582:. The majority
of the New Zealand Court of Appeal ;\Voodhouse and Cooke jj; heid that the duty of care
arose from the probability that the company would attract a take-over bid and the bidder
would rely on the audited accounts, although Cooke J held that the shortfall in the assets
below that erroneously shown in the accounts did not amount to a loss recoverable in
tort. Richmond P held that no duty of care was owed. He said [ 1 9 7 s 1 1 NZLR           a:

         ‘All the speeches in Hedley Byrne seem to me to recognise the need for a “special’'
      relationship: a relationship which can properly be treated as giving rise to a special
      duty to use care in statement. The question in any given case is w hether the nature
      o f the relationship is such that one party can fairly be held to have assumed a
      responsibility to the other as regards the reliability of the advice or information. 1
      do not think that such a relationship should be found to exist unless, at least, the
      maker of the statement was, or ought to have been, aware that his advice or
      information would in fact be made available to and be relied on bv a particular
      person or class of persons for the purposes of a particular transaction or type of

                    transaction. I would especially emphasise that to my mind it does not seem
                    reasonable to attribute an assumption of responsibility uniess the maker of the
                    statement ought in all the circumstances, both in preparing himself for what he said
                    and in saying it. to have directed his mind, and to have been able to direct his mind,
                    to some particular and specific purpose ‘or which he was aware that his advice or
                    iniormation would be relied on. In many situations that purpose will be obvious.
                    But the annual accounts of a company can be relied on in all sorts of wavs and for
          ,b        many purposes.’
               I agree with this reasoning, which seems to me to be entirely in line with the principles
            to be derived trom the authorities to which I have earlier referred and not to require
            modification in any respect which is relevant for press.it purposes by reference to
            anything said in this House in Smith v Eric S Bush. I should in anv event be extremely
       Ic reluctant to hold that the question whether or not an auditor owes a dutv o f care to an
           investor buving shares ;n a public company depenjs on the degree of probability that
           the shares will prove attractive either en bloc to a take-over bidder or piecemeal to
           individual investors. It would be equally wrong, in mv opinion, to hold an auditor under
           a duty ot care to anyone who might lend money to a companv bv reason onlv that it was
           foreseeable as hignlv probable that the company would borrow money at some time in
    1 id the year following publication of its audited accounts and that lenders might relv on
           those accounts in deciding ro lend. I am content :o assume the high probability of a take­
           over bid in reliance on the accounts which the proposed amendment of the statement of
           claim would assert but I do not think it assists Caparo"s case.
              The only other English authority to which I need refer in this context is IE3 Fasteners
           Ltdv Marks Blxm & Cc 'a firm- [ipS i] 3 All ER 219, a decision at first instance of Woolf J.
     t e This was another case v. here the plaintiffs, who had made a successful takeover bid for a
      i    company in reliance on audited accounts which had been negligently prepared, sued the
          accountants for damages. Woolf J heid that the auditors owed the plaintiffs a dutv of care
          in the preparation of the accounts 'at 296-20-;. He relied on both Anns’* case '1 0 7 - 1 z

          reaching the conclusion that the duty could be derived from foreseeability alone. For the
          reasons already indicated, I do not agree with this. It mav well be, however, that the
          particular facts in theJES case were sufficient^ establish a basis on which the necessary’
          ingredient of proximity to found a duty of care couid be derived from the actual
          knowledge on the pan of the auditors of the specific purpose for which the plaintiffs
          intended to use the accounts.
J
              The position of auditors in relation to the shareholders of a public limited liability
        9 company arising from the relevant provisions of the Companies Act 1085 is accurately
          summarised in the judgment of Bingham LJ in the Court of Appeal ([1980] 1 All ER -08
          at 804, [1980] QB 653 at 680-681}:

                    The members, or shareholders, of the companv are its owners. But they are too
                  numerous, and in most cases too unskilled, to undertake the dav-to-dav management
    ft h         of that which they own. So responsibility for day-to-day‘management of the
                 company is delegated to directors. The shareholders, despite'their overall powers of
                 control, are in most companies for most of the time investors and little more. But it
                 would, of course, be unsatisfactory and open to abuse if the shareholders received no
                 repon on the financial stewardship of their investment save from those to whom
                 the stewardship had been entrusted. So provision is made for the company in
                 8eneral meeting to appoint an auditor \Companies Act 1985, s 384) whose dutv is to
                 investigate and form an opinion on the adequacy of the company's accounting
                 records and returns and the correspondence between the company's accounting
                 records and returns and its accounts (s 237). The auditor has then to report to the
                 company’s members (among other things) whether in his opinion the company’s

       accounts give a true and fair view of the company's financial position s 23c . !n
       carrving out his investigation and in forming his opinion the auditor necessarily (
       w orks verv closelv with the directors and officers o f the company. He receives his
       remuneration from the company. He naturally, and rightly, regards the company
       as his client. But he is employed by the company to exercise his professional skill
       and judgment for the purpose of giving the shareholders an independent report on
       the reliabilitv of the company's accounts and thus on their inv estment. Vaughan
       Williams J said in Rf Kingston Cotton Mii; Cc [1        1 Ch 6 at 11: "No doubt he is ,
       acting antagonisticaliv to the directors in the sense that he is appointed by the
       shareholders to be a check upon them,'' The auditor's report must be read before
       the companv in general meeting and must be open to inspection by any member of
       the companv 's;4 i). !i is attached to and forms part of the company's accounts
       (s s i j S ' j ; and 239;. A copv of the company's accounts including the auditor’s
       report , must be sent to everv member s :4c;. Any member of the company, even c
       if not entitled to have a copv of the accounts sent to him, is entitled to be furnished
       with a copy of the company's last accounts on demand and without charge s 116

   No doubt these provisions establish a relationship between the auditors and the
shareholders of a companv on which the shareholder is entitled to rely for the protection
of his interest. But the crucial question concerns the extent of the shareholder's interest        <
which the auditor has a duty to protect. The shareholders of a company have a collective
interest in the companv’s proper management and in so far as a negligent failure of rhe
auditor to report accuratelv on the state of rhe company’s finances deprives the
shareholders of the opportunity to exercise their powers in general meeting to call the
directors to book and to ensure that errors in management are corrected, the shareholders
ought to be entitled to a remedy. But in practice no problem arises in this regard since           e
the interest of the shareholders in the proper management of the company's affairs is
indistinguishable from the interest of the company itself and any loss suffered by the
shareholders, eg bv the negligent failure of the auditor to discover and expose a
misappropriation of funds bv a director of the company, will be recouped by a claim
against the auditor in the name of the company, not by individual shareholders.                    ,
   I find it difficult to visualise a situation arisin^in the real world in which the individual
shareholder could claim to have sustained a loss in respect of his existing shareholding
referable to the negligence of the auditor which could not be recouped by the company.
But on this pan of the case your Lordships were much pressed with the argument that
such a loss might occur bv a negligent undervaluation of the company’s assets in the
auditor’s repon relied on by the individual shareholder in deciding to sell his shares at an
undervalue. The argument then runs thus. The shareholder, qua shareholder, is entitled
to rely on the auditor’s repon as the basis of his investment decision to sell his existing
shareholding. If he sells at an undervalue he is entitled to recover the loss from the
auditor. There can be no distinction in law between the shareholder’s investment decision
to sell the shares he has or to buy additional shares. It follows, therefore, that the scope of
the duty of care owed to him by the auditor extends to cover any loss sustained                    j
consequent on the purchase of additional shares in reliance on the auditor's negligent
repon.
   I believe this argument to be fallacious. Assuming without deciding that a claim by a
shareholder to recover a loss suffered by selling his shares at an undervalue attributable
to an undervaluation of the companv’s assets in the auditor's repon could be sustained at
all, it would not be bv reason of anv reliance by the shareholder on the auditor’s repon in        j
deciding to sell: the loss would be referable to the depreciatory effect of the repon on the
market value of the shares before ever the decision of the shareholder to sell was taken.
A claim to recoup a loss alleged to flow from the purchase of overvalued shares, on the
other hand, can onlv be sustained on the basis of the purchaser's reliance on the repon.
The specious equation of'investment decisions’ to sell or to buy as giving rise to parallel

    claims thus appears to me to be untenable. Moreover, the loss in the case ot the sale
£   would be of a loss of part ot the value oi the shareholders existing holding, which,
    assuming a dutv of care owed to individual shareholders, it might sensibly lie within the
    scope of the auditor's dutv to protect. A loss, on the other hand, resulting trom the
    purchase of additional shares would result from a wholly independent transaction having
    no connection with the existing shareholding.
       I believe it is this last distinction which isot critical importance and which demonstrates
    the unsoundness of the conclusion reached by the majority of the Court or Appeal. It is
    never sufficient to ask simplv whether A owes B a duty ot care. It is always necessary to
    determine the scope of the dutv bv reterence to the kind of Carnage from whscn A must
    take care to save B harmless:
                T he question is alwavs whether the defendant was under a duty to avoid or
g             prevent that damage, but the actual nature ot the damage sutierec :s relevant to the
              existence and extent of any duty to avoid or present it.’
     :See Sutherland Shire Council v Herman i c i ^ 60 ALR i at 4S per Brennan J.)
!       Assuming for the purpose of the argument that the relationship between the auditor
j    of a companv and individual shareholders ;s ot sufficient proximity to give rise to a duty
J of care. I do not understand how the scope ot that duty can possibly extend beyond the
 ■.d protection of anv individual shareholder from losses in the value of the shares which he
 ■ holds. As a purchaser of additional shares in reliance on the auditor s report, he stands in
 • no different position from any other investing member ot the public to whom the
 ! auditor owes no duty.
 i      I would allow the appeal and dismiss the cross-appeal.
i
® e LO RD ROSKILL. My Lords. I have had the advantage of reading in draft the speeches
    prepared by three of vour Lordships. I agree with them and would allow the appeal and
    dismiss the cross-appeal for the reasons there given. I only add some observations of my
    own out of respect for the two Lords Justices trom whom your Lordships are dinering
    and because of the importance of this case in relation to the vexed question of the extent
1 , of liability of professional men, especially accountants, for putting into circulation
    allegedly incorrect statements whether oral or in writing which are claimed to have been
    negligently made or prepared and which have been acted on by a third party to that
    party's detriment.
        That liability for such negligence if established can exist has been made dear ever since
    the decision of this House in Medley Byrne cr Co Ltd v Heller & Partners Ltd [1963] 2 All
1   ER 575, [1964] AC 465 in which the well-known dissenting judgment of Denning LJ in
  ^ Candler v Crane Christmas cr Co [1951] 1 All ER 426, [1951] 1 ^B 164 was held to have
    stated the law correctly. Thenceforth it was dear that such a duty of care could be owed
    by a professional man to third parties in cases where there was no contractual relationship
    between them, a view of the law long denied as the result ot a succession of late nineteenth
    century cases of which this House then took the opportunity of disapproving.
]       But subsequent attempts to define both the duty and its scope have created more
    problems than the decisions have solved. My noble and learned friends have traced the
    evolution of the decisions from A nnj v Merton London Borough [1977] 2 All ER 4 9 -* [ 197S]
    AC 72S until and including the most recent decisions of your Lordships House in Smith
    v Eric S Bush \aJ7rm), Harris v W'yre Forest DC [ 1969] - All ER 514 , [19S9] ~ W LR 790- 1
    agree with v o u r Lordships that it has now to be accepted that there is no simple formula
  j or touchstone to which recourse can be had in order to provide in every case a ready
     answer to the questions whether, given certain facts, the law will or will not impose
     liability for negligence or, in cases where such liability can be shown to exist, determine
     the extent of that liability. Phrases such as 'foreseeability, proximity, neighbourhood ,
      just and reasonable’, ‘fairness’, ‘voluntary acceptance of risk or voluntary assumption of
     responsibility' will be found used from time to time in the different cases. But, as your
   Afl England L*w Reports 9Merch19&0




                                   All England Law Reports                    [1990] 1 All ER

    Lordships have said, such phrases are not precise definitions. At best thev are but labels
   or phrases descriptive ol the very different factual situations which can exist in particular
   cases and v.hich must be carefully examined in each case before it can be pragmatically
   determined whether a duty of care exists and, if so, what is the scope and extent of that
   duty. If this conclusion involves a return to the traditional categorisation of cases as
   pointing to the existence and scope ot any duty of care, as my noble and learned friend
   Lord B, idge, suggests, I think this is infinitely preferable to recourse to somewhat wide
   generalisations which leave their practical application matters of difficulty and
   uncertainty. This conclusion finds strong support from the judgment of Brennan J in
   the High Court of Australia in the passage cited bv mv noble and learned friends 'see
  Sutherland Shire Ccuncilv Reyman (log 5 . 6c ALR 1 at 4 3 - 4 4 ! .
      My Lords. 1 confess that like Lord Griffiths in Smith v Eric S Busk [ 1 9 8 9 1 2 All ER 5 14
  at 534 , [19S9] 2 WLR 790 at 813, I find considerable difficulty in phrases such as
   voluntary assumption of responsibility’ unless they are to be explained as meaning no <
  more than the existence of circumstances in which the law will impose a liability on a
  person making the allegedly negligent statement to the person to whom that statement
  is made, in which case the phrase does no: help to determine in whst circumstances the
  law will impose that liability or, indeed, its scope. The submission that there is a virtually
  unlimited and unrestricted duty o f care in relation to the performance o f an auditor’s
 statutory duty to certify a company’s accounts, a duty extending to anyone who mav use (
 those accounts for any purpose such as investing in the companv or lending the company
 money, seems to me untenable. No doubt it can be said to be foreseeable that those
 accounts may find their way into the hands ot persons who mav use them for such
 purposes or, indeed, other purposes and lose money as a result. But to impose a liability
 in those circumstances is to hold, contrary to all the recent authorities, that foreseeability
 alone is sufficient, and to ignore the statutory dutv which enioins the preparation of and 1
 certification of those accounts.
     I think that before the existence and scope ot any liability can be determined, it is
 necessary' first to determine for what purposes and ir. what circumstances the information
 in question is to be given. If a would-be investor or predator commissions a report which
 he will use, and which the maker of the report knows he wifi use, as a basis for his
decision whether or not to invest or whether or not to make a bid. it mav not be difficult
to conclude that if the repon is negligently prepared and as a result a decision is taken in
reliance on it and financial losses then follow, a liability will be imposed on the maker of
that repon. But I venture to echo the caution expressed by m y noble and learned friend
Lord Oliver that, because different cases may display cenain common features, thev are
necessarily all cases in which the same consequences regarding liability or the scope of
liability will fo llo w . Moreover, there may be cases in which the circumstances in w hich ^
the report was commissioned justify the inclusion of and reliance on a disclaimer such as
succeeded in the Medley Byrne case but by reason of subsequent statutory provisions failed
in Smith v Erie S Bush.
    Mv Lords, it is for these reasons, in addition to those given bv mv noble and learned
friends, that, as already stated. I would allow this appeal and dismiss the cross-appeal.           ^

L O R D A C K N E R . My Lords, I have had the advantage o f reading the speeches of Lord
    I f ’ !ror'“ Koskill, Lord Oliver and Lord Jauncey and for the reasons they give I. too,
would allow this appeal and dismiss the cross-appeal.

L O R D O L IV E R OF A Y L M E R T O N . My Lords, this appeal, having come to this /
House on a pre.iminary point, involves the making of a number of assumptions of fact
which might or might not be substantiated at the trial of the action. To begin with, it is
to be assumed against the appellants -the auditors that they showed a lack of reasonable
care in certifying that the accounts of Fidelity pic for the year ended 31 March 19S4 gave
a true and fair view of Fidelity s position. It is also to be assumed that, when they certified
    A ll   Engiand   R g p o to   S March   1990




    HL                      Caparo Industries pic v Dickman (Lord Oliver)                     583

     ihe accounts, the auditors knew or would, if thev had thought about it. have known that
  j Fidelitv was vulnerable ;o take-over bids, that a potential bidder would be likelv 10 relv
     on the accuracy ot" the accounts in making his bid and that investors in the market
     een e r a l l v . whether or not already members ot" Fideiitv, would also be likely to or might
     well relv on the accounts in deciding to purchase shares in that company.
        Vour Lordships are not. however, either required or entitled to make anv assumption
     that the purpose of the certification was anvthing other than that of fulfilling the
 £» statutorv d u t y of carrying out the annual audit with a view to the circulation of the
     accounts to persons who were either registered shareholders or debenture-holders of
     Fidelirv and the subsequent laying of the accounts before rhe annual genera! meeting of
     that company.
       Thus, if and so far as the purpose for which the audit was carried out is a relevant
     consideration in determining rhe extent of any genera! duty in tor; ou ed by the auditors
 C to persons other than the company which is their immediate employer, that purpose was
    simplv rhat of fulfilling the statutorv requirements of rhe Companies Act 19S5. That, in
     turn, raises the question, and it is one which lies at the threshold of the inquiry on which
     your Lordships are invited to embark, of what is the purpose behind the legislative
     requirement for the carrying out of an annual audit and rhe circulation of the accounts.
     For whose protection were these provisions enacted and what object were they intended
 d to achieve?
        My Lords, rhe primarv purpose of the statutory requirement rhat a company’s accounts
    shall be audited annuallv is almcsr self-evident. The structure of the corporate trading
    entity, at least in the case of public companies whose shares are dealt with on an
    authorised stock exchange, involves the concept of a more or less widely distributed
    holding of shares rendering the personal involvement of each individual shareholder in
 ® the day-to-day management of the enterprise impracticable, with the result that
    management is necessarily separated from ownership. The management is confided to a
    board of directors which operates in a fiduciary capacity and is answerable to and
    removable by the shareholders who can act. if they act at all. only collectively and onlv
    through the medium of a general meeting. Hence rhe legislative provisions requiring
yr the board annually to give an account of its stewardship to a general meeting of the
    shareholders. This is the only occasion in each year on which the general body of
    shareholders is given the opportunity to cor.sfder, to criticise and to comment on the
    conduct by the board of the company’s affairs, to vote on the directors' recommendation
    as to dividends, to approve or disapprove the directors' remuneration and. if thought
    desirable, to remove and replace all or any of the directors. It is the auditors’ function to
 _ ensure, so far as possible, that the financial information as to the company's affairs
    prepared by the directors accurately reflects the company's position in order, first, to
    protect rhe company itself from the consequences of undetected errors or, possibly,
    wrongdoing by, for instance, declaring dividends out of capital) and, second, to provide
    shareholders with reliable intelligence for the purpose of enabling them to scrutinise the
    conduct 0) the company’s affairs and to exercise their collective powers to reward or
f] control or remove those to whom that conduct has been confided.
       The requirement of the appointment of auditors and annual audit of rhe accounts,
    now contained in ss 235 to 246 of the Companies Act 19S 5. was first introduced by the
    Companies Act 1879 in relation to companies carrying on the business of banking and
    was extended to companies generally by the Companies Act 1900, Section 23 of that Act
    required the auditors to make a report to the shareholders on the company's balance
j sheet laid before the company in general meeting, stating whether the balance sheet
    exhibited a true and correct view of the state of the company’s affairs. By the same
    section, the report was required to be read before the company in general meeting.
    Section 19 of the Companies Act 19c" substituted a new s 23, which, whilst repeating
    the requirement that the auditors’ report should be read before the companv in general
 • meeting, added a requirement that it should be open to inspection by anv shareholder.

who was entitled, on payment of the fee. to be furnished with a copy ot the balance sheet
and report. The new section also mace it an offence for any otncer of the compam to e
panv to issuing, circulating or publishing any cop}' ot the balance sheet which -id not
either append or contain a reference to the auditors' report. The matter was earned one
stage funher bv s 13c of the Companies Act 19:9 consolidating provisions contained in ?
ss 39 and i 1 of the Companies A« 192s; w hich required the annual balance sheet an- :
auditors' repon of a public company to be sent not less than seven u a \ s belore t e -ate ot 5

and entitled anv member of the company and any debenture holder to be .urmsned on
demand and without charge with a copy of the last balance sheet an - the audirors repon. j
 Finallv, for relevant purposes, s 15S of the Companies Act 194S required the accounts 1
and report to be sent to every member ot the company and to everv debenture ho er |
 not less than 21 days before the the general meeting before which the accounts were to |
 be laid.                                           _           .           ...   , -        .     *!
     Thus the historv of the legislation is one ot an increasing availability ot information
 regarding the financial affairs of the company to those having an interest in its prog, ess
 and stability. It cannot fairlv be said that the purpose of making such information
 available is solely to assist those interested in attending general meetings ot the company
 to an informed supervision and appraisal ot the stewardship of the company s d i r e c t o r s ,
 for the requirement to supply audited accounts to, for instance preference shareholders
 having no right to vote at general meetings and to debenture holders, cannot easily be
 attributed to anv such purpose. Nevertheless. 1 do not, for my part, discern in 1 e
 legislation anv departure from what appears to me to be the original, central and PJlrnaO'
  purpose of these provisions, that is to say the informed exercise bv those interest m t e
  property of the companv, whether as proprietors of shares in the company or as the
  holders of rights secured by a debenture trust deed, of such powers as are vested in them
  bv virtue of their respective proprietary interests.                  _     _
    ’ It is argued on behalf of the respondents Caparo that there is to De discerne- in tne
  legislation an additional or wider commercial purpose, namely that of enabling those to
  whom the accounts are addressed and circulated to make informed investment decisions,
  for instance bv determining whether to dispos/of their shares in the market or w e‘ner
  to applv anv funds which they are individually able to command in seeking to purchase
  the shares of other shareholders. O f course, the provision of any information about the
  business and affairs of a trading companv, whether it be contained in annual_ accounts or
  obtained from other sources, is capable of serving such a purpose just as it is capable ot
   serving as the basis for the giving ot financial advice to others, for a rm in g at a mar -et
   price, for determining whether to extend credit to the company, or for the writing ot
   financial articles in the press. Indeed, it is readily foreseeable by anyone who gives the
   matter anv thought that it might w-eil be relied on to a greater or less extent for all or an)
   of such purposes. It is, of course, equally foreseeable that potential investors having no
   proprietary interest in the company, might well avail themselves of the information
   contained "in a company's accounts published in the newspapers or culleu irom an
   inspection of the documents to be nled annually with the registrar of companies .which
    includes the audited accounts; in determining whether or not to acquire shares in the
    companv. I find it difficult to believe, however, that the legislature, in enacting provisions
    ciearlv aimed primarily at the protection of the company and its informed c o n t r o l d \ the
    body of its proprietors, can have been inspired also by consideration for the public at
    large and investors in the market in particular.
        The question is, I think, one of some importance when one comes to consider the
    existence of that essential relationship between the auditors and Caparo to which, in any
    discussion of the ingredients of the tort of negligence, there is accorded the description
    •proximity', for it is now clear from a series of decisions in this House that, at least so tar
     as concerns the law of the United Kingdom, the duty of care in tort depends not soleiv
     on the existence of the essential ingredient of the foreseeability of damage to the plainnn

   I but on its coincidence with a further ingredient to which has been attached the label
* ta proximity’ and which was described bv Lord Atkin in the course ot his speech in
Jt . Donoghue v Stevenson [1932] AC 562 at j S i . [ i 9 3 - j Al' ER Rep 1 at 12 as—
                     'such close and direct relations that the act complained of directly affects a person
j   '             whom the person alleged to be bound to take care would know would be directly
    1             affected by his careless act.'
g   Lb It must be remembered, however, that Lord Atkin was using these words :n the context
n  :     of loss caused by phvsical damage where the existence ot the nexus between the careless
  '      defendant and the injured plaintiff can rarely give rise to any iimcuhy. To adopt the
s :      words of Bingham LJ in the instant case {[i 9S9] 1 All ER 7?S at soS. j p S ? ] QB 653 at
r ,      6S6j :

    ic              'It is enough that the plaintiff chances to be out of the whole world: the person
     ;            with whom the defendant collided or who purchased the offending ginger beer.'
s ;          The extension of the concept of negligence since the decision of this House in Medley
1 i Byrne cr Co Ltd v Heller or Partners Ltd [1963] 2 All ER 57;. [1964] AC 465 to cover cases
f       of pure economic loss not resulting from ph ysical damage has given rise to a considerable
,       and as yet unsolved difficulty of definition. The opportunities for the infliction of
> 1d pecuniary loss from the imperfect performance of everyday tasks on the proper
:       performance of which people rely for regulating their affairs are illimitable and the
•• | effects are far reaching. A defective bottle of ginger beer may injure a single consumer
' j but the damage stops there. A single statement may be repeated endlessly with or
    j without the permission of its author and may be relied on in a different way by many
    I different people. Thus the postulate of a simple duty to avoid any harm rhat is. with
         hindsight, reasonably capable of being foreseen becomes untenable without the
    J imposition of some intelligible limits to keep the Isw of negligence within the bounds of
    j common sense and practicality. Those limits have been found by the requirement of
    j what has been calleda ‘relationship of proximity’between plaintiff and defendant and by
         the imposition of a further requirement that the attachment of liability for harm which
   j j has occurred be ‘just and reasonable’. But, although the cases in which the courts have
         imposed or withheld liabilirv are capable of an approximate categorisation, one looks in
         vain for some common denominator by which the existence of the essential relationship
         can be tested. Indeed, it is difficult to resist a conclusion that what have been treated as
         three separate requirements are, at least in most cases, in fact merely facets of the same
         thing, for in some cases the degree of foreseeability is such that it is from that alone that
      _ the requisite proximity can be deduced, whilst in others the absence of that essential
         relationship can most rationally be attributed simply to the court's view that it would
         not be fair and reasonable to hold the defendant responsible. ‘Proximity’ is, no doubt, a
         convenient expression so long as it is realised that it is no more than a label which
         embraces not a definable concept but merely a description of circumstances from which,
         pragmatically, the courts conclude that a duty of care exists,
  ft /j      There are, of course, cases where, in any ordinary meaning of the words, a relationship
         of proximity 'in the literal sense o f ‘closeness’) exists but where rhe law. whilst recognising
         the fact of the relationship, nevertheless denies a remedy to the injured party on the
         ground of public policy. Rondel v Worley [196/] 3 All ER 993. [1969] 1 AC 191 was such
         a case, as was Mill v Chief Constable o f West Yorkshire [10SS] 2 All ER 238. [1989] AC 53, so
          far as concerns the alternative grout'd of that decision. But such cases do nothing to assist
  j j in the identification of those features from which the law will deduce the essential
         relationship on which liability depends and, for mv pan, 1 think that it has to be
         recognised that to search for any single formula which will serve as a general test of
          liability is to pursue a will-o’-the wisp. The fact is that once one discards, as it is now clear
          that one must, the concept of foreseeability of harm as the single exclusive test, even a
          prima facie test, of the existence of the duty of care, the attempt to state some general

principle which will determine liability in an infinite variety of circumstances serves not
to c.aruy the law but merely to bedevil its development in a wav which corresponds wnh
practicality and common sense. In Sutherland Shire Council v Heyrr.jr. 10S5; 6c ALR : at
43-44 Brennan J, in the course 0; a penetrating analysis, observed:
         Ot course, if loreseeariiiry ot injury to another were the exhaustive criterion of a
     prima tacie duty to act to prevent the occurrence of that injury, it would be essentia!
     to introduce some kins ot restrictive qualification— perhaps a qualification of the
     kind state- in the second stage of the general proposition in Anns. I am unable to
     accept that approach. It is preterable. in my view, that the law should dev elop novel
     categories of negligence incrementally and by analogy with established categories,
     rathej than by a massive extension of a prima facie duty of care restrained only by
     indefinable"considerations which ought to negative, or'to reduce or limit the scope
     of the duty or the class ot person to whom it is owed”.’
The same approach is. I think, reflected in that passage in the speech of Lord Devlin in
the Hedley Byrne case > 6 3 ] ; All ER 575 at 607-608. [1964] AC 465 at 524-525 in
w hich he considered the impact ot Donoghue v Stevenson on the facts of that case and in
which he analysed and described the method bv which the law develops:
           ‘In his celebrated speech in that case L o r d A t k i n did two things. He stated what
      he described as a general conception        032] AC 562 at 5S0, [193:] All ER Rep 1 at
      i i ; and from that conception he formulated a specific proposition of law {'19321
     AC 562 at 5 PPm.J932 ] A l l ER Rep 1 at 20,. In between he gave a wamine
     AC 562.at 584, [1931] All ER Rep 1 at 13) “against the danger of stating propositions
     of law in wider terms than is necessary,Jest essential factors be omitted in a wider
     survey and the inherent adaptability of English law be undulv restricted,” What
     L o r d A t k i n callec a general conception of relations giving rise to a duty of care” is
     now often referred to as me principle ot proximity. You must take reasonable care
     to avoiu acts or omissions w hich you can reasonably foresee w ould be likelv to injure
     your neighbour. In the eyes of the law your neighbour is a person who is*so closelv
     and uirectly affected by your act that you ought reasonably to have him in
     contemplation as being so anected when you are directing your mind to the acts or
     omissions which are called ;n question , . , Now it is not in my opinion a sensible
    application of w'nat L o r d A t k i n was saying for a judge to be invited on the facts of
    anv particular case to say whether or not there was “proximity” between the plaintiff
    and the defendant. That w-ould be a misuse of a general conception and it is not rhe
    way in which English law- develops. What L o r d A t k i n did w-as to use his general
    conception to open up a category of cases giving rise to a special dutv. It was already
    clear that the law recognised the existence of such a dutv in the cat’egorv of articles
    that were dangerous in themselves. What Donoghue v. Stevenson did mav be described
    either as the widening of ar. old category- or as the creation of a new and similar one.
    The general conception can be used to produce other categories in the same w-av.
    An existing category- grow s as instances of its application multiply, until the time
    comes when the cell divides . . . In my opinion the appellants in their argument
    tried to press Doncgkue v. Stevenson too hard. They asked w-hether the principle of
   proximity should not apply as well to words as to deeds, I think that it should, but
   as it is only a general conception it does not get them very far. Then they take the
   specific proposition laid down by Donoghue v. Stevenson and" trv to apply it lireraih to
   a certificate ora bankers reference. That will not do, fora general conception cannot
   be applied to pieces of paper in the same way as to articles of commerce, or to writers /
   in the same way as to manufacturers. An inquiry into the possibilities of intermediate
   examination of a certificate w ill not be fruitful. The real value of Donoghue v.
   Stevenson to the argument in this case is that it show-s how- the law can be developed
   tosoive particular problems. Is the relationship between the parties in this case such

 cases it is not easy to divorce foreseeability simplicirer and the proximity which riow< j
 from the virtual inevitability of damage if the advice is toilowed. Again, economi; ios: ;
 may be inflicted on a third parry as a result of the act of the recipient ot the advice or

 Government v Sharp [197c] 1 All ER 1009. [1970] 1 QB :i 3 . both cases w hich give rss tc
 certain difficulties of analysis ;. For present purposes, however, it is necessary to consider
 only those cases of economic damage suffered directly by a recipient of the statement or
 advice as a result of his personally having acred in reliance on it.
    In his dissenting judgment in Candler v Crane Chris:mas i r Co [1951] 1 All ER j i c a;
 43 3 - 43 5 . [ i 9 5 ij 1 KB"i64 at 179-1 S i Denning LI suggested three conditions for rhe
 creation of a duty of care in tort in such cases. First, the advice must be given by one
 whose profession ir is to give advice on which others rely in the ordinary course o:
 business, such as accountants, surveyors, valuers and rhe like. Second, it must be k.nowr.
 to the adviser that rhe advice would be communicated to the plaintiff ir. order to induce
 him to adopt a particular course of action. Third, rhe advice musr be relied on ‘or rhe
 purpose of the particular transaction for which it w as known to the adviser that rhe
 advice was required. It is plain, however, from other passages in his judgment, rhat
 Denning LJ did not consider these conditions as necessarily exhaustive criteria 01 rhe
 existence of a duty and the speeches in this House in the Hedley Byrne case r : 9 6 3 ]: A';
 ER 575. [19^4] AC 465, where his judgment was approved, indicate a number or
 directions in which such criteria are to be extended. To begin with. Lord Reid wouic not
 have confined liability to statements made or advice given in the exercise of a profession
 involving the giving of such advice but would have extended it to—
         ‘all those relationships where it is plain that the parry seeking information or
      advice was trusting the other to exercise such a degree of care as rhe circumstances!
      required, where it was reasonable for him to do that, and where the other gave rhe
      information or advice when he knew or ought to have known that the inquirer was
      relying on him.’
(See [1963] 2 All ER 575 at 5S3, [1964] AC 465 at 4S6!;
   Lord Morris, with whom Lord Hodson agreed, w hilst initially referring to persons
‘possessed of a special skill’ nevertheless went on to state the conditions in which a duty
of care might arise in very much wider terms ([1963: 2 All ER 575 aI 5 ? 4 . [ 196^1 AC
465 at 502-503):
        ‘Furthermore, if in a sphere in which a person is so placed that others could
      reasonably relv on his judgment or his skill or on his ability to make careful inquiry,
      a person takes it on himself to give information or advice to, or allows his
      information or advice to be passed on to, another person who, as he knows or should
      know, will place reliance on it, then a duty of care will arise.’
 None the less, the subsequent decision of the Privy Council in Mutual Life ana Ci:i~ens'
 Assurance Co Ltd v Evart [1971] 1 All ER 150, [1971] AC 79 3 . from which Lord Reic and
 Lord Morris dissented, would have confined the duty of care to where the advice relied
 on was given in the course of a business or profession involving the giving of advice of
 the kind in question. For present purposes, it is unnecessary to attempt a resolution of
 the difference of opinion arising from the Mutual Life case, since there is no question here
 but that the certifying of the accounts was something done in the course of the ordinary
 business of the auditors.                                                                      1
    Leaving this on one side, how ever, it is not easy to cull from the speeches in the Hedley
 Byrne case any clear attempt to define or classify the circumstances which give rise to the
 relationship of proximitv on which the action depends and, indeed, Lord Hodson
 expressly stated (and I respectfullv agree; that he did not think it possible to catalogue the
 special features which must be found to exist before the duty of care will arise in the

 t 1 intoeasilv definable categories 'such as Ross vCauniers [af.rm:[:o-o'i 3 All ER 5Sc.[ioSc]

 ]       as a separate cateeorv displaying common features ‘rom which it is possible to find at
 : : least guidelines bv w:hich"a test tor the existence of the relationship which is essential to
          ground liability can be deduced.
          ” The damage’which may be occasioned by the spoken or written word is not inherent.
          It lies alwavs in the reliance bv somebody on the accuracy ot that which the word
     : communicates and the loss or damage consequential on that person having adopted a
     ; course of action on the faith of it. In general, it may be said that when any serious
     i statement, whether it takes the form of a statement of tact or of advice, is published or
     j communicated, it is foreseeable that the person who reads or receives it is likely to accept
    I f it as accurate and to act accordingly. It is equally foreseeable that it it is inaccurate ;n a
     |    material particular the recipient who acts ob it may sutler a detriment which, if the
     j statement had been accurate, he would not have undergone. But it is now clear that mere
          foreseeability is not of itself sufficient to ground liability unless by reason of the
          circumstances it itself constitutes also the element of proximity as in the case ot direct
          phvsical damage; or unless it is accompanied by other circumstances from which that
       g element mav be deduced. One must, however, be careful about seeking to find any
          general principle which will serve as a touchstone for all cases, for even within the
          limited categorv of w hat, for the sake of convenience. I may refer to as ‘the negligent^
          statement cases’’, circumstances may differ infinitely and. in a swiftly developing field ot
          law. there can be no necessary assumption that those features which have served in one
          case to create the relationship between the plaintiff and the defendant on which liability
    p h depends will necessarilv be determinative of liability in the different circumstances of
          another case. There are’, for instance, at least four and possibly more situations in which
           damage or loss mav arise from reliance on the spoken or written word and it must not be
          assumed that because thev displav common features of reliance and foreseeability they
          are necessarilv in all respects ar.alagous. To begin with, reliance on a careless statement
    , _ may give rise to direct phvsical iniurv w hich may be caused either to the person who acts
   PJ on the faith of the statement or to a third person. One has only to consider, for instance,
    j      the chemist’s assistant who mislabels a dangerous medicine, a medical man who gives

    same effect see [ipc-j 2 All ER 5*5 at 611. [1964] AC 465 at 53c'. The nearest that one
   gets to the establishment of a criterion tor the creation ot a suty in the case of a negligent
    statement is the emphasis to be found in all the speeches on 'the voluntary assumption of
    responsibility’bv the defendant. This is a convenient phrase but it is clear that it was not
    intended to be a test for the existence ot the duty for. on analysis, it means no more than
    that the act of the defendant in making the statement_or tendering the advice was
    voluntary and that the law attributes to it an assumption ot responsibility if the statement
    or advice is inaccurate and is acted on. It tells us nothing aoout the circumstances trom
    which such attribution arises.
        The point that is, as it seems to me, significant in the present context, is the unanimous
    approval in this House of the judgment of Denning LJ in Candler s case L> 9 5 1] 1 All ER
    416 at 434. [1951 j 2 KB 164 at 1S1, in which he expressed the test of proximity in these
    words: 'Did the accountants know that the accounts were required for submission to the
    plaintiff and use bv him?' In so far as this might be said to imply that the plaintiff must
    be specifically identified as the ultimate recipient and that the precise purpose for v. hich
     the accounts were required must be known to the defendant before the necessary
     relationship can be created, Denning LJ's formulation was expanded in the Hediey Bvrne
     case, where it is clear that, but for an etlective disclaimer, liability would have attached.
 ? The respondents there were not aware of the actual identity of the advertising firm for
  . which the credit reference was required nor ot its precise purpose, save that it was
     required in anticipation of the placing of advertising contracts. Furthermore, it is clear
     that ‘knowledge' on the part ot the respondents embraced not omy actual know leage but
     such knowledge as would be attributed to a reasonable person placed as the respondents
     were placed. What can be deduced from the Hediey B\rne case, therefore, is that the
^ necessarv relationship between the maker of a statement or giver ot advice ..the au\iser;
     and the recipient who acts in reliance on it >he advisee; may typically be heid to exist
  ' w here' 1; the advice is required for a purpose, whether particularly specified or generally
     described, which is made known, either actually or inferentiallv, to the adviser at the
      time when the advice is given, (2) the adviser knows, either actually or inferential!)’, that
t his advice will be communicated to the advisee, either specifically or as a member of an
      ascertainable class, in order that it should be used by the advisee tor that purpose, >.3 > *s
      known, either actually or inferentially, that the advice so communicated is likely to be
      acted on bv the advisee for that purpose without independent inquiry and (4) it is so
. acted on by the advisee to his detriment. That is not, of course, to suggest that these
■ conditions are either conclusive or exclusive, but merely that the actual decision in the
L case does not warrant any broader propositions.
F       Those propositions are, 1 think, in accord with the two United States authorities u hich
j were referred to in the course of the speeches in the Hedley Byrne decision. In Glan^er v
{ Shepard 1922} 233 NY 236, where a public weigher negligently certified an overweight
j so that the purchaser of the goods paid too much for them, the identity of the recipient
      of the certificate was known, the purpose of the certificate was known, and the certificate
   1 was issued for the verv purpose ol enabling the price ot the goods to be ascertained and
      with the knowledge that it would be acted on by the recipient tor that purpose. In
      Vltramares Ccrp v Touche .193 J 255 NY’ 1~3. on the other hand, a case much nearer to
      the present, the action failed. There auditors, although aware generally that the certified
I accounts of the company would be shown to others by the company as the basis of
 j financial dealings generally ‘according to the needs of the occasion, were unaware of the
j company’s specific purpose of obtaining financial help from the plaintiff.

 indeed an expressed intension that it should not be acted on bv anvone else, cannot
prevail against actual or presumed knowledge that it is in fact likely to be relied on in a
particular transaction without independent verification. Both appeals were concerned
 with surveyors’ certificates issued to mortgagees in connection with the proposed
purchases for which the mortgagees were contemplating making advances. In each case
there was an express disclaimer of responsibility, but in each case it was known to the
surveyor that the substance of the repon fin the sense of what was imponant to a
purchaser,, that is to say whether or not any repairs to the propenv were considered
essential, would be made known by the mongagee to the purchaser, the plaintiff in the
action, and would be likely to be acted on by him in entering into a contract to purchase
the property. In so far as the case was concerned with the effects of the disclaimer, it does
not require consideration in the present context, but there are important passages in the
speeches in this House bearing on the questions which arise on this appeal'and indicative
of the features which, in that case, led their Lordships to conclude that the necessarv
relationship of proximity existed between the survevors and the purchasers of the
respective properties. Lord Tempieman deduced the relationship from a combination of
factors. He said ([1989] 2 All ER 514 at 522-523. [19S9] 2 WLR -90 at 799-830 <:
        ‘I agree that, by obtaining and disclosing a valuation, a mortgagee does not assume
     responsibility to the purchaser for that valuation. But in my opinion the valuer
     assumes responsibility to both mortgagee and purchaser by agreeing to carrv out a
     valuation for mongage purposes knowing that the valuation fee has been paid bv
     the purchaser and knowing :hat the valuation will probably be relied on bv the
     purchaser in order to decide whether or not to enter into a contract to purchase the
     house . . . In general, I am of the opinion that in the absence of a disclaimer of
     liability rhe valuer who values a house for the purpose of a moneage, knowine that
     the mortgagee will rely and the mortgagor will probably rely on the valuation,
     knowing that the purchaser mongagor has in effect paid for the valuation, is under
     a duty to exercise reasonable skill and care and rhat durv is owed ro both parties to
     the mongage for which the valuation is made.’
   Lord Griffiths rejected the ‘voluntary assumption of responsibility’as a helpful formula
for testing the existence of a dutv of care, observing that the phrase—
        can only have any real meaning if it is understood as referring to the circumstances
     in which the law will deem the maker of the statement to have assumed
     responsibility to the person who acts on the advice.’
(See[i9S9j 2 All ER 514 at 534.£ 19S9] 2 WLR 790 at S13.)
  He continued {[1989] 2 All ER 514 at 534, 536, [19S9] 2 WLR 790 at Si 3-816}:
        ‘The essential distinction between the present case and the situarion being
    considered in the Hedley Byrne case and in the two earlier cases is that in those cases
    the advice was being given with the intention of persuading the recipient to act on
    it. In the present case the purpose of providing the report is to advise the mongagee
    but it is given in circumstances in which it is highly probable that the purchaser
    will in fact act on its contents, although that was not the primary purpose of the
    report. I have had considerable doubts whether it is wise to increase the scope of the
    duty for negligent advice beyond the person directly intended bv the giver of the
    advice to act on it to those whom he knows may do so . . . I therefore return to the
    question in what circumstances should the law deem those who give advice to have
    assumed responsibility to the person who acts on the advice or, in other words, in
    whar circumstances should a duty of care be owed by the adviser to those who aa
    on his advice? I would answer: only if it is foreseeable that if the advice is negligent
    the recipient is likely to suffer damage, that there is a sufficiently proximate
    relationship between the panies and that it is just and reasonable to" impose the

         'The reason for some divergence between the law of negligence in word and that
      of negligence in act is dear. "Negligence in word creates problems different from
      those of neglieence in act. Words are more volatile than deeds. They travel fast and
      far afield. Thev are used without being expended and take enect in combination
      with innumerable facts and other words. Vet they are dangerous and can cause vast
      financial damage. How far they are relied on unchecked . . . must in many cases be
      a matter of doubt and difficulty. If the mere hearing or reading of words were held
      to create proximitv, there might be no limit to the persons to whom the speaker or
      writer could be liable.'

 As 1 have aireadv mentioned, it is almost always foreseeable that someone, somewhere
 and in some circumstances, mav choose to alter his position on the taith ot the accuracy
 of a statement or report which comes to his attention and it is always foreseeable that a
 report, even a confidential report, may come to be communicated to persons other than
 the original or intended recipient. To a p p l y as a test of liability only the foreseeability of
 possible damage without some further control would be to create a liability wholly
 indefinite in area, duration and amount and would open up a limitless vista of uninsurable
 risk for the professional man.
      On the basis of the pleaded case, as amended, it has to be assumed that the auditors, as
 experienced accountants, were aware or should have been aware that Fidelity’s results

  potential bidder might well relv on the published accounts in determining whether to
  acquire shares in the market and to make a bid. It is not. however, suggested that the
  auditors, in certifying the accounts, or Parliament, in providing for such certification,
  did so for the purpose of assisting those who might be minded to profit from dealings in

  preparation, certification and publication ot the accounts of a public company to provide
  information for the guidance of predators in the market, nevertheless^ argue that the
  auditors' knowledge that predators might well rely on the accounts for this purpose
  sufficient! v establishes between them and potential bidders that relationship ot proximity
  which founds liabilitv. On the face of it. this submission appears to equate proximity
  with mere f o re s e e a b ilitv and to re!v on the very misinterpretation of the ettect of the
  decision of this House in Anus’s case [1977] 2 All ER 492. [ i 9 “ S] AC 72S which was

  [198S] AC 175. Your Lordships have been referred, however, to three authorities, one
r from New Zealand and two from the United Kingdom, which do undoubtedly support
   Caparo's contention.
      In Scot: Group Ltd v McFarlane[1978] 1 NZLR 553 the defendants were the auditors of
  a companv which had been successfully taken over in reliance on certified consolidated
  accounts in which, as a result of double-counting, the assets were overstated. It was
  admitted that the failure of the defendants to discover the discrepancy was due to
I negligence. In the Supreme Court of New Zealand Quilliam J dismissed the plaintiffs
   claim on the ground that the defendants, though careless, owed them no duty of care ;see
   [>975] 1 NZLR 582). An appeal to the Court of Appeal failed but the court was divided
   as to the reasons. Richmond P held that the appeal failed for the same reason as that
   stated bv the trial judge. WoodhouseJ would have allowed the appeal. Cooke J, on the
   other hand, whilst concurring with WoodhouseJ that the defendants did in fact owe a
   dutv of care to the plaintiffs, held that the appeal failed because the plaintiffs had failed
   to show anv recoverable loss.
      The more restrictive view was expressed by Richmond P in the following terms
   '.[>978] 1 NZLR 553 at 566-567):

       that one parry can fairly be held 10 have assumed a responsibility to the other as
       regards the reliability of the advice or information. I do not think that such a
       relationship should be found ro exist unless, at least, the maker of the statement
      was. or ought ro have been, aware that his advice or information would in fact be
      made available to and be relied on by a particular person or class of persons for the
      purposes of a particular transaction or type of transaction. ! would especially
      emphasise that to my mind it does not seem reasonable to attribute an assumption
      ot responsibility unless the maker of the statement ought in all the circumstances,
      both in preparing himself lor what he said and in saving it, to have directed his
      mind, and to have been able to direct his mind, to some particular and specific
      purpose tor which he was aware that his advice or information w-ould be retied on.
      In many situations that purpose will be obvious. But the annual accounts of a
      company can be relied on in all sorts of ways and for many purposes. It would be
      going too lar to treat accountants as assuming a responsibility towards ail persons
      dealing with the company or its members, in reliance to some greater or lesser
      degree or. the accuracy of the accounts, merely because it was reasonably foreseeable,
      in a general way, that a transaction of the kind in which the plaintiff"happened to
      become involved might indeed take place. The relationship between the parties
     would. I think, be too general and not sufficiently “special" to come within the
     principles underlying the decision in Hedley Byrne. As 1 have said, I believe it to be
     essential to the existence of a “special relationship” that the maker of the siatement
     was or should have been aware that his advice was required for use in a specific tvpe
     of contemplated transaction. This requirement has not alwavs required emphasis in
     the course of judicial discussion as to the nature of a special relationship. Probably
     this is because in most cases the purpose for which the information was reauired
     was, on the facts, quite obvious. But certainly this particular point was made \ e n ­
     dear indeed in Lord Denning’s judgment in Candler v Crane, Christmas c- Cc. 1
     would think that it must almost inevitably follow, once the maker of the statement
     is aware of a specific purpose for which his information will be used, that he will
     also have in direct contemplation a specific person or class of persons, even thoueh
     unidentified by name.’
   The New Zealand Companies Act 1955 contained provisfcns relating to the auditor's
report which is similar in substance to those contained in the United Kingdom legislation
but with this variation, that the ‘true and fair view’ which group accounts are certified to
give are qualified by the words ‘so far as concerns members of the companv’. In relation
to these provisions, Richmond P observed at 56S;;
        The provisions of the Act to which I have just referred are aimed essentially at
     the protection of the members of the company and of course the auditors, whose
     contract of employment is with the company itself, are under a contractual dutv of
     care to the company. These provisions do not encourage me to take the view that
     there is any reason why the auditors of a public company should thereby come
    under a common law duty of care to third persons dealing with the companv or its
    members on the faith of their audit certificate, such liability being in some way
    based on a much wider principle than would apply, for example, in the case of
    auditors certifying the accounts of a private company. Like Quilliam J, 1 can also see
    no reason to differentiate between auditors as such and a firm of chartered
    accountants employed to prepare the accounts of the company. The only point
    which has given me some concern, so far as the statutory provisions are concerned,
    is the requirement of s 133(1) whereby a copy of the balance sheet and auditor’s
    report is required to be annexed to the annual return and thus becomes available to
    the public under s 9 ( 1) of the Act. But on reflection, this only means that the auditor
    of the accounts of a public company knows that the accounts and his report will
    become available to the public generally and, consequently, may be relied on bv one

      nr
      ot                     ‘In this regard it will be noticed that although the first part of the inauirv outlined
      in                  by Lord Wilbertorce is to ask whether "there is a sufficient relationshipofproximitv”
      Iv
                          in order to decide whether there is a prima facie dutv of care, he would test the
      .!0j                sufficiency of proximity simply by the reasonable contemplation of likelv harm.
       -v e               And, with respect, I do not think there is anv need for or anv sound reason in favour
        *11               ot a more restrictive approach. The issue has been made increasinglv complex bv
       u                  the successive and varying formulas that have been used in an effort to coniine the
       11                 general area of responsibility, in particular for negligent words or in respect of
       h                  purely economic losses. At this initial stage at least it should be possible to r e m o v e
                          some degree of uncertainty—in my opinion it is done bv the comprehensible and
             f            straightforward test of foreseeability.' #.
       ’s
       n            WoodhouseJ again emphasised foreseeability as the relevant test for the creation of
       D         the relationship of proximity where he said (at 575;-:
'■)
                             ‘Although an audit is undertaken on behalf of the members of a public companv
                          it must be within the reasonable contemplation of any auditor that confidence in it's
       t                  ability to handle its commercial arrangements would depend upon the authenticity
                          of its accounts—a confidence that would disappear if reliance could not be put upon
       f                  the audit report. So I think that when auditors deliberatelv undertake to provide
                          their formal report upon the accounts of a public companv thev must be taken to
                          have accepted not merely a direct responsibility to the shareholders but a further
                          duty to those persons whom they can reasonably foresee will need to use and relv
                          upon them when dealing with the company or its members in significant matters
                          affecting the company assets and business. An example, no doubt, would be the
                          banker asked to make substantial advances on the securitv of the companv
                          undertaking. On the other hand, there would seem to be formidable difficulties for
                          a plaintiff who attempted to prove that an auditor should have foreseen the
                          plaintiff’s likely reliance upon some newspaper or a stock exchange reference to a
                          company s accounts. However, it is sufficient for present purposes to restrict
                          consideration to a takeover offer related, as so frequently is the position, to the value
                          of shareholders’ funds. In such a situation the need to rely upon audited accounts is,
                          I think, quite obvious. As a matter of commercial reality I think the auditor and
                          offeror are in a relationship of close proximity.’

      Cooke I was to the same effect. He adopted at 5 S 3 a s the first step of Lord
    Wilberforce's two-stage approach, the formuianon which equates the relationship ot 3
    proximitv with foreseeabilitv, although at an earlier stage ot his judgment he seemed to
    be disposed to regard the essential relationship as arising no; simply from the foreseeability
    that a member ot the public might rely on the accounts as a basis ot some transaction
    but, for a reason which I coniess 3 do not tully uncerstand. trom the foreseeability that
    some member of the public might rely on the accounts tor the making ot a take-o\er
    bid. He said at 5S 1'..:                                                                       ^
                "The learned judge in the Supreme Court was disposed to regard the requirement
             of niing audited accounts, which are available tor public inspection, as not imposed
             by Parliament for the purpose of enabling people to deal confidently in reliance on
             the accuracv of the accounts. He thought it much more likeiy that^the purpose was
             to enable a proper supervision to be exercised over the activities of companies, and ^
             to enable those concerned to ensure r'nat tht companies were not trading illegally or
             dishonestlv. With respect, I am unable to agree with him on that point. The
             starutorv requirements regarding the filing ot financial information stem. I thinK.,
             from the view that those dealing with or investing in a limited liability company have
             a legitimate interest in being ailorded reasonaDle access to relevant information, anu
             that this interest has to be balanced against the wish for confidentiality naturally (
             entertained bv familv companies ana the like which do not appeal to the public for
             funds. . . I would agree, though, that the provisions are probably not aimed, or at
             least not primarilv, at protecting purchasers ot shares in the market. Cooke J s
             emphasis.)
     Thus the majority of the Court of Appeal favoured a more extensive view_of the
     circumstances from which the essential relationship between plaintiff and aefenuanr
     may be interred in a negligent statement case than had yet emerged from any decision
     in the United Kingdom.                                    _
        Now, of course, any decision of the Court of Appeal ot New Zealand is entitled to the
     very greatest respect, but it has to be observed that the majority view was based on an
     interpretation of Lord Wilberforce’s observations in Anws case which has since been
     severely qualified by subsequent decisions of this House.

     take-over, claimed damages againsr the company’s auditors who, it was claimed, had
     been negligent in certifying the accounts. Woolf J dismissed the claim on the ground
     that the plaintiffs failed to show the causative connection between reliance on the
     erroneous accounts and the take-over and his decision was subsequently affirmed by the
     Court of Appeal ;see [1065] 1 All ER 5S3)- In the course of his judgment, however.
      Woolf J made the following observations with regard to the auditors liability ([198 Jj 3
     All ER 1S9 at 106-197;:
                  ‘Without laving down anv principle which is intended to be of general application.
                on the basis of the authorities which I have cited, the appropriate test for establisnir.g
                whether a duty of care exists appears in this case to be whether the defendants kne^
                or reasonably should have foreseen at the time the accounts were audited that a
                person might relv on those accounts for the purpose of deciding w hether or not to
                take over the companv and therefore could sutler loss if the accounts w ere inaccurate.
                Such an approach does place a limitation on those entitled to contend that there has
                been a breach of dutv owed to them. First of all, they must have relied on the
                accounts and, second, thev must have done so in circumstances where the auditors
                either knew that they would or ought to have known that they might. If the

      This case, thereiore, falls into the same category as the other rwo cases. All three were
  based on the view of Lord Wilberforce's exposition in the Anns case which would result
  in foreseeability and proximity being treated as synonymous, a view which this House
  (and, indeed. Lord W ilbertorce himself in McLcughlin v O ’Brien [jo S il - All ER 2cS.
  t 3 3j i .-.C 410.! has now decisively rejected. That, of course, does not conclude the
  question, tor it would still be open to your Lordships to find in the circumstances of this
  case that a special relationship existed between rhe auditor conductingan annual audit in
  pursuance ot his statutory duty and every potential investor in the market or, indeed,
  any other person who might do business with the company without relying solelv on
  the foreseeability of potential damage to such person. Just as, for instance."in Smith v Eric
  S Bush j 9 s o ] i All ER 514, [;cSp] 2 WLR -oc one of the factors giving rise to the
  relationship in that case was the circumstance rr.ar the plaintiff was rhe person who paid
  for the report on which the reliance was placed, so here it might be said that a special
  relarionsnip was to be found in the narure and extent of the starutorv duties which the
  auditor is called on to fulfil.
     For my pan. however, 1 can see nothing in the statutory duties of a companv's auditor
  to suggest that they were intended by Parliament to protect rhe interests of investors in
  the market and 1 see no reason in policy or in principle why it should be either desirable
  or appropriate that the ambit of rhe special relationship required to give rise to liabilirv
  in cases such as the present should be extended beyond those limits which are deducibl'e
  from the Hedley Byrne case and Smith v Erie S Bush, Those limits appear to me to be
  correctly and admirably stated in rhe passages from the judgment of Richmond P in the
 Scot: Group case to which 1 have already referred. In particular. 1 see no reason whv anv
 special relationship should be held to arise simply from the circumstance that the affairs
 of the company are such as to render it susceptible ro the attention of predators in the
 market who may be interested in acquiring all or the majority of the shares rather than
 merely a parcel of shares by wav of addition roa portfolio. It follows that 1would dismiss
 Caparo's cross-appeal.
     l^rurn, therefore, to the question raised by rhe auditors’ appeal. The Court of Appeal,
 whilst rejecting unanimously Caparo’s contention that the auditors owed them a dutv of
 care simply as potential investors in the market, nevertheless by a majority allowed rheir
 claim that a similar duty was owed to them in rheir capacity as shareholders from the
 date when they first became registered in respect of shares which thev had purchased.
 Now it cannot be nor is it claimed that this event created for the auditors anv new or
greater risk of harm in relation to a certification which had already taken place'; nor can
 it be Claimed that it brought about some change in the quality or extent of Caparo's
 reliance on the 'ex hvpothesi; inaccurate information which they had previouslv received
and digested. The only difference in their position before registration and their position
afterwards was that, as registered shareholders, they now had rhe statutory right to
receive the accounts on which they had alrtadv relied in acquiring their original shares
and to receive notice ot and attend the annual general meeting of Fidelity at which the
accounts were 10 be read and, if thought fit. appro\ed and passed. This change of position
seems, on the fare of it, less than momentous and in fact they did not trouble to appoint
a representative to attend the meeting on their behalf. If a distinction is to be found at
all, therefore, it can only be that the nature and purpose of the statutory provisions
governing rhe appointment and duties of auditors and the certification and”publication
to shareholders and others of the accounts have rhe effect of creating, between the
auditors and individual shareholders, as potential investors in that capacity, that special
relationship of proximity which is required to give rise to the duty "of care and which
does not exist between the auditors and the investing public generaiiv.
    Now if it be right, as, for my part, 1 believe that it is and as the Court of Appeal has
held, that no relationship of proximity and thus no duty of care exists between auditors
and the investing public generally in relation to the statutory audit ;l sav nothing, of
course, about a case where accounts are audited specifically for the purpose of submission

      the same information bv a person who happens to be the registered holder of a share in
      the companv whose accounts are in question produces entirely capricious results.
      O'Connor L], in his dissenting ju d gm ent [ ’. 9 S 9 ] 1 All ER “ 9 8 at 8 3 s . [ 1 9 8 9 ^ QB 6 5 3 at
      7 1 5 . instanced the case o f a shareholder who, having purchased further shares at an
      0\ ervalue on the basis o f the accounts, shows the accounts to a friend who has no existing
      shareholding but proceeds to make a similar purchase. Each receives exactly the same
      information; each relies on it in exactly the same way and tor the same purpose; and the
      loss sustained in both cases is identical" and is equally foreseeable. Vet liability is said to
      exist in the one case but not in the other. One has indeed only to consider the
      circumstances o f the instant case which must ultimately result in drawing a distinction
      between the loss sustained as a result of the initial purchase o f shares (irrecoverable'; and
      that sustained as a result o f purchases made after the first registration (recoverable;
      "although aii purchases were made in reliance on exactly the same information.
          So unreasonable a distinction must call in question the analysis which leads to it. The
      maioritv in the Court o f Appeal deduced the relationship from what Bingham LJ
      described as 'the degree o f closeness between the parties’ .see [ 1o 5 o] > All ER 79$ at Sc-,
      [ 1 0 8 0 ] QB 6 5 3 at 6 8 4 ; . It was pointed out that although the auditors are appointed and
      paid bv the companv that is the result of the vote of the shareholders in general meeting
      and their rem uneration is paid out of funds which might otherwise be a\ailablc for
      distribution to shareholders bv wav of dividend. Their duty is to report to the shareholders
      w hether the accounts give a true and tair view o f the company s financial position and
      their report is sent to each shareholder as an identifiable individual. Thus, it was said, the
      relationship, although not a contractual one, was very ciose to being contractual and was
    .'moreover one in which a lack ot care would be likely directly to affect the very person
       whose interest the auditor is engaged to protect, should that person choose to rely on the
       accounts for the purpose of making or disposing of an investment. My Lords, of course I
       see the force of this, but, as I have already suggested, 'proxim ity’ sn cases such as this is an
       expression used not necessarilv as indicating literally ‘closeness in a physical or
     - metaphorical sense but merelv as a convenient label to describe circumstances frorn
    ■ which the law will attribute a duty ot care. It has to be borne in m ind that the duty ot
       care is inseparable from the damage which the plaintiff claims to have suffered from its
       breach. It is not a dutv to take care in the abstract but a d u ty to avoid causing to the
    • particular plaintiff damage of the particular kind which he has in fact sustained. I cannot
    ! improve on the analvsis which is to be found in the ju d g m e n t o f Brennan J in the High
     Court of Australia in Sutherland Shire Council v Heyman (10S5) 60 ALR 1, to which I have
     alreadv referred. After citing the speech of Viscount Simonds in Overseas Tankship \L K)
     Ltd v .Mortj Dock and Engineering Co Ltd, The Wagon Mound [1961] 1 All ER 404 at 414-
     415. [1961] AC 3S8 at 425, where he observed that it was vain to isolate the liability from
     its context and to sav that B is or is not liable and then to ask for what damage he is liable.
     BrennanJ continued (at 4S):

1             'The corollarv is that a postulated duty of care must be stated in reference to the
           kind of damage that a plaintiff has suffered and in reference to the plaintitt or a class
           of which the plaintiff is a m e m ber. I venture to repeat w h a t ! said in John Pfeiijer P:y
            Ltd v C a im a v ; 1981) 148 CLR 21S at 241-241): “His duty o f care is a thing written
            on the wind unless damage is caused by the breach o f that duty; there is no
            actionable negligence unless duty, breach and consequential damage coincide-----
'J         For the purposes o f determ ining liability in a given case, each element can be
            defined onlv in terms of the others.” It is impermissible to postulate a dutyjaf care
            to avoid one kind of damage— sav, personal injury— and, finding the delendant
I          guilty of failing to discharge that duty, to hold h im liable for the damage actually
•          suffered that is of another and independent kind— say. economic loss. Not only may

      owed to different persons or classes of persons. That is not to say that a plaintiff who
      suffers damage of some kind will succeed or fail in an action to recover damasej
      according to his classification of the damage he suffered. The question is ahvavs
      whether the defendant was under a duty to avoid or prevent that damage, but the
      actual nature of the damage suffered is relevant to the existence and extent of anv!
      duty to avoid or prevent it.'                                                          ' j
    In seeking to ascertain whether there should be imposed on the adviser a dutv to avoid |
the occurrence of the kind of damage which the advisee claims to have suffered it is no:. I
I think, sufficient to ask simpiy whether there existed a 'closeness' between them in the j
sense that the advisee had a legs’ entitlement to receive the information on the basis of)
which he has acted or in the sense that the information was intended to serve his interest!
or to protect him. One must. 1 think, go further and ask, in what capacity was his interest
to be served and from what was he intended to be protected? A companv's annua!
accounts are capable of being utilised for a number of purposes and if one thinks about it
it is entirely foreseeable that they may be so emploved. But msr.v of such purposes have
absolutely no connection with the recipient's status or capacitv. whether as a shareholder,
voting or non-voting, or as a debenture-holder. Before it can be conciuded that the dutv
is imposed to protect the recipient against harm which he suffers bv reason of the'
particular use that he chooses to make of the information which he receives, one must, 1
think, first ascertain the purpose for which the information is required to be given.
Indeed, the paradigmatic Dencgkue vStnenscn case of a manufactured article requires, as
an essential ingredient of liability, that the article has been used by the consumer in the
manner in which it was intended to be used (see Grant v Australian Knitting Mills Ltd
[1936] AC S5 at 104, [1935] All ER Rep 200 at 217 and junior Bocks Ltd v Vfitdii Cc Ltd
[1082] 3 All ER 201 at 216. 2:S, ' 1 9 8 3 ] 1 AC 52c at 340, 55;:. I entirely follow that if
the conclusion is reached that the very purpose of providing the information is to serve
as the basis for making investment decisions or giving investment advice, it is not
difficult then to conclude also that the duty imposed on the adviser extends to protecting
the recipient against loss occasioned by an unfortunate investment decision which is
based on carelessly inaccurate information, fiingham LJ did. indeed, conclude that the
provision of guidance for the making of investment decisions was one of the purposes to
be discerned in the statutory provisions. He observed {[19S9]) All ER 79S at S05. [1969'
QB 653 at 681—682}!
            . I think these provisions also reflect a wider and more commercial intention.
      The growth and development of limited liability companies over a relatively verv
      short period have been phenomenal. Their proliferation and expansion have
      depended on their acceptance by the investing public as an advantageous and on
      the whole) reliable medium of investment. The statutory requirements that
      companies account to their members and that auditors express an independent
      opinion to shareholders on the truth and accuracy of company accounts are in mv
      view designed ;in part at least', to fortify confidence in the holding of shares as a
      medium of investment by enabling shareholders to make informed investment
      decisions. These are obvious reasons, both economic and social, why this end should
      be regarded as desirable.’
How far he regarded this as an essential feature of the relationship of proximity which
he held to exist between the auditors and Caparo as shareholders is not. however, entirely
clear, for he attributed the same intention to the legislature in relation to investors
generally. He said:
       ’The publication of accounts must limit, if it cannot eliminate, the scope for
    rumour-inspired speculation and thus promote an informed and orderlv market. It
    enables prospective investors, like shareholders, to make informed decisions. For
    such prospective investors the independent opinion of the auditor has the same
    significance as for existing shareholders.’

    >y|    already the holders of shares or other securities or persons having no previous proprietary
           interest in the companv. It is unnecessary to decide the point on this appeal, but I can see
           more force in the contention that one purpose of providing the statutory information
    id
         b mieht be to enable the recipient to exercise whatever rights he has in relation to his
           proprietary interest bv virtue of which he receives it, by way, for instance, of disposing
    le
           of that interest. I can. how ever, see no ground for supposing that the legislature was

    Jl
     SI
           information for the purpose of enabling them to acquire such securities from other
           holders who might be minded to sell.
    al !
               For mv pan."I think that the position as regards the auditor’s statutory duty was
     i t p co rre ctly "summarised by O'Connor LJ in his dissenting judgm ent when he said (TioSo^
     ■e ’
         i i All ER r?S at S30. [i?So] QE 6; j at 7 1 4 ;:
         {
    :v               T he statutorv dutv owed bv auditors to shareholders is, 1 think, a duty owed to
    le            them as a bodv] I appreciate that it is difficult to see how the overstatement of the
      I           accounts can cause damage to the shareholders as a body: it will be the underlying
    i.            reasons for the overstatement which cause damage, for example sraudulent
    is            abstraction of assets bv directors or servants, but such loss is recoverable by the
    le            companv. I am anxious to limit the present case to deciding whether the statutory
    ■d            dutv operates to protect the individual shareholder as a potential buyer ot lurther
    :d            shares. If I am wrong in thinking that under the [Companies Act 1985] no duty is
     if           owed to shareholders as individuals, then I think that the duty must be confined to
     ’e           transactions in which the shareholder can only participate because he is a shareholder.
     )t           The statute imposes a duty to shareholders as a class and the duty should nor extend
      g           to an individual save as a member ot the class in respect ot some class activity.
     is           Buying shares in a company is not such an activity.’
      e
               In mv judgment, accordingly, the purpose for which the auditors’ certificate is made
     o if
            and published is that of providing those entitled to receive the report with information
            to enable them to exercise in conjunction those powers which their respective proprietary
            interests confer on them and not for the purposes of individual speculation with a view
            to profit. The same considerations as limit the existence of a duty of care also, in my
           judgment, limit the scope of the duty and I agree with O ’Connor LJ that the duty of care
u
            is one owed to the shareholders as a body and not to individual shareholders.
               To widen the scope of the dutv to include loss caused to an individual by reliance on
            the accounts for a purpose for which they were not supplied and were not intended
            would be to extend it bevond the limits which are so far deducible from the decisions of
            this House. It is not, as I think, an extension which either logic requires or policy dictates
            and I, for my pan, am not prepared to follow the majority of the Court of Appeal in
            making it. In relation to the purchase of shares of other shareholders in a company,
            whether in the open market or as a result of an offer made to all or a majority of the
            existing shareholders, I can see no sensible distinction, so far as a duty of care is concerned,
            between a potential purchaser who is, vis-a-vis the company, a total outsider and one who
            is already the holder of one or more shares. I accordingly agree with what has already-
            fallen from mv noble and learned friend Lord Bridge, and I, too, would allow the appeal
            and dismiss the cross-appeal.

            may, in certain circumstances, render the maker thereof liable for economic loss

any particular case w ill depend on whether the maker ot" the statement owes a dutv of
care to the person who has suffered loss. In this connection I cannot do better than quote
the words of Lord Keith in Peabcdv Donation Fund v Sir Lindscx Parhnsor. cr C r Ltd' : 9 5 4 '
3 All ER 52? at 534. [; 9S5] AC 21c at 240-241:
           T he true question in each case is whether the particular defendant owed to the
      particular plaintiff a durv of care having the scope which is contended for. and
      whether he was in breach of that duty with consequent loss to the plaint is. A
      relationship of proximity ir. Lord Atkin's sense must exist before anv dutv of care
      can arise, but the scope of the duty must depend on all the circumstances of the case
      . . . So in determining whether or not a dutv of care of particular scope was
      incumbent or, a defendant it is material to take into consideration whether it is iust
      and reasonable that it should be so.'
   The relationship of proximity to which Lord Keith referred is not one which is created
solely by the toreseeability of harm resulting from carelessness in the statement, but is
one in which some further ingredient importing proximity is present. Thus in r.ill v
Chief Constable of Wes: Yorkshire j ° S S ] 2 All ER 23S at 241, [t oi pj AC 53 at 61 Lord
Keith said:
         ‘It has been said almost too frequently to require repetition that foreseeability of
      likely harm is not in itself a sufficient test of liability in negligence. Some further
      ingredient is invariably needed to establish the requisite proximity of relationship
      between the plaintiff and defendant, and all the circumstances of the case must be
      carefully considered and analysed in order to ascertain whether such an ingredient
      is present.'
    Once foreseeability of likely harm from a careless statement has been established, it
becomes necessary to examine the circumstances in and the purposes for which the
statement was made in order to determine whether there are also present the further
ingredients necessary to establish the requisite proximity of relationship between the
maker of the statement and the person who has acted on it. As Bingham LJ observed in
the present case, the concept of proximity is somewhat elusive, extending as it does
beyond mere physical proximity 'see [19S9] 1 All ER 79S at S02. [19S9] QB 653 at 6- S).
It might be described as the circumstances in which the law considers it proper that a
duty of care should be imposed on one person towards another. If in any given
circumstances a relationship of proximity is found to exist, consideration must still be
given to the scope of the duty which arises therefrom. In the case of phvsical proximitv.
few problems will arise, but where there exists a duty of care in relation to the making
of statements, written or oral, problems may arise if those statements are capable of being
used for more than one purpose. It is not disputed in the present case that economic loss
to the plaintiff as a shareholder was foreseeable by the auditors as a result of anv failure
on their part to exercise reasonable care in the conduct of the audit. What is disputed is
w-hether the auditors owed any duty to individual shareholders, and if so. what was the
scope of that duty.
    Before examining the circumstances in this case which may be relevant to the existence
of a relationship of proximity, it is helpful to look in a little more detail at the four cases
dealing with negligent statements to which I have already referred. In Cann v Willson
(18S8) 39 Ch D 39 valuers instructed by an intending mortgagor sent the valuation to
solicitors acting foran intending mortgagee know ing that it was hoped therebv to induce
the mortgagee to make a loan. ChittyJ held that in the circumstances the valuers owed a
duty of care to the mortgagee. In Candler v Crane Christmas cr Co [1951] 1 All ER 426,

          er errHover to the plaintiff who was a potential investor, and indeed their clerk discussed
         ris i those accounts with him. Denning LI in suggesting the circumstances in which a duty
         ' n to use care in a statement bv professional persons would exist apart from contract, posed
               three questions. First, what persons are under such duty: Second, to whom do those
         ‘Ie -irofessional people owe this duty! And third, to what transactions does the duty of care
               extend! In relation to the second question, he said ([195 0 1 All ER 426 at 434. [195 0 2
               KB 164 at 1So—1Si;:
         1e                       ‘] will take accountants, but the same reasoning applies to the others. They owe
         1(^                  the dutv, of course, to their employer or client, and also, I think, to any third person
                               to whom thev themselves show the accounts, or to whom they know their employer
         re                   is going to show the accounts so as to induce him to invest money or rake some
         se                   other action on them. I do not think, however, the duty can be extended si:!! further
         ^                    so as to include strangers of w hom they have heard nothing and to whom their
         st                   emplover without their knowledge may choose to show their accounts. Once the
                               accountants have handed their accounts to their employer, they are not. as a rule.
         ;d                   responsible for what he does with them without their knowledge or consent . . .
                               Excluding such cases as those, however, there are some cases—o f which the present
                               is one—where the accountants k n o w all the time, even before they present their
         d f                  accounts, that their employer requires the accounts to show to a third person so as
                               to induce him to act on them, and then they themselves, or the;r employers, present
                               the accounts to him for the purpose. In such cases I am ol opinion that the
         ^                    accountants owe a dutv of care to the third person. The test of proximity in these
         :r                   cases is: Did the accountants know that the accounts were required tor su&rrsission
          P                   to the plaintiff and use by him?’
                     In relation to the third question, he said ([1951] 1 All ER 426 at 4 3 5 . [ ; 9 5 >J 2 KB 164 at
                     182-184):
                                  '[The dutv of care] extends. I think, only to those transactions for which the
                               accountants knew their accounts were required. For instance, in the present case it
                               extends to the original investment of £2.000 which the plaintiff made in reliance
                               on the accounts, because the defendants knew that the accounts were required for
                               his guidance in making that investment, but it does not extend to the subsequent
’r   I                         £200 which he invested after he had been two months with the company. This
                               distinction, that the duty onlv extends to the very transaction in mind at the time,
                               is implicit in the decided cases. . . It will be noticed that I have confined the duty to
                               cases where the accountant prepares his accounts and makes his report for the
                               guidance of the verv person in the very transaction in question. That is sufficient
                               for the decision of this case. I can well understand that it would be going too far to
                               make an accountant liable to a n v person in the land who chooses to re!v on the
                               accounts in matters of business, for that would expose him, in the words of C a r d o z o ,
                               C.J., in I'hramares Corpn. v. Tmche (1931) 255 NY 170, to “. . . liability in an
                               indeterminate amount for an indeterminate time to an indeterminate class.”
                               Whether he would be liable if he prepared his accounts for the guidance of a specific
         e                     class of persons in a specific class of transactions, I do not say.’
                        Denning LJ clearly considered that the scope of any duty of care was limited to the
         :e          precise transaction for which the accountants knew that the accounts were to be used. In
         :s          the Hedley B\rne case [1963] 2 All ER 575, [1964] AC 465 a company’s bankers were
         ■”        1 asked by the plaintiffs' bankers whether the company 'would be good for an advertising
          0          contract of £8,000 to £9,000’. The company’s bankers answered the question in the
          c          affirmative but, 'without responsibility on the part of the bank’, W hen the company
          a          failed, the plaintiffs sought to recover damages from the bankers for negligence in
         5,          making the statement. The action failed because of the express disclaimer of responsibility,
         ir          but this House, after detailed re v i e w of authority, held that a negligent statement, oral or

written. could give rise 10 an action for damages for economic loss apart from an’,
contractual or fiduciary relationship subsisting betw een the parties. In the context of :h::
case. Medley Byrne is perhaps most important for its approval of the dissenting judemer.:
ol Denning LI in Candler v Crane Christmas <r Co. After setting out ;he facts in Candler :
case. Lord Reid said j 963] 2 All ER 575 at 5 S3, [1 0 6 4] AC 4 0 5 at 4S7 :
        This seems to me to be a typical case of agreeing to assume a responsibility: jh t
      accountants! knew why the plaintiff wanted to see the accounts and w hy their
      employers, the company, wanted them to be shown to him. and agreed to shov
      them to him without even a suggestion that he should not rely on them.’
   Lord Reid is again there emphasising the fact that the maker of the statement w i
aware of the purpose for which the accounts w-ere required 10 be seen. Finallv. in Smith
Eric S Bin):        2 All ER 514. [19S0] 2 WLR 790 the plaintiff applied for a morteaet
to a buiiding society which in pursuance of its statutory duty under the Building Societie:
Act 1062 instructed independent surveyors to prepare a written report as to the value 0:
the house in question. The plaintiff paid to the building society a fee in respect ot ihij
report, and subsequently a copy thereof was provided to her. Without obtaining ar.
independent valuation, the plaintiff bought the house which later turned out to be
structurally defective. The surveyor was found to have been negligent in failing tc
discover the detect. This House held that, notw ithstanding the presence of an exclusior.
clause in his report, he was thereby in breach of a duty of care owed to the plaintiff. It is
clear trom the speeches which were delivered that the facts w hich created the proximate
relationship betw een the surveyor and the plaintiff were that the former knew that tht
valuation had been paid for by the plaintiff and would be shown to and probabiv relied
on by her in deciding whether or not to buy the house. Thus, Lord Templeman said
         2 Ail ER 514 at 522-523, [1980] 2 WLR 79c at 799 :
         ‘I agree that, by obtaining and disclosing a valuation, a mortgagee does not assume
      responsibility to the purchaser for that valuation. But in my opinion the value:
      assumes responsibility to both mortgagee and purchaser by agreeing to carry out s
      valuation for mortgage purposes knowing that the valuation fee has been paid by
      the purchaser and knowing that the valuation will probabW be relied on by the
      purchaser in order to decide whether or not to enter into a contract to purchase the
      house.’

   Lord Tempieman undoubtedly considered that one of the necessary ingredients of the
relationship of proximity was the fact that the valuer knew of the particular transaction
for the purposes of which reliance would probably be placed on his report.
   Lord Griffiths, after setting out three criteria for the imposition of a dutv of care on an
adviser, namely foreseeability of damage, proximity of relationship and reasonableness,
continued ([1989] 2 All ER 514 at 536, [19S9] 2 WLR 79c at S16I:
         T he necessary proximity arises from the surveyor's knowledge that the
      overwhelming probability is that the purchaser will rely on his valuation, the
      evidence was that surveyors knew that approximately 00% of purchasers did so. and
      the fact that the surveyor only obtains the work because the purchaser is w illing to
      pay his fee. It is just and reasonable that the duty should be imposed for the advice
      is given in a professional as opposed to a social context and liability for breach of the
      duty will be limited both as to its extent and amount. The extent of the liability is
      limited to the purchaser of the house: I would not extend it to subsequent
      purchasers.’
Here Lord Griffiths is limiting the existence and scope of the duty of care to the very
person and the very transaction which were in the contemplation of the surveyor at the
material time.

 Tj! bv accenting office, came under a statutory duty to make their report to the members of
        the companv. The crucial issue is the purpose tor which rhe report was made. To quote

 eir; it":s necessarv to look at the relevant provisions of Pt Vll of the Companies Ac: i ?Sj.
 )\v!      Section 221 requires everv company to cause account-.ng records to be kept w hich
        should be sufficient to show and explain the company s transactions, and shouid be such
 ••as* as a to disclose with reasonable accuracy the financial position ot the company at the

         with the requirements of rhe Act. If a company's business involves dealing in goods, the

         financial vear and of their position at the end of it’, and giving particulars of. inter alia,
         changes in asset values, directors' shareholdings and other interests and contributions for

ier inter alia, in the following terms:

                   (2) The auditors' report shall be read before the company in general meeting, anc
                be open to the inspection of any member of the companv.
                   (3) In respect ot each financial year the directors— a, shall deliver to the registrar
                of companies a copy of the accounts for the year..
              The accounts of a company are denned by s 23? to include, inter alia, the companv’;
          profit and loss account and balance sheet, and the directors' and auditors’ reports. Ir
          terms ot s 240, a copy of the company's accounts must be sent to every member not lex
          than 21 days beiore the date o! the meeting referred to in s 2 j r i':. Finally, s 245 impose;
          penalties on directors whose defective accounts are laid before the company or delivered
          to the registrar of companies.
             Three matters emerge from the statutory provisions, name’v: '1; that the responsibility
          for the preparation ot accounts giving a true and fair view of the companv s financial
          state is placed fairly and squarely on the shoulders of the directors: '2; that the role of th:
          auditors is to provide an independent report to the members on the proper preparatior,
          of the balance sheet and profit and loss account, and as to whether those documents givt
         a true and tair view respectively of the state of the company's affairs at the end of the
          financial year and of the company's profit and loss for that vear. Their role is thus pureh
          investigative rather than creative: 3' that the companv’saccounts* including the auditors
          report, will be furnished to all members of the company as weii as to debenture holder,
         and any other persons entitled to receive notice of genera! meeting. The accounts will. 0:
          course, also be available to any member of the public who chooses to examine the
          company file in the office of rhe registrar of companies.
             So much for the circumstances in which company accounts reach the members,
         circumstances which render it inev itable that auditors will be aware that their report;
         will be seen and relied on by the members. However, that does not answer tht
         fundamental question ot the purpose, and hence the very transactions, for which the
         annual accounts ot a company are prepared and distributed to its members. Counsel for
         the auditors submitted that the principal purpose was to provide an account of the
         stewardship of the directors to the shareholders as a body, and pot to provide individual
         investors, whether shareholders or members of the public, with comparative information.
\       Counsel for Caparo, on the other hand, argued that the purpose was to enable shareholders
    I   to make such individual decisions as they wished in relation to the companv, including
         decisions as to investment, they already being investors, and decisions as to voting in
         general meetings.
             In the Court of Appeal Bingham LJ concluded that the auditors had voluntarily
         assumed direct responsibility to individual shareholders to whom they owed a duty to
         exercise reasonable care in carrying out their audit see [ 1pSoj 1 All ER 70S at S07-S11.
         [1989] QB 653 at 685-600;. He further concluded that such dutv was owed to a
         shareholder m respect of any loss sustained by him in selling, retaining, or buying shares
         in the company. Bingham LJ referred to the approval by Cardozo CJ in L'lrrumurfs Ccrp
         v Touche .'1931; 255 NY 170 at 185 of an earlier statement of Pound] in Csurteen Seed Cc
         vHcngKcmg and Shanghai Banking Ccrp ' 102 7; 245 \Y 377 at 3S1; that—
                ‘negligent words are not actionable unless they are uttered directly, with
              knowledge or notice that they will be acted on. to one to whom the speaker is bound
              by some relation of duty, arising out of public calling, contract or otherwise, to act
              with care if he acts at all.’
        He then said:
                 ‘This formulation would not exclude the finding of a sufficiently proximate
              relationship in the present case if the words “will be acted on” are replaced, as in
              English law I think they should be, by “may be acted on".'

             .. once proximitv to the shareholder is established, the auditor oughtprima
         fade to be liable for any loss suffered in foreseeable reliance on the report. . .
  In mv view these observations go too far. Possibility of reliance on a statement for an

 per se create a relationship of proximity between the auditor and the ultimate successful!

 this case was correctly decided and J would only add that rhat I am in entire agreemen;

owed a duty of care to potential investors who were not shareholders bv applvine the tes:
of whether the detenders knew or reasonably should have foreseen at the Time the
accounts were audited that a person might rely on those accounts for the purpose of
deciding whether or not to take over the company, and therefore would suffer loss if the
accounts were inaccurate. There were in that case no such findings in facr as woulc
support the existence of a relationship of proximiry between rhe auditor and the
unknown potential investor. I therefore consider that the reasoning of the Lord Ordinary
was unsound and that the decision cannot be supported.
    For the foregoing reasons, I would allow rhe appeal and dismiss the cross-appeal.

1 Au g u s t 1994.

Dear Home Secretary,

Mr.     & Mrs.        Chur<2h,
Liv e r p o o l L Z ±

I wrote to you on 27 J une 1994 in           respect of the
above named constituents of mine a n d you r e p l i e d to
me d ated 25 July.     I was e x t r e m e l y d i s a p p o i n t e d
with your response and I do feel o b l i g e d to write
to you again    in order to r e t a l i a t e on several
points.

1. I do not accept that you i n d i v i d u a l l y c o nsidered
   all    aspects          of   this   case   and       I   seek
   re consid e r a t i o n of my request to meet wit h you.

2. My constituents are not a s s o c i a t e d w i t h other
   bereaved families in the legal sense as they are
   ac t i n g indepe n d e n t l y outs i d e the   pressure
   groups.

   ^ referred to the ma n n e r in w h i c h they have been
   so       badly        served  by  a  variety        of  legal
   r e p r e s e ntatives and I give the e x a m p l e of £6,000
   of public m o n e y to one firm of s o l i c i t o r s alone,
   by way of Legal Aid, has been p a i d and nothing
   but nothing shown for by w a y of return.                  My
   cons t i t u e n t s have paid out of t h e i r own pockets
   well over £5,000 in p u r s u a n c e of the justice I
   referred to in my earlier l e t t e r and there will
   be other amounts of Legal Aid involved.



                                                                                                      C o n t i n u e d Over /

 4. I s p e c i f i c a l l y did not go into detail in my
     letter about the seri o u s d i f f i culties faced by
    my cons t i t u e n t s      (your         1st paragraph        in your
    response refers) b e c a u s e as I explained, they
    are long and c o m p l i c a t e d and need to be related
    first      hand          rather         than     hand     written          to
    appreciate          the    p o i g n a n c y and     full   effect         of
    their      diffic u l t i e s .              Furthermore/        despite
    numerous        r e q uests      by Mr.        &  Mrs. Church,           and
    myself      of       their       behalf/         to    a  vari e t y       of
    individuals and o r g a n i s a t i o n s (I have contacted
    our c o lleague Ian Sproat M.P. as M i n i s t e r of
    Heritage) we still cannot obtain the names of
    the   in d i v i d u a l s    comprising           the   Hil l s b o r o u g h
    Steering Group.            This is fundamental information
    required by my con stituents.

 5. I have not mad e this request to you in the sense
    of trying to find a n y M i n i s t e r likely to react
    to my constituents'               plight. Rather,  it   is
    because I b e l i e v e your office is the approp r i a t e
    one to c o n sider the mai n injustices in the whole
    sequence of events and, I am appealing to you
    once more to grant my request.              if you still
    feel unable to do so, would you please c o n sider
    requesting one of your junior Ministers to meet
    me and my c o n s t i t u e n t s ?.

I   hope  consistent          wit h  all     the  notions  of
compassion and justice w h i c h I t rust we both share,
you  will   consider        my   request    not  only  for  a
meeting, but for a J u d i c i a l R e v i e w as referred to
in my Early Day M o t i o n No. 1372 (attached) and
which is s u p p o r t e d at the last count by 50 of our
colleagues across the pol i t i c a l parties.

My cons t i t u e n t s feel they are being denied their
civil and legal rights and I have to say I fully
and totally supp o r t them .

I look forward to what I hope will be a favourable
response to this letter.


Yours sincerely,


Joe Benton,      J.p.,       M.P.,
Bootle.

Thank you              for y o u r letter of 27 June on b e h a l f of y o u r
c o n s t i t u e n t s M r a n d Mrs Church w h o lost t heir son during th e
H i l l s b o r o u g h tragedy.     You a sked for a m e e t i n g to discuss th e
d i f f i c u l t i e s w h i c h have b e e n faced b y you r cons t i t u e n t s in
g e t t i n g answers to questions s u r r o u n d i n g the tragic d e a t h of
t h e i r son, but y o u d i d not say what these d i f f i c u l t i e s have been.

You als o r e f e r r e d to a recent "Cook Report" w h i c h dealt w i t h
ev e n t s s u r r o u n d i n g Hillsborough. As I u n d e r s t a n d it, the c o n c e r n
of the p r o g r a m m e related to               a l l e g a t i o n s that   some w i t n e s s
s t a t e m e n t s wer e alte r e d u n d e r p ol i c e p r e s s u r e to c o n f o r m to the
a g r e e d time of death.

S h o u l d M r a n d Mrs Church have a c o m p l a i n t to m ake c o n c e r n i n g
p o l i c e b e h a v i o u r in this respect, it s h o u l d be made, in the first
instance, to the Chief Off i c e r of the relevant force u n d e r Part
IX of the Police an d Criminal E v i d e n c e Act 1984.

A l t h o u g h I am responsible for                 c o r o n e r ' s law,      coroners are
i n d e p e n d e n t judicial officers and H o m e Office M i n i s t e r s hav e no
p o w e r to interfere in their decisions.                     The A t t o r n e y G eneral has
p o w e r u n d e r sect i o n 13 of the C o r o n e r s Act 1988 to authorise an
a p p l i c a t i o n to the H i g h Court seek i n g a fresh inquest, but I am
a w a r e that the A t t o r n e y General has d e c l i n e d such app l i c a t i o n s
b e c a u s e he c o n c l u d e d that t hey w o u l d have no reas o n a b l e p r o s p e c t
of e s t a b l i s h i n g that it was n e c e s s a r y or des i r a b l e in the
i n t e r e s t s of justice for a fresh inquest to be held.

I a m f u r t h e r aware that a n u m b e r of L i verpool M P s have b e e n in
t o u c h w i t h the A t t o r n e y General a s k i n g hi m to r e c o n s i d e r his
d e c i s i o n an d that he has i n d icated that he remains of the v i e w
that t h e r e is no b a s i s for such an a p p l i c a t i o n to the H i g h Court.

I u n d e r s t a n d that the Divisional             Court,    in c o n s i d e r i n g an
a p p l i c a t i o n for judicial r eview r e l a t i n g to the inquest, too k the
same v i e w as the Attorney.




J o e B e n t o n Es q JP,    MP

There has, as y o u know, a l r e a d y b e e n an independent inquiry into
the H i l l s b o r o u g h disaster. The L o r d Chief Justice, as he is now,
w as app o i n t e d b y the then H o m e Sec r e t a r y to und e r t a k e this
i n q u i r y because, at the time of Hillsborough, the Hom e Office h a d
responsibility               for   safety       at    sports    grounds.      However,
r e s p o n s i b i l i t y for this m a t t e r n o w rests w i t h the Department of
N a t i o n a l Heritage and so a n y d e c i s i o n to re-o p e n the Inqu i r y
w o u l d be a m a t t e r for them to consider.

I appreciate the d epth of feeling of those like M r and Mrs C h u r c h
wh o so t r a g i c a l l y lost members of t heir family at Hillsborough.
I can o n l y express m y sincere c o n d o l e n c e s to them.           I am afraid,
though, that for the reasons w h i c h I have given, there is no
a c t i o n w h i c h I can p r o p e r l y take in this m a t t e r a n d c o n s e q u e n t l y
I do not think a meet i n g w o u l d serve a n y useful purpose.

Dear Home Secretary,

Mr.  &  Mrs.  Church/
Liverpool L21

My constituents named above tragically lost             their
son    Gary    Christopher          Church/    through    the
Hillsborough disaster.           Since then, they have been
trying to pursue some form of justice through the
legal system but w i t h o u t success.       By justice/ I
mean answers to q u e s t i o n s that w ould bring forth
the  reasons   for Gary's          death  and  identify   the
causes and n e g l i g e n c e if any/ w hich brought about
his death.

My constituents are h o n o u r a b l e and                                                                                  wo r t h y       people

name parent would seek to do.

Without  going        into     any   detail    at       this        stage
concerning   the       frustrations/     pr e v a r i c a t i o n s   and
lack of c o o p e r a t i o n t hey and I have e x p e r i e n c e d
from various members of the legal fraternity in so
many different w a y s / I am asking you to consi d e r a
request/ w hich I now formally make to you/ namely
to grant a meeting wit h myself/ Mr. & Mrs. Church

R e v erend                   of
in              Merseyside.

This       request     has   not      just   been  prompted      by
t e l e v ision's recent e d i t i o n of the Cook Report/      but
obviously         that   programme      does   bring  many      new
qu e s t i o n s requiring answers to the surface.

The h i s t o r y and details behind that w hich Mr. &
Mrs. Church have had to endure are very lengthy/ so
much so/ I felt it more a ppropriate to ask for this
m eeting     so   as you may  hear  at first han d the
dreadful manner in w hich my con s t i t u e n t s have been
treated.

I do hope in an attempt            to seek C h r i s t i a n justice
you will give my request            favourable c o n sideration.

In conclusion/ I take t h i s .opport u n i t y to m e n t i o n I
shall be tabling an Early Day Mot i o n in the Commons
calling upon you to initiate a J u d icial R e v i e w in
the light of recent events which do have further
b earings o n ‘‘the H i l l s borough disaster.

EDM : This House/ in the light of the re c e n t TV
e dit i o n       of   the Coo k Report and the i ncreasing
concerns and c o n s t e r n a t i o n of the relatives of the
vict ims of the tragic Hil l s b o r o u g h d i s a s t e r calls
upon         the      Rt.  Hon.   Home    S e c retary to    order
i m m e d i a t e l y a Judicia l Review into all a s p e c t s of
the d i s a s t e r including recent events which have now
emer g e d thro u g h the said Cook Report programme.

 I look forward to your response.




 Yours sincerely/


 Joe Benton/    J.P./    M.P./
 Bootle.

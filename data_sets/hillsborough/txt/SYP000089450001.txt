                   happening               at    Hillsborough.

                  treatment            as       he    had       got       an    IT    line      inserted              and      an     ET    tube        insitu.

                  A     decision           was       made       by    the       Doctors         present             to    discontinue                  the

                  treatment            as       the       patient          was       not    responding                and      there        was        nothing        else

                  that        could        be    done.

                  Together            with                                           l/took         the       patient          on    a     trolley           to    tue

                  picked        the        bodyV5p              off       the    trolley            and       placed          it    on     to    the     floor,            I

                  then        took,    the       trolley             back,      to    A +      E.        It    was       at    this        stage        th#

                  realised            that       the          patients          clothing            was       still       on       the     troj,

                  I cannot            describe                the    clothing          because            it     was      in       th e    fj/operty          ba>(<        I

                  returned            to    the       plaster             room       and    handed            the     proper^^             to    the     same

               I then       returned        to     the       resuscitation         roam    and    became    involved       in    the

               care    and      t r e a t m ent    of    a     young      female    patient.

               At    the    time     I did        not    know       they^irls      identity       but   later     found    out    that

               I had       no   further      dealings           with      these    or   any    other    patients.

T ravelling F irst Aid Kits
The contents of small travelling first aid kits (for use, in some circumstances, in
establishments where there is dispersed working, or by employees working away
from their employer’s establishment or by self-employed persons) may vaiy accord­
ing to the circumstances in which they are to be used. However, items included
should always be among those specified above. In general, the following items should
be sufficient:
   a. six individually wrapped sterile adhesive dressings;
   b. one medium-sized sterile unmedicated dressing (approx 10 cm x 8 cm;
       examples of suitable dressings currently available are the Standard Dressings
       No 8 and No 13 BPC);
   c. one triangular bandage (this should, if possible, be sterile; if not, a sterile
       covering appropriate for serious wounds should also be included);
   d. six safety puis.
Supplem entary equipm ent
The approved code states th a t where first aiders and occupational first aiders are
employed in an establishment the employer should provide appropriate, carrying
equipment for them to use. In addition it is recommended th a t where such
equipment is provided, blankets should be stored alongside the equipment and in
such a way as to keep them free from d u |t and dampness.
P rotective Clothing an d Equipm ent
Protective clothing and equipment should be provided near the first aid m aterials
where there is a possibility that the first aider or occupational first aider m ight need
protection to avoid becoming a casualty himself while adm inistering first aid.
 Protective clothing and equipment should always be properly stored and checked
 regularly to ensure th at it remains in good condition.

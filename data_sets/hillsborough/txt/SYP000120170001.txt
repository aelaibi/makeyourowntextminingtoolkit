                        I am a Police Constable in the South Yorkshire Police presently

                        stationed in the Divisional Support Group at £ Division,

                        Headquarters,       Heeley,     Sheffield.

      "e/s              At 08.30 am Saturday,           15th April       1989,     (150489)        I commenced duties

                        'Forest FG*. .

                        In company with the group upon arrival I attended at the briefing

                        this taking place at 1000 am in the North Stand.                            Upon completion we

          #             had a small break.           At 1115 am we took up our duties - S e r i a l              No.    21

                        in the Leppings Lane end - standby area - shortly before noon a few

                        fans had arrived into the Leppings Lane end about 20-30 in total.

                        At noon our unit was directed by match control to go to the

                        Nottingham Forest end - Penistone Road,                     this to assist other officers

                        re crowd control.          I took up duties at turnstiles and during this

                        time I body searched a number of Nottingham supporters before they

                        gained access to the ground.                Also assisted in arrest of a drunk.                 At

                        2.55 pm (1455)       the unit was directed to take up a position in the gym,

                        this was from the sergeant - S g t . Eddison.

                        As we got to the gyni, at 3.05 pm (1505) we were directed to go to the

Leppings Lane end - inner track area to assist with the crowd.                     As I

bilked down the track area North Stand I could see about 100 people

on the inner track and other people climbing over the ferice.

The m a j o r ity off the p eople seemed to me to b e watching the football

match.    (These on the inner track).       They were just either sat down

or squatting down on their knees.

As I got to the Lane end of the pitch - I saw and heard a lot of                          ^

supporters^**ito%«<£fcg at the Police to open the gates as they were

getting squished and that there was too many people in t h | r e .

A small gate was open at this time,         this to the right '/fljitirwr side of         ,

the goal as you look at it      People were going through this and onto

.the pitch .area'.'

A senior officer at this time ran onto the pitch and informed the

referee to stop the game.      This was Supt. Greenwood.

X assisted other officers to get these people through the gate, but

as it was quite small, difficulty was experienced,              injured people

then gained access to the pitch a r e a .         Fans were coming from the back

of the crowd and walking over the tops of the people in front of them.

Police Officers and supporters then began to shake the fencing from

behind the goal area and I did also * this was to enable the crowd of

fans to get pftto the pitch area the fencing gave way and people were

then climbing through.      NumeTrous people obviously dead were also

passed through and laid on the pitch.             I assisted in passing the

bodies through the fenced a r e a . ^

Supporters and police officers had torn down the boardings from

around the pitch and carrying bodies to the gym area.               I then started

to do this as there were too many officers around the goal area.                     I

assisted in carrying abodt seven people to the gym.              Some time later

after this when all the dead had gone from the pitch area I rejoined

m y unit, as I had become split up from them.            I then- wen|:.t<a-~'The
                                                                      v
         outside of Leppings Lane end and as I walked past near to the river I

         saw about 10 dead bodies covered up - shortly afterwards I went back

         with ray unit to the transit van and went on mobile patrol.

         At 8.30 pm i went off duty.

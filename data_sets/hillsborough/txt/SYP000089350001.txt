           I am a Woman Police Constable in the South Yorkshire                                                                    ice Force,

           currently stationed at Atte^cliffe Pol Stn.

           At 0830 hrs on Saturday 15th April                                1989 (150489),                            I commenced duty at

           Attercl iffe Pol Stn I was then transported by mini bus with other

           officers to West Bar Pol Stn for a briefing for the FA Cup Se-mi final

           to be played at the Hi 1 Is bo rough F ootball g round later t/Hat d a t e .

           My posting for the football match involved escorti n ci/ t o o t ba 11 fans

           from Midland Train Station to the ground at Hill^fiorough on the public

           transport buses t                    ad been laid on for the e v e n t .                                            I did

           this duty until 2                    pm (1445) when I went with/6ther officers to the

           Hillsborough Foot'lSall Ground.                   I went to the /ymnasium in order to

           have a hot m e a l .

           At about two minutes                 past three       (1502) as we having our meal we were
                                                                                           PAGE      2.
                                                                                           S33& 1

called out onto the pitch.                    I had no idea of what was happening.

I walked onto the pitch and down the side of the pitch and then across

to the Leppings Ln end to the far right of the goal mouth as you would

look from the Leppings Ln stand.

At first I thought there was pitch invasion occurring as I saw people

spilling o n t o ^ h e        pitch from the Leppings Ln stand.              However,     as these    ,

people got/onto the pitch many of them fell to th^/ground.                          I was with

FQL FC3172 DUDLEY at this time when a sevente^ff year old lad dropped
                  X.
onto the ground in/front of us.                         He had 4 ^ f iculty breathing so we

rendered f i rsj^^ai d and after about fifteen minutes he was recoveri rig.

I have today been shown video and pKotographs by                                          and

                  of the West Midlandk Police and in the following photographs

I am pictured with the aforementioned youth.

survived,          after hiv/ng escorted him on -fn advertising hoarding to an

       began mouth to mouth on a casualty and was approached by a man who

       stated he was a doctor.         I then worked with this man on a number

       of people, giving mouth to mouth whilst he gave cardiac massage.

       I lost count of the people we tried together to revive but as

       we were unable to we were covering their heads with clothing as

       an indication that they were dead,        to assist others   in being able

       to give help to others that there may have been alive.             When we
                                                                     PAGE     5

     had done all we could to help we parted company and I reported

     back to my superior officer.     I then with another Fireman S.O.

            1walked the perimeter of the pitch to assist walking

     casualties and advise them where to receive medical     help.    We

     then reported to the Gym where we again assisted with the

     i njured.

     I do not know who the doctor I assisted was and I don't think I

     could recognise him again.     He was whits avid probably in his

     mid 3 0 ’s.   He appeared tall & slim.

     I would not be able to assist    in identifying any of the bodies

     I worked on whilst I was on the pitch I d i d n ’t take notice of

     any of them particularly.

Hillsborough - note for file

Friday 29 October 99 - Telephone conversa ion 15.30hrs
with            Sellers Legal Services (tel.

Purpose - update                with progress of conversion from Holmesl
to Holmes2 as promised.

Details Provided: -
Problems encountered in conversion of incident (not Hillsborough).
Unisys has now resolved problem.
SYP are validating the conversion data to check on data consistency
and completeness. I will confirm status on Friday 5 November - or
before if problems found in conversion.

Agent for conversion work.
I stated Unisys would be the agent used for the production of the
Hillsborough Data, reasons being
1. Unisys already contracted to transfer incidents from Holmesl to
    Holmes2.
2. Holmesl ceases as at end of November
3. Unisys has the required expertise and resources in Holmes2.

Outline Schedule: -
5™ November - confirm conversion data check results.
17th November - collection of sample data on CD-ROM
24th November -               |to confirm acceptance of data format.
Mid December - Hillsborough info available on CD-ROM

I stressed this was an outline schedule only - subject to availability of
Unisys - and firmer proposals should be available by mid November.

Further to our recent discussions regarding the above, I have now had the opportunity to
discuss the same with               Our requirements for the transfer o f the data are as
follows:-

        1.      The 3,000+ statements held on Holmes to be supplied on CDRom.

       2.       Data to be supplied as ACSII text file, one file per statement.

Where addresses o f witnesses are disclosed I undertake not to supply these to any third party
without the consent o f the witness. An exception to this will obviously have to be made when
providing copy CDs to the Defence.

I look forward to receiving your charging proposals and timetable at your earliest
convenience.

I thank you for your assistance in this matter.

Yours sincerely

Also provided hand written and typed version o f former Inspector Harry
White’s statement dated 25 February 1991.
Informed Ms Adlington that we did not have QPO’s for ACC W.W.Jackson,
Ch Supt Duckenfield, Supt Marshall, nor Supt Greenwood.
I referred Ms Adlington to her request for the minutes o f a meeting
between DCC Hayes, Ch Supt Mole and DS Peter Carr. I informed her
that as far as I was aware the meeting had not been minuted and that it
had been held to instruct DS Carr to prepare an ANACAPA chart. I
informed her I had spoken to Peter Carr on his return from annual leave
and although he could remember preparing the ANACAPA chart he had
no recollection o f the meeting nor could he assist with whether minutes
had been prepared or not. I also informed her that I had spoken to the
former secretary to the DCC and that she had no recollection of
minuting the meeting, nor was anything indexed to suggest the meeting
had been minuted. She asked if there was a written action to record the
request for the ANACAPA chart and I replied, "No”.

Provided Ms Adlington with a copy of the 142 page Hillsborough Video
Schedule.

I spoke to Ms Adlington re her request for the transcript o f radio
channel 35, informed her that the channel had been used by Hammerton
Road Police Station and that it was not recorded. An extended incident
had, however, been created on the command and control computer and
was added to by an operator sitting at a computer terminal typing
details from channel 35 on screen as they happened. This system was
not perfect, as it was neither verbatim, nor real time. The print out o f
this extended incident, which was the only record o f channel 35 was
contained in D1393, which had been copied to her today.

Superintendent B Murray
Superintendent R Marshall
Superintendent R Greenwood
PC417 Illingworth
PC442 Cuckson
PC1285 Smith
PC2316 Scott, and also
Mr G H Mackrell (Secretary SWFC)

I informed Ms Adlington that a search o f the archive had not revealed
there to be any police officers pocket note books stored therein and no
PSU forms either. I informed her that we did not have copy o f original
FA Submissions to the LJT Enquiry, but confirmed with her that she did
not know if there had been an original submission as opposed to the FA
final submission, a copy o f which had been disclosed.

Disclosed to Ms Adlington a file o f West Midlands Police Reports R1 to
R109 to supersede the partial file o f reports originally supplied on Friday,
8 October 1999. I also disclosed the file o f reports R1 to R ll from the
original South Yorkshire Police Enquiry into Hillsborough. I particularly
referred her to R8 PC                     ^nd pointed out that this was
actually a note by DS Mick Oughton after he had interviewed PC
giving a summary o f what he could say. I also disclosed a print out o f the
SYPol HOLMES action schedule from 17.04.89, which tasked DS Oughton
with interviewing 4 officers. I disclosed a copy o f the index to the SYPol
Reports R1 to R ll and the folder o f those reports.

In answer to a query by Ms Adlington about R48 from the West Mids Pol
Reports I disclosed S120 £r S495, being identical statements by PC7048
Stephen Martin Foster, Merseyside Police. I also referred her to R65,
which was about the same officer and indicated that he had been
registered on the HOLMES system twice and given two nominals hence
the two differently numbered identical statements. The two entries had
later been merged.

A copy o f the S.Y.Fire Service original submission to LJT was supplied to
Ms Adlington.

Up to this point o f the disclosure process I had been responding to the
requests o f Ms Adlington in disclosing statements, documents, etc. Being
mindful o f the Court Order I brought to her attention large plans o f
SWFC ground and photographic collages o f the Leppings Lane Terrace,
with and without spectators. I also disclosed for her inspection two boxes
o f photographs, taken on 15.4.89 by members o f the press and
spectators in the ground. I also tried to ascertain if there was anything
else she wished me to disclose as she had indicated that she was coming
to the end o f her inspection for the time being.

I also disclosed a plan o f SWFC Gound prepared by Eastwoods on 16.4.87
with amendments to the gates at Leppings Lane dated 21.10.87. I also
drew her attention to plan 1340/04A by Brades (Ref. DPP Doc94) which

Friday, 19 November,1999.
Following receipt o f a fax dated 15.11.99 and a telphone conversation on
16.11.99 between Ms Adlington and myself, I refused to disclose to her
the Index o f Actions from the West Midlands Police, HOLMES Hillsborough
data base. My grounds for this decision were that the index, which
comprises over 8600 different actions had no relevancy to the
Prosecution and its disclosure was not covered by the Court Order issued
by His Honour Judge Hooper.
I wrote with this decision on this date and also enclosed a copy o f the
schedule o f documents, statements, photographs and indices that I had
disclosed and copied to the Prosecutor.
    Tuesday, 7 December, 1999.
    Following receipt o f a fax and confirming letter from Ms Adlington, I
    today forwarded to her the following statements:
    S3718 £r A        Former PCT

and West Midlands Police Photograph Album RAH/HILL 1 -M, Plate 6 , 1
indicated the position of the camera that recorded RJH 1. Using Plate

recorded turnstiles 9 to 16 and the camera that was not switched on,
because it was trained on a brick wall. I explained that it was the video.

White’s statement dated 25 February 1991.
Informed Ms Adlington that we did not have QPO’s for ACC W.W.Jackson,
Ch Supt Duckenfield, Supt Marshall, nor Supt Greenwood.
I referred Ms Adlington to her request for the minutes o f a meeting
between DCC Hayes, Ch Supt Mole and DS Peter Carr. I informed her
that as far as I was aware the meeting had not been minuted and that it
had been held to instruct DS Carr to prepare an ANACAPA chart. I
informed her I had spoken to Peter Carr on his return from annual leave
and although he could remember preparing the ANACAPA chart he had
no recollection o f the meeting nor could he assist with whether minutes
had been prepared or not. I also informed her that I had spoken to the
former secretary to the DCC and that she had no recollection o f
minuting the meeting, nor was anything indexed to suggest the meeting
had been minuted. She asked if there was a written action to record the
request for the ANACAPA chart and I replied, "No”.

Provided Ms Adlington with a copy o f the 142 page Hillsborough Video
Schedule.

I spoke to Ms Adlington re her request for the transcript o f radio
channel 35, informed her that the channel had been used by Hammerton
Road Police Station and that it was not recorded. An extended incident
had, however, been created on the command and control computer and
was added to by an operator sitting at a computer terminal typing
details from channel 35 on screen as they happened. This system was
not perfect, as it was neither verbatim, nor real time. The print out of
this extended incident, which was the only record of channel 35 was
contained in D1393, which had been copied to her today.

Following receipt o f a fax dated 15.11.99 and a telphone conversation on
16.11.99 between Ms Adlington and myself, I refused to disclose to her
the Index o f Actions from the West Midlands Police, HOLMES Hillsborough
data base. My grounds for this decision were that the index, which
comprises over 8600 different actions had no relevancy to the
Prosecution and its disclosure was not covered by the Court Order issued
by His Honour judge Hooper.
I wrote with this decision on this date and also enclosed a copy o f the
schedule o f documents, statements, photographs and indices that I had
disclosed and copied to the Prosecutor.

Following receipt o f a fax and confirming letter from Ms Adlington, I
today forwarded to her the following statements:

RE: ADLINGTON v DUCKENFIELD AND MURRAY

I refer to our telephone conversation of last week and today regarding the return to the
Hillsborough Disaster Archive of original documents, plans, photographs, video and audio tapes,
which were produced to Leeds Magistrates Court on Monday 24 May 1999 as a result of a
witness summons issued by the Stipendiary Magistrate. Rather than sending you a copy of the
schedules to the summons, which had many deletions and alterations on them I enclose a copy
of the statement of Ian Daines, an Assistant Chief Constable with South Yorkshire Police, which
lists everything produced to the court on the above date.

As I explained to you on the telephone it is the intention of South Yorkshire Police to keep the
original documentation from the Hillsborough Disaster in perpetuity and that is why we are
seeking the return of the listed material.

I am grateful for your assistance in this matter and will telephone you next week to ascertain if
you have been able to locate all the material and arrange a date and time for us to collect.

Thank you.

              I am a married woman                      living     at   the     above       address          w i t h my    husband,

                              and     o ur    son,                      aged     18 w e e k s .         We    have     l i v e d at       this

              address         for     the     past      eighteen        months.

              On Saturday             15 A p r i l      1989     (150489), I awoke                about        8 a m (0800)         and     set

              about      my       normal      housework         etc.

              Whilst       I was         working        in on e    front      room     I had         occasion         to   look      out     of

              the w i n d o w                                                   where       I could          see    s m a ll     groups      of

               people      walking           up a n d    down     the    road.        They       were    football          f an s    as    they

              were      wearing          red a n d w h i t e      scarves,       hats       e t c.      I c a n ’t s a y         from     which

               team     t h e y wer e.

              They      were       quiet and         peaceful,          causing       no     trouble          to a n y o n e .      It w o u l d

              have      been about            9 am      when      I first      noticed        t h e m and, by about,                10.30     am

               (1030)      or      so,    I saw      that   there       were     quite       a    lot    more       people        in the
                                                                                                                                    PAGE
                                                                                                                                    S487

road and           I saw a group                  of    about        thirty        or    so      fans      sat      on    the    wall       of

                                                                                                           This      group were

j ust     sat      there        in h i g h        spirits        and     some       of     them were             drinking          cans      of

beer .

Shortly           after       this,        I saw        two    footali         f a ns      sat       on    our w a l l      and     they

were      drinking            cans        of    beer     which        they     took        from a          carrier         bag     they'd

got     by    them.           They        remained           there      for a b o u t          half       an   hour       and    then

left.         They       caused           no    trouble        at     all.         They        w e r e n ’t n o i s y      or

anything           like       that.            The     only    nuisance            was     that       they       left      behind

about        3 or 4          cans     of       half     drunk        beer.

During        the       t ime    they were              th e r e ,    they     d i d n ’t a p p e a r          to    be    d run k .

They      j us t       seemed        to    have        sat    down,      had a drink,                 and      then       rejoined          the

crowd.

After        t hat      I d i d n ’t t a k e           much    not ice        of    t he       c r o w d at      all,      ju st    going

about        my    business           as       normal.

At     about       2    pm    (1400),           my     husband        and     I went           out    shopping,            returning

around 3.30              pm     (1330)          to     see    l a rge    crowds          leaving          the       ground.         We

d i d n ’t k n o w w h a t           had       happened        till      we    got       in a n d         learned about             it

from I                                                                                  o ur    neighbour,            w h o ’d s e e n       it

on TV.

Following              this,     we       stood        out    the     back     of       our     houses         a n d Mrs

allowed           people        to    use       her     ’phon e.         These          people        were       Liverpool

supporters              ringing           their        relatives         to    tell        them       they       were      safe     etc.

I do      recollect             there          was     one    fan who         rang       to     tell       someone         his     brother

wa s    de ad.          We    only        gathered           this     after        the     call       as M r s       ________ a s k e d

him     if e v e r y t h i n g        w as      alright        and      he    said       t h at ,     apart         from his        brother

being        dead,       yes.

He     d i d n ’t a p p e a r        too       u p s e t , but       very     quiet.            He    w a s n ’t c ry i n g .

Shortly after                 t his       we    returned         to     our    house           where      we     remained          j us t

watching           the       crowd        passing        the     window,           going         in b o t h      directions.

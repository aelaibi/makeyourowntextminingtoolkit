Dear Mr. White

Hillsborough Disaster

Thank you for your letter dated 18th December responding to my
earlier letter regarding the above matter.

I note that you have forwarded the letter to the Director of
Social Services for his attention but should in all honesty stress
that I am somewhat astonished that you have taken this course of
action as it appears to misunderstand the nature of the action
required. I must emphasise that the role of Social Services at
this stage in the aftermath of the Disaster, while obviously
important is nonetheless relatively minor.

Far more important to the Hillsborough families - including those
from Wirral - is their continuing campaign for justice, a campaign
which this City Council has since 1989 supported through its
Hillsborough Disaster Working Party. It is this campaign, boosted
by the new evidence which has come to light as a result of the
"Hillsborough" TV programme, which Liverpool City Council is
asking Wirral, and other Councils in Merseyside and beyond to
support. Many of the families would be appalled, particularly
given the huge public focus which has recently been given to their
quest for justice, to find that the only way in which they are
perceived is as a concern for social workers when they desperately
need more positive and practical assistance from their
representatives in the Town Halls of Merseyside and elsewhere.



                       Director o f Personnel & Administration: Ian Jones
  Administration & Commercial Services; Committee & Member Services; Human Resource Service;
                    Information Technology; Legal Services; Public Relations.
I would emphasise that this matter received the full attention of
a special meeting of Liverpool City Council and that the Council
as a result pledged its unanimous support to the various legal
actions being taken by the Hillsborough Family Support Group. The
hope of the City Council therefore is that these issues are placed
before the Members of other Councils, particularly here on
Merseyside, in order that they too can express their concern and
give their assistance in whatever way possible to the Hillsborough
families.

I hope therefore in the light of the above that you are able to
place this matter before the Members of your Authority with a view
to them hopefully endorsing the resolution of the City Council and
on behalf of the families in Wirral bereaved by Hillsborough,
joining the campaign for justice following what has recently been
described as the "biggest farce in British legal history". Given
the massive public concern which has been expressed since the
transmission of the "Hillsborough" drama/documentary from all
corners of the country, it would be, to say the least, a very big
disappointment to the Hillsborough families if Wirral Council
failed to support, or even worse failed to even consider, the very
important issues which the television programme brought into the
homes and consciences of the nation.

Enclosed are some documents which may assist with your
understanding of the issues involved including responses I have so
far received from Wirral M.P.'s. I would of course be pleased to
let you have any further information which you may require.



Yours sincerely

           Dear Mr Moneypenny

           Thank your for your correspondence dated 7 January 1997 regarding the above
           matter.

           I do appreciate the nature of the request but the officer responsible for dealing
           with all matters relating to the Hillsborough Disaster is the Director of Social
           Services and I was anxious to involve her in any response the Authority may
           make in relation to this matter.

           For your information, an item has been included on the first available meeting of
           the Policy and Resources Committee which is on 3 February 1997. The Authority
           will be in touch with you immediately after that date with our response to your
           original letter of 12 December 1996.

           With best wishes

           Yours sincerely

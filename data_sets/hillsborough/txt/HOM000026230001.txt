                      THIRTY-FIRST DAY'S PROCEEDINGS

                        TH U R S D A Y , 29th JUNE.    1989

                              (AFTERNOON    SESSION)


                        DOUGLAS JOHN LOCK Recalled

                      Cross-examined by        MR. J A C K S O N :

     Q. Mr. Lock, I hope you will forggve me if in the sixtji
        week of this Inquiry I put to you some propositions
        which you may find childlike.  I do so because of the
        nature of the conduct of this Inquiry.,— A. Xes, sir.

               LORD JUSTICE    TAILOR:      Not sure what you mean by
          that, but still.

               MR. 3ACKS0N:   Sir, may I make it quite clear what
          I do mean??  I feel it is terribly, terribly important.
          It will be my submission for a number of weeks repeated
          and extensive cross-examination has been put forward
          seeking to support propositions that are untenable in
          theory and are not supported by any of the evidence
          given even by those who speak for the parties involved.

               LORD JUSTICE TAYLOR:   Well now, Mr. Jackson, why
          do not you just ask the witness  some questions?

     Q.        MR. JACKSON:   Mr. Lock, it is a simple proposition,
          is it not, that the loading and distribution of terraces
          combined both crowd control and safety problems? - A.
          Yes, sir.

     Q. Bearing in mind the configuration of the Leppings Lane West
        terraces it is a very simple proposition that the dis­
        tribution of the fans on the terraces is a safety matter?
        - A. Yes, sir.

     Q. It is well-known to anyone who has had anything at all
        to do with the policing or stewarding of those terraces
        that there may well arise dangers out of uneven dis­
        tribution? - A. Yes, sir.

     Q. You as a Superintendent for years took it uppn yourself
        and the officers under your control to monitor and ensure
        the even distribution? - A. We did, sir.

     Q. There has been the use of the expression find their own
        level and you in fact adopted it in a limited sense this
        morning.  Do I understand you to mean when you use the
        expression find their own level you meant they had a
        choice of which of the areas of the terrace to initially
        go to? - A. In a big match, yes, sir.
S^vS.
                                     72



                                                             D. LOCK

        Q. And that again is because of the lack of the crowd
           control and segregation problem at the semi-final?
           - A. Yes, sir.

        Q. Bearing in mind all the matters would you now accept
           as right that the crushing at the front of pens 3 and
           4 was caused by the overcrowding of pens 3 and 4? - A.
           Yes, sir.

        Q.   I ask you that in that way and say it was childlike
             because some weeks ago Mr. Mole would not accept that
             proposition.   Would you agree that any system, and I
             put together the Police and the club for this purpose,
             any system that allowed the fans to find their own level
             in the sense of going into the pens unmonitored was
             clearly dangerous?- A. Not in our experience, sir.    Untiji
             this incident happened, of course, in my time at the
             ground I had not experienced any problem with regards to
             danger to the crowds.

        Q.    Forgive me, Mr. Lock. I understood you to say that this
             system, the system you used, involved monitoring, not
             necessarily by turnstile count but by visual observation?
             - A. Yes, it did, sir.

        Q. Can you give any explanation at all why the years of
           experience were thrown away? - A. None at all, sir.

        Q. It seems u n b elievable, does it not, that anyone, whatever
           rank or position, could sensibly suggest that 10,000 fans
           could be allowed to evenly distribute themselves safely
           on those terraces? -A. No, sir, because we had had big
           crowds both in the League and in semi-finals and they
           had evenly distributed themselves.     I know there was the
           1981 situation but we took steps to prevent that occurring
           again by policing it.

        Q. Mr. Lock, that is exactly what I am talking about.    I am
           suggesting, you see, that your evidence is totall^rj accurate
           and so sensible it bears no contradiction, that is, that
           the system essentially should have been that someone should
           have monitored the distribution of the fans.  You did it
           yourself?- A. Yes, sir.

        Q. What I am asking is can you give us any possible explanation
           as to why those under Chief Superintendent Duckenfield seem
           to have stopped following your sensible policy? -A. No, sir.
           I was not aware they had stopped.

        Q. But you now are? - A. I am.

        Q. Mr. Lock, it must have given you great concern, must it
           not, to find on the terraces of the club who employed
           you people crushed to death and a system that you knew
                              73



                                                        D. LOCK

     would have made it safer had been abandoned? - A. I was
     very - well, I was appalled and I was emotionally dis­
     turbed by what had happened, obviously, sir.

Q.That is why I am asking you, Mr. Lock, if you can tell us
   any possible reason because I will suggest one at the end
   if you cannot.

          LORD JUSTICE  TAILOR:   Well, he has said he does not
     twice so why do not you suggest it?

Q.        MR. JACKSON:   Quite clearly the safety of the fans
     was of no concern to Chief Superintendent Duckenfield?
     -A. Well, I cannot ....

          LORD JUSTICE TAYLOR:   I do not see how you can ask
     this witness that question, with respect, Mr. Jackson.
     I have got the flavour of your argument but this witness
     cannot be asked what was in Mr. D u c k e n f i e l d 1s mind.

Q.        MR. JACKSON:   Mr. Lock, may I ask you this then?
     Is it conceivable to you that anyone who was sitting or
     standing in that control room that  day could have missed
     the overcrowding in the central pens? - A. I was not
     there and you are asking me to make a conjecture that if he
     was sat there and the thing was running normally, they
     were coming through at a normal pace, they were finding
     their own level and then because of what was happening
     outside,and I can understand Mr. Marshall's predicament,
     a request is to open the gates and the system is being
     overridden by the influx of so many people at that time,
     I do not think that Mr. Duckenfield would have disregarded
     the safety of those people.

Q. Mr. Lock, we know there was something like a six or seven
   minute delay between the first request for the gates to be
   opened and the eventual arrival of the supporters at the
   tunnel entrance. - A. Yes, sir.

Q. Do you find it surprising that no-one seems to have con­
   sidered the effect on the crowd inside of the influx of
   people through a gate? - A. This seems to have been missed
   entirely, sir.  I was surprised that no request was made
   either for the Police or the stewards to secure the entry
   to that tunnel and to deviate the fans who were going to
   be allowed into the ground  to do so.

Q. Mr. Lock, may I move to two other matters?  First of all,
   the monitoring of the crowds by the club control room.
   - A. Yes, sir.

Q. We understand that there were videos recorded by the club.
   - A. That is true, sir.

Q. Tfiey would have been able to tell us, would they not,         that
                           74



                                                    D. LOCK

   which was seen by the officers   in the club control room?
   - A. Most of our videos are concentrated on the 95   gates
   and they have static cameras and they are being recorded
   for that alone.   Now, within our control room we also have
   a facility which enablfeseus to look at the Police cameras
   within and without the ground but to be abl^ tor do this,
   we have only one monitor, so we have a selection button.
   Now, we do not record that material.    That is recorded in
   the Police control, so all I have recorded is the entry
   of fans through turnstiles and, coincidentally, the
   entry - the gates being opened at C gate.

Q. Well, Mr. Lock, is it sufficient to say this, that there
   ought to be available videos that would assist this
   Inquiry? - A. Yes, sir.

Q. Where are they?- A. They were taken away from our control
   room, sir, and I cannot answer that question.

Q. We understand they were. We understand some were lost.
   - A. That may be a kind way of putting it, sir.

Q. Yes, it was a kind way.   Until I hear the reverse. - i A . .
   Two of the video films which belonged to the club system
   were in fact stolen.

                                                       D.J. LOCK


     Q. Let us look at this section.  This is section 13 you have
        referred to in the Green Guide. - A. yes, sir.

     Q. And you have selected paragraph 197.     Now, this section at
        page 56 begins:

               "Effective stewarding should prevent overcrowding in
               sections of the ground".

          - A. Yes, that is generalisations.

     Q. But we begin with a generalisation on page 12, do we not?
        There is a whole section on management responsibility? - A. It
        is certainly true, sir, but it also says in paragraph 6, if I
        might quote that:

               "Deviations from individual guidelines are possible
               without necessarily detracting from the overall safety of
               the ground".

     Q. You regarded that as entitling the club to devolving
        stewarding responsibility upon the Police, did you? - A. If I
        might make an analogy with another aspect of football, Kenny
        Dalglish has got responsibility for the club’s results, but he
        can't play the game on his own because he has not got the
        necessary manpower, and the club has not got the resources nor
        the facilities nor the trained persons to do that particular
        function at that end of the ground.

               LORD JUSTICE TAYLOR:    I think we are getting into
          argument.

     Q.        MR. WOODWARD:   May I just move to one other Matter.     In
          the section on stewarding, section 200, it says:

               "Management should appoint a chief steward responsible
               for co-ordinating responsibilities of all stewards".

          - A. Yes, sir.

     Q. Would that be you that had that role? - A. I think you could
        call me that, sir.

     Q. How did you co-ordinate the role and the activities of the
        Police with the rest of your stewards? - A. I don't co­
        ordinate the Police, sir.  I am not able to co-ordinate the
        Police activities.  I speak to the Police liaison Officer.   I
        speak to the Police Chief Superintendent.   I speak to the
        Police on the day.  I visit their box.   I walk round the
        ground and speak to the individual sector coonanders.   I speak
        to my chief stewards.  I have a radio link with my chief
        stewards.  I answer all of their calls for help and do
        whatever I can from any of those people to assist in the
        smooth running function of the stewards.   That is how I co­
        ordinate them.

     Q. What role did the stewards perform on the Kop? - A. There was
                             88


                                                 D.J. LOCK


     a specific role there. Mr. Calvert asked me about that in
     particular.  First of all, they were to keep the gangways and
     entry ways clear, and because we knew a large number of
     Liverpool fans had obtained Nottingham Forest tickets the
     Police had decided to put a segregated area of Liverpool fans
     on an elevated area in the Kop, and they asked my stewards if
     they would deviate any Liverpool fans they saw to that area.

Q' Did your stewards control and direct members of the public on
   the Kop to achieve an even flow of people to viewing areas? -
   A. You could say that.  I have just said that, sir. They were
   directing people over to where the Police had segregated them.

Q. But that would be to send Liverpool people away to the area
   that had been reserved for them? - A. Yes. That is directing
   and control.

Q. What about all the other people? - A. It is not possible, as
   my Lord has said, to pack people like oranges in boxes.

Q.   But you had the task of safe dispersal of spectators on the
     terraces, had not you? - A. But we were doing that.

Q. How did you do that on the Kop? - A. We were directing people
   away from the entrances and the gangways, and specifically we
   were directing Liverpool fans to an area segregated for their
   purpose.

Q.   Were you monitoring through your stewards the safety of
     persons on the Kop? - A. I think that goes without saying.    We
     would have been receiving information.

Q.   Who had given your stewards the instruction to do that? - A.
     The Police gave them a briefing.   I was not there. The Police
     gave them a briefing at 11.15 a.m.

Q.   But your stewards were under your control andresponsibility.
     Did you do anything to ascertain whether they had been told to
     ensure the safe dispersal of spectators on the terraces? - A.
     They are under the control of both me and the Police.   In
     fact....

Q. I am sorry, that is not an answer to the question. Did you do
   anything to ascertain whether or not they had so been told? -
   A. No.

Q. Mr. Lock, I suggest to you that your evidence concerning
   discussions with Mr. Chapman are just not accurate? - A.
   Incorrect, sir.

Q. You say there was a meeting at which Mr. Chapman was present
   between you and Mr. Chester prior to the Leeds match in 1982?
   - A. Not only was there a meeting, I was very fortunate as I
   said before, David Chapman was moved sideways. He was made
   Detective Superintendent, and I took over his role. We
   discussed on a number of occasions the sort of situations we
   could see occurring at the Hillsborough ground.

                                                D.J. LOCK



Q. Was there a specific meeting you recall when this agreement
   was discussed? - A. Mr. England, I am sorry, not Mr. Chester.

Q. Well, with Mr. England and yourself and Mr. Chapman? - A. I
   went down to the ground prior to the Leeds United match with
   M r . Chapman, because he was concerned both as a new Detective
   Superintendent in respect for crime for that match, because
   there had been a high incidence of crime with Leeds followers,
   and I also went with the Chief Superintendent, and we agreed
   to carry out what they had been doing previous to my arrival,
   and that was to steward the West end terraces.

Q. I suggest there was no specific reference in any discussion
   you had with the club and Mr. Chapman concerning the
   stewarding of the Leppings Lane terraces? - A. There was, sir.

Q. Were you present at any of the briefings that Mr. Calvert
   carried out? - A. Which briefings, sir?

Q. Of the stewards? - A. On our training nights?

Q. Yes. - A. I arranged them.   I was present at all of them.

Q. Were you present at the briefing that Mr. Sewell gave? - A. He
   attended one. Sergeant Goddard attended the other one.

Q. In 1988? - A. I beg your pardon.   He did attend twice then,
   yes.

Q. Were you present on those occasions? - A. I was.

Q. It has not been suggested to the Police witnesses that they
   gave your stewards or gave any indication to the club at that
   time that the responsibility of stewarding on the terraces,
   the West end terraces, would be theirs? - A. I am sorry,
   what was the question?

Q. Do you recall any suggestion on the occasions of any of those
   briefings that the stewards should do their ordinary
   stewarding but the stewarding on the West terraces
   was to be a Police responsibility? - A. No, because
   that was the understood thing. They never told the
   stewards they were taking over.

Q. Are you saying that it went without being said? - A. Can I
   digress a short while and tell you the format of those
   training evenings.  I introduced the people who were coming,
   the Fire Officer, the St. John’s Ambulance man and the Police
   Officer.  Then they gave their piece.  In accordance with
   Popplewell the Fire Brigade told them about the emergency
   equipment, first-aid by St. John's Ambulance, and the Police
   told them about emergency evacuation procedures - full stop.

Q. Were you present when any of the Police Officers, apart from
   those who gave evidence today and yesterday, gave evidence? -
   A. No, sir.

                                                 D.J. LOCK



Q. Were you aware, although in the nature of this Inquiry it is
   important to observe matters will not be decided on what was
   put or not put, but it has not been suggested on behalf of the
   club that there was any agreement or arrangement that the
   Police had with the club concerning the stewarding of the
   terraces? - A. There was agreement, sir.

Q.   Mr. Lock, may I move on to some other matters.   The club, as
     you wrote  in your article, had the facility for monitoring by
     reason of the video cameras at various positions, and it had a
     control room? - A. That is right, sir.

Q.   Who was in control in your control room? - A. I was, sir.

Q.   You were.When you were not there   who was in control in your
     control room? - A. P.C. Guest.   It was a joint role, agreed by
     Chief Superintendent Mole.

Q. Just a moment.  Whilst you were there you were in control? -
   A. It was a joint enterprise.

Q. What was a joint enterprise? - A. If there were any questions
   asked with regard to any problems, if it was something which
   pertained purely to the club I would deal with it. If it was
   a policing enquiry such as "We have got a car parked out in
   the car park in the wrong spot.  Its number is....” then
   Harold Guest would deal with it.

Q. So are you saying when you were not there Mr. Guest would take
   over your role? - A. He did not need to take over my role.  I
   had a radio with me, and if anything was happening I could
   hear it.

Q. Were you monitoring by means of the television and the
   computer the entry of supporters, you, the club? - A . Yes,
   sir.

Q. If you were not in the control room who was doing it for
   the club? - A. I was in the control room frequently. I had   to
   go out to do my job, and Mr. Guest has enough experience and
   he has been there now with me for the last four years, to be
   aware if there was anything which needed to be done either
   through the Police control or me, to do it.

Q. In the article which you wrote which I have asked you about
   already, "Playing safe at Sheffield", pages 61-62 - there are
   two pages 61 - in the bundle, you write in relation to the
   television equipment:

          "In my control I am helped by a Police Officer and a
          television computer engineer” .

     - A. Yes.

Q. Was that a club employee, the television computer engineer? -
   A. He has a contract with the club.

Q.   Heis a club responsibility? -      A- Yes.

Q.    "Together we watchand record the entry of allsupporters” . -
     A. I am not technically capable of being able to do any of the
     repairs or anything that needs doing.

Q. Of course not, Mr. Lock. Would you look at the top right-hand
   column? - A. Which page, sir?

Q. Page 61. - A. Is it "Football's last chance” , sir?

          LORD JUSTICE TAYLOR:       "Playing safe at Sheffield", page
     61 in my bundle.

Q.         MR. WOODWARD:     Beginning at the bottom of the central
     column:

          "By careful monitoring of the digital read-out we can
          begin to close down turnstiles as we approach sector
          limits.  This facility also enables staff to warn Police
          to transfer supporters to other parts of the ground where
          accommodation is available"?

     - A . Y es.

Q.   So that would be something that the club would be doing in
     order to tell the Police and direct the Police? - A.
     Frequently.  To assist the Police in their control. Obviously
     if you have fans....

Q. In their control of what? - A. Of the people who are outside
   the ground.

Q.   Those who had not     yet entered? - A. Yes.

Q.   Did you know that there was trouble outside at the Leppings
     Lane end in April, 1989? - A. When?

Q.   At any time before     the kick-off? -A. I arrived back   inthe
     room and I saw the gate C had been opened, and I saw aPolice
     Officer on a horse having some problems closing the gate, but
     I never heard any calls for help or anything else.   I did not
     see anything happening outside there.

Q.   Let us look at the evidence a little bit. Do you
     remember round about 2 o ’clock Mr. Darling coming into
     the control room? - A. Definitely not.

Q. Are you saying he did not come? -A. No, I am saying I do n ’t
   remember him coming in.

Q. And during his visit there was observation at that time that
   there were 12,000 in the ground whilst in 1988 there had been
   about 20,000? - A. I think at 2 o'clock there was 24,000 in
   the ground.

                                                   D.J. LOCK


Q. Do you remember a discussion, Mr. Lock, at about 2 o ’clock
   time? - A. No, sir.

Q.   That the numbers were down on   1988? - A. With me?

Q.    Any discussion in thecontrol room? - A. No. I am not saying
     Mr. Darling did not come in and discuss it with somebody, but
     certainly not whilst I was there.

Q.   Your stewards have radios? - A. Some of them have.

Q . Did any of your stewards out atthe Leppings Lane end       have
    radios? - A. One of them did, Stuart Thorpe.

Q.   Would you expect Mr. Thorpe to keep you in touch with what was
     happening around the turnstiles and out at the approach to the
     turnstiles? - A. No.

Q.   Would you not want toknow that? - A.   For what reason, sir?

Q.   Would you not want to know it for any reason? - A. I can see
     on the gates them coming through.  I can’t see a reason, no.

Q . You can see on the gates - I am sorry? - A . I can see through
    my cameras what is happening at the gates.

Q. You can see from your cameras what was happening out there? -
   A. At the turnstiles, yes.

Q. If there had been any difficulties at the turnstiles would
   have expected Mr. Thorpe to bring that to your attention? - A.
   No, because he could not see them. He was in the West Stand.

Q. Would there be any means of turnstile problems, excessive
   people coming without tickets, people trying to get in without
   paying, jumping through, any means of you being told of that?
   - A . Several, sir.

Q. What? - A. First of all the Police would tell me. Secondly, I
   could see, because in our control room not only do we have the
   cumulative totalisator for the numbers coming through the
   gates but also we have an infra-red ray which runs over the
   top of the turnstiles and accounts for anybody leaping over.

Q. Were you aware of what the evidence of your turnstile
   operators is on that? - A. Subsequently.

Q. Another conversation: do you remember seeing Mr. Chapman and
   Mr. Finnegan by the tunnel, the players' entrance? - A. I saw
   Sergeant Chapman, Mr. Finnegan and Inspector Harvey once, and
   I saw Sergeant Chapman on his own once.




                           /G. Do you remember being

Q.   Well, do you remember being there at about    19 minutes/
     20- to-3? - A. I do not recall the exact time.    I would
     accept I could have been there at that time, yes.

Q. I think at a time when probably Inspector Harvey was
   in the vicinity? -A. Yes, sir.

Q.   Did you see him   there? - A. Yes.,

Q.   Do you remember having a conversation with Mr.Finnegan
     and Mr. Chapman? - A. Yes.

Q. Did you at that stage know what was the situation outside
   the Leppings Lane entrance? - A. I may well have done.

Q. Did you make any observation to the effect that it was
   all absolute hell out there? -A. I certainly did not.

Q. That did not happen; or anything like it? -A. I spoke to
   Sergeant Chapman.   I do not know whether Mr. Finnegan
   was there then.   I spoke to him after C gate.

Q. Did you observe to any Officer it was absolute hell
   out there?-A.No.

Q. Nothing like that was said by you? -A. Nothing whatsoever.

Q. If there had been absolute hell out there that would have
   been asmatter of some concern to you, would not it? - A.
   Of course.

Q.What would you have done? -A. I would have asked the Police
   what they were going to do about it.

Q. It follows from your answer to the question about whether
   or not the conversation took place that at no stage did
   you ask the Police what they were doing? - A. That is
   true, sir, because I did not know what was happening out
   there.

Q. May I ask you about another conversation? - A. Certainly,
   sir.

Q. Do you remember Police Constable Crottendon? -A. Yes.

Q. She was an Officer that you had known from some time?
   - A. Yes.

Q. Not a new face? -A. No.

Q. A reliable lady? - A. Extremely.

Q. Perhaps I could ask you this too.       Do you know M r . Chapman

           Q. Sergeant Chapman. -A. There are two Chapmans.         Do you mean
              Sergeant Chapman?

           Q. Yes. — A. Yes, I used to be his Detective Inspector when
              he worked for me at Ecclesfield.

           Q. P.C. Finnegan, did you know him of old? - A. For a long
              time.

           Q. Would you say of those three Officers they are all,
              according to your knowledge, reliable and truthful
              officers? - A. Yes, extremely.

           Q. Policewoman Crottendon, please.       - A. Yes.

           Q. She has a recollection of seeing you whilst she was on
              duty that afternoon come from inside the directors'
              suite and that you appeared to be agitated.  Do you
              remember having a conversation with her some time
              between 2.30 and 2.45 p.m? -A. Yes.

           Q. What did you talk to her about? - A. C gate had been
              breached for the first time and I have explained already
              how I wasf securing the gates with additional stewards.
              I went down to the directors' suite.           The doors are
              glass doors.           There were two young stewards on duty
              there, greeting people and handing out programmes
              and Miss Crottendon was outside.           I went outside and I
              told her that there had been an entry at C gate and that
              I was concerned that some of the fans may come down and
              try to gain entry at either the p l a y e r s ' entrance or
              the d i r e c t o r s ' entrance and if there were any problems
              for her own safety that she should           step inside and
              close the door.

           Q.   May I put to you her recollection of the conversation
                you had, the comment you made to her relating to thepi
                large number of fans still outside the ground? - A.
                There were a large number of fans still outside the
                ground.  I had seen that.  Notwithstanding the gate
                had been breached, there were still people outside
                the ground.

           Q. Did you pass a comment abotifcg thatec to Miss Crottendon?
              - A.,What? That there was a large number outside?

           Q. Yes. - A. I might have done.

           Q.    That there may be difficulty getting them all     in?
                - A. I certainly did not say that.

           Q. So she is wrong about that,      is she? - A. Yes.

Q.    Do you know Mr. Cannon? - A. No.

Q.    The Company Director of All Sports   (U.K.)   Limited? - A.
     No, sir.

Q.    It would be right to say that the only person you
     observed in the vicinity of the tunnel in a blazer
     was Mr. Kirton? - A. Yes.

Q. You do recall talking to Mr. Kirton, do you .... - A. No.

Q         in the vicinity of the tunnel? - A. Never spoke to
     the man.

Q. Do you recall SfSeimggMr. Mackrell at the vicinity of
   the players' entrance? - A. Yes.

Q. In company with Mr. Kirton? - A. I think they were
   talking, yes.

Q. Do you recall being there at about 20-to-3 and a con­
   versation along these lines taking place, a ground
   official saying, "I think we sill have between fifteen
   and twenty thousand people outside the ground'*? - A. I
   know nothing of that conversation.  It certainly was not
   me.

Q.Do you recall MM. Kirton saying anything about        the kick-
   off being delayed? - A. Nothing at all.

Q. Do you recall Mr. Mackrell saying anything about the
   kick-off being delayed? - A. I never spoke to Mr. Mackrell
   and Mr. Kirton, together.

Q. Do you recall at the players' tunnel entrance any con­
   versation with Mr. Mackrell concerning delay of the kick-
   off? - A. No.

Q.   Do you say no such conversation took place? - A. Yes.

Q.    Had the thought of delaying the kick-off crossed your
     mind? - A. Not until the gate opened for the first time
     at C and then I was too busy to be able to do anything
     about it.

Q.    You asked Mr. Mackrell to go off, did not you, or    he
     volunteered? - A. Yes, he volunteered.

Q. What did you want him to do or expect him to do? - A. I
   expected him to go to the gate and see whether or not
   it had been breached, i.e., was it broken or whether it
   had been opened  for a reason - I later found out it had -
   and to see what  had happened and to speak to the Police.

You wanted him to go to the scene and           .... - A. Yes.

And ascertain by actually going to the spot, no second­
hand stuff, what was happenings there? - A. Yes.  I was
going to do that but he said, "I'll go.   Leave it with me.

Did he go off in that direction? - A. Yes.

Did he appear to understand what you expected of him?
Did you make plain what you wanted? - A. He understood
what I was talking about.

Did you see him again after that? - A. Not until after
the disaster.

After the disaster? -A. Yes.

Where did you next see him? - A. In the directors' room
when the F.A. and the club directors were having a
meeting.

Would you have a look at your statement, Mr. Lock, page
15? - A. Yes, sir.

Now, we have two copies.   Have you got the Police one?

had not started."  Is that your recollection? - A. Yes,

              the gates"? - A. Yes,   sir.

         Q. You then ran back through the players'     tunnel, did you?
            - A. Yes.

         Q. Shouting as you ran into your personal radio calling
            upon the chief steward? - ;A. Yes.

         Q. You told them, did you,     that the Police had opened the
            gates? - A. Yes.

         Q.   So at that time Mr. Mackrell and M r . Kirton, ifthey had
              been listening, would have heard from you that the gates
              had btein opened by the Police? - A. Yes, sir.

         Q. You had no doubt about it at that time, did you?- A. None
            whatsoever.

         Q.   Your information was clear? - A. Yes.

         Q.   This would be the second opening of the gate? -     A. That
              is true.

         Q.   So when Mr. Mackrell and Mr. Kirton go off    to the   Police
              control room they have got your account of    what had
              happened? - A. Yes.

         Q. When you told them that the Police had opened the gates
            do you recall Mr. Mackrell saying can we get them in?
            - A. I do, sir.

         Q. What did you say? -A. I said yes, we could.

         Q. At that time was there any thought on yottsn part of delaying
            the kick-off? -A. I did not know whether - there was no
            thought on my part of delaying the kick-off.

         Q. Is what you are saying this?  No thought on your part at
            that time.  Well* do you mean oil your part of you delaying
            the kick-off or the kick-off being delayed? -A. Of me
            delaying the kick-off.

         Q. Did the thought of the kickfoff being delayed cross your
            mind? - A. The time had passed for that, sir.  They were
            in.

         Q.        LORD JUSTICE TAYLOR:   Pardon? - A. The crowd were
              in, sir.  When I saw Mr. Mackrell the second time and

     said the Police have opened the gates the crowd were in
     the ground.

Q.        MR. WOODWARD:    Did the thought of the kick-off
     being delayed occur; to you? - A. Then?

Q. At any time. -A. Yes.

Q. When? - A. The first time the gate went.

Q. What did you do about it? - A. Nothing.

Q. Well, why not? - A. Because I had not the opportunity.

Q. You had a radio? - A. I have already stated I tried to
   reach'Police Control and I could not get through.

Q. What were you going to say if you had got through? - A;
   I was going to say - I do not know what I was going to
   say precisely.  It was going to be something, what are
   we going to do about delaying the kick-off?  Are we
   going to delay the kick-off?  It was not my decision.
   I could have made the suggestion.

Q. So round about the time of the       gate having been open
   the first time y o u d i d have in   your mind the question
   of the kick-off being delayed?       -A. I think I answered
   your friend down here, sir, to       that effect.

Q. Well, did you have a telephone line in your control box?
   -A. I left the control.  I said the reason why I was
   unable to do anything was I left the control to secure
   the doors, to see where the vacancies were on the pitch,
   to call at C gate, to see the Police, to call in the
   Police.

Q. Asking for hydraulic equipment, cutting equipment to
   cut fence.

           LORD JUSTICE TAYLOR:     Which transcript are you looking
     at?

          MR. MULLER:   It is the transcript of the VHF channel 1
     tape which we were supplied with, at page 16.
           MR. PHILLIPS:   It is SA/1.

©•        MR. MULLER: As you say, a very precise message giving
     very precise information, just the sort of thing you are
     supposed to do? - A. Yes.

Q. And the kind of thing one could expect a Police officer to do?
   - A. Yes.

Q. That is acknowledgd in the incident room by these words,
   "Roger, Fire Brigade. Urgent, up to Leppings Lane. Roger"? -
   A. Yes, sir.

Q. That is obviously a reply by obviously somebody in the
   incident room. All I want to ask you about is as far as the
   VHF is concerned am i right in understanding that everybody in
   the incident room can hear it?   It is not when somebody has
   got earphones on or anything like that? - A. It all depends.
   If the radio operator can have it playing on an ear set where
   he listens, I can be plugged in and so I can also hear it.
   Anybody else in the room may not necessarily hear it.

Q. Otherwise if it is not plugged in particularly then everybody
   can hear it? - A. Yes, sir.

Q. As far as you are concerned do you remember that message
   coming in? - A. no, sir.

Q.   Do I take it from that therefore it was notyou who said,
     "Roger. Fire Brigade. Urgent, up to Leppings Lane"? - A. No,
     at that time I was not on the radio.

Q. We have not been able to get hold of the Chief Inspector
   Edmundson unfortunately, but can I ask you this? What he
   says, at that time he was in the incident room when ground
   control requested the Fire Service attend at Hillsborough with
   cutting equipment. What I want help about, as you understand
   what he says there, does that mean he is overhearing or does
   it mean he is the one who is hearing that message and giving
   that reply, saying, "Roger. Fire Brigade. Urgent. Up to
   Leppings Lane"? - A. No, sir, he would not give that reply.
   That would be the radio operator, and i would suggest it would
   be P.C. Jones, the only other person in the room.

Q.   The position would be if what Mr. Edmundson says isright that
     he has obviously overheard it? - A. yes.

Q. So it must have been on some sort of mode which enabled

            everybody in the room to hear? - A . Yes.

       Q. But you presumably did not hear it because you were otherwise
          engaged? - A. Correct.

                          Cross-Examined bv MR. KALLIPETIS:

       Q.   Mr. Waugh, would the mode be arepeater set? -     A. A small
            radio on channel 25, y e s.

       Q. Is that a small loudspeaker which allows everybody to listen
          to messages coming through? - A. It is a small radio, but I
          believe it is temporarily connected to a loudspeaker, and that
          is the trouble. You can either have it on loud or low.

       Q. It was because of trouble at the ground radio that Snig Hill
          were asked to monitor channel 25 until they got the problem
          sorted out? - A. Yes, sir.

       Q. Mr. Waugh, the call you made to the ground asking them if they
          wanted any ambulances off your own bat was unusual, was not ,
          it? - A. Looking back, sir, yes.

       Q.   No criticism at all.   In fact Ithink probably something that
            should have been done earlier. We shall see. You may that
            call within seconds of you hearing the repeated calls for
            somebody to open a gate? - A . Correct.

       Q. You also heard crowd noises? - A. Correct.

       Q. Were they to this effect:  "Help.  I'm hurt.  I'm being
          crushed"? - A. I never heard any words, sir, no direct words.

       Q. Were the words you heard the Officer say something to this
          effect, "Come and open these gates. People are dying in
          here"? - A. To that effect, sir, yes.

                 MR. KALLIPETIS:   Sir, those words were spoken by Mr.
            Smith, transcript Day 17 page 114.

                  THE WITNESS:  The Officer that I heard speak words
            similar to that was the one that had been on the radio making
            several requests. At that time I didn't know the Officer's
            name.

       Q.        MR. KALLIPETIS:   It was not until a few days ago you
            were asked to make a statement about these matters? - A. Yes.

       Q. And we have the advantage of having various other bits of
          evidence like tape recordings, videos and photographs, and we
          can pin point almost exactly what happened and when.

                  LORD JUSTICE TAYLOR:   I am sorry, you referred to Day
            17.   That is Police Constable Smith at the track.

                  MR. KALLIPETIS:   At gate 3.

          LORD JUSTICE TAYLOR:     Yes, but where do you get your
     quote from?

          MR. KALLIPETIS:   Transcript 17, page 115.

          LORD JUSTICE TAYLOR:     That is what he said?

          MR. KALLIPETIS:    That is what he said.    He grabbed his
     radio and he said that.

          LORD JUSTICE TAYLOR:   That is not recorded anywhere on
     any of these transcripts, is it?

          MR. KALLIPETIS:   No, sir. Bear with me, sir?         The
     other words I put, sir, were....

          LORD JUSTICE TAYLOR:     "Come and open these gates".

          MR. KALLIPETIS:   Yes.  "People are dying in here". That
     is what Mr. Smith said. The other words, "Help, I am hurt and
     being crushed". Those were given in evidence by Mr.
     Illingworth on gate 4, and you will find that in transcript 17
     pages 134 and 135. Those two events occurred at about after
     14.50, because it was 14.50 that they returned to their posts
     respectively by gates 3 and 4.

          LORD JUSTICE TAYLOR:     Relieving Mr. Helliwell.

Q.        MR. KALLIPETIS:   Mr. Waugh, the time that you actually
     telephoned the ground off your own bat and said, "Do you want
     any ambulances?", is in fact just before 3 o'clock, about
     14.59 and 30 seconds. That is page 8 of SA/1. It is the
     recording we got from the Police.  - A. If you say so.

Q. There is no trick about this.      I am trying to help you about
   the times.

          MR. KALLIPETIS:   Sir, would it assist if I gave a list
     of the times and the source of where they come from, and then
     one can see exactly where this call fits in in context? At
     14.51, and this is on Snig Hill 4, which is SA/22, you will
     see at 11 minutes 50 seconds, just about 12 minutes into the
     tape, this recording was done as an addition to the first
     transcript of the Snig Hill tape when it was picking up voices
     in the background. What is heard is in the background is
     this:

          "Letting anybody through."
          "It's bloody chaos at Leppings Lane because thousands
          can't get in, they've just broken gates down and
          Superintendent Marshall's screaming for them to open the
          inner gates and to let people in and Murray's (saying)
          in control, we've got to monitor tickets, if we get
          Liverpool mixed up with Notts Forest, they're going to
          have trouble even if we get a serious problem.".

     That is 14.52, because we have the times on the other
                              116


                                                   B. WAUGH


     transcript of this tape, and that corresponds with 12 minutes
     into the tape.

          THE WITNESS:   Can I say, sir, this radio transmission
     has nothing to do with my sphere. There is nothing I could
     hear on that.

          MR. KALLIPETIS:      Bear with me, Mr. Waugh.  It is just
     that I want to get these times in. At 14.52 we know gate C
     was opened for the second time. That is the video RJ 82. At
     14.57 gate C is closed, the area has been clear, and that is
     on two videos. At 14.50 PC. Smith and P.C. Illingworth return
     to their positions at gates 3 and 4. They broadcast on their
     radios messages to the effect people are being crushed, people
     are dying, the gates should be opened, and they give evidence
     of crowds shouting, ’’I ’m hurt.  I ’m crushed. Open the gate” .
     At 14.59 we know from the photograph that the Liverpool Echo
     took that gates 3 and 4 were open:

Q. That is when you make your call to the ground asking, ”Do you
   want any ambulances yet?”? - A. Correct, sir.

          MR. KALLIPETIS:    I suggest, sir, what this Officer heard
     which prompted his ’phone call to the ground asking if they
     wanted ambulances was in fact the calls from Saiith and
     Illingworth on their radios and the cries they heard from the
     people in pens 3 and 4.

          LORD JUSTICE TAYLOR:   You have   given us an interesting
     chronology which I would be grateful   if you would put it on
     paper, but so far as this witness is   concerned I think he said
     he never heard the "Help, I'm hurt",   but he did hear:

Q. Is this right, you did hear, "Come and open these gates,
   people are dying in here"? - A. Words to that effect.  I don't
   think it was those words exactly.

Q. I think what counsel is trying to get at as I understand
   i t .... - A . The remarks the counsel said about the other
   Officers, I never heard those transmissions at all.

Q. You did not hear either of these transmissions? - A. No.

Q. I think what counsel is trying to do is to establish a link to
   explain your prescience in asking if anybody wanted
   any ambulances. Had you heard anything suggesting
   injuries before you said that? - A. No, sir.  It was
   just a general build up of noise from the crowd, the
   assistance of the Officer requesting gates to be
   opened.  It was mentioned in the room I was in, "We
   could have some trouble there". I then contacted
   ground control to see if they needed ambulances.  That
   is the only reason, sir.

Q.        MR. KALLIPETIS:   In your statement you say:

          "Each time he asked he was more insistent and he stated
TS   .
                                         117


                                                             B. WAUGH


                   finally that the gate had to be opened or else people
                   would be fatally injured"?

              - A. That is right, sir.     That was the saae Officer that had
              been on throughout.

         Q. You also go on to say:

                   "The sounds of the crowd seemed to suggest this as well".

              which is why I put the words I did to you at the very
              beginning of the cross-examination? - A. I could not hear any
              words from the crowd at all.

         Q. No, the sounds of the crowd "seemed to suggest this as well",
            is what your statement says? - A. That is right.

         Q.        LORD JUSTICE TAYLOR:   What have you in mind when you
              said, "The sounds of the crowd seemed to suggest this as
              well"? Not just general crowd noise does that mean, or does it
              sound like people in distress or what? - A. No, it was just
              general crowd noise, sir, no distress at all. There were no
              sounds of crying, shouting or that type.  It was just normal
              crowd and increasing crowd noise.

                   MR. KALLIPETIS:   Sir, I will stand by his first answer,
              if I may, when he agreed he did hear something to the effect
              of the words I put to him.

                   THE WITNESS:   I heard one Officer who asked for the
              gates to be opened saying, "Please open the gates.  Injuries
              may be a result".  That is it.

         Q.        MR. KALLIPETIS:   Mr. Waugh, you are doing your best with
              your recollection, but we have evidence which can't be
              controverted as to times those things were done. The 'phone
              call you make to ambulance control - exhibit 128 track 9 page
              4 - and this Mr. Waugh is 15.08, and this is the second call
              to the ambulance control, but you were not aware of that
              obviously? - A. That is correct.

         Q. You say here: "Ambulance ---       Leppings Lane end, Leppings Lane
            end". - A. I see that.

         Q. And then "A big fleet of ambulances, immediately as many as
            you've got love". She says, "Theres one on its way". You
            say, "We want more than one".  - A. That is negative, sir.
            This is not my conversation to the ambulance.

         Q. Mr. Waugh, I think it must be your conversation because the
            other one is Mr. Rook? - A. No, sir.

         Q. Turn back to page 1 of that transcript.   Do   you see that,
            15.06.  "Hello ambulance ;yes is one of your supervisors there
            please my love".  Is that your call? - A. No, sir.

         Q. Just follow this through so you can be certain about it.       That
                           118


                                               B. WAUGH


  call goes on purely advising the ambulance there may be a need
  for ambulances, although the Police were not requiring one,
  but just giving them advance notice; If you turn over to page
  3, this is still the same call. You will see just at the top
  there, after "(delay)” and then "Hello".   ?'Hello". "We are
  requesting a fleet of ambulances".    I can tell you as well,
  Mr. Waugh, that from the other recording we have the request
  from the ground through to Snig, Hill asking for a fleet of
  ambulances occurred at exactly that time, namely at 15.07 and
  50 seconds. That call came through while this telephone call
  was going on. Do you see? - A. Yes.

Q. That is not your call? - A. No, sir.

Q. And at the end of that call, page 4, you will see there the
   Officer who is making the call is asking to whom he is
   speaking, and it is Superintendent Clark. Do you see that? -
   A. Yes, sir.

Q. Then there comes the second call to ambulance headquarters
   which I suggest is the one that you made secondary to the one
   you had made to the ground, and there you are merely asking
   for a fleet of ambulances and you are told that one is on its
   way and that there are Officers in the vicinity that can
   assess it for SYMAS. Do you see that at the top of page 5? -
   A. Yes.

Q. To complete the picture the only other call that was received
   from Snig Hill to the ambulance headquarters is on track No.
   11 at 15.10 when the caller asks for Superintendent Clark by
   name.

        LORD JUSTICE TAYLOR:   I am completely lost. I have got
   a whole sheaf of different transcripts. Very few of them have
   a heading saying who they are from or two.

        MR. KALLIPETIS:   Sir, I did ask all these transcripts be
   numbered in a particular way, namely SYMAS 1, SYMAS 2 and Snig
   Hill 1, 2, 3 and 4, to avoid this sort of confusion.  I will
   have it all clear for you in writing so you can follow it.
   You will see, sir, at 15.10, track 11, there is another call
   from Force control to ambulance headquarters, and this caller
   from Snig Hill is asking for Superintendent Clark by name:

Q. Do you see? - A. Yes.

Q. It goes on to the following page, track No. 10, where
   Superintendent Clark takes on the call.  In that that is the
   same Officer who had made the earlier 'phone call to SYMAS
   Headquarters.  There are only three telephone calls, two of
   them made by the same Officer from Snig Hill, and one, I
   suggest, Mr. Waugh, if you 'phoned SYMAS, is the one I put to
   your earlier, namely the one that appears on page 4 of track
   9. - A. I certainly made one call, and i asked for a fleet of
   ambulances.

Q. That is the call there at 15.08. - A. I can't dispute the
T77
                                      119


                                                            B. WAUGH


           time.

      Q.   What you were told, the point I was making, is that an
           ambulance had already been despatched to the ground and that
           Officers were in the ground from SYMAS who were going to
           assess the situation? - A. I was not informed that, sir, no.

      Q.   The tape recording, if youlisten to it, may well reveal     it is
           your voice. We won't bother with that.

                MR. KALLIPETIS:   Sir, I will have typed out for you this
           chronology with cross-references.  It will be my submission
           that this Officer could not have made the call at 14.59
           pursuant to what he might have heard Mr. Marshall saying
           outside because there is a time lapse of 8 minutes between
           gate C being opened and the 14.59 call that he makes:

      Q. Would you be kind enough to look at Chief Inspector
         Edmundson's statement.  I will read the sentence I want. Page
         2. He was talking about ground control fixing their radio:

                   "After that time it was much improved, back to the good
                   reception we had had earlier that day. This would be
                   about 2.40 and after that the reception was clear".

           Would you agree with that? - A. Yes, sir.

                LORD JUSTICE TAYLOR:   Before you sit down, Mr.
           Kallipetis, in two sentences can you tell me what you get out
           of all this?

                MR. KALLIPETIS:   Yes, sir, that the 'phone call this
           Officer makes if as I submit it is abundantly clear it was
           made as a result of radio messages from Officers on the
           perimeter fence, the question mark will then arise why was not
           that message picked up and appreciated in ground control in
           the ground itself, and why were not the ambulance called at
           14.59 instead of the 15.08, bearing in mind as we have heard
           the importance of 8 minutes to those people who were crushed.

                             Re-Examined by MR. PHILLIPS:

      Q. Mr. Waugh, in your statement you say that you heard a
         supervisory Officer that you did not know talking to Sergeant
         Goddard, saying that he had a large crowd outside the Leppings
         Lane end of the ground? - A. That is correct

      Q.   How did you know he was a supervisory Officer? - A. The manner
           in which he was speaking, sir.

      Q.   Did he give a call sign or an indication by name of who he
           was? - A. No, sir.

      Q. Do you think it could have been a Constable on the perimeter
         track? - A. No, sir. Within several minutes I identified the
         Officer.  I was told who it was.

    Q. Did you hear anything said about outside Lappings Lane when
       you overheard these messages? - A. Yes, that was the reason
       for the gate to be opened, he had a large crowd building up

                                                          B.   W AUG H


     Q. Are you sure he said outside the Leppings Lane end of
        the ground? - A. As far as I recollect, sir, yes.

     Q. Because you continued, you say, to hear the same Officer.
        Now, are you sure it was the same Officer that you had
        heard speaking about what was going on outside Leppings
        Lane? -A. I took it as the same Officer, sir, yes.

     Q. Well, have you any doubts whether it was the same
        Officer? -A. No doubts personally, sir, no.  To me
        it was the same Officer.

     Q. And again when you heard this Officer again was there
        any reference to Leppings Lane?-A. Not that I can rem­
        ember, sir.

     Q.* L e t me just put to you what is in your statement, Mr.
         Waugh, and ask you how it came to be there if that is
         the case.     Your statement says, "I heard the same
         Supervisory Officer ask several times for a gate to be
         opened at Leppings Lane."     How does that come to be in
        your statement? - A. That is what I heard then, sir.
        That is certainly what I heard.      The Officer asked several
         times for a gate - Leppings Lane         - I do not know
         the ground myself.     I took it from the Officer who said
         i t .„

     Q. Have you a clear recollection at all of this Officer             i
        talking about Leppings Lane? - A. Yes, sir.

     Q. You see, I notice your statement is made on the 27th
        of June of this year. - A. That is correct.

     Q. Wljich is not sovery long ago. -A.    N6, sir.

     Q. When you made the statement did you have this recollection?
        - A. Yes, sir.  I remember the conversation between the
        Officer and the ground control.

     Q. Was there any appreciable delay between yourhhearing this
        Officer asking for these gates to be opened and your
        ringing ground control or speaking to ground control?
        - A. No, sir, no appreciable delay.  Minutes, a few minutes.

     Q. Minutes.   That is enough. - A. Well, a minute.

             MR. PHILLIPS:    Yes.    Thank you, Mr. Waugh.

              ME. WOODWARD:   Sir, I hesitate to endeavour to
        contribute anything at this stage to the analysis of
        the transcripts because I am reminded there were other
        people using radios and there was, I think, evidence
        by Mr. Higgins concerning opening another gate, sir,
        so it may be appropriate at this stage I rise to say
        this.   I did not cross-examine this witness because one
<>
                               122




     would have to look at the evidence before one could
     really make an assessment.  I have not gone nearly
     as far as Mr. Kallipetis has done bQliatheteeara>!
     witnesses who used radios and spoke of opening gates
     and ....

          LORD JUSTICE TAYLOR:   Yes, but I think the only
     one who made repeated requests we know of was Mr. Marshall.
     I think Sergeant Higgins came through on one occasion
     saying if you do not open it it is going to be broken
     down any way if I am not mistaken.  Any way .... Thank you.

          M R . ,GOLDSACK:   That is the evidence currently
     available.

           LORD JUSTICE TAYLOR:       Thank you very much.

          MR. WOODWARD:   Sir, I have indicated to Counsel
     for the Inquiry that I was intending to rise at this
     stage, sir, to draw your attention to the video.
     Sir, I say that with some trepidation having regard
     to what was said right at the beginning of this Inquiry
     concerning looking at the video.  May I just say this?
     We would submit that some specific and careful con­
     sideration may be given to and usefully repaid by
     looking at one of the BBC videos at a particular time, sir.

          LORD JUSTICE TAYLOR:       Yes.

          MR. WOODWARD:   It is BBC television tape 1 to 9 and
     it is in relation to the period of time 14.45 or there­
     abouts to 14.51.

          LORD JUSTICE TAYLOR:       Outside Leppings Lane?

          MR. WOODWARD:   No, not outside Leppings Lane, sir.
     It is in relation to the barrier in pen 3 which collapsed.
     There appears to be upon one analysis of that evidence
     an indication that it may have collapsed at a time before
     Gate C was opened and is not to be related to any surge
     coming down through the tunnel into pen 3.  Sir, one has
     to look at it a number of times.  We have not ....

          LORD   JUSTICE  TAYLOR:   Well, I will look at it
     again.  I   have looked at it but I will look at it again.

          MR. W O 0 B W A R D : There is a gentleman in a white
     shirt on the barrier and there is a chap with a brown
     shirt or a suede jacket who is holding his hand up
     and helping him and iff one analyses and looks at what
     they are doing it may give some clue as to when the
     barrier failed.

          LORD   JUSTICE TAYLOR: Yes, thank you.  Yes.        Nothing
     else that   anybody wants to say at this stage?
VAi                          123




           MR. WOODWARD:   I apologise for rising again, sir.
      In relation to Mr. Lock's evidence a number of matters
      were raised which had not been put,- sir, I do not com­
      plain they were not put - upon which we wish to take
      instructions, for example, from Mr. Chapman.   We will
      do that and, sir, may we reserve the |>psition in relation
      to it concerning the agreement in quotes the club is
      supposed to have had with the Police.

           LORD JUSTICE TAYLOR:   Yes, sfocourse.  Now, that
      concludes the evidence that is presently available
      and intended to be called.   What I propose to do now
      is to adjourn this hearing.   I have already indicated
      to Counsel I would expect their final submissions would
      be in writing and the timetable that I propose is that
      the submissions in writing should be with the Secretary
      to the Inquiry by 10 o(clock a week tomorrow and I
      will then read them, the Assessors will also have copies
      and will be able to read them and I then propose that
      we come back here for brief oral submissions on the
      14thj Friday, the 14th.   That is a week after the
      written submissions are delivered.   I would propose
      that we would sit that day at 10.30 and, without going
      to American extent of precision, I would expect that
      Counsel for the Inquiry would complete all he wants
      to say that day in an hour and each of the represented
      parties in something of the order of half-an-hour by
      way of supplement to what is in the written submissions
      because the written submissions may be made available
      to the Press as in effect the submissions which would
      otherwise have been delivered orally so that the Press
      will have the opportunity of having both the written
      submissions and hearing the oral perorations   or
      supplements or further points.   Now, so far as any
      further evidence is concerned the door is not closed
      but I would suggest that if it is proposed, and I
      really do mean this, that some evidence which is
      of really essential relevance to the Inquiry is
      going to be asked to be called notice of that be
      given at earliest not on Friday, the 14th, when we
      arrive here or anything of that sort because it may
      be, subject to what it is, if it arises at all, and
      what the length of it is that we might have to alter
      this arrangement because I only envisage the 14th
      will be a one day hearing.   If there is going to be
      any evidencesas well it might have to be rather longer
      than that but I am hoping that there won't be any
      further evidence Unless,as I say, it is essential
      to the Inquiry, so I hope that makes the position clear.
      Are there any questions?

           MR. GIBSON-WATT:   Yes, sir, I have one question.
      Is it envisaged that we should each see the written
      submissions of the other parties a n d ? if so, do you
      intend to lay down a timetable by which we should
      receive them by way of exshange?
S T ^

             LORD JUSTICE TAYLOR:    Well, I think it probably
        would be best if at the   same time as the submission
        is delivered to the Secretary be delivered to each
        of the other parties.

             MR. GIBSON-WATT:      I am grateful,     sir.

                 LORD JUSTICE TAYLOR:     I really fixed the deadline
        of 10 o'clock a week on Friday because I would hope to
        have them to read over the weekend and it may be that
        the eagerness of the other represented parties to read
        t h e m o v e r that weekend may not be so intense but certainly
        I think they should be got to them in time for them to
        have read them before they come to make their oral
        submissio ns.

             MR. GIBSON-WATT:   Sir, what I have in mind is this.
        I do not necessarily speak for myself and my leader but I
        know possibly one or two other Counsel may have this in
        mind that having read the written submissions they might
        or might not feel it necessary to make oral submissions
        at all.  That obviously would shorten matters.  There
        are obviously one or two ....

             LORD JUSTICE TAYLOR:   There would be no adverse
        inferencedrawn from an absence of final j o e -s I submission.

             MR. GIBSON-WATT:   No, but the point, sir, of course
        is that one could not do that unless one was sure from
        other parties' written submissions that there was no
        adverse reflection on ones client.

             LORD JUSTICE IAX10R:   Certainly.  Quite.  Well, I
        have fiked a deadline for the submissions so far as the
        Inquiry is concerned and I think that they should at
        least be got to the other parties by Tuesday of the
        following week at latest.

             MR. GIBSON-WATT:     Thank you,   sir.

             LORD JUSTICE TAYLOR:    That is merely a copying and
        posting exercise once they have been prepared for the
        Inquiry obviously.

              MR. GLASGOW:   Sir, might I make one suggestion or
        request if it does not disturb your timetable at all and
        if it does then of course we will abide by your ruling
        but having regard to the fact that there are nine,
        subject to what has been said, nine speeches in all, ten
        including the Counsel to the Tribunal and, therefore, on
        atiy yiew a full day's work for that Friday and a risk,
        albeit a small one, that somebody may want to call some
        live evidence, I (wonder if you would consider advancing
        the timetable for those submissions by just 24 hours

       because if we sit on Friday, even if all goes well, we
       only just finish by that Friday afternoon.

            LORD JUSTICE TAYLOR:    Well, the trouble with
       any other day that xveek excepting the Monday which
       I think is probably too soon is that there are other
       complications.  There are rail strike complications/
       There are difficulties with getting all three of us
       together.

            MR. G1ASG0W:       I say no more.

            LORD JUSTICE TAYLOR:          There are difficulties of
       Counsel as well, I think.

            MR. GLASGOW:   Sir, it was only the risk of going
       on to the Monday.  It does of course add enormous
       difficulties and strains elsewhere.

            LORD JUSTICE TAYLOR:   I appreciate that,         I
       thought you were going to say 10 o'clock.

            MR. GLASGOW:      Or earlier, sir.  Perbapp does it
       help at a l l .to even suggest if the rail strike is a
       difficulty at noon on the previous day, on the Thursday
       afternoon, even to get an hour in on the afternoon so
       that there is no risk of us going over that weekend.
       It is a genuine concern of going over that weekend.
       If that is not possible ....

             LORD JUSTICE TAYLOR:        Not possible.

            MR. GLASGOW:       So be it.

            LORD JUSTICE T M I i D R :   I think p&ehaps we had better
       say 10 o'clock.

             MR. GLASGOW:      Thank you at least for that.

            MR. HYTNER:   May I therefore make another suggestion,
       sir? With written submissions I would have thought 20
       minutes each was ample for oral  submissions.

               LORD JUSTICE I M L O R : Does everybody agree with that,
       they won't wish to resile from it later?       I think in that
       case probably better leave it 10 o'clock.       It is just
       that some people may be coming up that morning.       We
       will leave it at 10 o'clock.       If there is any amendment
       to that I will let you know.       If there are indications,
       for example, during that week that there is not going
       to be any further evidence and it may be even that
       somebody is so convinced by the effect of his own
       drafting that he does not think he can improve on
       it orally we might be able to make it 10.30.       We will
       s e e ......

                                         / Thank you all

DCC                     FINAL SUBMISSION TO THE HILLSBOROUGH INQUIRY
ACC (Ops)
ACC (S S )                    ON BEHALF OF TREASURY COUNSEL




It is thought inappropriate to provide a precis of this submission as its 36
pages would reward careful reading.

There are aspects of the submission which might be a little unpalatable but,
in the main, most criticisms of police actions, made by Mr Collins, cannot
easily be dismissed on the basis of the evidence which has been heard.  This
submission could well represent a 'preview' of Lord Justice Taylor's
preliminary findings.

There are individual statements which are not accepted, they are set out below
and will be communicated to Messrs. Woodward and Metcalf.

p . 3 para    1   "The fault (for insufficiently expeditious rescue) lay in a
                   lack of ...... leadership (amongst other things)."

On the contrary, Supt Greenwood gave very forceful evidence of the system of
rescue he adopted at an early stage, and the manner in which it was executed.
(Transcript day 12 p40-42).

A similar response may  be levelled at the comment at p . 32 para 7 "The picture
was one of chaos .... until Chief Superintendent Nesbit arrived".

p . 12 para   2   "It is futile for the police to suggest that the club .... were
                   responsible for the safety of the fans on the terrace".

It may be arguable (given the evidence) but not futile.       Our arguments for the
responsibility lying with the club are well rehearsed.

p . 16 para   3   "... Many died elsewhere (than around the failed   barrier) in
                   pens 3 + 4".

We "have not heard this  in evidence before the Inquiry and the South Yorkshire
Police contention is that the vast majority died as a result of the barrier
failing.

p.21 para     1   "... -We suspect that in many cases an indication by a police
                  officer to a ticketless fan to go away would suffice".

Our experience would suggest otherwise!

It is also worth drawing attention to a statement made by Mr Collins, apropos
the SYMAS submission.

p . 3^ para 11 "... we doubt that any delays in seeking medical aid and a
sufficiency of ambulances made any real difference (to the deaths which
occurred)."

                                           FINAL OBSERVATIONS




I. I N T R O D U C T I O N
1.           A large n u m b e r of w i t n e s s e s and a great deal of e v i d e n c e has

been he a rd in the c o u r s e o f the 31 days duri ng which the i n q u i r y has

been sitting.                We do not p r o p os e in these o b s er va t io ns to go into

detafil or se e k to r e s o l v e issues of m i n o r importance.                        We will give

our views on the m a j o r issues and seek to indicate w h a t in o u r opin io n

are the i m p o r t a n t f i n d i n g s of fact w h i c h the Tribunal ought to make.

We do not c o n c e i v e it to be our t a s k to invite the                           Tribunal to

a p p o r t i o n blame, but we r e c o g n i s e that is inevitable that c r i t i c i s m s

will be m a d e in the c o u r s e of d e c i d i n g w h a t happened and why.                      We

shall not s h r i n k f r o m m a k i n g such cr it i c i s m s as we c o n s i d e r

ap pr o priate.



2.           In d e c i d i n g w h a t happened, we have been g r e a t l y a s s i s t e d by

the video and p h o t o g r a p h i c records', all of wh i ch have been f r e e l y made

a v a i l a b l e by t h e i r owners.          We should like also to place on r e c o r d our

g r a t i t u d e to the i n t e r e s t e d par ti e s for their c o - o p e r a t i o n in

p r o d u c i n g r e l e v a n t d o c u m e n t s and w i t n e s s e s and to the Wes t M i d l a n d s

P olice for t h e i r i m m e n s e effor t in inte rv ie wi n g w it n e s s e s and

c o l l e c t i n g the n e c e s s a r y e v i de nc e and in p r o d uc i ng for us, o f t e n at

v er y s hort notice, e x c e e d i n g l y helpful reports and su m ma ri e s o f t h e i r

e nquiries.         W i t h o u t that a s s i s t a n c e and c o -o pe r at io n o ur t a s k w o u l d

have been i m p os s ib le .           As it is, we are co ns cious that we have

c o m p l e t e d this st a ge of the inqu i ry w it h in 3 months of the o c c u r r e n c e

of the d i s a s t e r and that m a n y w i t n e s s e s who were at the g r o u n d and who
c o u l d have g i v e n r e l e v a n t evi de nc e have not been called.                  We have

t a k e n the g r e a t e s t p o s s i b l e care to try to call a r e p r e s e n t a t i v e cross

s e c t i o n of w i t n e s s e s and to e n sure that no serious issue has been left

u n i n v e s t i g a t e d or u n c o v e r e d . b y evidence.    We are s a t i s f i e d that we

h av e s u c c e e d e d in t h i s ’o bj ec t i v e and th at s u f f i c i e n t e v i d e n c e has been

c a l l e d b e f o r e the Tri bu na l to enable it to reach p r o p e r and acc u ra te

f in dings.          All p a r t i e s r e p r e s e n t e d have had the o p p o r t u n i t y to

n o m i n a t e w i t n e s s e s w h o m they c o n s i d e r e d w e r e able to g i v e useful

e v i d e n c e and w e have, so far as possible, t r i ed to a c c o m m o d a t e them.

We c o n f i d e n t l y b e l i e v e that there are and can be no c o m p l a i n t s that

any r e l e v a n t w i t n e s s , who could add to the accou n t g i v e n by others,

has been o v e r l o o k e d or that any evi d en ce has been o m i t t e d w h i c h

a f f e c t s any m a t e r ia l findi n g of fact.



3.            In o p e ni n g this inquiry on 15th May, there w e r e set out w h a t

th e i n d i c a t i o n s w e r e at that stage of the se q ue n c e of events.                     After

31 da y s of e vi d e n c e , it is not n e c e s s a r y to chan ge a n y t hi ng of

i m p or t an ce .     T h e picture, b r o ad l y speaking, remains the same.                       By

a bo u t 2.30 pm, t h e r e , w a s a serious c ru sh o u t s i d e the t u r n s t i l e s at

L e p p i n g s Lane.       As the minu t es w e n t by, the sit ua t io n d e t e r i o r a t e d and

by 2.47 had r e a c h e d such a. state that the e x p e r i e n c e d p ol ic e o f f i c e r

in charge, S u p e r i n t e n d e n t Marshall, d e c i d e d that the onl y w a y to avoid

i n j u r i e s or d e a t h w as to open the exit g a t es to r e li ev e pressure.                      He
r a d i o e d a m e s s a g e to the controller, C h i e f S u p e r i n t e n d e n t Duck en fi e ld ,

w h o a u t h o r i s e d the o p e n i n g of the gates.          At 2.52 pm Gate C w as opened

and about 2000 w e n t t h r o u g h it.             By this time,'-the two central pens on

the t e rraces, 3 and 4, were full, alth o ug h th e re was s p a c e on the
wings.        When the g a t e w a s opened, no m e a s u r e s were taken to pre ve nt

t h o s e e n t e r i n g g o i n g dow n the tunnel ahead o f th em into the a l r e a d y

c r o wd e d central pens.              H o s t did so, c a u si n g severe c o ng es t i o n in the

pens.       As a result, 95 in the pens w e r e crushed to such an e x te nt that

t h e y d ie d and m a n y m o r e w e r e injured.                Un fo r tunately , the p olice

o f f i c e r s in th e control r o o m and on the p e r i m e t e r o f the pitch failed

to a p p r e c i a t e t h a t t he pens w e r e o v e r c r o w d e d and that fans w e r e in

distress.          T h e p e r i m e t e r gates, i n ad e qu at e as they were, w e r e not

o p e n e d in ti me and m e a s u r e s to reli ev e the situation were

i n s u f f i c i e n t l y e x p e d i t i o u s or adequate.         This does not mean that

individual p o l i c e o f f i c e r s did not do all th ey could.                             The fault lay

in a la ck o f p l a n n i n g and o f l e a d e r s h i p and, above all, in a failure

to a p p r e c i a t e the n e e d to control the n u mb er s in the central pens.

3.                It is     s i g n i f i c a n t that t he police at the time a p p e a r to have

b e l i e v e d th a t the f i g u r e o f 10,1000 in the S a f e t y C e r t i f i c a t e was too

4.          The e r e c t i o n o f the pens was not of itself a bad idea.                           The

f enc es w e r e to have g a t e s at the top, to enable egress to be m a d e to

a r r a n ge me n ts , if any, to man them, w h e t h e r by stewards or by the

police.       It seems t h e y w e r e to have a dual use: first, to e n a b l e fans
                                     •>



to go f r o m one pen to a n o t h e r to help in an even d i s t r i b u t i o n on the

U n f o r t u n a t e l y , a l t h o u g h he was aware o f the importance o f this

c o n t r o l , he does n ot s e e m to have i mp re s se d the club or the w o r k i n g

5.          T he r e a l i t y was, as Dr. E a s t w o o d accepted, that w i t h o u t any

been c o n d i t i o n e d to put up with.                It is s i g ni fi c an t that in both 1987

to tak e any steps to inquire into t h e i r comf o rt is a n o t a b l e feature

T h e p o li c e d e n y this.            It is d i f f i c u l t to believe that t h e r e was such

a p o s i t i v e u n d e r t a k i n g by t he police: if there had been, one would

at the o ut se t has been consi st e nt .                The p ol ic e did not expect t h er e to

be any st e wa rd s on the t e r r ac e s and no a c ti ve steps w e r e to be taken

by anyone to control or d i re c t s p e c t a t o r s on the t e r r ac e so as to

avoid o v e r c r o w d i n g .    T he fans w e r e ' e x p e c t e d to find th ei r own levels.

If the central pens b e c a m e over c ro wd e d, the fans w o ul d e i t h e r turn

r ou nd and go b a c k up the tunnel or d i s p e r s e by the gates at the rear

of the radial fe nces to the a d j o i n i n g pens.                   The p olice in the control

r o o m w o u l d ke ep an eye on the pens and, if ov er c r o w d i n g was detected,
shoul d take steps to stop mo r e c o mi n g in.                    A lt ernatively , al th o u g h it

was not part of t he m a t c h o p erational order, police of fi c er s on the

p e r i m e t e r of the pi t ch and in the w e s t s tand w ou l d report any problems

to Control to e n a b l e t h e m to ta ke n e c e s s a r y action.               The cl u b was

c l e a r that it had no r e s p o n s i b i l i t y for the m a n a g e m e n t of the fans on

the t e r ra c e and said th e re was an agreement, not in w r it i ng or

above.



2.           In t he l i g h t o f the evidence, w h i c h is all one way, it is in

D r E a s t w o o d ’s d e s c r i p t i o n of it as r i d i c u l o u s is c l e a r l y right.

F u r t h e r m o r e , t he m o n i t o r i n g of the s ta te of affairs in the pens by

to give a fa l se impression.                  No field glas se s w e r e a v a i l a b l e and the

This is s u r p r i s i n g s i nc e in 1988 the tunnel was blocked o f f to prevent

Dr. E a s t w o o d ’s i n t e r p r e t a t i o n of A n n e x C to the Gr ee n Guide.         The

s h o u l d have been retested; if the latter, it r e c o r d e d 100% and passed.

 Dr. East w oo d a d o p te d the l a tt er and so p a s s e d it.               He j u s t i f i e d his

do not t h i n k we can be cr i ti ci s ed for a d o p t i n g his interp r et at i o n ,

m a n y w ho d i e d   e l s e w h e r e in pens 3 and 4 and, if it had not collapsed,

fans w o u l d in      all p r o b a b i l i t y have been c r u s h e d to death again s t it.

In h i s ’statem en t , Dr E a s t w o o d said that it was in his v i e w "reas on a bl e

to b e l i e v e it    f a il e d on 15th April 1989 b e c au se it was s u b j e c te d to a

s i g n i f i c a n t l y g r e a t e r crowd pre s su re than is e n vi s a g e d in the 1986

Guide".       T h a t e v i d e n c e wa s not challenged, since it is m a n i f e s t that

the gross o v e r c r o w d i n g in pen 3 w o u l d have c r e at e d an e xc es s i v e

pressure.        T h e ver ti c al run behi nd it to b a r r i e r          /£*-<}       and the

diagonal run to the t u n n e l side o f the pen at the top w o u l d have

i n c r ea se d tha t p r e s s ur e .     There is no c e r t a i n t y that the d i f f e r e n t

i n t e r p r e t a t i o n and a r e te st wo ul d have led to renewal o f the b a r ri er

or that, even if it had been renewed, it w o u l d have s ur v i v e d the

is d i f f i c u l t to say that lives w o u l d have n e c e s s a r i l y been saved.               It

is i n c i d e n t a l l y u n f o r t u n a t e that Dr E a s t w o o d ’s test records we re

incomplete, si nc e the test of one out of t hree of the spans was not

recorded.        It h a p p e n s that in the - ca se of 124A the one o m it t ed was the

one w h i c h survived.

T h i s did m a t e r i a l l y a f fe ct the c a p a c i t y and we t hi n k that i n s u f fi ci e nt

m o r e easy for fans c om i ng down the tunnel to- spread out into the pen

and we b e l i e v e that its absence did r e sult in a g r e a t e r fl ow down the

the event, d e s p i t e the e m e r g e n c y that arose, it seems to ha ve m a d e                        •

little difference.                 S i nc e there had been a m i n o r p i t c h i n v a s i o n at the

a dd ition, t he r e w as i n s u ff ic i en t plan ni n g to deal w i t h the arrival of
fans at the t u r ns ti le s .             It was a s su m ed that t h e y w o ul d a r r i v e in             a

s t e a d y fl ow and th at th e re w o u l d be no build up.                      It is in te r e s t i n g

th at t he re w as a c o n s i d e r a b l e bo dy o f e v i d en c e from fans to the effect

th at in 1988 there had been a m u c h h i g h e r p r o fi le p o l i c i n g en route to

the ground.            Fans c o mi ng down Le pp in g s Lane had been s t op p ed and asked

if they had t i c ke ts and steps had been t aken to weed out t h o s e w ho had

not and to control th os e g oing to the turnstiles.                                 Some w i t n e s s e s even

n u m b e r s of o f f i c e r s p o s t e d to p u b l i c o r d e r du ties away f r om the

1988 has led p e o p l e to t h i n k there w as m o r e control than in the chaos

o f 1989, w h e r e a s in fact there was no material diff e re nc e.                              In any

event, it is c l ea r that in 1989 i n s u f f i c i e n t c o n s i d e r a t i o n was given

to the p o s s i b i l i t y of the arrival o f large num be r s at o nc e or to the

l i t t l e r e c e n t e x p e r i e n c e o f p o l i c i n g football groun ds and had not been

fault.       He i n h e r i t e d a plan w h i c h had a p p ea r ed to w o r k well and was

c o n t e n t that it w o u l d w o r k well again.              He did not have the e xp er i en ce

we feel th at he s h o u l d have taken more time and g r e a t e r ca re to

f a m i l i a r i s e h i m s e l f w i t h the g ro u nd and all its p ro blems.

A l t e r n a t i v e l y , H r H o l e could have been asked to deal w i t h the match,

Ill     S A T U R D A Y 15TH A P R I L 1989

A.    T h e c r u s h at the t u rn st i le s

1.           B e c a u s e of the need to seg re g at e Liverpool f r o m N o t t i n g h a m

all 2 4 , 0 0 0 Liverpool fans had to enter by the L e p p in g s Lane

turnstiles.          1-10 w e r e al l oc at ed to the 9880 in the N o r t h Stand, 11-16

to the 4 4 6 5 in the W e s t Stand and A-G to the 10,100 on the terrace.
T h i s m e a n t that t h e r e w as c on s id e r a b l e p r e s s u r e on the t u r n s t i l e s and,

a s s u m i n g a h o p e d - f o r rate of 800 an hour w as achieved, it w o u l d have

t u r n s t i l e s i n e v i t a b l e and it is a defec t w h i c h u n d o u b t e d l y c o n t r i b u t e d

to the di sa s te r.



2.           It was e s s e nt i al that there should be no i m p e d i m e n t to the

s m oo th o p e r a t i o n of the turnstiles.             However, there are a n u m b e r of

t h i n g s w h i c h did c a u s e fans to c o n g r e g a t e o u t s i d e the t u r n s t i l e s and

to o b s t r u c t and d e l a y the entry to the ground.                    In p a r t i c u l a r , we

w o u l d i d e n t i f y the f o l l o w i n g matters:-
(i) T h e c o n f u s i n g nature of the tickets c o u pl ed w i t h the

s i gn i ng o u t s i d e the turnstiles.           1-10 wer e m a rk e d A, 11-16 C

and A - G B, so that they rah ACB.                    B was the o th er side of a

wall to A and C, so that anyone g e t ti ng h i m s e l f on the wrong

side had to e x t r i c a t e h i m s e l f and go to the ot he r side.

F u r t h e r m o r e some of the signs p la ce d to s h o w the a p p r o p r i a t e

c o l o u r c o d i n g of the rel ev an t t u r n s t i l e s w e r e too l o w and

i n v i s i b l e onc e a substantial q u e u e built up.                Police off ic e rs

said th at t he r e w e r e nu merous q u e r ie s f ro m fans as to wh e re

they s h o ul d go and that the sign i ng wa s not at all good.                           The

C lu b o u g h t to have made sure th a t the tic ke t s and signs were

clear.


(ii) T h e a c t i v i t i e s of ticket touts.             T h e r e w e r e touts

o pe ra t in g, albe it not in large numbers, in the v i c i n i t y of the

Lepp in g s Lane turnstiles: one at least was ar r es te d for

o bs tr u c t i o n .   T outs are a m e n a c e because (a) they e n c o u r a g e

fans to c o m e w i t h o u t tickets in the hope of being able to buy

one, (b) th e y sell supporters t i c ke t s for the w r o n g end of the

ground, thus imperi l li ng the s e g r e g a t i o n o f the fans and (c)

they c a u s e o b st ruction.          Ideally, they should be b a r re d from

the v i c i n i t y o f any ground, but t here are d i f f i c u l t i e s in

d e v i s i n g .a m e a n s o f c ur t ai li n g th ei r a ct i vi ti es w i t h o u t

p r e v e n t i n g the p e r f e ct ly lawful and u n o b j e c t i o n a b l e sw apping

or s e l l i n g o f tick et s o t h e r than as a business.
(iii) T h e p r e s e n c e of t i ck et l es s fans.       The e v i d e n c e m a k e s it

c l e a r that th er e wer e m a n y fans asjd n g for tickets.                 Poli ce

o f f i c e r s on d u t y at and near the. t u r n s t i l e s gi ve v a r i o u s

e s t i m a t e s o f the numbers, ran gi n g f r o m 200 to 2000.              Fans have

told the i n q u i r y that much more w as done in 1988 to try to
w e e d out the t i c k e t l e s s than in 1989.          W h e t h e r or not that is

right, v e r y l i t t l e was done in 1989.              T he p o l ic e to ld the

i n qu i ry that t here was little they c ould do, since no offen ce

w a s c o m m i t t e d in being near a g r ou nd w i t h o u t a ticket,

p r o v i d e d t h e r e was no o b s t r u c t i o n or breach of the peace.            We

do not t h i n k the police are so p owerless.                   T i c k e t l e s s fans do
c a us e p r o b l e m s and, in s uf f ic ie n t numbers, are a l m o s t bound to

c ause an o b st ru c t i o n .     It is in o ur opini on p e r f e c t l y

 r e a s o n a b l e f o r a po lice o f f i c e r to ask a fan if he has a

 t i c k e t and, if he has not, it is lawful to r e fu se h i m access

6.           In any event, we do not t h i n k that t h o s e who a r r i ve d |hour

7.          It has. b ee n said that, had the fans not pushed, the p r o b l e m of

c r u s h i n g w o u l d not have arisen.          Thi s is a s u p e r f i c i a l l y p l a u s i b l e

view.     But it i g no re s the r e a l i t y of crowd behaviour.                      It has not been

s e r i o u s l y s u g g e s t e d by any p ol ic e o f f i c e r that the m o o d o f the c rowd

8.          We s h o u l d r e f e r to o t h e r factors w h ic h have been s u g g e s t e d as

c a u s a t i v e o f the crush.



            (a)    T i c k e t l e s s Fans
            As w e ha ve a l r e a d y said, it is v er y d i f f i c ul t to e s t i m a t e the

            n u m b e r o f t i c k e t l e s s fans.      It has been s u g g es te d t h a t t he r e

            w e r e a s u b s t a n t i a l n u m be r wh o w e r e d e te rm i n e d to g et into the

            g r o u n d w i t h o u t a ticket.         T h e r e is some evidence, n o t a b l y

            f r o m H r T a y l o r , the ef fect of w h i c h is that some fans w e r e

            o v e r h e a r d e x p r e s s i n g the intention to get in by w a y of an open

            g a t e or to c a u s e a gate to be opened.                  A t t e n t i o n is d r a w n to

            the arrival of large numbers of Liverpool fans at a l l - t i c k e t

            L e a g u e m a t c h e s in the hope of g a in in g admission.                 A n d it is

            p o i n t e d out th a t at this y e a r ’s Cu p Final t he re w e r e up 1000
            fans w h o had come to force an e nt ry to W e m b l e y Sta di um .                        We do

            not d o u b t t h a t there p r o b a b l y w e r e some fans w h o c a m e w i t h o u t
t i c ke t s d e t e r m i n e d to gain entry.      But we find it i mp os s ib le

to a c ce p t th a t the c r u sh in g w as c a us ed by such fans so as to

e n g i n e e r the o p e ni n g of a gate, a t h e o r y p r o p o u n d e d b y ’

S u p e r i n t e n d e n t Greenwood.    (See D ay 12, p . 95).         T h a t w ou ld

w h o t o o k a d v a n t a g e of the s i t u a t i o n and we re h a p p y to

e x a c e r b a t e and m a k e use of the crush.          Opportunists probably

did hope t h a t a gate w o u l d be o p e n e d and tha t the y w o u l d get

in t h r o u g h it.       To that extent, t i c k e t l e s s fans m a y have

c o n t r i b u t e d to the d i f f i c u l t i e s at the turn st il e s.



(b)    Drink

M a n y w i t n e s s e s , p a r t i c u l a r l y the police, r ef er to a large

c o n s u m p t i o n of alcohol, m a i n l y lager.       Fans a r r iv ed in

S h e f f i e l d in good time but th en s t ayed o u t s i d e the g r o u nd

o f f i c e r s s u g g e s t e d that the. ban on the sale o f alcohol in the

g r o u n d c o n t r i b u t e d to this p a t t e r n o f behaviour.        It was

p o i n t e d out that, h aving rega r d to the crowds, t h o s e seeking

d r i n k i nside the ground, if it was p e r m i s s i b l e to sell it,

w o u l d be u n l i k e l y ’to succeed in g e t ti n g m o r e than a pint (i.e

a s i ng le drink).          It does c e r t a i n l y seem that a s i g n i f i c a n t

n u m b e r of fans did d ec i de to take a d v a n ta ge o f the suns hi n e

and d r i n k so that th ey arri ve d c o m p a r a t i v e l y late and in a

c o n d i t i o n a f f e c t e d by alcohol.   Th e d r in k had i n cr ea s ed

s e l f i s h and stupi d behaviour, l e a di ng to p u s h i n g and a
          f a i l u r e to t a k e any notice of po lice appeals to hold back.

          T h e r e was a c o n s i d e r a b l e amount of boorish and l o ut i sh

          b e h a v i o u r (e.g. u r i n at i ng in g a rd e ns or backyards, throwing-

          e m p t y cans all o ve r the place, shouting, s w e ar in g and

          c ha nt i ng ) w h i c h sadly tends to be as so c i a t e d w i t h football

          crowds.      T h a t sort of b e h a v io ur is inexcusable.                But it was a

          m i n o r i t y of fans w h o were g u i l t y of it and it did not c au se

          the tro u bl e.       It p r o b a b l y c o n t r i b u t e d to the i n a b i l i t y o f the

          p o l i c e to alleviate the trou bl e once it had arisen.



          (c)    Hool i g a n i s m
          T hi s is r e a l l y c o u pl e d wit h the t a ki n g of drink, al th o u g h

          t h o s e m a y well have been fans w ho did not need d r i n k to behave

          in a t h o r o u g h l y antisocial fashion.              Police ho rses w e r e burnt

          w i t h c i g a r e t t e s , there was p u s hi ng and shoving and some fans

          b e h a v e d in a t h o r o u g h l y selfish way, c o n c e r n e d o n l y to get

          t h e m s e l v e s into the g r o un d w i t h o u t caring for the c o m f o r t or

          s a f e t y of t h e i r fellows.       But this sort of b e h a v i o u r was that

          o f a m i n o r i t y and did not cause the problem.                   The primary

          ca us e o f t h e ' c r u s h i n g was the b o t t l e n e c k at L e p p i n g s Lane, and
          i n s u f f i c i e n c y of tu rn s t i l e s and a f a il u re by the p o l i c y

          p r o p e r l y to control fans arriving before the y r e a c h e d the

o r d e r l y fashion, g l a d to e s ca pe from the dangerous crush outside.                      At

2 .5 8 Gat e A was o p e n ed , but this time there was some p r e p a r a t i o n

inside, l a r g e l y b e c a u s e of the fo r es i g h t of Sgt. Higgins.            Hr

g o i n g f r o m Gate C to pens 3 and 4 w as the e ff ective cause o f the

s u g g e s t i n g that t he b a r r i e r broke be fore 2.52.        We do not find that at

all likely.          It is c o n t r a r y to the e v i d e n c e that is a v a i l ab l e from

fans w h o w e r e in the v i c i n i t y o f -t ha t barrier.         It is also less

the arrival o f the teams on the pitch, caused the collapse.                              T he

2.             S i nc e no steps w e r e taken to p r ev e nt it h appening, the pens

go t f u l l e r and fuller.         As they did, peopl e began to be c r u s h e d to

t r a u m a t i c a s p h y x i a - the crush was so g r ea t that th e y could not

breathe.         As this ha p pened, they began to cry out in dis t re ss .                         The

p o l i c e o f f i c e r s at the p e r i m e t e r fence w e r e slow to react, p a r t l y

b e c a u s e th ey w e r e a c c u s t o m e d to over c ro wd i ng , p ar t ly b e c a u s e the noise

                the i n t e g r i t y of the pitch.         PC H o o s o n told the i n q u i r y that

he came past the N o r t h S ta nd and, as                he ap pr o a c h e d gat e 4, he r e alised

th at fans w e r e in d i s t r e s s and he tookjjjpon h i m s e l f to open Gat e 4.

T h i s w as s o m e t i m e b e t w e e n 2.55 and 3pm.        There af t er , Gate 4 r e m a in ed

open.      PC I l li ng w o r t h , the o f f i c e r on Gate 4, does not agree; he says

he o p e n e d that gate.          It is pos si b le that it had o r i g i n a l l y been

o p e n e d by PC I l l i n g w o r t h and shut again and then r e o p e n e d by PC
Hooson.         But i n s o f a r as there is 3 c o n fl ic t of e v i d e n c e to be

re solved, we w o u l d s u bm it that PC H o o s o n ’s account is to be preferred.

PC I l l i n g w o r t h m u s t feel h i m s e l f open to criticism; PC H o o s o n has, on

the face of things, no axe to grind.



3.         Gate 3 w a s opened, according                to PC Smith, by the f or c e of the

fans in the pen.           He shut it again.             T he same h ap p e n e d a g ai n and it

w a s only then th at he a pp re c i a t e d the need to keep it open to try to

4.         It is not p o s s i b l e to say p r e c i s e l y wh en the          gates w e r e

opened, since the v i d eo s a v a i la b le w e r e not fo cu ss e d on the pens at

the crucial time.           T h e p h o t o g r a p h s in C o m p o s i t e A l b u m II sh o w gate 4

15.0 0: 4 5 (HAP 1) and gat e 4 open at 1 5 . 0 0 : 5 0 (HAP 3).                    The e a r l i e s t

that Gate 3 is shown open on a v i de o is 15.03: 49 (MAP 8).                              All this

m a k e s Hr G r o b e l a a r ’s ti ming very susp ec t and his d e s c r i p t i o n of the

5.         Not onl y was there a sl ow n es s to react to the s i t u a t io n in the

pens, but also, o n c e fans had begun to c li m b ov er the p e r i m e t e r fence

(at about 3pm), the imm e di at e r e a c t i o n wa s that it was a pitch

invasion.       This w a s u n l ik el y for v a r io u s reasons, not least bec au se

(a) the fans did not go on the p itch and (b) there was no c o n c e i v a b l e

c ause for an i n v a s i o n at that stage of the game.                    Valuable minutes

w e r e spent w h i l e t h o s e in the control box tried to find out w h a t was

happening.


6.         A t t e m p t s w e r e m a d e by s t a n di ng on the p e r i m e t e r f e n c i ng and

g e s t i c u l a t i n g to get those at the back o f the pens to m ov e back.

T h e s e a t t em pt s failed.    T hi s was not in the m ai n due to c us s ed n e s s

on the part o f the fans, but to (a) an in ab il i ty to mov e and (b) a

7.           T h e r e was an abs e nc e of l e a d e r s h i p by the s e n i o r p o l i c e

o ff ic e rs .     I ndividual efforts we re made to try to save lives and to

o r g a n i s a t i o n until C h i e f S u p e r i n t e n d e n t N e s b i t t came on the scene at

about 3.15.           No a t t e m p t was m a d e to use the t a nn oy to try to summon

medical a s s i s t a n c e until about 3.20.               Similarly, those not d i r e c t l y

a n n o u n c e m e n t s h o u l d have been made.        Hos t football fans are d e c e n t

                     I      left           the       pub     with        my       fri                                                                        at

                    about                 3.30pm        (1330).




                    We       went              to    the     ground           walked               around        it    and    found    a youth       outside      of

We    bought       a    ticket       each     from       him    and     went      into       the    Hop       end   to     watch

the    match.




When    we     went         into    the    ground        there       was    about       30    people          outside       in

Perristone         Road.




Some    were                ling    tickets       but     not     all      of    them.




I finished             work    at    11a m    (1100)        and      drove       home.




                                                                                  from       H i l l s b o r o u g h F o ot b a 1 1

I was     only         in    the    house     for    a    few     minutes         and    I left          to    go    for    a       drink

When    I got          to    the    Gate     there       was    only       the    side       door     that       was     open       and
                                                                                                                                         PAGE         3
                                                                                                                                         S2004

there       was       two    men       on    the       door       who     are     friends          of    the     Licensee.




On    my    way       to    the     Gate         pub    I was       stopped            by    5 Liverpool            fans           who    asked

me    if    I knew          where       a    pub       was    open        I told        them       I d i d n ’t.




Also       outside          of    The       Travellers             pub     was     two       youths        who    asked            me    if    I ’d

got    any       tickets          for       sale       told       them     I h a d n ’t.




I also          saw    by    th e      Railway          Station           in H a l i f a x        Road     a    line      of       Policemen,

there       was       about       15    of       them.




These       Policemen             were       stopping             people         who    were       walking         along           Halifax

Road       away       from       the        ground          and    asking        them        where       they     were         going.




If    the       people       said           they       were       football         fans       and       lo o k i n g for       a    p u b t he

police          was    turning              them       back       towards        the        ground.




The    two          persons       on        the    door       of    the     Gate       Pub        know     me    by s i g h t       and I

walked          straight          into       the       bar    of    the      pub.




I    later       saw       these       two       directing          Liverpool               supporters           into      the          lounge

area       of    the       pub.


                N     Io a 31                •
The    Licencee             had     decided            to    let    the      Liv^st^pool           supporters             use       the

lounge          and    the       bar    was       kept       for    local         Shef-fiVlli           people"




I    could       see       into     the      lounge          of    t he    pub     and       it    was     full      to    capacity.




The    two       on    the       door       had    to       turn    a     l ot    of    supporters              away      because             they

could       get       no    more       into       the       lounge.

The    bar       was    fairly       empty        and    the      only       Liverpool           people       in    there    was

about       10    to    15.




These       came       into    the       bar    because          they     were       friends       of    the       licences.




They    had       to    knock       on    the     door      to    get     in,




It    was    about       2pm       (1400)       when      the     door       to     the    pub    was    shut




The    supporters             in    the    lounge         were     behaving           quite       well




They    started          singing          and     chanting         at     about       2.15pm       (1415)

At    about       £.           (1430)          the    majority          of    the     Liverpool          fans       had   left     the




I know       this       because          there       w a s n ’t m u c h      noise        coming       from    the    lounge       and

the    laricF!ba<d o p e n e d           the    front       door    to       l et    them    out.




I stayed          in    the    pub       a^itil      about       3.05pm       (1505).

I ’d m e t                                                  pub    and       we     had   decided        to    go    to   the

ground       and       walk    around.




We    thought          that    if    there        was    anybody          selling         tickets        and       they   were

cheap       enough       we    would       buy       them    and    watch           the   match.

When       we    left       the       pub    there       was       no    Liverpool           fans     in    the    bar    but    I

d o n ’t    know       if    there          was    any    in       the    lounge.




I had       had    about          4    pints       of    lager          but    I w a s n ’t d r u n k .




                 and    I walkaNi d o w n               Penistone             Road    to     the    island        into    Leppings

Lane       and    up    to       the    Lepfofcpgs L a n e              turnstiles.




When       we    walked          I.    saw    a    few   fans           walking      a w a y from     the         ground towards

the    island.




I didri\t         see       anyone          fighting          or    drinking.




When       I got       t V the         entrance          to    Leppings             Lane     turnstiles           I saw    a    l ot    of

ambulance          men       an^jFolice             moving          around.




I saw       people          in    the       road    who       were       crying       and      in a    distressed          state.




No    one       seemed       to        know       what   was       happening.




We    walked       passed              the    entrance         and        turned          left atthet r a f f i c          lights.




We    walked       down          this       road    and       I saw       people          standing         on   the   concrete

structure          which          I think          is    something             to    do    with     the     electricity          board




I thought          these          people          were    watching             the    match.




Somewhere          by       Leppings          Lane       I heard          a Policeman              tell     somebody       that        the

game       was    off       so                     and    I were          now       making      our    way      home.

            At    the    Pennistone         Road     end    I saw      a   l ot    of   ambulances.          They   were    going

            into    the    ground.




            I still       do    not    know       what   had    happened.




            I    left                  at   Leppings        Lane      by   the     island      and   I walked       home,




            This    year       I d i d n ’t s e e    anyone         selling       tickets      either   at    the    ground       or

            nearby.




            The    only    thing       I think       that      was    different         from    last    years   match       was

            the    policemen          at    the    station      in H a l i f a x    Roadk      stopping      people    trying

            to    find    pubs.        I d i d n ’t s e e      them    there       last   year.

HILLSBOROUGH SCRUTINY

When the Home Secretary announced the outcome of Lord Justice Stuart-Smith’s scrutiny of
evidence, he undertook to release as much of the material considered in the course of the scrutiny as
possible, by placing copies in the House of Commons Library.

Two of the documents in question were letters from Peter Metcalf of Hammond Suddards Solicitors
to Lord Justice Stuart-Smith, dated 11 November 1997 and 20 January 1998, copies of which I
enclose. Mr Metcalf has indicated he has no objection to the release of these letters, but that
permission for the disclosure of the documents attached to them could only be granted by his clients,
namely South Yorkshire Police and Municipal Mutual Insurance. I should therefore be grateful if you
would let me know whether you are content for these documents to be released. I should also be
grateful if you would confirm Municipal Mutual Insurance have no objections to the disclosure of
these documents. If either you or Municipal Mutual Insurance have any objections, it would be
helpful if you could let me know what they are so that we may advise the Home Secretary
accordingly.

On a related issue, your letter of 3 August to Ann Adlington indicated that in view of the private
prosecutions brought by the Family Support Group, you were awaiting legal advice on the disclosure
of the remaining statements made by police officers. As you know, the vast majority of statements
have now been placed in the House of Commons Library. I should be grateful if you would let me
know whether you foresee any difficulties in fulfilling the Home Secretary’s undertaking in respect
of the release of material considered in the course of the scrutiny.

Yours sincerely




M J Pyne

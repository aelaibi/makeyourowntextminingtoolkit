To:      Lord Justice Stuart-Smith




I attach the Crown Prosecution Service’s report -dated 8 May - setting out their conclusions
about the ‘new evidence’ of Roger Houldsworth and Dr Walker, and whether these justify
further any new criminal proceedings. The evidence is what we are already familiar with.

2.     The CPS conclusion, as far as Houldsworth is concerned, is that there is no new
evidence justifying prosecution. The suggestion is that the Houldsworth material, taken
together with his not been called to give evidence to Taylor and the Inquests

         a)       shows that police knew more about conditions on the terrace than was
                  admitted, possibly pointing to proceedings for (?) manslaughter; and

         b)       demonstrates the suppression of evidence, pointing to proceedings for
                  perverting the course of justice.

3.      CPS judge that Houldsworth does not support either of these conclusions. The
Walker evidence relates to Philip Hammond and Lee Nicol, and indicates that they were alive
after 3.15. The allegation is that the police deliberately concealed Walker’s evidence from
Taylor and the Inquests.

4.     CPS conclude that this is wrong. They do not think that Walker provides compelling
evidence that Lee Nicol or Philip Hammond were alive after 3.15, or that what he had to say
was suppressed.

5.       We have also had the attached material from Lynne Fox, whose brother Thomas died
at Hillsborough. Her college thesis and the book o f photographs make touching reading (the
thesis lifts large chunks o f Lord Taylor’s report) but they do not I think add anything new.
We heard from Mrs Fox, Lynne’s mother, when we were in Liverpool.

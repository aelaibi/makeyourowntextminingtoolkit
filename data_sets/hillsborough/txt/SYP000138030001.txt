             Sheffield



             D ear Mr Popper

             I am writing on behalf o n mv son                     vho attended the Inquest into the
             Hillsborough Disaster on                  January.

                   *as very nervous at the thought of attending the inquest, but was reassured by one
             ot your officers that the inquest was to be held in a small room with four or five people
             present.

             When we arrived at the Town Hall to attend the i ;quest, we were shown into a large
             court room, I enquired if this was the room      vas to attend and was told it was.

             We were all shocked to discover that there were members of the public, press, I think
             twelve barristers, their clerks, a jury as well as Mr Popper the coroner and his clerk.

             This proved to be a very traumatic experience for          ind he was completely taken
             aback to face this ordeal.                        L

             I feel I must draw this episode to your attention and I wonder if any other witnesses
             have been mislead in this way.

             Yours sincerely           (____________

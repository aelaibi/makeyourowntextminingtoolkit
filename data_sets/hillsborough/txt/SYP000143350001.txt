On Sa t u r d a y      15th April        1989    (150489),       I a t t e n d ed   the semi-final

be tw ee n Li verpool           FC and N o tt i n g h a m Forre st FC at Hillsb or oug h,                 on

duty with the St John Am b u l an ce Brigade                        to wh ich       I am a full       adult,

member.           I a r r i v e d at H i l l s b o r o u g h at a p p r o x i m a t e l y 2.15   pm   (1415)

after mak in g my own way to the ground.                            After      signing     the atten da nc e

book and       leaving      the        first aid       room,    I was a sk ed to join my              colleagues

in the     corner        of the N o r t h S ta nd and the Kop which                    is usually used by

the S h e f f i e ld W e d n e s d a y supporters.              This Kop on the S a t u r d a y of the

semi-final         was    used     by the N o tt i n g h a m Forre st          supporters.



Myse lf and my           colleagues           commented on the          lack of Liverpool             supporters

on the      ’wings'       of the Leppin gs Ln end of H i l l s b o ro ug h as we                      expected

the    latter      to be full.               We also    commented on the full              turnout        of the

St John Brigade membe rs as many more had a t t e n d e d the match than are

at a usual S a t u r d a y Lea gu e ma tc h of S h e f f i e l d Wednesday.                         All   the St

Jo h n members were a s s e m b l e d               in their    de si g n a t e d   corners    by

a p p r o x i m a t e l y 2.40    pm    (1440).        At ar o u n d 2.5 3      pm (1455),      as    the match

was    due to start,             a police          constable    remarked to Peter WELLS,                  to which

I was     party to,        that        the m at ch had been            put back      for   15 minutes       and

was    due to start at 3. 1 5                 pm    (1515)    instead of 3.00          pm (1500).          This

was    not to occur,             as,    at    exactly 3. 0 0      pm    (1500),      both teams       came onto

the    pitch.



The    opening minutes             of the m at ch seemed to go                  perfectly normal           until

we saw what         looked        like the Liverpool             su pporters         had   invaded the

pitch.       Nob od y knew what was                  happening at        the Leppings         Ln end.       Myself

and my      colleagues           decid ed to take            the st retcher         down to where we

thought      the    trouble was              occurring.        As we a r ri ve d on the scene,              what

seem ed    like total mass               confusion had broken out.                   People were          being

carried out         by police           officers and Liverpool                supporters and we

promptly       carried out m o u t h — to— m ou th             r es usc it at ion and external             heart

compressions          on the dying             victims.        I was    brought a young man who had

been    crushed and had an                   injury to his       left     calf and who was also              very

distressed.          As    I remember,             I comforted the young man who was arou nd

                                                                                                      D637

IS years       of age and          put, him at     complete       rest as       I had to     leave him to

a t t e n d other        casualties.        1 returned to him when               I could and he was

e v e n t u a l l y taken by some Liverpool               su pporters         on an ad ve rti sin g    board

to the     first aid            room.    Then    I was    called by a fireman to do

re s u s c it at ion      on an elderly gentleman.                We    tried to     resuscitate       him

together,          as    I was at tem p ti ng mouth~-to--mouth the               fireman was

att em p t i n g    external       heart    compressions.          Eventually,        after several

minut es     of resuscitation,              we still      couldn't       feel    a pulse or any signs

of   life arid the firema n agr ee d we                  could not have          done an yt hin g     else.

I was     then      called upon to          att en d a young man who was              laid on the

pitch.       I put        him    into the   recovery      position        as he was        breathing and

didn't appear             to have an y       visible       injuries. I as ke d a group of

suppor te rs        to    take him to       the first aid         room and he was           promptly

lifted onto an ad v e rt i si n g            board and taken            round to be ferried by one

of the many a mb ul anc es              to hospital.        When       I left    the man     in the

capable      hands        of his    fellow suporters          I went      round anyone who ap pe a r e d

to be     injured or distressed.                  I went    to a girl who was very dis tr es se d

and appeared             to be having       trouble      breathing a l t h ou gh she h a d n ’t any

pain    in her          chest    or any visible       injuries.          I calmed her down and

talked to her until                her husband      came a nd found her.              As    I felt

sa t i s f i e d that my services were              no longer          required,     I left her to go

to other       casualties.



As most      of the        bodies and       injured      people    had been taken off the              pitch,

I made my way             round to the first aid room to see                     if I could be of any

help.      I was         called by a policewoman to a girl and her husban d who                              had

both su ff er ed          injuries      in the   crowd.      The       girl    had a pain     in her    chest

and so     I ex amined the area where                 I found she         had a broken        rib.     I felt

that any treatment               given to her would have made                   her un com for tab le    so

after    her husband had been treated for a crush                              injury to his ankle we

                                                                                                  D637

took    them to an awa it in g min i-bus whi ch was                 being    used for       the

casualties who             needed to be taken to the            hospital     but    could walk.              I

then went         to see     if anymore      casualties     could be taken to the hospital

in the mini-bus.              I went     to a young man who         had had his       legs an d his

right arm          crushed and who         couldn't walk.         Myself,    a fellow       colleague

and a policeman             carried the young man to the             bus and       I made    him a

m a k e sh if t   sling    for his arm out of his Liverpool                 scarf.     Along with

two    other St John          personnel      I went    to the     hospital with       casualties.

On arr ivi ng        at the Hal la m s hi re Hospital        we helped the          casualties          into

the C a su al ty Department.               I borrowed a wh ee lc ha ir       for    the young        lad

who    couldn't walk.            I pushed him to where            some   doctors were        standing

and    the young       lad was      told    rather     harshly to stand up.           He    c o u l d n ’t

stand up and was             then   promptly dragged out           of the wh eel cha ir        wh er eu po n

he fell       to the floor.           I am not even sure          this woman was a doctor.                       I

hel ped him back            to the wheelchair.          We then     left the hospital             and

returne d to H i l l s b o r o u g h     in the mini-bus.



As we ar ri ve d back at Hillsborough,                  we went     back to the       pitch to find

our    colleagues.           This was at ap p r o x i m a t e l y 5.45    pm (1745).         We    then

had the       task    of    looking    for our stretchers          that had been       left all

around      the ground.          After     returning     to the    first aid       room we had a

drink and a rest.              We   then left the ground at a p p r o x i m a t e l y 6 . 3 0           pm

(1830).           I ar ri ve d home at 7.00       pm    (1900).

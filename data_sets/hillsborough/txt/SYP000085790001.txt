Moving        onto     the    pitch we mixed with                crowds      of     confused     civilians and a

a p p a r e n t l y dead. The crews began to a t t e n d to the casualties while I

t ried to make            contact         with other           f .ice r s-i n-Charge and assess               the

situation.              I eventually             1ocaVed Stn O F l e t c h e r and           it was ag r e e d         that

c asua l t i e s     should       be    removed through the S o u t h S t a n d to the                     road

behind,        where      I would         set    up a casualty          clearing area          <D>.         During

this     operation           it was       necessary       for me to         request     large numbers             of

fans     to    clear      the ai s l e s        in the S outh S t a n d and,           to their       credit,          they

did this        quickly and             in an orderly manner.                      Along with Police

O f f i c e r s and S t e w a r d s       I arranged       to have a clear             passage       <E>

maintained           thro u g h    to     the    roadway.         I believe          over 20    casualties             were

removed        by this        route.            Throughout      this     period Darnall          Roa d      crews

           minor    injuries while          the more           seriously      injured were             not   being      reaches

           at the     casualty       clearing area.                This was        resolved after

           I made     contact with Po 1 i ce 0 f f i c.ejp«f at              the Peni stone Rd ent rance

           It was about         this    time    that ACG'

           Once    it had become         clear     that most          of the       casualties          had been       removed

           from the     pitch and the           casualty area           I   went        to    the g y m nasium and

           informed ADO Robjohns               that      oncoming a m b u l a n c e s        were still        at t e n d i n g

           L eppings Ln,       while     the m a j o r i t y of the          casualties were             now     in the

           gymnasium,        and the a m b u l a n c e s       ware more      urgently          required here.

           Darnail     Rd    crews     eventually         regrouped         in the g y m nasium and were                   then

           requested to         return to our appliances and stand-by.                                  While      returning

                The m a t c h was        e v e n t u a l l y a b a n d o n e d and the      ground         cleared        but    due    to

                the    position of our a p p l i a n c e s             the    fans      leaving         onto L e p pings         Ln were

                forced       to come       into    close         contact with firemen,                  appli a n c e s    and    police

                officers.            The    occasionally            hostile a t t i t u d e       of the       crowd was a cause

                of    concern      to my      crew and myself.                 At one       point ADO Robjohns                   car was

                dama g e d    by passing          crowds         including     one      person who wa l k e d             over    it.         1

                expressed        our     concern to AGO H o r n s b y and he a d v i s e d us to                          remain with

                our appliances,             w h i c h we     did after moving             them a few metres                 to give

                the    crowds a clearer              route,          S h o r t l y a ft e r w a r d s    we were      released from

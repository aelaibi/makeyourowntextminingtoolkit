            Crush Barrier Assessment

       i*
            1.0   Synopsis

                  This report assesses the strength, stiffness and load carrying capacity
                  of Barrier number 124A which collapsed under recorded excess crowd
*                 loading on Saturday, 15th April, 1989.

                  The barrier is located on the central west terrace at the Leppings Lane
i                 End of S.W.F.C., Hillsborough....

                   It is of steel construction, rigidly fixed to the terrace foundation.
W /t              At this stage the date of construction is notknown but it is likely to
Wk                be from the early 30's era.

            2.0   Testing and Maintenance

                  In accordance with the Safety Certificate issued in1979 and the
                  recommendations of the so-called "Green Guide" booklet on the Safety at
                  Sports Ground then in operation, a % of all the stadium barriers, rails
                  and fences are tested every year.

                  On most barriers a test load of 6 KN/m is applied which corresponds to
■                 the greater strength requirements of table 1 in peak viewing areas. New
                  barriers may be designed and analysed to a loading of 5 KN/m.

                  At the time of test the barriers are examined visually for signs of
m
                  excess corrosion and maintenance undertaken accordingly. Any element
                  which does not satisfy the testing criteria is replaced and re-tested.

m                 It is fortuitous for the present report that these barriers were
                  included in the last test series undertaken in July 1988 together with
                  a calibration test on the equipment used by the Club's Engineer,
m                 Dr. W. Eastwood. .

                  The previous test was in June 1983.
m           3.0   Construction Details

                  The barrier consists of vertical cantilever type frame supports of
m                 2)6" x 2%" x   (54mm x 54mm x 6.3mm) raker struts and 2" x 2" x X"
                  (51mm x 51mm x 6.3mm) angle vertical ties attached to a riveted/bolted

■                 gusseted joint at the top which carries a 2%" (60mm) diameter x 6 swg
                  CHS barrier rail tube by means of a clip assembly.

                  A maintenance repair had been undertaken in the past at joint numbered
■                 20 which consisted of a CHS tube sleeve inserted into the barrier rail.

                  There are signs of surface corrosion in some areas and it is possible

■                 that the strength of the angle legs had at some time been supplemented
                  with additional angle fixtures at foundation level.

            4.0   Failure
■                 The collapse mechanism appeared to follow classic theoretical lines with
                  the progressive formation of plastic hinges at critical locations.

                  The supports and barrier rail had completely failed at joints 4 and 12
                  and the barrier rails exhibited excessive deflections near mid spans of
                  about 7" (170mm).

m
           It is likely that approaching ultimate conditions the rail behaved in a
m          catenary manner creating torsion and longitudinal forces in the frame
           support members.

     5.0   Model Analysis
m
           The barrier construction has been modelled using computer finite element
           techniques. There is no pretence that these yield an exact analysis of
m          the stresses induced and the mode of collapse due to the existence of
           many unknown factors such as failure in the gusset assembly, assumptions
           in member properties, pattern of loading, strain hardening, lever and

■          prying forces, etc.

           Nevertheless within reasonable practical limits the analysis will give a
           good indication of load factors, strengths and particularly stiffness
■          since an accurate comparison can be made with the recorded test
           information data.

           The analysis gives results for the theoretical behaviour of the system
           in the elastic and plastic states of stress.

           Although research into the plastic behaviour of angle members is not
■          complete and the current British Standard.BS 5950 forbids plastic design
           of angles, it is considered that such an approach should give reasonable
           results in this case because the plasticity will occur in areas which
m          are fairly well restrained at foundation and top assembly locations.

           The angle members are also of a 'stocky' section with D/T ratios of
■          about 8.

     6.0   Summary of Results

■          Barrier Hail analysis B124CB1-5

           Some measure of the extreme load acting in the construction can be
■          gauged from the deflection of barrier rails 4-12 and 12-20. These
           developed a near mid-span deflection of 170mm - a value well above
           that corresponding to the onset of plasticity (about 15mm).

■          Space frame analysis of complete structure B124S

           This shows good correlation with the test load figures on deflection
■          (18mm on test (6 KN/m) 15mm analysis (5 KN/m)) and provides a confidence
           limit on the accuracy of the assessment.

^1         Support frame analysis B124A - J

           Indicates a load factor against collapse of over 2.0. Analyses B124B
           (BS 449) and B124D (BS 5950) show that the design would not quite meet
■          current design requirements using standard load factors although there
           would be a strong case for revising these in regard to barrier
           assessment.

     7.0   Conclusions

           The on-going tests carried out in accordance with the safety certificate
           and S at SG guidelines proves the barrier system capable of taking the
           6 KN/m load safety. This is all that is required of the Act.




m
Nevertheless the analysis carried out in this report shows clearly the
additional reserve of strength in the barrier system - about i%x.

The crowd forces involved in this incident can be reasonably deduced
from these calculations but the cause can only be assessed by consider­
ation of many factors yet to be investigated by the Lord Justice Taylor
Enquiry.

Recommendations on Barrier Strength

(1) The design and test load figures specified in the Guide may need to
     be re-assessed although medical evidence may suggest that forces
     applied in excess of these limits would be intolerable.

(2)   It may be of advantage to additionally test load individual barrier
      spans rather than a series of continuous members. This would
      perhaps highlight potential joint and element weaknesses.

(3) Longitudinal or sideways loadings on barrier supports may be
     critical particularly towards the stage of ultimate collapse.
     Members should be rigidly connected in all directions.

                METHOD

                The calibration was carried out in a Grade 0*5 lever arm testing machine                                                                                                 in
                terms of theTechnical unit of force the ton force (tozrf). The uncertainty                                                                                               of
                the forces applied during the calibration is +0.5?*

                Three tests were made on each cylinder.

                Tests were made to determine the reading indicated on the gauge at filed loads.

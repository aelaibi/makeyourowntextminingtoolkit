              On S a t u r d a y   15th April           1989    (150489)      I was       on cfrdty at West Bar Police

              I went to M i d l a n d Raft 1way S t a t i o n to supervise                      loading of buses to

              H i l l s b o r o u g h Focrroall Ground.             I remained there              until    shortly before

              3.00    pm (1500)           w hen   I boarded a bus to the football                       ground,        arriving

              there at a p p r o x i m a t e l y 3 .10          pm <1510).           On arrival       at the ground         I

              attended       the gyrnnas i um "f o r f ui^ylne r i n s t r u c t i o n s , and was direc t e d to

              the Hop end of the ground. / O n arrival                              there    I was    instructed by the

              Inspector        in charge          t\> >yf to the L e p pings Lane               end of the ground due

              to an apparent              pitch       invasion at that             end.     In company with other

              officers       I went to that              end,    initially near             to the    corner at Leppings

              Lane and the           cantilever          stand.      At this         time    I was    under     the

            impression that a pitch invasion was                        in progress,         and began trying           to

            control        and   persuade    the fans to return to the enclosure.                         However

            after a short          time    I realised that          something was ser i o u s l y wrong and

            star t e d to make my way towards                 the goal        at the Leppings Lane             end to

            give what a s s i s t a n c e     I could.       Whilst       checking       various    people who were

            sitting        on the ground obv i o u s l y d i s t r e s s e d      I was a sked by a member              of

            the Fire Brigade             to help    clear an exit             through the terraces            on the old

            condition.           After    some tj/Ke I was         d i r ected by an officer            to form a

            cordon across          the    pitch.     I remained there             for some time         until    1 was

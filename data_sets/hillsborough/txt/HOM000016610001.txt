Thank you for your letter of the 2nd May.

I do appreciate the fact that despite the
pressure of the Inquiry you should take
the time to write in manuscript which shows
the wisdom in your appointment to head the
Public Inquiry.

I am now even more sure that not only will
justice be done, but it will be seen to be
done.




The Rt Hon Lord Justice Taylor
Inquiry into the Hillsborough
Stadium Disaster

s on-!e o reakt ast         8   i c ■ ? at a sma j. 1    ca f e .

we went              to the Car-Park       of the G at e w a y Store,           Halifax Rd S had another

little           sleep.     Then we had a game              of football,

Latsr           in the morning we m oved the van nearer                       to the ground A w e re

d i r ecte d          by the Police       to a car-park             in a side street off Hali f a x Rd,

just       up from the T ravellers                Inn.     This w ould have             been about          11am

(0    1 1 0 0   ).

We wa l k e d around             in the a rea      looking      for a pub, JtSkX A to , couldn* t find

one      until we spoke            to a P o l i ce wo ma n who         said I h ^ y r o ^ - -AWtrirtT'dief i ni tely

be open so we wa l k e d up there.                       I had one        pint.

lhe      place was         packed with both team supporters.                         There was a lot of

high       spirits,        but no drunkeness             to speak       of.

At about id. 15pm ( 1 4 13) we started                     to make        our way to        the ground*             We

received              no Police     di r e c t i o n or escort,        it was     just a mass          of    people

going           towards    the ground.          I saw no disorder             or violence           on the way to

the g round.

We a r ri ve d at the ground at just after 2 . 3 0 p m                          (14J50).             that     time

the queues were                 fairly well       organised.           T h e re w /re    pJyL i cey€f f 1 ce r

standing at each turnstile,                       but    none organising                           e s .Qu r group

sto.od a round outside.                  Some     started to drift            in,    but _I

stayed with                                   talking       to some friends we'd met.

At about 2 . 40pm               (1440)    i decided       to enter        the ground,         oy    that     time

there were a few more                    people    trying      to get      in, & the queues were

beginning             to deteriorate.                                                __

trying           to get to the turnstile.                 The queue was moving                forward,        but    it

just       became a mass            of people.

                 &    I moved to the       right    of the          crush that was building                 up.     I *d

                 decided to wait            to get     in after kick-off,              after      the    crowd had died

                 down.

                 officers         or stewards       checking us as we went                  through.

                 to the bottom the               crowd was     backed up to the end of the tunnel                              &    I

                 realised the            pen was a lr ea dy full.

                 I had had easy access               to the ground,            there was         no rush or            crush

                              suggested we moved further                 forward,          so we weaved our way

                 We were all            swaying about.         Then with one sway we moved forward about

                 4    steps,      but    instead of returning all               the way         it just moved            back about

                 1 step.          The    pressure    just    built      up from behind.              So much so I

                 c o u l d n ’t move at all,         not    even my fingers.               There was        nothing         I could

                  wouldn't.              All       they did was               indicate            to people           to move       back.

                  People         then began               panic & tried to                  climb out             over     the front.               The

For the attention of Mrs Barbara Mills.

Dear Mrs Mills,

I read in the press that two senior policemen are being personally blamed for the terrible
disaster at Hillsborough.

Every decent thinking person knows it must be a dreadful experience to have a member of
your family killed or maimed in a situation such as this, but leaving all that aside and looking
at it fairly, do you really think these two policemen deliberately caused that tragedy?

Obviously, I do not know all of the facts, but where are the drunks and the idiot fans who
were obviously out of control? It occurs to me that they have to accept the major part of the
responsibility. I don't remember seeing any of them in court, and I certainly don't remember
seeing any police officers pushing or shoving the mob forward.

Policemen are decent human beings who do their best under difficult circumstances. They
obviously had to make a quick decision at Hillsborough and maybe they got it wrong. Are
they supposed to be perfect, and if they are not, then are you going to persecute them every
time a awkward decision they have to make goes wrong?

If you do, you will eventually find they will back off from future difficult decisions for fear of
not getting it right, law and order will even less effective than it is at present, then what
happens?

Maybe I am just an old cynic, but I reckon a scapegoat is needed which will then leave the
gates open for massive compensation claims and fat fees for the Robber Barons of the
nineties, i.e. lawyers. Will that bring the loved ones back?

It's ironic really, there are real nasty criminals walking the streets after the police have done
their best to prove them guilty, yet when an officer of the law tries to do his or her job, they
are hounded and prosecuted. Remember the Joy Gardiner case?

Makes one think doesn't it Mrs Mills?


Yours sincerely

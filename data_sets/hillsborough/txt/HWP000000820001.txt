Dear Sir/Madam

RE: JOINT HILLSBOROUGH STATEMENT

I have been requested by the meeting of the Hillsborough Disaster
Working Party held on 21st March to let you have a copy of the
Statement which has now been signed by the Leaders of Liverpool
and Nottingham City Councils, and the Chairmen of Liverpool and
Nottingham Forest Football Clubs concerning the causes of the
Disaster and issued as a formal response to allegations made in
the past year by Sir Bernard Ingham and Mr. Brian Clough that
Liverpool supporters were responsible for the Disaster.
Yours faithfully



Ken Corns
Head of Committee and
Member Services

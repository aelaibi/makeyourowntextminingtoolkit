               Further            to       my    questionnaire             dated           27    June       1989,     <270689)       I took       up    my

               position               on    gate       "A"    at    Sheffield              Wednesdays             Football     Ground,       with

               Jack         S T O N E,      at    about       11.45       am.       (1145)            I then       remained     on    that       gate

               with         Mr    STONE          until       after       the    match           kicked       off .

               During            the       time    that       we    were       on    the        gate,       the    only     persons       that    were

               allowed            in w e r e       uniformed             police,           plain          clothed     police    officers          on

               production                  of    either       a    white       ticket           or    a warrant        card    in a       blue

               plastic            type          cover,       Liverpool          Football              Club       Stewards     and    members       of

               the       St      Johns          Ambulance          Brigade.               Obviously          the     plain    clothed       Police

               Officers               and       Liverpool          Stewards          were           the    only    people     allowed       through

               who       were         in    plain       clothes.           Only           Mr    STONE       or    myself     would    open       the

               gate         for       those       persons          and    this       would           not    have     been    done    by    any    of    the

               police            officers          inside          the    ground.

                                                                                                                                         S3595

There       was       no    police          officers             actually         posted          with       us    at    Gate       “A "      in

any    event,          and    if       we    needed          any       help      we    would       just       ask       for    it       from       one

of    the    officers             on       the    turnstiles               or    one    of    those          patrolling             on

the    concourse             area          behind          the    North         Stand-        There          was    about          half       a

dozen       of    these       officers                and    from       time      to    time       they       did       come       and     have

a    look    through          the          fixed       glass          "peep      hole"       in    the       gate,       particularly

when    the       crowd       built          up       in L e p p i n g s        Lane    and       in    front       of       the    gate.

In    fact       at    about       2.20          pm    (1420)         we       could    not       believe          the       way    the       crowd

had    built          up.

Dealing          with       persons          that          were       officially         let       through          the       gates,          I am

able    to       remember          that          the       last       persons         allowed          through          were       at

about       this       time       that       is       2.20       pm    (1420).          I was          by    the    ’pe ep         hole*          when

a    Police       Sergeant             came       up       accompanied            by    four       other          people       whom        he

wanted       to       take    to       the       first       aid       room      within       the       ground          for    treatment.

He    came       up    in    uniform             and       shouted         out    what       he    wanted          and       X actually

opened       the       gate       for       him       and    the       other      four,       presumably                injured          persons

to    come       through.              I    cannot          describe            these    persons             other       that       they          were

fans    neither             can    I describe                the      Sergeant.              I did          not    see       these       fans          or

the    Sergeant             again.

No    money       was       paid       to    me       to    allow       the      Sergeant          or       the    fans       through,             and

as    far    as       I am    concerned                this       was      a    legitimate             request          by    the       officer.

I did       have       a    number          of    fans       offer         me    money       during          this       afternoon             to

allow       them       entry,          but       that       money       was      not    accepted             by    either          me    or       Hr

STONE       and       none    of       the       police          officers         in    that       area       were       in a       postiion

to    accept          money       to       allow       entry,         even       if    they       wanted          to.

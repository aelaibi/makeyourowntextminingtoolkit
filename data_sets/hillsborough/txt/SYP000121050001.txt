                     ^   The basis of this charge             is that on        the 15 April             1989

                         Chief s u p e r i n t e n d e n t D U C K E N F I E L D having assumed      the

                         role of overall        operational        Police Commander,

                         authorised      the opening of         'the gates'       and in

                         pa rticular Gate C at the Leppings                   Lane side of the

                         ground,'ifaving            taken    that decision,        he failed             to

                         'think it through'          by using his ^lijjwr^ed knowledge

                         of the ground^ taking into account                   the obvious          risks

                         and ensuring       that action was           taken    to ensure          that

                         those supporters         entering      through       that gate were

                         capable of being controlled               and directed
                                                                             in a manner
                                                                               cmb obfecxA*|

                         the ground.



                         That Mr D U C K E N F I E L D had assumed       the role of overall

                         operational       commander has been dealt with previously.



                         It is clear       that he was       aware of the fact           that he had

                         a role    to play on giving          the au th orisation          to open

                         the gates.         In his evidence given on oath at the

                         Inques t :



D1   P . 51   'B/C'      Q.     'Had you any idea w h a t sort of things you m i g h t

                                  have   to take dec i s i o n s on?*

                         A.     '....... s o m e t h i n g m a j o r w h i c h was against

                                  P olicy or the order.*



                         He went on      to acknowledge         that openi ng      the gates:



D1   P . 54   ' B'              •would de f e a t e v e r y t h i n g we had planned in

                                                                                                       =2
                     He was     also aware       that    the Police had a responsibilty

                     for the control           and dir ection of spectators within

                     the ground        :

D1    P.68   'D '    Q.       ’Before      the game b egan did you have any

                               k n owledge as to who w o u l d have            the respons i b i l i t y

                               for the d i r e c t i n g of spec t a t o r s and the co n t r o l l i n g

                               of numbers going onto              the Leppings Lane terraces               ?'

                     A.       ’For the dir e c t i n g of spectators,               I assume    that

                     In short        then,    we know     that Mr D U C K E N F I E L D was    aware

                     that when he authorised                the opening of the gates             the

                     respon sib ilt y of catering for                that decision was          his.

                     The plan,        his plan had been dramat ica lly amended

                     by his d e c i s i o n , (Xm j C^    >1   ujck $>                  cwhc*

                     Although        the charge    relates        to the contucfcf of the

                     Chief Supe rin ten de nt         subsequent          to the opening of

                     Gate     1C'    it is essential           to have some knowledge           of

                     the events which lead               to the request and his subsequent

                     au tho ris ati on       for the gates        to be opened.



                     At some        time between 2.27 p.m.               and 2.30 p.m.    that day

D1     P . 47 'G*    a request was           received    in the control        box for Leppings

                     Lane     to be closed       to vehic ula r          traffic.     He was

D.1    P . 48 'D '   aware of       the gra nti ng of that request but took no

                     steps     to countermand         it.       He did however accept           that

                     he   'Paused for         thought'      as a result:



                     Q.       ’Did it alarm you w hen             that came     through ?'
A.     *1 think w h a t I did,     I was s t a nding towards       the

       b ack because,      as you p r o bably know,        that control

        is a little bit c o n fined and I got the i mpression

        if I stood at the front I was in p e o p l e ’s way,

       just pure ly physically,         not by b e i n g a senior

       o f f i c e r but by b e i n g stood there.         I remember

        turning to my left and looking at the video

        screen thinking,       'What does he w a n t Leppings

        Lane clos ed for?'         It was that sort of thought

        -   ’W hat does he wan t that closed for?*              The

        reason I remember the bus is I saw a bus going

        past and I thought,        ’Well why does he want

        Leppings Lane closing if the bus can go past

        and there aren't any d i f f i c u l t i e s ? ’     That was

        the sort of thought process going through my

        mind -     ' W h a t ’s it all about?*    - and I can

        remember doing that.



One must be left wo n d e ri ng why as the operational

co mmander with all       the experience      around him,      he simply

did not ask.



We also     know   that at 2.30 p.m.      the Chief Su perintendent

was aware of the location of the crowd on the Leppings

Lane   terrace:



Q.     ’At that point had you noti c e d the filling of

        the stadium at all ?'

A.     '......     But the Leppings Lane         terrace    that was

       f i l l i n g more so in the c e n t r e .......... But I

       have an i m p r e s s i o n that we had the normal

       sort of 2.30 -ish sit u a t i o n of filling
         c e n trally and space more so on the side shall

         we s a y .'



The following          ten minutes    to 2.40 p.m.     can be quiet

adequately dealt with by reference                 to evidence

given at the Inquest:



Q      *1 am deal i n g w i t h the period      to 2.40 and by

         2.40 you had had the request for the Leppings

         Lane to be closed,          had you not,     that is certainly

         the c a s e ? ’

A.     'Yes     Sir.•

Q.     ’You     had had the request         for further moun t e d

         a ssistance       that is cer t a i n l y the case?'

A.     'Yes     Sir.»

Q.     ’You     had had the send i n g of the reserve serial

         and    you had had the request         for the tannoy

         messages       to the crowd?'

A.     'Yes     Sir.»



At 2.40 p.m.       the radio communica tio ns         broke down

and were       immediat ely    attended     to by an engineer,       who

res tored communica tio ns         albiet    he was obliged      to leave

the system on a 'Talk through'               system which     allowed

all officers with in          the area    to talk to and listen

to each other but gave            the control      room no priority

facility       to interupt     the system when someone else

was    speaking.



When    the radio      communica tio ns were       restored   at around

2.40 p.m. Mr D U C K E N F I E L D was    aware:
                                                                                                       5

                      Within     the follwing few minutes                 the control box was

                      faced with one or more               requests from Supt. Marshall

                      for    the gates      to be opened.              At the Inquest

                      Mr D U C K E N F I E L D explained      how he reacted         to the request:



D1   P . 53   ’A*           '....... I turned and looked and thought                     ’What

                            does he w a n t       the gates o p e n i n g for?*          An

^                           absolute shock.              As I turned and looked               the

                            gate b urst o p e n . '



                      We know from         the video T.B.2.            that     the time of     this

                      event was       2.48 p.m.          By 2.49 p.m.           the gate had been

                      closed and Mr D U C K E N F I E L D       told     the inquest:



D1   P . 53   'D'           '.......that m a t t e r was fin a l s i e d in my m i n d . ’



                      Once again       the question must be asked - Why did
                                                   aw
                      the Chief S.uperintendent^make,enquiry of some kind

                      as to why       this event had occurred.



                      Within     the fo ll owing        three minutes Mr D U C K E N F I E L D was

                      faced with       the demand        for the gates           to be opened or:



D1   P . 53   'G'           'If you d o n ’t open the gates,                  someone is g oing to

                            get k i l l e d . '



                      The pres en ta tio n        accept     that he was         faced   at that stage

                     with an enourmous             decision -and— that within— feto&e-

                    — thr ee m i n u t e s— k-e— g a v e— the -mat fc-er— serious— consideration-
so touch so that he had to be asked by Supt Murray

for his decision.               Nr DUCKEHFIELD told the inquest *



     'I was stood there thinking about that and the

      enormity of that decision, and thinking,                          *If

      I don't open the gates people are going to get

      killed.1          ThenMr. Murray - the atmosphere in

      the control box, to say it was a football ground

      with probably 50,000 in it, and we talk frequently

      about noise etc., to use a well worn phrase

      you could hear a pin drop.                     The atmosphere

      was electric.             I was stood there and 1 was asked

      to make that decision and it seemed as though the

      world had stopped.                Mr Murray then said to me

       •Mr Duckenfield are you going to open the gates?'

      As you can imagine, whatever rigid plans people

      might have had, whatever policies you might have,

      if it means saving lives and preventing injury then

      you do your level best, don't you, to save people's

      lives?        So I gave the order to open the gates.'



T ha t o r d e r was g iven o u t by the control                room s t a f f

and self imposed i n t e n t i o n of the day was                  to e n s u r e

the sa f e t y of s u p p o rters.
                       We know from evidence of video material                            that Gate          *C *
                                                                                                                    7
                       opened       at 2.52 p.m and              that his     thinking at that           time

                       was    that      the fans could be accomodated on the concourse:



D1   P.58   !B'              'My r e c o l lection sir is that there was space

                              in the concourse and if that gate was opened I

                              could save peoples lives.



D2 p . 23   ’C - E ’   At this         stage Mr D u c k e n f i e l d was       in the control box.

                       He had a view of Gate                    *C * on the CCTV monit or          and

                       of fans entering                  through    that gate.         He also had

                       a view from                the control box onto          the terrace,       a view

                       which was          supplemented by the CCTV system by a camera

                       ov e r lo oki ng           the   terrace.



                       It is at this stage                  that the p r ese nt ati on       submit      that

                       he as     the overall              operational      commander should have

                       detached         himself,          thought    the matter       through and ensured

                       that action was being                    taken   to secure      the safety of

                       both    the supporters               entering and        those already        in the

                       ground.



                       He    told      the inquest:

We kno w from 2.52 p.m. w hen Gate                      ' C 1 wa s o p e n e d     he

 instead     busied      h i m s e l f w i t h various o ther           r e quests.




 Within     the f o l l o w i n g    two minu t e s a requ e s t w a s m a d e

 by Pol i c e C o n s t a b l e     B u x t o n who was o u t s i d e     the

 Leppings      Lane    t u r n s t i l e s ,for the kick off            to be

 delayed.



 He had     arrived      in L e p p i n g s    Lane at 2.46 p.m.             and

 after p o s i t i o n i n g his       l a n d r o v e r vehi c l e and    carried

out v a r i o u s o ther a c t i v i t i e s      he made wha t he c l a i m e d

 to be his       request and was              told almost i m m e d i a t e l y

by Sgt.      G O D D A R D that      it was     too late b e c a u s e       the    t eams

we r e on the pitch.                 We know      therefore      that      this

r e q u e s t was made      at a b o u t      2.54 p.m.



In his e v i d e n c e to the           inquest Chief Inspector CREASER

stated      that it was he wh o               had asked     PC B U X T O N      to m ak e

the r e q u e s t but it w o u l d         ap p e a r that his a u t h o r i t y         as

the gro u n d c o m m a n d e r in that area was not added                         to

the     request.



We know from video            evidence         that Gate      'A' was open at

2.58 p.m.      and    that shortly prior              to this a messa ge                had

been    received      from Sgt Higgins stationed behind                          that

gate,    implying      that it was            about   to collapse due              to the

crowd    pressures       outside.
                  The Chief S up er int en den t allowed himself                 to be

                  distracted:



D2 P. 17   'EF'   Q.      'After the gates had been opened did you not

                           put into your min d that there w o u l d be a c o nnection

                           be tween the e n t e r i n g of the gates and the condition

                           of the Leppings Lane Terrace?'

                  A.      'Sir,   I have just said I recall to mind,                     if you

                           w ill bear w i t h me a m o m e n t w h i l e I just collect

                           mu thoughts on this,          I have a view that as soon

                           as gate C ---      I am sorry,        I have a v iew as soon

                           as the gates w ere opened there was a n o t h e r di s t r a c t i o n

                           and    that d i s t r a c t i o n was that someone came over

                           the radio and said         'If you don't open gate               'A' it

                           is g o i n g in anyway.'         Now,    I don't think I knew

                           w here gate A was actually,             but someone       then passed

                           a comment that that was the gate to the North

                           Stand,   and I think the pr e s u m p t i o n was that whe n

                           they said open the gates,             that m eant every gate

                           so on a personal note I was d i s t r a c t e d because

                           of the m e s s a g e coming in there and my min d being

                           taken over by that event.'



                  Within    two minut es     of Gate     'A' being opened           the

                  dis tur ban ce on    the pitch had been noticed                 and Chief

                  I n s p e c t o r M c R o b b i e had been directed     from    the control

                  box   to the pitch      to investigate.            We know from

                  video    evidence    that he was on the pitch at 3 p.m.

                  and   that by 3.07 p.m.        S o u t hY or ks hi re   Police    Force

                  Control    Room was being asked           to implement Operation

                  Support.
It is at the        time     that C hief S u p e r i n t e n d e n t D U C K E N F I E L D

decided     that he would           acceed       to the request         to open

the gates       that      this    presentation       submit      that his

neglige nc e     in this mat te r began.                 A prudent       commader

would    have    thought         the decision       through bearing in

mind    the geo graphy of           the ground,        considered         the

risks    and    taken action          to avaoid       them.



We must     therefore examine what Mr D c u k e n f i e l d knew

He knew he had a large crowd outside:



Q.      'First of all,            you knew before          the o r d e r for

         the gates         to be opened was m ade that there

         was a large crmwd outside the gates?'

A.      'I a g r e e .'

Q.      'You k new that the co n s e q u e n c e of o p e n i n g the

         gates was to introduce that large crowd onto

         the concourse?'

A.      'I did'

Q.       'And they w o u l d be intr o d u c e d in one mass;                   they

          w o u l d not be i n t r o d u c e d through turnstiles,                 and

          you k new that?'

A.      'Yes.'



He knew of      the div idi ng wall on              the concourse:



Q.       'You w o u l d have been aware from you r w a l k round

        the ground that that was                  the position,          w o u l d you

        not?'

A.      'That the d i v i d i n g         wall was in       that area?'

Q.      'Yes.'

A.      'I knew of         the d i v i d i n g   wall, yes.'
                                      He was also aware of the location of the tunnel
                                                                                                                               //
  D1        P73       'F'             Q.      'As overall com m a n d e r in charge of the game you

                                                 not say i n g seriously,              are you,    that you were

                                                 ignorant of the e x istance of that tunnel

                                                 l e a d i n g down into the centre area of the

                                      A.      'No,



                                      U n f or t una te ly Mr D u c k e n f i e l d has never been asked

                                      of his      pe rception of the two centre                   pens at this stage

                                      but we do know as quoted earlier he was                          aware   that   the

                                      centre pens were filling first.                           He should   however

                                      have applied               that knowledge        to his    thinking which he

                                    A.           At that stage,             sir,    I was   totally consumed by

                                                 the deci s i n to save lives and my only thoughts

                                                 wer e    that people w ould go onto               the c o ncourse

                                                 After that I didn't have a picture.'
                   That    total    consumption was      again me ntioned by the

                   Chief Su pe rin ten de nt at the inquest:

 D1   P57    'F'   Q.      'Did you y o u r s e l f give any d irections or

                            i n s t r uctions w i t h regard to putt i n g serials

                            of officers      in specific locations?'

                   A.      'The situation,       sir, was such that I was

                            totally c o ncsumed by the decis i o n that there

                            was.      As I said earl i e r it was        totally

                            u n p r e c e d e n t e d and outs i d e my e x perience and

                            I was    tota lly focused on that at that stage.'



                   Having made       the decision he should have concentrated

                   on   the obvious        risks which were a matter of common

                   sense    in the circumstance,         such as:

 D1   P8    'A'    Q.      'Were you not ignor i n g the o b v i o u s risk that if you

                            in troduced such a large number of people into

                            the concourse,       the obvious      risk that a large number

                            of people w o u l d mak e their wa y down the tunnel

                            into the centre pens,         w h i c h w ere on any view

                            alre a d y such that there was no room for such

                            a large nu m b e r of people?'

                   A.       Mr.    King,   it was not obvious       to me that those

                            p eople w ere at risk.'



D2 P24       'B'   Q.      'Where did you      think those people w ould end up

                            w h i c h part of the gr o u n d g e n e r a l l y for the moment?

                   A.      'I had no idea w h e r e they w ould end u p , ....... '



D2 P26       'B'   Q.      'Just let me deal w i t h the tunnel for the m o m e n t

                            The tunnel - and you w ould kno w this and see thi5

                            from your v i s i t to the ground - was clea r l y seen

                   w h e n you are on the concourse,          was   it not?
                      A.       'Yes S i r . '

                      Q.        'You would not disagree,             it is not contraversial

                                if I say to anybody on the c o ncourse is an

                                obvious route onto           the terrace,        w ould you

                                agree w i t h that?'

                A.              'Yes.'



                The simple          facts of      the matter are        that     the Chief

                S up eri nt end en t       failed     to consider any of           these and

                also       failed    to take any action           to ensure       that the

                amendement          to his plan       could be catered           for by

                informing        those he was         relying on      to act upon         it.



                He did not          inform his ground          commanders of        the decision

                he had       taken:



 D2 P12   'G'   Q.         'You did not         give any in f o r m a t i o n before o r d e r i n g

                            the o p e n i n g of the gates      to Mr Gr e e n w o o d who was

                            the ground c o m m a n d e r     on the ground level,           did you ?'

                A.         'No s i r . '



                There       is no evidence          to suggest      that Chief Inspector

                CREA S E R the man directly                responsible     for    that area

                was    informed of the decision.



                He did not inform any of the Sheffield Wedn es da y                             Football

                Club officials             of his decision:



D2 P13    'E'   Q.         'You did not         y o u r s e l f cause or think about causing

                            any m e s s a g e to be sent to the club or their

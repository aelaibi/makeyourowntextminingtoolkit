                On Saturday,            15 A p r i l ,      1989    <15 0 4 8 9 )        I was     on d u t y at H i l l s b o r o u g h

                travelled          to S h e f f i e l d     from p C r n s i e y         by m y    own      car,     I a r r i v e d at

                Sheffield         at    about        9am    (0900)       and      parked my           car    in th e      premises         of

                Carlton Pres                  i ch    is    located       on     the      road     f r o m Penistttnt R o a d

                this       time    there      were        several       Liverpool          supporters           wandering           around.

                At    9 . 4 5 a m (0945)      I attended           at    the     North       stand and          joined       my     s er i a l ,

                car     in o r d e r    to    collect        my w a t e r p r o o f        jacket.          Once    again      f an s f r o m

                Liverpool         were       in a n d      around       the    Herries        R o a d area.           F a s t food

                mobiles       were      ready        to    sell    refreshments.                  After      collecting            my    coat we

                proceeded         to L e p p i ngs L a n e         from Penistone                 Road and         onto     th e    junction

                with Fielding             Road       and Leppings             L a ne .

                Upon arrival           we     s et    up    barriers          at a b o u t    1 0 . 4 5 a m <1045)* in o r d e r           to

                to    control       the      flow     of    pedestrians.                          C

                By    this    time     Liverpool           and N ottingham                 fans       had    begun    to a r r i v e a n d
were    asking          for     d i r e c t ions        to    public        houses           and       off-licences.                    We

tried       to    explain         that       local       pubs       were     closed              or    only     open       for      local

residents.              This      did       not    deter       t h e m as m a n y            stated          that        it w a s       early

and    they would walk                   a mile         or    so    for     a drink.

At    this       time    the      mood       of    the       fans     was    very           cheerful          and        jokes      were

being       made    f r o m al l         quarters.             During        the           next       four     hours       the

following          ©vents         I remember             took       place       but         not       necessarily            in

tickets          were    changing            hands       for       between          thirty and               fifty        pounds.

Inspectors          and        ranks        above       were       in a b u n d a n c e          outside        t he      ground         early

Fans    were       arriving            up L e p p i n g s      Lane       (Liverpool                  fans)     and       were

carrying          bottles         and       cans    of       beer     and    lager.                  Several        by    t hi s    time

were    the w o r s e          for     drink       a n d at        one    p o in t         two       fans    of a b o u t     2 0 yir&rs

were    asleep          on     th e    pavement          in L e p p i n g s         Lane         opposite           Fielding            Road

and were          in a s t a t e         that      I could          only     call           drunk an d          incapable.

As    time       progressed more                  and more          fans     arrived and many                        were     very

boisterious,             throwing            food and          litter        a r o u n d as w e l l             as       swearing            and

chant in g .

Fans    were       turning            up w i t h o u t       tickets        and were                 asking     other        fans        if

they    had       spare        tickets.            This      at     the     time           sounded          like     " S p u r s ’ a n d we

Lane.        I could           say     that       I saw about             H00       different               people        asking         for

a b o u t 2 h o ur s .

By    1.3 0 p m      (1330)      there       were          hoards        of       people       on L e p p i n g s      Lane         and

many asking             for    toilets           as    there       w as       already massive                   queues         forming

outside         the     turnstiles           on L e p p i n g s          L a ne .

At a b o u t      2.10pm       (1410)        I remarked              to PC P a t t e r s o n             that     the      train

carrying          Liverpool           supporters             was     just          pulling        into W a d s ley B r i d g e

walking         in a m o n g s t      the    traffic          because              of    their      sheer        numbers            they

Club    Stewards             from Sheffield Wednesday                              persistently             tried         to       park

their       cars       in F i e l d i n g    Road,          which        by       n ow wa s      already         full      with

us.      If t h e y        treat      us    as     they      di d w h a t          would       they      treat      the        fans

like.        Many       used     an    excuse          that     their             boss     had    given         them      permission

to    park w h e r e         they wanted and were                        not       slow     to d r o p      names         of       certain

Inspectors             in the       fo r c e .        However        they          left     and     found        suitable

packing         elsewhere.

The    t i me     by    n ow w as      about          2.20pm       (1420)           a n d we      ha d    dealt        with a.^ot

of    people         who     were     not    very a m u s e d            with       both       the P o l i c e      and        stewards

at    the    turnstiles.               Many Liverpool                    and Nottingham Forest                         fans         showed

us    tickets          and were        generally             convinced              that       they      h ad   gone       to       the

wrong       entrances.              Many,        and       I would        sa y      to    be     conservative,                 about          500

people      stating           that     they        h ad     tickets           for       seats     in the        North          stand          and

because         of     the    prefix        letters          before           their       seat     numbers,            had         been

told    that         they     had     to    go     into      the     football             ground         via    the       turnstiles

on P e n i s t o n e       Road.       These          were    Liverpool                 supporters         and      it wa s

obvious         by     their     accents.              After       being           sent     down Leppings                 Lane       and
                                                                   ' A        '
onto      the     turnstiles                on P e n i s t o n e          Road        they were               rather          dismayed when

they      came       back           and    sa w    the m a s s           of     people         waiting,           or       rather             pushing

to get      in.

By about          2.45pm             (1445)        the     crowds             were       so    immense           outside             the

turnstiles                in L e p p i n g s       Lane        that       I remarked                to PC P a t t e r s o n              that           no

be    having          little          effect         in    controlling                   the     crowds.

Fans      were        climbing             over      fences          and walls                but    I cou.ldn't                  say whe t h e r

Some       fans        came       ou t       of    the      ground and                 remarked           that       a    pitch       invasion

was     in p r o g r e s s .               These        were      Notts.              Forest       supporters.                  Over       the     next

and     after          several             beat      cars a r r i v e d ,              some       from A Division,                    we    began

to a s k         them       questions              as     to w h a t        had        happened.               We    got       the    impression

that       there        was       trouble            within        the           ground        and       a message             had    been       sent

o ut    to       get    every available                      man       to        the    ground.            This          had    been       done        so

 quickly          that       there           was     a distinct                  smell       of    burning           clutches           from       the

 cars.           I looked             b ac k      u p the      road         to        see    my    colleague              Graham Patterson

and     several             other          officers          waiting              around.

 I returned             back          to     the     barrier           at        the    top       of F i e l d i n g       Road with

. Le p pi n g s    Lane          and       asked Graham                if        he    knew what was                 going        oru

Naturally              he    d i d n ’t h a v e           much     of a n             idea.

Residents              came       out        of    the      houses          and were              stood        looking           rather            <

 shocked.              I went           to     one      lady a n d all                 she     could       t e l l tne w a s          that       it

was     terrible             and        these        were      people             d e a d , but          she     didn't         fill       in a n y

 detaiIs.

 I returned             to       th e      barriers          and       watched              the L i v e r p o o l         fans       spill       back

out     onto       Leppings                Lane,          Many     initially were                        very distressed,                   tears

were       freely           flowing            and      there      w as       a great             deal     of a g g r e s s i o n          being

shown        towards             th e      Police.

 I remained             behind             the     barriers            oblivious               to w h a t        w as     happening           and

tried my           best          to     soak       in w h a t      h ad       hapened             in the         football            ground.

Ambulances              were          trying         to     get    up L e p p i n g s             Lane     being          led     in t u r n       by

either        a Police                motorcycle             or a t r a f f i c              car.         Th e      fans       were     not

prepared           to m o v e           to     one      side      to    let           the    emergency              services          through.

As m o r e        fans       c am e        onto      the    street           we        were       m et   with        fa n s     who were

exceptionally                    aggressive               and were               calling          us     from       fucking          bastards           to

c u nt s     and anything                    linked.           Our      so        called          incompetence                 and    all     we

were       doing was              standing              around         while           their       friends           lay       d e a d a n d ;we
didn't        care.        Of    course         we    did       care     but       they       knew more             t h a n we        did.

A    lot m o r e ,

When     there       were       so m a n y      people          on     the    streets            we w e r e        getting        a    lot

of a g g r o    from       the     residents            to      stop     them          coming       from Leppings                 Lane

end     into F i e l d i n g       R o ad .       As m o r e         protests          were       aimed        p e r s o n a l l y a t me

and     insults          several       fans       spat       in our          general          direction.               Insults             an d

abuse      were      constantly             hurled         at     us    and when             threats          were    administered

I really        f el t     threatened.                We w e r e        alone,          no    radios          to. call       for       help,

nowhere        to    go    or    h id e     and      I felt          frightened,              so m u c h       so    I had        hold

of m y     staff         and    if a n y o n e       ha d a t t a c k e d         me    I would          have       used     it

without        notice.           I feared            for     my      safety        so m u c h as we                were     so

helpless,            I remember             seeing         a sergeant              who       I don't          know     stood          in

front      of me.          He    was      trying        to      calm     the       area       d o w n as we          tried        to

allow      Doctors,            nurses       and      fire       personnel              into      Fielding           Road     in o r d e r

to    keep Leppings              Lane       open       for      the     emergency             services.              While        I moved

the     barriers          out    th e L i v e r p o o l         fans     did       nothing          to    help       only        jostled

and     insulted          us as       well      as     p u s h th e      sergeant             away.

During        this       barage       a woman         ran a c r o s s         the       r oa d    from S h e n t a l 1 Road                  and

said     to    us    that, a m a n          had      collapsed           in her          house.           Immediately                 PC

Patterson and              myself         attended           at                                          to    find       a man

having an           epileptic          fit      in her          house.            I remembered                my    first        aid and

put    the m a n         in a    recovery            position           while          I tried       in v a i n        to    ring          for

an ambulance.                  Eventually            I got        through and about                      20 minutes              l a t e r an

ambulance           attended          and      took     the m a n w h o            I only         k n o w as

from Halifax              away     to H o s p i t a l        who       was    still          in d e e p       shock.         He       ha d

rung     home       to    say    he    was      fine and a fte r                  ringing         off     went       into        an

epileptic           fit.        I obtained a telephone                            number         from     him and           said       I

would     try a nd         ring       h om e    for     him.

                         ha t    we    had       some       property          w h i c h was       handed          to    us

personally         in the        day       to    hand       to    central           control.

We     then went       into      the       ground          sti l l     not    aware        of w h a t       had    occurred

P r o p e r t y was    handed         to a s e r g e a n t           a n d we       then    looked          for    a

telephone.            1 remember            looking           through         the     passageways             under          the

North     stand and         seeing          debris          scattered           o n the         floor.

I proceeded           towards         the       gymnasium            in o r d e r     to    find a          phone       and       once

inside      I was     met       by a m a s s          of    people       standing           around.           As       I walked

through       I was       aware       of    bags       of     clothes         and     directly          behind          I s a w one

foody on the          floor      apparently                being       searched.            Curiosity             got    the       better

of me a n d      I noticed            rows       of d e a d       bodies        with       no    real       Outside

injuries.         I w a s n ’t a w a r e          that        they were            d e a d at     this       time.           I just

remember       feeling          numb.           I eventually             found a           p ho n e    and    tried          to    get

an     outside     line     to    no a v a i l .            As     I h un g     the    phone          up a    policewoman                in

the     police     r oo m w e n t      hysterical                and    I knew        something             was    wrong          but

what     I d i d n ’t kno w .          I proceeded                w i t h PC       Patterson           to    C 1a y w h e

where     I awaited         the       rest       of    our       serial.           Eventually           retiring             from

duty     at 6 . 4 3 p m    (1845).              On my way            back     to     the    car       I remembered                seeing

a helicopter          hovering             over       the     ground.           Once       alone       in m y      car       and

travelling        back      home       I remember                listening          to R a d i o       Hal l a m .

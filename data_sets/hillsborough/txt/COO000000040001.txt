                 recommendations were directed to the crini              sudh as the
                 creation of new offences covering specific
                 misbehaviour at football matches, the extensli

                  In discussion with the Prime Minister and interest
                  he had concluded that the Government should accept
                  Taylor’s findings and move swiftly to irrpleroent a^pac
                  measures based on his reccxmriendations. The enabling ;
                  Fart I of the 1989 Act should, however, remain on the
                  Book in case it became desirable to proceed with a




                            fCONFiP£Nnr>AM
scheme at a latex date.

In discussion the following points were made:

a.    Ihe findings and conclusions in the report were open to
question.    For example, the thesis that poor behaviour was the
result of poor facilities at grounds was not consistent with the
fact that behaviour at Batches had been perfectly satisfactory
  ten facilities at grounds had been inudh less developed than
   :y were now.

     A nuniber of the recexnraendations in the report were of
         value. For example, the proposed new criminal offences
      add little of substance to the existing law and would be
di5$icult for the police to enforce. Ihe recommendations
differed in scrae respects frcra those of Mr Justice Pqpplewell
following the Bradford fire disaster, in part no doubt because
of the di#£§&ent nature of the events involved. Further
consider-*(&o4|inight well suggest that a different view would be
accepted's^pS^onger term and it was noteworthy that the
report ccsurrBqte^favourably on the membership arrangements at
Daton Footb^^^firo. Nevertheless the recommendations would be
initially attM^J^.to the public.

c.   The shor             the report might encourage si^portexs
of the proposed fc                  Lp scheme to urge that the
Government should            ground. Nevertheless, it would not
be practicable to pr            with the scheme in the face of
Lord Justice Taylor’s             and of the undertakings given
that, before a national-'          Lp scheme vas introduced, there
would be further cppor      S ^ ’Sfor Parliament to express a view
in the light of the         ^p^ings.
d,   ihe improvements                the report would be very
costly for the clubs. Althc             »rt discussed various tax
concessions, it did not reconroers            financial
assistance to the clubs which, as^    report pointed out, had
very substantial sums at their ddU teal, for exanple from the
sale of television rights.

e.   The leak of sane of the content of         >rt in advance of
the statement which the Heme Secretary p!          make on its
publication was very unfortunate. There             to be
pressure to bring forward the statement,              was,
hwever, constrained by the need to have              itionally
sufficient printed copies of the report. Enqu:             being
made to see if, for the future, scxm means caul             of
enabling the very rapid printing of reports of

THE PRIME MINISTER, summing up the discussion, said
clear that lord Justice Taylor's report was flawed in
of respects. There could, however, be no question of
with the National Membership Scheme in the face of Ijordi
Taylor's findings. Nevertheless, these findings related




          [c o n fid e n tia l !
               ICONfJUfcN.i fAl»I



a particular form of the scheme: Part I of the Football
Spectators Act 1989 was an enabling provision and it should
remain on the Statute Book for later use if necessary. To
proceed in this way would be consistent with the \mdertakings
given during the passage of the 1989 Act. The remainder of lord
Justice Taylor's findings endorsed the Government5s argument
          primary responsibility for the present situation lay
          football clubs, and his recommendations built on
          ready put in hand or urged by the Government, While it
           be right to anticipate the Hone Secretary8s statement
          wing Jfcnday, the timing of which had already been
     meed, these points could be brought out suitably in
     l^se to any questions about the report.

               I live at the above a d d r e s s wit h my wife and family.                            I have     lived at

              this ad dr e s s       for 3 and a half years.

              At ab out       10.00am on S a t u r d a y        15th April      1989 I t r a v e l l e d to S h e f f i e l d

              f rom Liv er po ol         by motor     car.       I t r a v e l l e d with

                                                                                drove.       We went wit h the

               i n te nt io n to w a t c h the Semi            Final   of the F .A. C u p betw e e n Liverpool

              a n d N o t t i n g h a m Forrest.       I had a ticket           for the m a t c h for the

              L e p p i n g s Lane S t a n d i n g w h i c h    cost me      6.00p.         I went towards       the

               turnstile         just    inside the blue          gate.      There was a        lot of S u p p o r t e r s

               inside where          I was and a Police Horse was                  inside      trying to control

               the S u p p o r t e r s   into sections.           The Police       horse      stood on my right

               foot a n d broke my toe a n d a bone on my in step.                            My foot was

               bleeding and my shoe was                split so I wa l k e d a r o u n d towards            the S o u t h
                                                                                                     P AG E         S


Stand.       There were two Po lice O f f i c e r s            standing at a small         barrier

an d they told me to try and get back through the                             crowd.     Whe n   I

looked back        I saw I w o u l d not get th rough as all                  I could see was a

mass    of people.           The   gate at the side just              past the turnstile was

op en ed and      I w a l k e d thro u g h    I met      up wit h                         and    I

e v e n t u a l l y went to the tunnel and whe n               I looked down the tunnel               I saw

it was     full    so I wa l k e d back.           I was standing        on the steps waiting

for the other          two    lads who       I went wit h w h e n      I saw Michael D a v i d K e l l y

come th ro u g h the turnstiles.                  He was on his own a n d        I spoke     to him.               He

said,     he was going         into the ground terracing a n d said that he might                              see

me   later.       I never      saw him a g a i n after        that.      This was at about a

minute     past three.             I then went      to the S o u t h S t a n d end of the West

S t a n d and a st eward told me to sit down on a seat                        near     to the exit            in

the S o u t h Stand.          I remained there            for the time of the disast er a n d the

game    being s t o p p e d . W h e n    I went    into the ground        I did not hand my ticket

into an y official as               I was    injured and a Police Offi c e r            saw my injury

a n d d i r e c t e d me   into the S o u t h Stand.

I still      have my ticket             number    150489 w h i c h    I passed to                                  (

Item No         ) (Exhibit No                ).    LLS    17-31     Ticket.

 IT WAS ANYTHING ELSE.     I ALSO SAW THE POLICE FORM A LINE IN FRONT OF TH

 AFTER THE MATCH WAS STOPPED?

 INITIALLY I DON'T THINK THE POLICE KNEW WHAT WAS HAPPENING.          THE SUPPOR

 WHO GOT ONTO THE PITCH WERE OBVIOUSLY DISTRESSED AND THE MATCH WAS THEN

 STOPPED BY A POLICEMAN, SO FROM THEN ON THEY MUST HAVE REALISED WHAT WA|

 HAPPENING.    THE ONLY PEOPLE APPEARING TO HELP WERE THE FANS THEMSELVES

 THE ST JOHNS AMBULANCE.     ALL THE TIME THERE WERE A GREAT AMOUNT OF OFF I

 THE PITCH,   SOME FORMED A LINE ACROSS THE PITCH, WHILST ALL THE TIME IT

 VERY OBVIOUS THAT SOMETHING WAS WRONG.       SO OBVIOUS THAT THE SUPPORTERS

 RUNNING WITH BOARDS RIPPED UP FROM THE GROUND.        THERE WERE NO ANNOUNCEM

 M A D E , IF THERE HAD BEEN, THEN THE LINE THAT HAD BEEN FORMED W O U L D N 0T HA

 NEEDED AS THE NOTTINGHAM FANS WOULD HAVE UNDERSTOOD WHAT WAS HAPPENING.

             i am a                                                                 in Liverpool,      I have

             t:een a supporter of Liverpool Football Club since                      I was a schoolboy

             and I am currently a season ticket holder for the Kop at Anfield,

             On either the Tuesday or Wednesday before the Hillsborough semi final

             I    went dawn to Anfield and collected my                  6   ticket for the Leppinqs

             Lane standing at Hi 1 lsfcorougn.

             On Saturday 13th April             1989 I set out for Hillsborough in my friend

                                    ;ar.      Thera were five of us in the car.             I don't know

             who the other 3 were.              We went on the M6S to Sheffield*            We stopped at

             Bartonwood Services for fuel.

             We had a good run into Sheffield itself»                        There were -a lot of

             Policemen about on the roads into Sheffield.                        We arrived in Sheffield

             between 1.30pm and E'.OOpm.             We parked the car about £—3 miles from the
ground.

vie   had intended to stop for a drink at a pub on the way to the ground.

However when we got to the pub it was boarded up.           I*ie had a hamburger

and carried on to the ground.

We arrived at the ground outside the Leppings Lane entrance at about

2.30pm.        1 saw crowds of people   in front of ms as is normal at a big

football match.        I can remember a lot of Nottingham Forest hats being

throwR a b o u t .

It then became apparent that there were         no Policemen around that

area.      The crowd was in go q d hurnour «

We made our way towards the outer gates.          People asked us what tickets

we had and we said they were for entrance 8.           That was the

furthest entrance away from us.

We made our way towards that entrance.         I can remember two distinct

crowds of people.          One crowd was packed against the turnstiles at

entrance B and the other crowd was in the street being separated from

the crowd at the turnstiles by a Police         horse.

I got pushed up against a Police horse.         The rider was going berserk

trying to keep the two crowds separated.          He was telling people to get

ba c k .

I managed to duck under the Police horse and 1 joined the crowd

directly outside the turnstiles.          The five of us were all still

t o ge t h e r .

It was about this time that the policeman on the horse came up trying

to keep the crowds apart.          I yaw him have to spur his way out of the

crowd before he was overwhelmed.

We were then subjected to a crushing pressure as the crowd pressed on

to us from b e h i n d «

      snort while after one of our friends           fainted as a result of

this pressure.        He passed out right next to me             mother    friend.
                                                                        PAGE


held him up from behind.       1 turned round.and held him upright with my

knee under his crotch.       I ’ve been in greater   crushes than that one.         I

remember seeing a couple of men get up on a wall to escape the crush

and I saw them pulling people up out of the crowd.          The same people

were on the news      report that I saw later.

I eventually got to a turnstile.       1 went in backwards as I was still

holding |______ up.    I fell over the turnstile backwards.       A Policeman

inside looked down at me and said,       "I hope you've got a ti cket.”    1

had the ticket in my hand and the Policeman tore off the stub and gave

me my portion back.      By this time the others had all got in and                 1

had recovered sufficiently to walk.

We went to the toilet at the back of the stand next to the tunnel.              I

only saw one Policeman when I got in the ground and that was the one

who had asked me for my ticket.       I ca n’t remember seeing any stewards.

8y this time it was about 2.45pm.

When 1 came out of the toilet we walked through the tunnel          into the

standing area I d i d n ’t see any signs directing me to the right around

the side of the stand into the side enclosures.

We walked through the tunnel under the stand.         There were not crowds

of people   in there, we had a free passage through.

At the end of the tunnel we came up against the back of a huge crowd.

             ~1 said lets go left and so we went into Pen 4.

We drifted into the crowd towards the left of the goal and past the

first barrier,     I c ou ldn ’t go to where   I wanted because the crowd was

so dense.

When I came into the vicinity of the second barrier.          I had lost my

friends we were    really packed.    This was about 3 o ’clock,    the teams

had been announced and were      coming on to the pitch then.

There was a lad in front of me who had turned and faced me.           He was

right on the edge of the barrier.       His left leg was behind the barrier
                                                                              PAGE           4


and his bottom was over the top of the barrier,.           He had his knee in my

groin wnich prevented me from being crushed against the barrier.

This lad was about      15 yrs,   he had black hair and was wearing a navy

blue tracksuit.

We were in this position for about five minutes while the game was

going on.       This lad was screaming in pain,      I think his leg may have

been broken.

Suddenly the pressure from behind eased and his leg came out from

between wire.       He was carried off over the heads of the crowd and

disappeared towards the fence.

The lad next to me and myself then tried to duck under the bar.                    I

managed to get under the bar.          The lad next to me d i d n ’t make it.          His

face was crushed against the bar.          I can remember that he screamed.

All   I can remember about him was that he might have been in

his early twenties and that he was smaller than me.            I am O f t     '.

I didn't see him again.       I don't know what happened to him.

By this time I was only about 3 yards from the front fence.                 I think

the game was stopped by then.

Once I had got under the barrier there was a little breathing space

and I managed to get my foot on the front wall and my hand on the top

spike of the front fence,          I jumped up and because I was right in the

corner of the pen 1 was able to swing my left leg up on to the fence

that separates pen 4 from pen 5.          I was able to climb up on top of the

fence and   1    turned round and faced the crowd.

I was able to stand on the fence and steady myself with one hand.

There was a man behind me holding me and I managed to pull four or 5

young   lads aged between 14 and 16 out of the crowd and over the fence.

I remember a lot of hands         reaching up for help.

I then tried to get a full grown man over the fence.            Unfortunately a                  ?

policeman moved on the lad what was holding me on the pitch side so I
                                                                        PAGE


had to let go of the man's hand and let him go back        into the crowd.

He fell back into the crowd and tne crowd just trampled him.           There is

no doubt in my mind that he was killed.        l think he was probably

dead when we tried to pull him out.

I would describe this man as being between 30-33 yrs.         1 d i d n ’t see

his face but he was wearing a navy blue jacket and trousers,          it could

have been a suit.     He had on a white shirt.      The last time I saw the

man he was lying in the gutter at the front of pen 4 and people were

standing on him in an effort to get out of the pen.

When I saw this I jumped off the fence.

I really don't know what I did next,       1 was shocked and stunned.

The next thing I remember is that I was in the 6 yard box near the

goal when I tripped over a foot.

I looked down and I saw a young    lad lying on his back with his right

knee in the air and his hand was in the air as well.

I grabbed his hand and I knelt down beside him.         I took his hand and

asked him if he was alright.     I lifted his head up.      I think he was

still alive then but he d i d n ’t say anything.

His face was white and sort of pockmarked.         His lips were purple.

The pock marking was where    individual   pores had gone purple like small

blood vessels bursting.

I saw his eyes roll backwards and he died in my arms.

I later saw a picture    in the Liverpool Echo newspaper of this boy and

his name is Henry Charles RODGERS.

I held him for about 2 minutes when a policeman told me to leave him.

            □ found   me and dragged me off to the half way line.

We sat down and cried for about five minutes.

A fella bumped into me with one of the hoardings and asked me to get

on the front and help.

I helped the lad with the hoarding and I lost                      again.
                                                                          PAGE      6


We got to the   Lepping Lane end and picked         up a young lad of about   16.

He was unconscious.       I remember he had fair hair and      green eyes.    1


think he was wearing jeans,      I d o n ’t know what else he had on if

anything.    We took him to the Motts Forest end.         1 gave him mouth to

mouth and someone else tried heart massage.           After about 3 minutes a

St. John Ambulanceman told us to give up as he was dead.

As I had been   giving him mouth to mouth I         could hear what I think   was

blood rushing   about    in his lungs.

I sat there and cried.      This was then the worst time.        There were

bodies everywhere.      The Policeman covered the lad up.        The Policeman

covered his face with a dark blue pullover.

When I got up I was gently ushered by the Police back to the Leppings

Lane end of the ground.      By this time there was a line of Policemen

across the pitch.

I then milled about amongst distressed supporters.             There was a lot of

anger amongst the supporters against the Police.           I   tried to find my

mates and then I heard over the tannoy that the game had been

abandoned.

About five minutes      later I climbed the wall     into the North stand and

made my way out of the ground.

1 went to a house and telephoned home.

I then went back to the     car where    I met my friends and we     made our way

home.

There are some things that I have missed out.           When I was stuck behind

the barrier with the lad with the leg in my crotch I helped to pass

over a young girl who had passed out.         All   I can remember   is that she

was wearing black shoes.

Also when I first got in pen 4 I was able to move where           I wanted to

but within a minute      I was pushed by the crowd right down to the second

barrier from the front.

           Further to my previous statement dated 1 May 19S9                    (010589).



           I have today, Saturday 15 July 1989 (150789)                   been shown by WPC

           and PC                 a photograph reference number                       I hav e

           identified myself on this photo,                   I am carrying a hoarding across the

           pitch with other fans,                 I am closest to the camera behind a youth in a

           red top.            (Ref No f              ) (            ) I do not know which body I

           am carrying at this time.                   1 do remember carrying a lad on a hoarding

           who had fair hair and green eyes,                   I cannot say whether this lad is the

           one in the photo.                   I have also been shown photograph reference number

           N G N 1/94.         his shows a lad on a hoarding,            on the pitch, at the Notts

           Forrest end being given mouth to mouth by a policeman,                    I am kneeling

           down to the left            (as you look at the photo)         of this policeman
                                                                                          PAGE


         (Ref No           '(                   )   I   am giving heart massage to the

         youth.      I cannot say whether this youth is the one on the hoarding                    in

         the previous    photo or not.        I can say that this           is the same youth

         that I found in tne goal mouth at the Lappings Ln end.                     I did not

         carry him to the Spion Kop I can only assume that I must have come

         across him again later on.



         I have also been shown photo                           y I can identify myself again as

         the person giving heart massage to a youth on a hoarding an the pitch

         at the Spion Kop end (Ref                          (             ) again it is the same

         youth as 1 found earlier at Leppings Ln g o a l .

NUMBER OF PEOPLE WERE TRYING TO RESUSCITATE THEM, UNFORTUNATELY THEY WE

BEYOND HELP AT LEAST SIX OF THEM WERE DEAD.     THEY HAD NO EXTERNAL INJUR

THEY WERE ASPHYXIATED.     I THEN WENT TO TELL THE POLICE OFFICER AND HE D

ME TO THE BACK OF THE STAND AND UNDERNEATH DEFINITELY NOT THE GYMNASIUM

THERE WAS ABOUT FIFTEEN PEOPLE LYING ON THE GROUND HALF OF THEM WERE DE

COATS OVER THEIR FACES.    SOME WERE SEMI-CONSCIOUS SITTING UPRIGHT AGAIN

WALL,   I REMEMBER SEEING ONE LAD LYING ON HIS SIDE HE HAD A CHAROTIA PUL

PUPILS DILATED AND HE WAS UNCONSCIOUS,    I INSTRUCTED A ST. J O H N ’S AMBULA

CADET TO STAY WITH HIM.    THERE WAS NO ORGANISATION ONLY A NURSE IN UNIF

AND THIS 12 YEAR OLD ST. JOHN AMBULANCE CADET.      THERE WAS A CONTINUAL F

ASPHYXIATED.     I WENT BACK OUT ONTO THE PITCH INTO THE GOAL MOUTH AND SA

A NUMBER OF OTHER DOCTORS WERE TREATING INJURED FANS.       THEY WERE OBVIOU

FROM SHEFFIELD AS THEY WERE WEARING COATS WITH THE WORDS 'DOCTOR' WRITT

THEM.    I WENT AND SAT ON THE WALL OF THE NORTH STAND AND THE AMOUNT OF

RECEEDED AND THEY WERE PLACED IN AMBULANCES.

I MUST POINT OUT THAT I WENT DOWN TO THE PITCH OF MY OWN ACCORD I DID N

HEAR ANY ANNOUNCEMENT OVER THE PUBLIC ADDRESS SYSTEM REQUESTING THE PRE

AND ASSISTANCES OF ANY DOCTOR OR NURSE.

I AM UNABLE TO DESCRIBE ANY OF THE PERSONS THAT I ATTENDED AFTER THE DI

HAD OCCURRED.

           TOUR OF DUTY ON SATURDAY 15TH APRIL 1989 (150489)

           7 PM     (1900)   X 3 AM (0300) LICENSINGVAN



           On Saturday 15th April              1989 (150489)     I commenced duty at 12 n (1200)

           at West Bar Police Station on public order patrol                   in the city

           centre.      The van crew that day were PS 812 Stuchfield, PC 2430 K a y e ,

           PC 1354 W o r t l e y , PC 231 C l a r k e , PC 1165 Newman, PC 1672 Thacker.

           At 1.50 piTi (1350) we attended a disturbance                 in Charles Street outside

           the Roebuck Tavern.               As a result of that call      I arrested



           Southampton for being drunk and disorderly.                              was a Liverpool

           supporter who had travelled from Southampton that morning to attend

           the match with his father who was later also arrested for being drunk
                                                                       PAGE     2


and disorderly by another officer.                   was extremely drunk

and had to be handcuffed en route to the Charge Office.         After further

patrol duties we attended at West Bar Police Station for meal, at 3 pm

(1500).

About 3.10 pm (1510) we received a call to attend at SWFC to give

assistance and we left West Bar      immediately and made our way to

Hillsborough arriving there at 3.20 pm (1520).        We reported to the

Police Room and were instructed to standby under the North Stand and

await further    instructions.   Along with numerous other officers     I was

on standby until 3.30 pm (1530) when we were        instructed to go onto

the pitch.     At all times   I was taking my orders from PS Stuchfield.

Once on the pitch I went to the centre line and was        instructed to form

part of the cordon.     At that time   I had cause to speak to many fans,

many of them the worse for drink, and as I was not fully aware of the

grave   circumstances of the situation at that time I initially thought

we were dealing with a public order situation.        At 3.40 pm (1540)     I

was instructed by PS Stuchfield to go with him and other officers

into Leppings Lane and we left the ground through the uncovered

seating area and went into Leppings Lane to assist dispersal of the

Liverpool    fans.

At 4.10 pm (1610) with other officers      I went   into Penistone Rd to

assist fans leaving by buses and then I patrolled to the city centre

with PC 1354 Wortley and at 6.0 pm (1800)      I rejoined PS Stuchfield

at the Midland Station.

I then continued licensing duties until 3.0 am        (0300).

           SUBJECT?       SEMI FINAL      -    D DIVISION PLANNING



           Chief   Inspector BETTISON,           who   is engaged on the HQ semi final enquiry

           team,   has requested that I submit a report on the above subject to hi

           office urgently and in any event before 27 April                  1989 <270489)=



           INTRODUCTION        -    D DIVISION OPERATIONS PLANNING



           Presently myself and PC 916 BRADLEY are responsible for the initial

           planning of D1 sub divisional               policing response to events which occur

           within the sub division.              Occasionally we plan the response for the

           whole division when the manpower               commitment   is large, such as for a

           Royal   visit or major march/procession which affects D1 and D2.
First knowledge of events         is gained in several ways,      from

correspondence,       media reports,   poster   campaigns,   telephone   calls and

there are many which recur annually.            Once we have knowledge of an

event which appears to require         police action a report is made to the

sub divisional       commander.    He then instructs the course which will

be taken which ranges from advising the organisers to preparation of

an operational order.          FGO and FSOs are consulted and adhered to where

appli c ab le .



Once    it had been decided that an order will be prepared the event            is

programmed into the D1 planning system.           A file is opened and a number

of customised forms are completed.          Key dates are entered in the sub

divisional    diaries and the event assigned a unique event number.             It

is not unusual to have several events being           planned simultaneously,

presently there are 8 "live" files being handled by the office.



Thereafter meetings are held with all           interested parties and regular

reports made to the sub divisional         (and sometimes divisional)

commander to keep them updated.          The usual method is for a minute to

be attached to the event working file showing the up to date position.

We also    liaise with statutory undertakers, PSV operators, and the

emergency services as a matter of course and in the week prior to the

event    itself pro-forma letters are sent to PSV operators and the

emergency services.



Using the directions given me in the frequent discussions and minutes

on file written by the sub divisional           commander    I then draw up a draft

operational       order.   Experience and divisional    policy is used to deploy

the manpower       involved.    The first draft is then submitted to the sub
                                                                             PAGE    3


divisional   commander   (or divisional    commander) who will     request

amendments or sign the order.



At that point the order is copied and published.



The event then takes place and usually an officer from the office is

involved in the actual execution.



Following the event de brief information is recorded and the original

file along with the working      papers   is filed for future reference.



1989 (0 0 0 Q 8 9 ) SEMI FINAL PLANNING



First knowledge of the event was gained from media reports on 21 March

■1989 (210389).   Our initial    response was to open two files,        one headed

manpower and one headed semi final.        Certain customised forms were

completed and the event given a unique number.           On the face of it D

Division would be required to mount a similar operation to the one

mounted in 1988 (000088) when       (excluding traffic    points   in D Division)

200 men were used.



I discussed the matter with A/Superintendent KING who told me to begin

planning our operation based on the 1988 (000088)          operation.    After

that meeting   I consulted the sub divisional duty books and realised

that it would be difficult to raise the manpower wholly from D

Division officers due to annual       leave and courses.



On 22 March 1989 (220389) myself, PS                     and PC 916 BRADLEY

attended a joint planning meeting at Hammerton Road Police Station.

Also   present were officers from HQ Ops, Dog/Mounted section, British
Trans port Police,, and representatives from British Rail, South

Yorkshire Trans port and other organisations.     Chief Superintendent

MOLE chaired the meeting.     Basically the outcome of that meeting was

that the D Division commitment would be the same as      in 1988 (000088)

with the exception that Ops and Traffic would be accepting

responsibi1ity for all match traffic in the South Yorkshire Police

area on 15 April    1989 (150489).



At the meeting    I arranged further meetings with South Yorkshire

Transport, British Transport Police, British Rail and Road Traffic.



On 23 March 1989 (230389) myself and PC 916 BRADLEY attended the first

of several meetings we were to have with Road Traffic to discuss the

traffic policing    in D Division.   It was agreed that Inspector SCHOLEY

would draw up the traffic operations order and that affected divisions

would "second" officers to traffic on 15 April      1989 (150489).   It was

estimated that traffic would require 30+ D Division Constables on 15

April    1989 (150489).



I discussed the developments with A/Superintendent KING and informed

him of the requirement to supply 30+ Constables to traffic addition to

the 200 we would probably need in D Division for our operation.         I

also    informed him that raising the total   in house was proving

difficult and that cancellation of WL might be required.       It was

decided at that point - 28 March 1989 (280389) - to ask D Division to

supply volunteers to work on WL as an alternative to cancellation.

The request was circulated and produced more officers.



I had several meetings with Inspector MABBOTT of the British Transport

Police and also with staff from British Rail.      The meetings took place
                                                                          PAGE   5


in the offices and platforms at Midland Station.          The outcome was that

British Rail would be using the same tactics as         in 1988 (000088)    to

deal with the influx of fans at the station except that Inspector

MA8B0TT initially declined to have his men segregating Liverpool fans

from the traveliing    publi c on the platforms     pr ior to exit from the

South Luggage Exit as    in the past.    This    task was to be left to us.

(However two days before the operation we received the British

Transport Police order which stated that BTP would after all segregate

the fans on the platforms.     This    contradicted our order but the new

information was given at D Division briefing on 15 April         1989)

(150489).



I also met Mr                   of South Yorkshire Transport who told me

that   last year a fleet of 35 buses transported fans to and

from Midland Station.     On the outward trip 41 full      loads of Nottingham

supporters were carried and 11 full       loads of Liverpool fans were

carried.     On return 8 Liverpool    loads were carried and 37 Nottingham

loads.     The outward figures showed that approximately 4160 fans had

been taken to the ground and that 3600 had returned.          (It is not

unusual for fans to walk back due to congestion).          The figures also

showed that 17 buses had managed a return trip on the outward leg and

that 10 had managed a return trip on the return leg.



South Yorkshire Transport    regularly transport fans to SWFC from the

Midland Station.     Police escorts are always      requested and it is

usual to deploy two officers to a full bus.         This was discussed with

A/Superintendent KING and he decided that two officers         per bus would

be used for the operation but that if possible they were to return to

Sheffield Midland for a "return load".          It was hoped that this would

save manpower.     That meant that on 1988 (000088)      figures at least 104
                                                                          PAGE


officers would be required for PSV escorts.



On 29 March 1989 (290389)         I received a request from PC 808 ROSEVEAR

(HQ Ops)    for D manpower to work at SWFC on 15 April       1989 (150489).

After speaking with A/Superitendent KING I informed PC ROSEVEAR that

it would not be possible for D Division to supply any staff as we were

having difficulty raising manpower for our in house needs on the day.



On the 4 April    1989 (040489) Road Traffic      requested 35 Constables and

4 Traffic wardens from D Division.         They were to report at Brightside

Lane by 0800    (0800) on the 15 April      1989 (150489).   I subsequently

warned 35 officers who were all D2 Constables.



Also by 4 April    1989 (040489)      I informed A/Superintendent KING that

cancellation of WL was then needed as we were still some 40 officers

short.     He consulted with Chief Superintendent BROOMHEAD and WL on 15

April    (150489) was cancelled for D Division officers on that day.



All D Division staff - with few exceptions - were now included in the

planning.     Court staff, Charge Office staff*      CID Aides and some

administrative officers had been included.          Cancellation of WL raised

most of the shortfall      but we were obliged to go to PC 808 ROSEVEAR for

17 officers.     Most of these were Detectives who worked in uniform for

the day.     Given that they were "strangers" none were eventually

deployed other than on PSV escort duties.



On 5 April    1989 (050489)   I had a meeting with A/Superintendent KING.

I told him that I had raised enough manpower for the operation

envisaged which would take in public order patrols on 14 and 15 April

(140489)    (150489),   patrols    in Pond Street and PSV escorts on 15
                                                                            PAGE       7


April    1989 (150489).   One problem was that we had a surfeit of

Sergeants and it was decided that two per PSV serial would be

allocated as the important factor was that each PSV have two officers.

At that point allocation of responsibility for the          5D 5 Division

Senior Officers involved was decided by A/Superintendent KING which                I

noted for inclusion on the order.



On or around the 5 April       1989 (050489)   I contacted Inspector SEWELL at

FI and confirmed the unloading       points for the PSVs.     I also informed

him that the escort serials would amount to 110+ and that they were

available as a reserve during the match itself.          He told me to have

them report to the Gymnasium at SWFC and that they would be given a

hot meal after half time.        I noted the information for inclusion in

the draft D Division order.        PC 916 BRADLEY sent a Gen S containing

the information to Inspector SEWELL via Chief Superintendent BROOMHEAD

on 8 April    1989 (080489).



By this time serial make up and deployment had been decided.            We had

also made    requests for the attendance of mounted officers,       dog section

staff and arranged for a Brimac vehicle to be on standby.           It was

apparent that we would need extra vehicles and requests for these were

made through HQ Traffic Management.        Also requests for radios and

repeater sets were made.        1 radio between £ officers was to be the

issue.    A logistics team was appointed to manage all the extra

equipment from collection to issue and return.



Meals were ordered for all       concerned and the PSV escort serials were

to be given a hot drink and packed meal at briefing         in case they did

not receive their hot meal at SWFC due to being utilised.           Hot drinks

were also    laid on at Sheffield Midland.
                                                                          PAGE




On 7 April    1989 (070489)    I drew up a draft operational order.       I gave

it to A/Superintendent KING on 8 April        1989 (080489)   for his

amendments.    On 9 April     1989 (090489) A/Superintendent KING returned

the order to me with some minor       changes.     These were incorporated into

the End draft which I submitted to him on 10 April          1989 (100489).

This copy was read by Superintendent BATES who signed the order that

day.   It was then copied and distributed.



At around that date I attended a final        planning meeting at Hammerton

Road which was chaired by Chief Superintendent DU CK EN F IE LD .       My input

to the meeting was the arrangements made for PSV escorts.



In the final days run up to the operation the office published several

other unconnected orders.       As is common on orders which use large

numbers of officers changes had to be made to the semi final order

serials as circumstances dictated.        Consequently it was necessary to

update the master serial      list by hand.      A copy of that list is

attached and reflects the make up of       the serials as they were

deployed on 15 April    1989 (150489).     The new information was passed        to

the officers involved both prior to and at the main briefing.

Efficiency was not compromised.



All supervisors were sent an advance       copy of the order on the 10 April

1989 (100489) as were surrounding Divisions, HQ, Specialists and

BTP.   In common with normal      practice spare    copies were available at

briefing as were displayed copies of the serial          lists and deployments.

A pile of SWFC maps were also made available for those unfamiliar
                                                                      p


A total of IE serials were sent to SWFC totalling       120 officers of

which 19 were sergeants.       Inspectors HARPER and DEWS accompanied

them.   In D Division    (excluding traffic   points) 46 officers were

deployed on public order and Pond Street duties over a three day

operation.



As for the order   itself the main strategy and policy was laid down by

A/Superintendent KING.       I attended to the detail and liaison with

other divisions and outside or ganisations.      The working papers and

original   copy of the order is filed in E Group office at West Bar

Police Station

PC 2045 Jessop

PC 3121 Hi t chbourne



At 8 am       (0800)   on Saturday 15 April   1989 (150489)   I commenced duty at

West Bar Police Station, Sheffield.



At 9 am       (0900)   I attended the semi final briefing at that Police

Stat io n .



I was the Sergeant         in charge of Serial 7 with specific

responsibi1ities to escort Nottingham Forest fans from Sheffield

Midland Station to the Hillsborough football           ground.   These fans would

be conveyed by dedicated P S V 5s .       At the completion of the match the

reverse would apply and the fans would be escorted back to Sheffield

Midland Station.         During the period of the match my serial would meal

and remain on standby in the gymnasium at Hillsborough football

ground.At 9.40 am         (0940)   that day I joined my serial at the North Gate

of the Midland railway station where the Nottingham Forest supporters

would exit.

All officers of my serial were present and were aware of their duties.

From around 10.00 am (1000) my officers were engaged in escorting the

supporters       to the Sheffield Wednesday ground and by 2.30 pm (1430) all

my officers were either at the ground or were on route to it.              I

remained at the rail station to escort a small number of fans who

were expected to arrive on a service train around 2.40 pm (1440).

At 2.45 pm (1445)         I travelled with these fans to the ground on the

last bus to leave from the North Gate,           this bus arrived outside the

ground on Penistone Road at 3.00 pm (1500).            The road was reasonably

clear and the fans left the bus and made their way through the

turnst i1es into the g r o u n d .
                                                                     PAG E      3


I then entered the ground and went straight to the gymnasium.

I had been in the gymnasium a matter of moments when a senior officer

(identification not known)      came into the gym and instructed everyone

to make their way to the playing area as "there was trouble on the

pitch."   With other officers we went to the ramp at the Kop end.         The

match was still   in play.     I looked up the field and saw fans climbing

over the fence at the West Stand.       I instructed all the officers

present to make their way to the West Stand.       We made our way along

the perimeter track towards the West Stand and as we did so I recall

the match being stopped.       On arrival at the West Stand I saw fans

climbing over the fence on to the track and I also saw that the

perimeter fence gate,    to the right of the goal when facing the West

Stand was open and people were spilling out.       I saw youths being

lifted into the seated area above the stand.

Some fans were now lying on the grass.       I started to move one of the

youths towards the edge.       1 formed the opinion that he was intoxicated.

As I did this more and more fans were spilling out and coming on to

the pitch.    I looked closer at the crowd and saw that there was a

a huge amount of people in the stand - people were obviously trying to

get out of the crush.    As more people came out I tried to direct them

to the right hand side to prevent the escape      route becoming blocked.

I was joined by other officers and tried to organise a funnel at the

gate to keep it clear.       At this point a youth was carried out and

placed on the grass I saw he was lifeless.       I checked for signs of

life and found none.     I looked at his eyes and saw that they were

cloudy.   He was obviously dead.

At this point I changed my radio chanel      to number 25.   I identified

myself and twice requested urgent medical assistance to the West

Stand.    I received no reply and I could not hear any radio traffic.

I then continued to assist with first aid as more injured and dead
                                                                         PAG E     4


were brought out and to keep the immediate area clear to facilitate

the escape of more people.

I then recall    the St Johns ambulance attending at    the West Stand,     but

by this time there were crowds on the pitch and        I lost sight of it.

Some time later Fire Brigade Officers attended,        I directed them    to the

area behind the goal, and asked them to send for oxygen.

A South Yorkshire ambulance then made its way up the pitch.         The

ambulance attendant asked me for Police Protection as he stated that

he had already been attacked.     I stayed with the ambulance for a short

while until    it was driven further along the pitch.

At this point the bodies and injured persons we re being swiftly

removed by supporters and Police officers on makeshift stretchers.

The area was then cleared of casualties and I started to make an

effort to move fans to the edge of the pitch.     A number of supporters

became aggresive and abusive.

At this point I regrouped as many of my serial as possible and took up

position on the centre line cordon.

I was then instructed by Chief    Inspector Sumner to attend with my

serial on Penistone Road and assist with the dispersal of supporters.

I took up position in Penistone Road and performed duties in relation

to keeping the road clear for emergency vehicles.

Finally I escorted a PSV containing Nottingham Forest fans to Midland

Station, arriving there at 6.30 pm (1830).

I then returned to West Bar Police Station,    where after accounting for

all my officers and attending the de briefing    I stood down at 8.00 pm

(S 0 0 0 ) .

I am unable to give specific times of events between 3 pm (1500) and

6.30 pm (1830)    or account for any actions by officers on my serial,

as due to the nature of the incident I found myself detached from my

serial and had little recollection of time,    however    I believe that all
                                                           PAG E   5


         my serial were present at the ground.

           SUBJECT?       SEMI FINAL              D DIVISION PLANNING



           Chief    Inspector BETTISGN, who is engaged on the HQ semi final enquiry

           team,    has requested that I submit a report on the above subject to his

           office urgently and in any event before 27 April                        1989 (270489).



           INTRODUCTION          -    D DIVISION OPERATIONS PLANNING



           Presently myself and PC 916 BRADLEY are responsible for the initial

           planning of D1 sub divisional                  policing response to events which occur

           within the sub division.                   Occasionally we plan the response for the

           whole division when the manpower                  commitment is large,       such as for a

           Royal visit or major march/pro cession which affects D1 and D 2 .
                                                                           PA GE    S




First knowledge of events       is gained in several ways,      from

correspondence, media reports,       poster   campaigns-,   telephone   calls and

there are many which recur annually.          Once we have knowledge of an

event which appears to require police action a report is made to the

sub divisional    commander,,   He then instructs the course which will

be taken which ranges from advising the organisers to preparation of

an operational    order.    FGO and FSOs are consulted and adhered to where

appli cabl e.



Once it had been decided that an order will be prepared the event is

programmed into the D1 planning system.          A file is opened and a number

of customised forms are completed.        Key dates are entered in the sub

divisional   diaries and the event assigned a unique event number.             It

is not unusual to have several       events being planned simultaneously,,

presently there are 8 "live" files being handled by the office.



Thereafter meetings are held with all         interested parties and regular

reports made to the sub divisional       (and sometimes divisional)

commander to keep them updated.       The usual method is for a minute to

be attached to the event working file showing the up to date position,

We also liaise with statutory undertakers? FSV operators, and the

emergency services as a matter of course and in the week prior to the

event itself pro-forma letters are sent to PSV operators and the

emergency services.



Using the directions given me in the frequent discussions and minutes

on file written by the sub divisional         commander I then draw up a draft

operational order.     Experience and divisional       policy is used to deploy

the manpower    involved.    The first draft is then submitted to the sub
divisional   commander   (or divisional    commander)   who will   request

amendments or sign the order.



At that point the order is copied and published.



The event then takes place and usually an officer from the office is

involved in the actual execution.



Following the event de brief information is recorded and the original

file along with the working     papers is filed for future reference.



•1989 (000089) SEMI FINAL PLANNING



First knowledge of the event was gained from media reports on El March

•1989 (£10389).   Our initial   response was to open two files,         one headed

manpower and one headed semi final.        Certain customised forms were

completed and the event given a unique number.           On the face of it D

Division would be required to mount a similar operation to the one

mounted in 1988 (000088) when     (excluding traffic points in D Division)

200 men were used.



I discussed the matter with A/Superintendent KING who told me to begin

planning our operation based on the '1988 (000088)         operation.    After

that meeting   I consulted the sub divisional duty books and realised

that it would be difficult to raise the manpower wholly from D

Division officers due to annual     leave and courses.



On EE March 1989 (EE0389) myself,     PS                and PC 916 BRADLEY

attended a joint planning meeting at Hammerton Road Police Station.

Also   present were officers from HQ Ops, Dog/Mounted section,          British
Transport Police,, and representatives from British Rail, South

Yorkshire Transport and other organisations.     Chief Superintendent

MOLE chaired the meeting.    Basically the outcome of that meeting was

that the D Division commitment would be the same as in 1988 (000088)

with the exception that Ops and Traffic would be accepting

responsibility for all match traffic in the South Yorkshire Police

area on 15 April   1989 (150489).



At the meeting   I arranged further meetings with South Yorkshire

Transport, British Transport Police,   British Rail and Road Traffic.



On 23 March 1989 (230389) myself and PC 916 BRADLEY attended the first

of several meetings we were to have with Road Traffic to discuss the

traffic policing in D Division.     It was agreed that Inspector SCHOLEY

would draw up the traffic operations order and that affected divisions

would "second" officers to traffic on 15 April    1989 (150489).    It was

estimated that traffic would require 30+ D Division Constables on 15

April   1989 (150489).



I discussed the developments with A/Superintendent KING and informed

him of the requirement to supply 30+ Constables to traffic addition to

the 200 we would probably need in D Division for our operation.       I

also informed him that raising the total    in house was proving

difficult and that cancellation of WL might be required.     It was

decided at that point - 28 March 1989 <280389) - to ask D Division to

supply volunteers to work on WL as an alternative to cancellation.

The request was circulated and produced more officers.



I had several meetings with Inspector MABBOTT of the British Transport

Police and also with staff from British Rail.     The meetings took place
                                                                       PAGE    5


in the offices and platforms at Midland Station.        The outcome was that

British Rail would be using the same tactics as in 1988 (000088)         to

deal with the influx of fans at the station except that Inspector

MABBOTT initially declined to have his men segregating Liverpool fans

from the travelling    public on the platforms prior to exit from the

South Luggage Exit as in the past.      This task was to be left to us.

(However two days before the operation we received the British

Transport Police order which stated that BTP would after all segregate

the fans on the platforms.     This contradicted our order but the new

information was given at D Division briefing on 15 April       1989)

(150489).



1 also met Mr                   of South Yorkshire Transport who told me

that last year a fleet of 35 buses transported fans to and

from Midland Station.     On the outward trip 41 full    loads of Nottingham

supporters were carried and 11 full      loads of Liverpool fans were

carried.     On return 8 Liverpool   loads were carried and 37 Nottingham

loads.     The outward figures showed that approximately 4160 fans had

been taken to the ground and that 3600 had returned.        (It is not

unusual for fans to walk back due to congestion).        The figures also

showed that 17 buses had managed a return trip on the outward leg and

that 10 had managed a return trip on the return leg.



South Yorkshire Transport    regularly transport fans to SWFC from the

Midland Station.     Police escorts are always   requested and it is

usual to deploy two officers to a full bus.      This was discussed with

A/Superintendent KING and he decided that two officers       per bus would

be used for the operation but that if possible they were to return to

Sheffield Midland for a "return load".       It was hoped that this would

save manpower.     That meant that on 1988 (000088)   figures at least 104
                                                                        OAna   £


officers would be required for PSV escorts.



On 29 March 1989 (290389)      I received a request from PC 808 ROSEVEAR

(HQ Ops)    for D manpower to work at SWFC on 15 April    1989 (150489).

After speaking with A/Superitendent KING I informed PC ROSEVEAR that

it would not be possible for D Division to supply any staff as we were

having difficulty raising manpower for our in house needs on the day.



On the 4 April    1989 (040489) Road Traffic   requested 35 Constables and

4 Traffic wardens from D Division.       They were to report at Brightside

Lane by 0800 (0800) on the 15 April 1989 (150489).        I subsequently

warned 35 officers who were all D2 Constables.



Also by 4 April    1989 (040489)   I informed A/Superintendent KING that

cancellation of WL was then needed as we were still some 40 officers

short.     He consulted with Chief Superintendent BROOMHEAD and WL on 15

April    (150489) was   cancelled for D Division officers on that day.



All D Division staff - with few exceptions - were now included in the

planning.     Court staff. Charge Office staff,    CID Aides and some

administrative officers had been included.        Cancellation of WL raised

most of the shortfall     but we were obliged to go to PC 808 ROSEVEAR for

17 officers.     Most of these were Detectives who worked in uniform for

the day.     Given that they were "strangers" none were eventually

deployed other than on PSV escort duties.



On 5 April    1989 (050489)   I had a meeting with A/Superintendent KING.

I told him that I had raised enough manpower for the operation

envisaged which would take in public order patrols on 14 and 15 April

(140489)    (150489),   patrols in Pond Street and PSV escorts on 15
                                                                               p. A rztr




April    1989 (150489).   One problem was that we had a surfeit of

Sergeants and it was decided that two per PSV serial would be

allocated as the important factor was that each PSV have two officers.

At that point allocation of responsibility for the              'D8 Division

Senior Officers    involved was decided by A/Superintendent KING which I

noted for inclusion on the order.



On or around the 5 April       1989 <050489)   I contacted Inspector SEWELL at

FI and confirmed the unloading       points for the P S V s .     I also informed

him that the escort serials would amount to 110+ and that they were

available as a reserve during the match itself.           He told me to have

them report to the Gymnasium at SWFC and that they would be given a

hot meal after half time.        I noted the information for inclusion in

the draft D Division order.        PC 916 BRADLEY sent a Gen 2 containing

the information to Inspector SEWELL via Chief Superintendent BROOMHEAD

on 8 April    1989 <080489).



By this time serial make up and deployment had been decided.               We had

also made requests for the attendance of mounted officers,              dog section

staff and arranged for a Brimac vehicle to be on standby.               It was

apparent that we would need extra vehicles and requests for these were

made through HQ Traffic Management.         Also requests for radios and

repeater sets were made.        1 radio between 2 officers was to be the

issue.    A logistics team was appointed to manage all the extra

equipment from collection to issue and return.



Meals were ordered for all       concerned and the PSV escort serials were

to be given a hot drink and packed meal at briefing             in case they did

not receive their hot meal at SWFC due to being utilised.               Hot drinks

were also laid on at Sheffield Midland.
                                                                           PAGE




On 7 April    1989 (0704-89)    I drew up a draft operational order.       I gave

it to A/Superintendent KING on 8 April         1989 (080489)   for his

amendments.     On 9 April     1989 (090489) A/Superintendent KING returned

the order to me with some minor changes.         These were incorporated into

the 2nd draft which I submitted to him on 10 April         1989 (100489).

This copy was read by Superintendent BATES who signed the order that

day.   It was then copied and distributed.



At around that date I attended a final         planning meeting at Hammerton

Road which was chaired by Chief Superintendent DUCKENFIELD.              My input

to the meeting was the arrangements made for PSV escorts.



In the final days run up to the operation the office published several

other unconnected orders.        As is common on orders which use large

numbers of officers changes had to be made to the semi final order

serials as circumstances dictated.        Consequently it was necessary to

update the master serial       list by hand.   A copy of that list is

attached and reflects the make up of        the serials as they were

deployed on 15 April     1989 (150489).     The new information was passed        to

the officers    involved both prior to and at the main briefing.

Efficiency was not compromised.



All supervisors we re sent an advance       copy of   the order on the 10April

1989 (100489) as were surrounding Divisions,          H Q ,Specialists and

BTP.   In common with normal       practice spare copies were available at

briefing as were displayed copies of the serial         lists and deployments.

A pile of SWFC maps were also made available for those unfamiliar

with the ground.

A total of IE serials were sent to SWFC totalling 120 officers of

which 19 were sergeants.       Inspectors HARPER and DEWS accompanied

them.   In D Division    (excluding traffic points) 46 officers were

deployed on public order and Pond Street duties over a three day

operation.



As for the order itself the main strategy and policy was laid down by

A/Superintendent KING.       I attended to the detail and liaison with

other divisions and outside organisations.       The working   papers and

original   copy of the order is filed in E Group office at West Bar

Police Station

           SUBJECTS       SEMI FINAL      -    D DIVISION PLANNING



           Chief    Inspector BETTISON, who is engaged on the HQ semi final enquiry

           team,    has requested that I submit a report on the above subject to his

           office urgently and in any event before 27 April                   1989 (270489)=



           INTRODUCTION        -    D DIVISION OPERATIONS PLANNING



           Presently myself and PC 916 BRADLEY are responsible for the initial

           planning of D1 sub divisional             policing    response to events which occur

           within the sub division.              Occasionally we plan the response for the

           whole division when the manpower             commitment is large,       such as for a

           Royal    visit or major march/procession which affects D1 and D 2 .
First knowledge of events is gained in several ways,           from

correspondence,     media reports,   poster   campaigns,   telephone    calls and

there are many which recur annually.          Once we have knowledge of an

event which appears to require police action a report is made to the

sub divisional     commander.    He then instructs the course which will

be taken which ranges from advising the organisers to preparation of

an operational     order.    FGO and FSOs are consulted and adhered to where

appli cable.



Once it had been decided that an order will be prepared the event is

programmed into the D1 planning system.         A file is opened and a number

of customised forms are completed.        Key dates are entered in the sub

divisional     diaries and the event assigned a unique event number.           It

is not unusual to have several events being         planned simultaneously,

presently there are 8 "live1' files being handled by the office.



Thereafter meetings are held with all         interested parties and regular

reports made to the sub divisional       (and sometimes divisional)

commander to keep them updated.        The usual method is for a minute to

be attached to the event working file showing the up to date position.

We also liaise with statutory undertakers, PSV operators, and the

emergency services as a matter of course and in the week              prior to the

event itself pro-forma letters are sent to PSV operators and the

emergency services.



Using the directions given me in the frequent discussions and minutes

on file written by the sub divisional         commander I then draw up a draft

operational     order.   Experience and divisional    policy is used to deploy

the manpower     involved.    The first draft is then submitted to the sub
divisional   commander   (or divisional   commander) who will    request

amendments or sign the order.



At that point the order is copied and published.



The event then takes place and usually an officer from the office is

involved in the actual execution.



hollowing the event de brief information is recorded and the original

file along with the working      papers is filed for future reference.



•19S9 (000089) SEMI FINAL PLANNING



First knowledge of the event was gained from media reports on 21 March

1989   (210389).   Our initial   response was to open two files,        one headed

manpower and one headed semi final.       Certain customised forms were

completed and the event given a unique number.         On the face of it D

Division would be required to mount a similar operation to the one

mounted in 1988 (000088) when      (excluding traffic points in D Division)

200 men were used.



I discussed the matter with A/Superintendent KING who told me to begin

planning our operation based on the 1988 (000088)          operation.    After

that meeting   I consulted the sub divisional duty books and realised

that it would be difficult to raise the manpower wholly from D

Division officers due to annual      leave and courses.



On 22 March 1989 (220389) myself, P        S   a   n   d     PC 916 BRADLEY

attended a joint    planning meeting at Hammerton Road Police Station.

Also present were officers from HQ Ops, Dog/Mounted section, British
Transport Police, and representatives from British Rail, South

Yorkshire Transport and other organisations.     Chief Superintendent

MOLE chaired the meeting.    Basically the outcome of that meeting was

that the D Division commitment would be the same as in 1988 (000088)

with the exception that Ops and Traffic would be accepting

responsibi1ity for all match traffic in the South Yorkshire Police

area on 15 April   1989 (150489).



At the meeting   I arranged further meetings with South Yorkshire

Transport, British Transport Police,   British Rail and Road Traffic.



On 23 March 1989 (230389) myself and PC 916 BRADLEY attended the first

of several meetings we were to have with Road Traffic to discuss the

traffic   policing in D Division.   It was agreed that   Inspector SCHOLEY

would draw up the traffic operations order and that affected divisions

would "second" officers to traffic on 15 April    1989 (150489).    It was

estimated that traffic would require 30+ D Division Constables on 15

April   1989 (150489).



I discussed the developments with A/Superintendent KING and informed

him of the requirement to supply 30+ Constables to traffic addition to

the 200 we would probably need in D Division for our operation.         I

also informed him that raising the total    in house was proving

difficult and that cancellation of WL might be required.       It was

decided at that point - 28 March 1989 (280389) - to ask D Division to

supply volunteers to work on WL as an alternative to cancellation.

The request was circulated and produced more officers.



I had several meetings with Inspector MABBOTT of the British Transport

Police and also with staff from British Rail.     The meetings took place
                                                                           PAGE   5


in the offices and platforms at Midland Station.           The outcome was that

British Rail would be using the same tactics as in 1988 <000088)             to

deal with the influx of fans at the station except that Inspector

MABBOTT initially declined to have his men segregating Liverpool fans

from the travelling      public on the platforms prior to exit from the

South Luggage Exit as in the past.         This task was to be left to us.

(However two days before the operation we received the British

Transport Police order which stated that BTP would after all segregate

the fans on the platforms.         This contradicted our order but the new

information was given at D Division briefing on 15 April           1989)

<150489).



I also met M       r     o     f       South Yorkshire Transport who told me

that last year a fleet of 35 buses transported fans to and

from Midland Station.        On the outward trip 41 full    loads of Nottingham

supporters were carried and 11 full        loads of Liverpool   fans were

carried.     On return 8 Liverpool     loads were carried and 37 Nottingham

loads.     The outward figures showed that approximately 4160 fans had

been taken to the ground and that 3600 had returned.            <It is not

unusual for fans to walk back due to congestion).           The figures also

showed that 17 buses had managed a return trip on the outward leg and

that 10 had managed a return trip on the return leg.



South Yorkshire Transport       regularly transport fans to SWFC from the

Midland Station.       Police escorts are always   requested and it is

usual to deploy two officers to a full bus.         This was discussed with

A/Superintendent KING and he decided that two officers per bus would

be used for the operation but that if possible they were to return to

Sheffield Midland for a "return load".         It was hoped that this would

save manpower.     That meant that on 1988 <000088)     figures at least 104
                                                                          PAGE   6


officers would be required for PSV escorts.



On 29 March 1989 (290389)         I received a request from PC 808 ROSEVEAR

(HQ Ops)    for D manpower to work at SWFC on 15 April       1989 (150489).

After speaking with A/Superitendent KING I informed PC ROSEVEAR that

it would not be possible for D Division to supply any staff as we were

having difficulty raising manpower for our in house needs on the day.



On the 4 April    1989 (040489)     Road Traffic   requested 35 Constables and

4 Traffic wardens from D Division.         They were to report at Brightside

Lane by 0800    (0800) on the 15 April      1989 (150489).   I subsequently

warned 35 officers who were all D2 Constables.



Also by 4 April    1989 (040489)      I informed A/Superintendent KING that

cancellation of WL was then needed as we were still some 40 officers

short.     He consulted with Chief Superintendent BROOMHEAD and WL on 15

April    (150489) was cancelled for D Division officers on that day.



All D Division staff - with few exceptions - were now included in the

planning.     Court staffs Charge Office staff? CID Aides and some

administrative officers had been included.          Cancellation of WL raised

most of the shortfall but we were obliged to go to PC 808 ROSEVEAR for

17 officers.     Most of these were Detectives who worked in uniform for

the day.     Given that they were      "strangers" none were eventually

deployed other than on PSV escort duties.



On 5 April    1989 (050489)   I had a meeting with A/Superintendent KING.

I told him that I had raised enough manpower for the operation

envisaged which would take in public order          patrols on 14 and 15 April

(140489)    (150489),   patrols    in Pond Street and PSV escorts on 15
April    1989 (150489)„   One problem was that we had a surfeit of

Sergeants and it was decided that two per PSV serial would be

allocated as the important factor was that each PSV have two officers.

At that point allocation of responsibility for the                 ’D ’ Division

Senior Officers involved was decided by A/Superintendent KING which I

noted for inclusion on the order.



On or around the 5 April       1989    (050489)   I contacted Inspector SEWELL at

FI and confirmed the unloading          points for the P S V s .     I also informed

him that the escort serials would amount to 110+ and that they were

available as a reserve during the match itself.              He told me to have

them report to the Gymnasium at SWFC and that they would be given a

hot meal after half time.        I noted the information for inclusion in

the draft D Division order.           PC 916 BRADLEY sent a Gen 2 containing

the information to Inspector SEWELL via Chief Superintendent BROOMHEAD

on 8 April    1989 (080489).



By this time serial make up and deployment had been decided.                   We had

also made requests for the attendance of mounted officers,                 dog section

staff and arranged for a Brimac vehicle to be on standby.                  It was

apparent that we would need extra vehicles and requests for these were

made through HQ Traffic Management.            Also requests for radios and

repeater sets were made.        1 radio between 2 officers was to be the

issue.    A logistics team was appointed to manage all the extra

equipment from collection to issue and return.



Meals were ordered for all       concerned and the PSV escort serials were

to be given a hot drink and packed meal at briefing                 in case they did

not receive their hot meal at SWFC due to being utilised.                  Hot drinks

were also laid on at Sheffield Midland.
                                                                            PAGE




On 7 April    1989 (070489)    I drew up a draft operational order.         I gave

it to A/Superintendent KING on 8 April          1989 (080489)   for his

amendments.    On 9 April     1989    (090489) A/Superintendent KING returned

the order to me with some minor changes.           These were incorporated into

the 2nd draft which I submitted to him on 10 April          1989 (100489).

This copy was read by Superintendent BATES who signed the order that

day.   It was then copied and distributed.



At around that date I attended a final          planning meeting at Hammerton

Road which was chaired by Chief Superintendent DUCKENFIELD.               My input

to the meeting was the arrangements made for PSV escorts.



In the final days run up to the operation the office published several

other unconnected orders.        As is common on orders which use large

numbers of officers changes had to be made to the semi final order

serials as circumstances dictated.          Consequently it was necessary to

update the master serial       list by hand.    A copy of that list is

attached and reflects the make up of          the serials as they were

deployed on 15 April    1989 (150489).        The new information was     passed   to

the officers involved both prior to and at the main briefing.

Efficiency was not compromised.



All supervisors were sent an advance          copy of the order on the 10 April

1989 (100489) as were surrounding Divisions, HQ, Specialists and

8TP.   In common with normal         practice spare copies were available at

briefing as were displayed copies of the serial          lists and deployments.

A pile of SWFC maps were also made available for those unfamiliar

with the ground.
                                                                        PAGE


A total of 12 serials were sent to SWFC totalling       120 officers of

which 19 were sergeants.       Inspectors HARPER and DEWS accompanied

them.    In D Division (excluding traffic points) 46 officers were

deployed on public order and Pond Street duties over a three day

o pe rat ion.



As for the order itself the main strategy and policy was laid down by

A/Superintendent KING.       I attended to the detail and liaison with

other divisions and outside organisations.       The working papers and

original   copy of the order is filed in E Group office at West Bar

           At 12 noon       (1200)   on Saturday 15 April         1989 (150489),          I commenced duty

           at West Bar Police Station.            I was engaged on public order duties,                  on

           transit patrol.           I was supervising serial          19 which consisted of

           PC 1546 FRY, PC 813 OAKLEY,          PC 977 DYE and PC 441 BUCKINGHAM.                  Two

           other PCs, PC __________________ [nd PCI                                  should have been on

           my serial       but were not present.        Our duties were mainly visitng

           licensed premises,         ensuring that rival fans were kept apart, attending

           any reports of public order trouble and carrying prisoners for other

           officers to the police station.              During      the pre-match period we were

           joined on patrol by Inspector BEEDEN.



           About 2.45 pm (1445),          that day, we went to West Bar Police Station for

           meal.     By this time the city centre was no busier than on a normal
                                                                   PAGE     2


Saturday»



Whilst eating my meal   in the canteen, Chief Inspector   (now

Superintendent)   KING came in and told us all that Operation Support

had been called at the ground and we were to attend at Hillsborough

immediately.



We left the station and travelled at speed to Hi 1lsborough.     Whilst

en route we were instructed to report to the police room at the

ground and park our vehicles   in Penistone Road.



We altered our radios to the ground's    channel but gained no idea of

what had taken place by the messages being passed.



When passing Hillsborough Park, along iiiddlewood Road, a police

transit, which appeared full of officers, was patrolling slowly,

travelling away from the ground.



We parked our vehicle on the central    reservation of Penistone Road and

entered the ground via the large gate which allows access towards the

gymnasium.



I instructed my men to wait in the entrance between the Kop end and

the North Stand whilst I went to the police room.    Outside the police

room I saw Inspector BARKER who appeared to be on duty there.      I told

him that I was a serial of one sergeant and four constables attending

as a result of Operation Support.    I asked him what had happened and

what our instructions were.



He told me to take my serial onto the pitch and report to the senior
                                                                      PAGE       3


officers there,     I asked   what had   happened but received no reply,



I returned to my men and      told them that we   still did not know what had

happened but we were to go onto the pitch.         I told them to stay near

me.



We entered the pitch via the gap between the Kop and the North Stand.

At the bottom of this gap,      on the grass, was an ambulance and I saw St

J o h n ’s Ambulancemen treating injured persons who were sitting and

lying on the grass in the area.



As we turned to our right,      onto the pitch,   I could see a line of

police officers with their backs to me.         Beyond them I could see

persons climbing over the perimeter fence onto the playing area at the

Leppings Lane end, and also other        people who appeared to be being

handed up i nto the stand from the ter racing.



I believed that a massive      pitch invasion had taken place.    We walked

to the line of officers,      who,   in some places, were several deep.     At

the back of this line was Superintendent CHAPMAN.         I went to him and

asked for instructions.       I was told to place my men in the line of

officers.    I asked him what had happened and he said that there was a

possibility of persons having been killed.



I then joined my men in the line.         I could see frantic activity near

the goal at the Leppings      Lane end   and some supporters and officers

were carrying persons on stretchers and broken advertising hoardings,

through the line,    towards the Kop.



Liverpool   supporters   came up to us, and it was at this stage that we
                                                                      PAGE     4


learned that there had been a crush on the terracing.



Some supporters were obviously in shock and were crying and trembling.

Others were very abusive and many smelled of intoxicants.        At this

stage we left the line to assist    persons   close to us.



I would describe the persons I assisted as       'walking wounded'.   They

were mostly suffering from shock and crush injuries and were having

difficulty in breathing.     All we could do for many of them was to

attempt to calm them and lay them down until their breathing

stabilised.     We then took most of them and sat them near to the

North Stand at the Kop end.



One man was brought to me by S supporters who were virtually having to

carry him.     I took over from them with another officer    (whose identity

I do not know) and we took him by the shoulders to assist him in

walking.     He reeked of intoxicants and we soon came to the opinion

that he was not injured?    he was very drunk.    We sat him by the wall of

the North Stand.



Once all these supporters had been cared for I returned to the line.

I could hear on the radio that the match had been abandoned and that

an announcement to the crowd would soon be made.        I therefore took

PC FRY and PC DYE and PC BUCKINGHAM back to our van.



Our after match duty was at the Midland Railway Station and I was

aware that there would be a lack of officers to supervise the fans.



As we left the ground the announcement to the crowd was made.
                                                                            PAG E


         We drove to the Midiand Station and completed our duties regarding the

         match.



         We remained on public order   patrol until 3 am   (0300), Sunday 16 April

         1989 (160469)„ when we retired from duty.



         Inspector BEEDEN did not attend at the ground with my serial-

           Chief      Inspector B E T T IS O N, who is engaged on the HQ semi final enquiry

           team,      has requested that I submit a report on the above subject to his

           office urgently and in any event before 27 April                  1989 (270489)»



           INTRODUCTION          -    D DIVISION OPERATIONS PLANNING



           Presently myself and PC 916 BRADLEY are responsible for the initial

           planning of D1 sub divisional               policing response to events which occur

           within the sub division.                Occasionally we plan the response for the

           whole division when the manpower               commitment    is large,    such as for a

           Royal visit or major mar ch/pro cess ion which affects D'1 and D2.
First knowledge of events      is gained in several ways,    from

correspondence,    media reports,   poster campaigns,   telephone    calls and

there are many which recur annually.       Once we have knowledge of an

event which appears to require police action a report is made to the

sub divisional    commander.    He then instructs the course which will

be taken which ranges from advising the organisers to preparation of

an operational order.       FGO and FSOs are consulted and adhered to where

appli cable.



Once    it had been decided that an order will be prepared the event          is

programmed into the D1      planning system.   A file is opened and a number

of customised forms are completed.       Key dates are entered in the sub

divisional    diaries and the event assigned a unique event number.           It

is not unusual to have several events being planned simultaneously,

presently there are 8 "live" files being handled by the office.



Thereafter meetings are held with all      interested parties and regular

reports made to the sub divisional      <and sometimes divisional)

commander to keep them updated.       The usual method is for a minute to

be attached to the event working file showing the up to date position.

We also liaise with statutory undertakers,       PSV operators,     and the

emergency services as a matter of course and in the week prior to the

event    itself pro-forma letters are sent to PSV operators and the

emergency services.



Using the directions given me in the frequent discussions and minutes

on file written by the sub divisional      commander    I then draw up a draft

operational    order.   Experience and divisional   policy is used to deploy

the manpower    involved.    The first draft is then submitted to the sub
divisional   commander    (or divisional   commander) who will    request

amendments or sign the order.



At that point the order      is copied and published.



The event then takes place and usually an officer from the office is

involved in the actual execution.



Following the event de brief        information is recorded and the original

file along with the working        papers is filed for future reference.



1989   (000089) SEMI FINAL PLANNING



First knowledge of the event was gained from media reports on 21 March

1989 (210389).    Our    initial   response was to open two files,       one headed

manpower and one headed semi final.        Certain customised forms were

completed and the event given a unique number.          On the face of it D

Division would be required to mount a similar operation to the one

mounted in 1988 (000088) when (excluding traffic points           in D Division)

200 men were used.



I discussed the matter with A/Superintendent KING who told me to begin

planning our operation based on the 1988 (000088)           operation.    After

that meeting   I consulted the sub divisional duty books and realised

that   it would be difficult to raise the manpower wholly from D

Division officers due to annual        leave and courses.



On 22 March 1989 (220389) myself, PS                    and PC 916 BRADLEY

attended a joint planning meeting at Hammerton Road Police Station.

Also present were officers from HQ Ops, Dog/Mounted section,             British
                                                                     PAGE       4


Transport Police, and representatives from British Rail, South

Yorkshire Transport and other organisations.       Chief Superintendent

MOLE chaired the meeting.      Basically the outcome of that meeting was

that the D Division commitment would be the same as in 1988 (000088)

with the exception that Ops and Traffic would be accepting

responsibility for all match traffic in the South Yorkshire Police

area on 15 April     1989 (150489).



At the meeting   I arranged further meetings with South Yorkshire

Transport, British T rans port Police,   British Rail and Road Traffic.



On 23 March 1989 (230389) myself and PC 916 BRADLEY attended the first

of several meetings we were to have with Road Traffic to discuss the

traffic   policing   in D Division.   It was agreed that Inspector SCHOLEY

would draw up the traffic operations order and that affected divisions

would "second" officers to traffic on 15 April      1989 (150489).   It was

estimated that traffic would require 30+ D Division Constables on 15

April   1989 (150489).



I discussed the developments with A/Superintendent KING and informed

him of the requirement to supply 30+ Constables to traffic addition to

the 200 we would probably need in D Division for our operation.         I

also informed him that raising the total      in house was proving

difficult and that cancellation of WL might be required.       It was

decided at that point - 28 March 1989 (280389) - to ask D Division to

supply volunteers to work on WL as an alternative to cancellation.

The request was circulated and produced more officers.



I had several meetings with Inspector MABBOTT of the British Transport

Police and also with staff from British Rail.       The meetings took   place
                                                                            PAfSF    5


in the offices and platforms at Midland Station.          The outcome was that

British Rail would be using the same tactics as in 1988 (000088)              to

deal with the influx of fans at the station except that Inspector

MABBOTT initially declined to have his men segregating Liverpool              fans

from the travelling    public on the platforms      prior to exit from the

South Luggage Exit as in the past.         This task was to be left to us.

(However two days before the operation we received the British

Transport Police order which stated that BTP would after all segregate

the fans on the platforms.       This   contradicted our order but the new

information was given at D Division briefing on 15 April            1989)

(150489).



I also met Mr ________________    of South Yorkshire Transport who told me

that last year a fleet of 35 buses transported fans to and

from Midland Station.     On the outward trip 41 full      loads of Nottingham

supporters were carried and 11 full         loads of Liverpool   fans were

carried.     On return 8 Liverpool      loads were carried and 37 Nottingham

loads.     The outward figures showed that approximately 4160 fans had

been taken to the ground and that 3600 had returned.             (It is not

unusual for fans to walk back due to congestion).          The figures also

showed that 17 buses had managed a return trip on the outward leg and

that 10 had managed a return trip on the return leg.



South Yorkshire Transport regularly transport fans to SWFC from the

Midland Station.     Police escorts are always      requested and it is

usual    to deploy two officers to a full bus.       This was discussed with

A/Superintendent KING and he decided that two officers            per bus would

be used for the operation but that if possible they were to return to

Sheffield Midland for a "return load".          It was hoped that this would

save manpower.     That meant that on 1988 (000088)      figures at least 104
                                                                          PAGE


officers would be required for PSV escorts.



On 29 March 1989 <290389)         I received a request from PC 808 ROSEVEAR

(HQ Ops)    for D manpower to work at SWFC on 15 April       1989 (150489).

After speaking with A/Superitendent KING I informed PC ROSEVEAR that

it would not be possible for D Division to supply any staff as we were

having difficulty raising manpower for our in house needs on the day.



On the 4 April    1989 (040489) Road Traffic requested 35 Constables and

4 Traffic wardens from D Division.         They were to report at Brightside

Lane by 0800 (0800) on the 15 April         1989 (150489).   I subsequently

warned 35 officers who were all D2 Constables.



Also by 4 April    1989 (040489)      I informed A/Superintendent KING that

cancellation of WL was then needed as we were still some 40 officers

short.     He consulted with Chief Superintendent BROOMHEAD and WL on 15

April    (150489) was cancelled for D Division officers on that day.



All D Division staff - with few exceptions - were now included in the

planning.     Court staff, Charge Office s t a f f , CID Aides and some

administrative officers had been included.          Cancellation of WL raised

most of the shortfall      but we were obliged to go to PC 808 ROSEVEAR for

17 officers.     Most of these were Detectives who worked in uniform for

the day.     Given that they were “strangers" none were eventually

deployed other than on PSV escort duties.



On 5 April    1989 (050489)   I had a meeting with A/Superintendent KING.

I told him that I had raised enough manpower for the operation

envisaged which would take in public order patrols on 14 and 15 April

(140489)    (150489),   patrols    in Pond Street and PSV escorts on 15
                                                                                 PAHF   7


April    1989   (130489),,   One problem was that we had a surfeit of

Sergeants and it was decided that two per PSV serial would be

allocated as the important factor was that each PSV have two officers.

At that po int allocat ion of responsibility for the              *D' Division

Senior Officers      involved was decided by A/Superintendent KING which I

noted for inclusion on the order.



On or around the 5 April         1989 (050489)   I contacted Inspector SEWELL at

FI and confirmed the unloading         points for the P S V s .    I also informed

him that the escort serials would amount to 110+ and that they were

available as a reserve during the match itself.             He told me to have

them report to the Gymnasium at SWFC and that they would be given a

hot meal after half time.          I noted the information for inclusion in

the draft D Division order.         PC 916 BRADLEY sent a Gen 2 containing

the information to Inspector SEWELL via Chief Superintendent 8R00MHEAD

on 8 April      1989 (080489).



By this time serial make up and deployment had been decided.                 We had

also made requests for the attendance of mounted officers,                dog section

staff and arranged for a Brimac vehicle to be on standby.                 It was

apparent that we would need extra vehicles and requests for these were

made through HQ Traffic Management.          Also requests for radios and

repeater sets were made.         1 radio between 2 officers was to be the

issue.    A logistics team was appointed to manage all the extra

equipment from collection to issue and return.



Meals were ordered for all         concerned and the PSV escort serials were

to be given a hot drink and packed meal at briefing               in case they did

not receive their hot meal at SWFC due to being utilised.                 Hot drinks

were also laid on at Sheffield Midland.
                                                                           P A fiF        S




On 7 April    19S9 (070489)    I drew up a draft operational    order.     I gave

it to A/Superintendent KING on 8 April        1989 (080489)   for his

amendments.     On 9 April    1989 (090489) A/Superintendent KING returned

the order to me with some minor       changes.     These were incorporated into

the 2nd draft which I submitted to him on 10 April          1989 (100489).

This   copy was read by Superintendent BATES who signed the order that

day.   It was then copied and distributed.



At around that date I attended a final        planning meeting at Hammerton

Road which was chaired by Chief Superintendent DUCKENFIELD.              My input

to the meeting was the arrangements made for PSV escorts.



In the final days run up to the operation the office published several

other unconnected orders.       As is common on orders which use large

numbers of officers    changes had to be made to the semi final order

serials as circumstances dictated.        Consequently it was necessary to

update the master serial      list by hand.      A copy of that list is

attached and reflects the make up of       the serials as they were

deployed on 15 April    1989 (150489).     The new information was passed            to

the officers    involved both prior to and at the main briefing.

Efficiency was not compromised.



All supervisors were sent an advance       copy of the order on the 10 April

1989 (100489) as were surrounding Divisions, HQ, Specialists and

8TP.    In common with normal     practice spare copies were available at

briefing as were displayed copies of the serial          lists and deployments.

A pile of SWFC maps were also made available for those unfamiliar

with the g ro u nd .
                                                                       P AGE


A total of 12 serials were sent to SWFC totalling      120 officers of

which 19 were sergeants.       Inspectors HARPER and DEWS accompanied

them.   In D Division    (excluding traffic points) 46 officers were

deployed on public order and Pond Street duties over a three day

operation.



As for the order   itself the main strategy and policy was      laid down by

A/Superintendent KING.       I attended to the detail and liaison with

other divisions and outside organisations.       The working   papers and

original   copy of the order    is filed in E Group office at West Bar

Police Station

           SUBJECTS       SEMI FINAL      -    D DIVISION PLANNING



           Chief    Inspector BETTISON,          who is engaged on the HQ semi final enquiry

           team,    has requested that         I submit a report on the above subject to his

           office urgently and in any event before 27 April                1989 (270489).



           INTRODUCTION        -    D DIVISION OPERATIONS PLANNING



           Presently myself and PC 916 BRADLEY are responsible for the initial

           planning of D1 sub divisional             policing response to events which occur

           within the sub division.              Occasionally we plan the response for the

           whole division when the manpower             commitment    is large,    such as for a

           Royal    visit or major march/procession which affects D1 and D2.
First knowledge of events         is gained in several ways,    from

correspondence, media reports,         poster campaigns,   telephone   calls and

there are many which recur annually.          Once we have knowledge of an

event which appears to require police action a report is made to the

sub divisional       commander.    He then instructs the course which will

be taken which ranges from advising the organisers to preparation of

an operational       order.    FGO and FSOs are consulted and adhered to where

appl i cabl e .



Once it had been decided that an order will be prepared the event is

programmed into the D1         planning system.   A file is opened and a number

of customised forms are completed.          Key dates are entered in the sub

divisional    diaries and the event assigned a unique event number.           It

is not unusual to have several events being planned simultaneously,

presently there are 8 "live" files being handled by the office.



Thereafter meetings are held with all         interested parties and regular

reports made to the sub divisional         (and sometimes divisional)

commander to keep them updated.          The usual method is for a minute to

be attached to the event working file showing the up to date             position.

We also    liaise with statutory undertakers,       PSV operators, and the

emergency services as a matter of course and in the week prior to the

event   itself pro-forma letters are sent to PSV operators and the

emergency services.



Using the directions given me in the frequent discussions and minutes

on file written by the sub divisional         commander    I then draw up a draft

operational       order.   Experience and divisional   policy is used to deploy

the manpower       involved.    The first draft is then submitted to the sub
                                                                              PAGE

divisional     commander   (or divisional   commander) who will     request

amendments or sign the order.



At that     point the order   is copied and published.



The event then takes place and usually an officer from the office is

    involved in the actual execution.



Following the event de brief information is recorded and the original

file along with 'the working       papers is filed for future reference.



    1989 (000089) SEMI FINAL PLANNING



First knowledge of the event was gained from media reports on 21 March

1989     (210389).   Our initial   response was to open two files,       one headed

manpower and one headed semi final.         Certain customised forms were

completed and the event given a unique number.            On the face of it D

Division would be required to mount a similar operation to the one

mounted in 1988 (000088) when        (excluding traffic    points   in D Division)

200 men were used.



    I discussed the matter with A/Superintendent KING who told me to begin

    planning our operation based on the 1988 (000088)       operation.    After

that meeting     I consulted the sub divisional     duty books and realised

    that it would be difficult to raise the manpower wholly from D

Division officers due to annual        leave and courses.



On 22 March 1989 (220389) myself,       PS ___________ and PC 916 BRADLEY

attended a joint planning meeting at Hammerton Road Police Station.

Also     present were officers from HQ Ops, Dog/Mounted section, British
Transport Police,    and representatives from British Rail, South

Yorkshire Transport and other organisations.       Chief Superintendent

MOLE chaired the meeting.     Basically the outcome of that meeting was

that the D Division commitment would be the same as in 1988 (000088)

with the exception that Ops and Traffic would be accepting

responsibility for all match traffic     in the South Yorkshire Police

area on 15 April    1989 (150489).



At the meeting    I arranged further meetings with South Yorkshire

Transport,    British Transport Police, British Rail and Road Traffic.



On 23 March 1989 (230389) myself and PC 916 BRADLEY attended the first

of several meetings we were to have with Road Traffic to discuss the

traffic    policing in D Division.   It was agreed that Inspector SCHOLEY

would draw up the traffic operations order and that affected divisions

would "second" officers to traffic on 15 April      1989 (150489).     It was

estimated that traffic would require 30+ D Division Constables on 15

April    1989 (150489).



I discussed the developments with A/Superintendent KING and informed

him of the requirement to supply 30+ Constables to traffic addition to

the 200 we would probably need in D Division for our operation.           I

also    informed him that raising the total   in house was   proving

difficult and that cancellation of WL might be required.         It was

decided at that point - 28 March 1989 (280389) - to ask D Division to

supply volunteers to work on WL as an alternative to cancellation.

The request was circulated and produced more officers.



I had several meetings with Inspector MAB80TT of the British Transport

Police and also with staff from British Rail.       The meetings took place
in the offices and platforms at Midland Station.        The outcome was that

British Rail would be using the same tactics as in 1988 (000088)           to

deal with the influx of fans at the station except that Inspector

MABBOTT initially declined to have his men segregating Liverpool           fans

from the travelling    publie on the platforms prior to exit from the

South Luggage Exit as in the    past.   This task was to be left to us.

(However two days before the operation we received the British

Transport Police order which stated that BTP would after all         segregate

the fans on the platforms.     This contradicted our order but the new

information was given at D Division briefing on 15 April         1989)

(150489).



I also met Mr I                 of South Yorkshire Transport who told me

that last year a fleet of 35 buses transported fans to and

from Midland Station.     On the outward trip 41 full    loads of Nottingham

supporters were carried and 11 full      loads of Liverpool   fans were

carried.     On return 8 Liverpool   loads were carried and 37 Nottingham

loads.     The outward figures showed that approximately 4160 fans had

been taken to the ground and that 3600 had returned.          (It is not

unusual for fans to walk back due to congestion).        The figures also

showed that 17 buses had managed a return trip on the outward leg and

that 10 had managed a return trip on the return leg.



South Yorkshire Transport regularly transport fans to SWFC from the

Midland Station.     Police escorts are always requested and it is

usual    to deploy two officers to a full   bus.   This was discussed with

A/Superintendent KING and he decided that two officers        per bus would

be used for the operation but that if possible they were to return to

Sheffield Midland for a "return load".       It was hoped that this would

save manpower.     That meant that on 1988 (000088)    figures at least ’104
                                                                       PAGE


officers would be required for PSV escorts.



On 29 March 1989 (290389)      I received a request from PC 808 ROSEVEAR

(HQ Ops)    for D manpower to work at SWFC on 15 April    1989 (150489).

After speaking with A/Superitendent KING I informed PC ROSEVEAR that

it would not be possible for D Division to supply any staff as we were

having difficulty raising manpower for our in house needs on the day.



On the 4 April    1989 (040489) Road Traffic   requested 35 Constables and

4 Traffic wardens from D Division.       They were to report at Brightside

Lane by 0800    (0800) on the 15 April   1989 (150489).   I subsequently

warned 35 officers who were all D2 Constables.



Also by 4 April    1989 (040489)   I informed A/Superintendent KING that

cancellation of WL was then needed as we were still some 40 officers

short.     He consulted with Chief Superintendent BROGMHEAD and WL on 15

April    (150489) was cancelled for D Division officers on that day.



All D Division staff - with few exceptions - were now included in the

planning.     Court staff, Charge Office staff, CID Aides and some

administrative officers had been included.       Cancellation of WL raised

most of the shortfall     but we were obliged to go to PC 808 ROSEVEAR for

17 officers.     Most of these were Detectives who worked in uniform for

the day.     Given that they were "strangers" none were eventually

deployed other than on PSV escort duties.



On 5 April    1989 (050489)   I had a meeting with A/Superintendent KING.

I told him that I had raised enough manpower for the operation

envisaged which would take in public order      patrols on 14 and 15 April

(140489)    (150489),   patrols in Pond Street and PSV escorts on 15
                                                                            PAGE       7


April    1989 (150489).   One    problem was that we had a surfeit of

Sergeants and it was decided that two per PSV serial would be

allocated as the important factor was that each PSV have two officers.

At that point allocation of responsibility for the           9D' Division

Senior Officers involved was decided by A/Superintendent KING which                I

noted for inclusion on the order.



On or around the 5 April        1989 (050489)   I contacted Inspector SEWELL at

FI and confirmed the unloading        points for the PSVs.    I also informed

him that the escort serials would amount to 110+ and that they were

available as a reserve during the match itself.          He told me to have

them report to the Gymnasium at SWFC and that they would be given a

hot meal after half time.         I noted the information for inclusion in

the draft D Division order.        PC 916 BRADLEY sent a Gen 2 containing

the information to Inspector SEWELL via Chief Superintendent BROOMHEAD

on 8 April    1989 (080489).



By this time serial make up and deployment had been decided.            We had

also made requests for the attendance of mounted officers,           dog section

staff and arranged for a Brimac vehicle to be on standby.            It was

apparent that we would need extra vehicles and requests for these were

made through HQ Traffic Management.         Also requests for radios and

repeater sets were made.         1 radio between 2 officers was to be the

issue.    A logistics team was appointed to manage all the extra

equipment from collection to issue and return.



Meals were ordered for all        concerned and the PSV escort serials were

to be given a hot drink and packed meal at briefing          in case they did

not receive their hot meal at SWFC due to being utilised.            Hot drinks

were also laid on at Sheffield Midland.
                                                                           PAGE        8




On 7 April    1989 (070489)   I drew up a draft operational     order.     I gave

it to A/Superintendent KING on 8 April        1989 (080489)   for his

amendments.    On 9 April     1989 (090489) A/Superintendent KING returned

the order to me with some minor       changes.     These were incorporated into

the 2nd draft which I submitted to him on 10 April          1989 (100489).

This   copy was read by Superintendent BATES who signed the order that

day.   It was then copied and distributed.



At around that date I attended a final        planning meeting at Hammerton

Road which was chaired by Chief Superintendent DUCKENFIELD.              My input

to the meeting was the arrangements made for PSV escorts.



In the final days run up to the operation the office published several

other unconnected orders.       As is common on orders which use large

numbers of officers changes had to be made to the semi final order

serials as circumstances dictated.        Consequently it was necessary to

update the master serial      list by hand.      A copy of that list is

attached and reflects the make up of       the serials as they were

deployed on 15 April    1989 (150489).     The new information was passed         to

the officers involved both prior to and at the main briefing.

Efficiency was not compromised.



All supervisors were sent an advance       copy of the order on the 10 April

1989 (100489) as were surrounding Divisions, HQ, Specialists and

BTP.    In common with normal     practice spare copies were available at

briefing as were displayed copies of the serial          lists and deployments.

A pile of SWFC maps were also made available for those unfamiliar

with the ground.
A total of 12 serials were sent to SWFC totalling      120 officers of

which   19 were sergeants.     Inspectors HARPER and DEWS accompanied

them.   In D Division    (excluding traffic points) 46 officers were

deployed on public order and Pond Street duties over a three day

operation.



As for the order itself the main strategy and policy was laid down

A/Superintendent KING.       I attended to the detail and liaison with

other divisions and outside organisations.       The working   papers and

original   copy of the order is filed in E Group office at West Bar

Police Station

           SUBJECT s     SEMI FINAL      -    D DIVISION PLANNING



           Chief    Inspector 8ETTIS0N,         who   is engaged on the HQ semi final enquiry

           team,    has requested that        I submit a report on the above subject to his

           office urgently and in any event before 27 April                 1989 (270489)=



           INTRODUCTION       -    D DIVISION OPERATIONS PLANNING



           Presently myself and PC 916 BRADLEY are responsible for the initial

           planning of D1 sub divisional              policing response to events which occur

           within the sub division*             Occasionally we plan the response for the

           whole division when the manpower              commitment   is large,    such as for a

           Royal    visit or major march/pro cession which affects D1 and D 2 .
                                                                           PAfiF    £




First knowledge of events        is gained in several ways,   from

correspondence,      media reports,   poster campaigns,   telephone    calls and

there are many which recur annually.         Once we have knowledge of an

event which appears to require police action a report          is made to the

sub divisional      commander.    He then instructs the course which will

be taken which ranges from advising the organisers to preparation of

an operational      order.    FGO and FSOs are consulted and adhered to where

appli cafole.



Once it had been decided that an order will be prepared the event is

programmed into the D1 planning system.         A file is opened and a number

of customised forms are completed.         Key dates are entered in the sub

divisional    diaries and the event assigned a unique event number.            It

is not unusual      to have several   events being planned simultaneously,

presently there are 8 "live" files being handled by the office.



Thereafter meetings are held with all        interested parties and regular

reports made to the sub divisional        (and sometimes divisional)

commander to keep them updated.         The usual method is for a minute to

be attached to the event working file showing the up to date position.

We also   liaise with statutory undertakers, PSV operators, and the

emergency services as a matter of course and in the week             prior to the

event   itself    pro-forma letters are sent to PSV operators and the

emergency services.



Using the directions given me in the frequent discussions and minutes

on file written by the sub divisional        commander I then draw up a draft

operational      order.   Experience and divisional   policy is used to deploy

the manpower      involved.    The first draft is then submitted to the sub
                                                                             PAGE    3


divisional   commander   (or divisional    commander)   who will   request

amendments or sign the order.



At that point the order     is copied and published.



The event then takes place and usually an officer from the office               is

involved in the actual execution.



Following the event de brief information is recorded and the original

file along with the working     papers    is filed for future reference.



1989 (000089) SEMI FINAL PLANNING



First knowledge of the event was gained from media reports on 21 March

1989 (210389).    Our initial   response was to open two files,         one headed

manpower and one headed semi     final.    Certain customised forms were

completed and the event given a unique number.           On the face of it D

Division would be required to mount a similar operation to the one

mounted in 1988 (000088) when     (excluding traffic      points   in D Division)

200 men were used.



I discussed the matter with A/Superintendent KING who told me to begin

planning our operation based on the 1988 (000088)          operation.    After

that meeting   I consulted the sub divisional duty books and realised

that it would be difficult to raise the manpower wholly from D

Division officers due to annual     leave and courses.



On 22 March 1989 (220389) myself, PS                    |and PC 916 BRADLEY

attended, a joint planning meeting at Hammer ton Road Police Station.

Also   present were officers from HQ Ops, Dog/Mounted section, British
                                                                    PAGE     4


Transport Police, and representatives from British Rail, South

Yorkshire Transport and other organisations.     Chief Superintendent

MOLE chaired the meeting.    Basically the outcome of that meeting was

that the D Division commitment would be the same as in 1988 (000088)

with the exception that Ops and Traffic would be accepting

responsibility for all match traffic    in the South Yorkshire Police

area on 15 April   1989 (150489).



At the meeting   I arranged further meetings with South Yorkshire

Trans port, British Transport Police, British Rail and Road Traffic.



On 23 March 1989 (230389) myself and PC 916 BRADLEY attended the first

of several meetings we were to have with Road Traffic to discuss the

traffic policing in D Division.     It was agreed that Inspector SCHOLEY

would draw up the traffic operations order and that affected divisions

would "second" officers to traffic on 15 April    1989 (150489).    It was

estimated that traffic would require 30+ D Division Constables on 15

April   1989 (150489).



I discussed the developments with A/Superintendent KING and informed

him of the requirement to supply 30+ Constables to traffic addition to

the 200 we would probably need in D Division for our operation.       I

also informed him that raising the total    in house was proving

difficult and that cancellation of WL might be required.     It was

decided at that point - 28 March 1989 (2803S9) - to ask D Division to

supply volunteers to work on WL as an alternative to cancellation.

The request was circulated and produced more officers.



I had several meetings with Inspector MABBOTT of the British Transport

Police and also with staff from British Rail.    The meetings took place
                                                                         PAGE   5


in the offices and platforms at Midland Station.        The outcome was that

British Rail would be using the same tactics as in 1988 (000088)           to

deal with the influx of fans at the station except that Inspector

MABBOTT initially declined to have his men segregating Liverpool fans

from the travelling    public on the platforms prior to exit from the

South Luggage Exit as in the past.       This task was to be left to us.

(However two days before the operation we received the British

Transport Police order which stated that BTP would after all segregate

the fans on the platforms.     This contradicted our order but the new

information was given at D Division briefing on 15 April        1989)

(150489).



I also met Mr                   of South Yorkshire Transport who told me

that   last year a fleet of 35 buses transported fans to and

from Midland Station.     On the outward trip 41 full     loads of Nottingham

supporters were carried and 11 full      loads of Liverpool fans were

carried.     On return 8 Liverpool   loads were   carried and 37 Nottingham

loads.     The outward figures showed that approximately 4160 fans had

been taken to the ground and that 3600 had returned.         (It is not

unusual for fans to walk back due to congestion).        The figures also

showed that 17 buses had managed a return trip on the outward leg and

that 10 had managed a return trip on the return leg.



South Yorkshire Transport    regularly transport fans to SWFC from the

Midland Station.     Police escorts are always     requested and it is

usual to deploy two officers to a full bus.        This was discussed with

A/Superintendent KING and he decided that two officers per bus would

be used for the operation but that if possible they were to return to

Sheffield Midland for a “return load".       It was hoped that this would

save manpower.     That meant that on 1988 (000088)     figures at least 104
                                                                          PAGE


officers would be required for PSV escorts.



On 29 March 19S9 (290389)         I received a request from PC SOS ROSEVEAR

(HQ Ops) for D manpower to work at SWFC on 15 April          1989 (150489).

After speaking with A/Superitendent KING I informed PC ROSEVEAR that

it would not be possible for D Division to supply any staff as we were

having difficulty raising manpower for our in house needs on the day.



On the 4 April    1989 (040489) Road Traffic      requested 35 Constables and

4   Traffic wardens from D Division.        They were to report at Brightside

Lane by 0800    (0800) on the 15 April      1989 (150489).   I subsequently

warned 35 officers who were all D2 Constables.



Also by 4 April    1989 (040489)      I informed A/Superintendent KING that

cancellation of WL was then needed as we were still some 40 officers

short.     He consulted with Chief Superintendent BROOMHEAD and WL on 15

April    (150489) was cancelled for D Division officers on that day.



All D Division staff - with few exceptions - were now included in the

planning.     Court staff, Charge Office staff, CID Aides and some

administrative officers had been included.          Cancellation of WL raised

most of the shortfall but we were obliged to go to PC 808 ROSEVEAR for

17 officers.     Most of these were Detectives who worked in uniform for

the day.     Given that they were      "strangers" none were eventually

deployed other than on PSV escort duties.



On 5 April    1989 (050489)   I had a meeting with A/Superintendent KING.

I told him that I had raised enough manpower for the operation

envisaged which would take in public order patrols on 14 and 15 April

(140489)    (150489),   patrols    in Pond Street and PSV escorts on 15
                                                                               PAGE


April    1989 (1504S9).   One    problem was that we had a surfeit of

Sergeants and it was decided that two per PSV serial would be

allocated as the important factor was that each PSV have two officers.

At that point allocation of responsibi1ity for the              'D* Division

Senior Officers involved was decided by A/Superintendent KING which                   I

noted for inclusion on the order.



On or around the 5 April        1989    (050489)   I contacted Inspector SEWELL at

FI and confirmed the unloading           points for the PSVs.     I also informed

him that the escort serials would amount to 110+ and that they were

available as a reserve during the match itself.             He told me to have

them report to the Gymnasium at SWFC and that they would be given a

hot meal after half time.         I noted the information for inclusion in

the draft D Division order.            PC 916 BRADLEY sent a Gen 2 containing

the information to Inspector SEWELL via Chief Superintendent BROOMHEAD

on S April    1989 (080489).



By this time serial make up and deployment had been decided.               We had

also made requests for the attendance of mounted officers,              dog section

staff and arranged for a Brimac vehicle to be on standby.               It was

apparent that we would need extra vehicles and requests for these were

made through HQ Traffic Management.            Also requests for radios and

repeater sets were made.         1 radio between 2 officers was to be the

issue.    A logistics team was appointed to manage all the extra

equipment from collection to issue and return.



Meals were ordered for all        concerned and the PSV escort serials were

to be given a hot drink and packed meal at briefing             in case they did

not receive their hot meal at SWFC due to being utilised.               Hot drinks

were also    laid on at Sheffield Midland.
                                                                           P AGE        8




On 7 April    1989 (070489)    I drew up a draft operational order.        I gave

it to A/Superintendent KING on 8 April        19S9 (080489) for his

amendments.    On 9 April     1989 (090489) A/Superintendent KING returned

the order to me with some minor        changes-     These were incorporated into

the 2nd draft which I submitted to him on 10 April           1989 (100489).

This copy was read by Superintendent BATES who signed the order that

day.   It was then copied and distributed.



At around that date I attended a final        planning meeting at Hammerton

Road which was chaired by Chief Superintendent DUCKENFIELD.            iiy input

to the meeting was the arrangements made for PSV escorts.



In the final days run up to the operation the office           published several

other unconnected orders.       As   is common on orders which use large

numbers of officers    changes had to be made to the semi final order

serials as circumstances dictated.         Consequently it was necessary to

update the master serial      list by hand.       A copy of that list is

attached and reflects the make up of        the serials as they were

deployed on 15 April    1989 (150489).      The new information was passed         to

the officers    involved both prior to and at the main briefing.

Efficiency was not compromised.



All supervisors were sent an advance        copy of the order on the 10 April

1989 (100489) as were surrounding Divisions,, HQ, Specialists and

BTP.   In common with normal      practice spare copies were available at

briefing as were displayed copies of the serial           lists and deployments.

A pile of SWFC maps were also made available for those unfamiliar

with the ground.

A total of 12 serials were sent to SWFC totalling         120 officers of

which   19 were sergeants.     Inspectors HARPER and DEWS accompanied

them.    In D Division (excluding traffic points) 46 officers were

deployed on public order and Pond Street duties over a three day

operation.



As for the order itself the main strategy and policy was laid down by

A/Superintendent KING.       I attended to the detail and liaison with

other divisions and outside organisations.        The working      papers and

original   copy of the order    is filed in E Group office at West Bar

           Further to my previous statement       I would make the following specific

           points of criticism.

           The first being a number of points concerning the South Yorkshire

           Police.

           1) Traffic arrangements for supporters arriving from the South and

           this includes a significant number of Liverpool          supporters were

           totally inadequate for the volume of vehicles.

           Specifically cars leaving the Ml at Junction 34 were directed

           towards    the City Centre,    which was already congested.

           2) When we arrived at the Leppings Lane turnstiles at 2=30 pm (1430)

           the situation was already out of control of the Police.           Groups of

           Officers were standing around doing nothing.           There was no filtering

           or queuing system.        Several mounted police near the turnstiles seemed
                                                                        PAGE      ,2


to have lost control     of their horses with a threat of injury to those

trying to gain admission.

3) When we passed through Gate C nobody examined our tickets or gave

us directions onto the terraces.

4) Just before 1 lost consciousness        probably around 1503 hours   (1503)

I saw a Police Officer walk slowly along the other side of the fence

in front of me towards the main stand.         He was completely oblivious to

the groans,   screams and cries for help from the crowd.

5) At about   1530 (1530)   hours having    regained consciousness outside

Gate C I was several     times refused entry back    into Pen 3 by a cordon

of Police blocking the tunnel entrance.         I was then denied the

opportunity to seek out my son and if he had still been alive assist

with his resuscitation.       1 was also anxious about the other two boys

and about the loss of my spectacles.

6) At about 1730 (1730)     hours when I was being treated in the St

Johns Ambulance Room                       ^ent off to try and find a phone.

He wandered by mistake into the gymnasium where he saw at least fifty

of the victims.    There was obviously no control over access to the

corpses at this time.

7) At about 1845 hours      (1S45)   having returned to the stadium I asked

a Police Officer   if there had been any fatalities and he replied?        "one

or two."    He would certainly have known that he was lying.       Also at

this time we were advised by a Police Officer to go to Hammerton

Road,   but we were told no transport was available and eventually

hitched a lift there.

S)   Immediately after   identifying Kesters body I was taken by a Police

Officer to a table in the gymnasium and asked to recount the events of

the day.    This took about ten minutes.       The Police Officer then asked

me to go through it again so he could write it down.         As a result of

this procedure    it was at least an hour before I was given an
                                                                     PAGE      3


opportunity to telephone my wife with the bad news.

The officer who took the statement omitted all     critical   references to

the Police.     At one point Kesters belongings were brought and I was

asked to check them and sign a receipt,     this was very distressing.

9) Within the past few weeks the Chief Constable Peter WRIGHT has

stated that there is additional     evidence which has not been made

publi c .

He denies knowing what this evidence     is, but has implied on a

number of occasions that the behaviour of Liverpool Supporters was a

major    contributory factor.   His remarks have been widely reported by

the Press    in Sheffield where the inquests will be held.     I believe he

has abused his position and prejudiced the outcome of the inquests.

My criticsrri of the football association iss

1.    The Association insistence that both semi finals should be played

simultaneously and that neither should be shown live on television

created an extraordinary demand for tickets.

2.    Allocation of the smaller Leppings Lane end to Liverpool

highlighted the demand mentioned in (1) above.      The four of us who

travelled to Sheffield were all season ticket holders at Anfield,        but

only two of us automatically qualified for a semi final ticket,         (The

other two obtained tickets quite legitimately on the morning of the

mat c h )»

My criticism of Sheffield Wednesday Football Club iss

•1.   The fatal design of the two central   pens was obviously crucial

once through the tunnel,    there was no means of escape to the left or

right while the front gate was totally inadequate,

2.    There was no indicatation anywhere near the tunnel entrance that

there were other points of access to the terraces.      Neither did we see

any stewards directing supporters onto the terraces.

3,    The tickets advised spectators to take up their   positions "15
                                                                              PAGE


   *      minutes before kick off".     Those of us who arrived at the turnstiles

          fay 1430 hours   (1430) would have expected to be able to comply with th

          request.

          4.     The map on the ticket was   inaccurate and dangerously misleading.

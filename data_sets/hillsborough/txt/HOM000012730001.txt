TAYLOR REPORT: POLICE ISSUES
Your note of 26 June asked for contributions to the briefing for
Lord Ferrers for his meeting with Mr Anderton. A â€™line to take1
on radio communications is attached.
As the Taylor recommendation on radios was for the Home Office and
has been met there is no need for me to attend the meeting -
although I would be happy to do so if required.

Rec 55: There should always be a command channel reserved solely
for the Police Commander to communicate with his senior officers
round the ground.

LINE TO TAKE
Additional Channels
1.    The Home Office Radio Frequency and Communications Planning
      Unit made available on 1 January 1990 eight new channels for
      use at pre-planned events.
2.      The channels are not geographically assigned by the Home
        Office and must be co-ordinated by users to minimize
        interference between operations. They may be used for
        command purposes at football matches.
Noise
3.    At the request of ACPO the Home Office Police Requirements
      Support Unit has set up a working party to improve the use of
      radios in a noisy environment.
4.    The working party will consider
      a)    what equipment is available to attach to existing radios
and   b)    the development of special equipment.

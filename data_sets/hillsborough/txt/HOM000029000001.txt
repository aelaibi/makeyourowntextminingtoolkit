 Dear Mr. Jones,
                              Sheffield Wednesday Inquiry
              In a telephone discussion with Chief Inspector Ross late
 this evening, I discovered that permission had not been given
 for representatives of the Club to enter on the Leppings Lane
 end of the ground to make measurements or carry out tests.
               I must apologise most sincerely for the fact that on 17 May,
 we made a level survey of part of the West terrace,and that on
 15 May,we carried out an experiment in which one of the exit
 gates from the terrace was subjected to the test load appropriate
  to a crush barrier,in order to see whether under that load the
 quick release device which we designed operated easily.
              There was unfortunately a complete misunderstanding.                                                                               You
 will know that we designed shoring for the boundary wall round
  the South West corner of the ground but were not able to instruct
  the contractors to carry out the work until we had Lord Justice
  Taylor's permission.                                 When that permission was given, I had understood
  that we now had freedom of access to the whole of the Leppings Lane end.
  I now realise that that was incorrect.
               I wish to express my sincere apology and to assure you that no
  disrespect was meant to your authority.
                                                                                                               Yours sincejaely,

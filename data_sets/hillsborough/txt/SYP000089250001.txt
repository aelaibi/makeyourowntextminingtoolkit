I thought               the tunnel       was the cftjly entrance.

A i j five             of us went       down the         M^je 1»      I never    saw any     police        or

could no                longer           see any of my              companions.

At about 3.10                      pm     (1510)        I climbed over             the       dividing           fence    into    pen

number 5 and went                          out       onto     the    pitch,      where         I saw               and             a nd

I thought                        that     the game may start a gain so                        I. stopped          in pen number         six

At about 3.30                      pm     ( 1530)       I realised that                people        had died.            I.could      see

bodies             on      the      pitch with their                faces covered,               it was then that           I went

back         down          onto          the    pitch 1 0 look           for my friends.

By about                3.45       pm     (1545)        all    the      people       1 had travelled with except

Gary C H U RC H were all                           together         on the      pitch.

We were all w o ndering                              what     had happened to Gary CHURCH and                             thought          he

might         have          gone back              to the minibus.

All      eleven of us                     left       the ground at about                    4.00    pm (1600)           of our       own

The     only other                   thing     I cannot         unde r s t a n d    is why the entrance              to t h e

stewards?                 which       1 believe was the                 case at the         1988 semi-final.

Dear Mr. Whalley,
                                                                                                                        M -(i



                             Hillsborough Stadium Disaster Inquiry

       I am writing to acknowledge receipt of your letter dated
2nd October, as Graham Kelly is abroad this week on Football
Association business.   We are also considering the wide ranging
questions raised in your letter dated 25th September,
acknowledged by Graham Kelly on 2 7th September.

       As you know, the subjects to which you refer are complex.
The submission for Phase 2 of Lord Justice Taylor's Inquiry was a
result of many meetings between representatives of The Football
Association and The Football League.   It may be necessary,
therefore, for those members to meet again to discuss in detail
the points you raise.   We believe the best way forward may be to
meet with you and advise you direct what action has been taken so
far and what action is planned in the future.

       I will of course bring your letter dated 2nd October to
Graham Kelly's attention when he returns to this Country.

        Whilst writing, may I refer to Graham Kelly's letter to
you dated 27th September, concerning the possibility of obtaining
copies of the submissions that have been received, or
alternatively a list of contributors.    We look forward to
receiving your response to this inquiry at your earliest
c onvenience.

                                                 Yours sincerely,




                                            Patricia F. Smith

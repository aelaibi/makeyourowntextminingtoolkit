             I am                               I am a married man and live together with my

             wife at                      Hillsborough,           Sheff ield,

             Stadium.

             F rom                                             I have a clear view of Leppings

            Ln,                                                    however,     I cannot see the

             Leppi ng Ln entrance      into the footb al 1 g r o u n d .

            On Saturday\15 April         1989       (150489)     I was at home from aboutv midday,         I
S.o.£
            was aware that the Liverpool               v Nottingham Forest F A Cup Semi Final

            was being staged at the ground on that day and I could see over a
U W f e
             period of two houns a steady flow of people walking towards the

            Leppings Ln entrance.            I could see that some were wearing Liverpool

             scarfs and shirts and spoke with Merseyside a c c e n t s .
                                                                                            PAGE
                                                                                            S32S

               I would ^k Ls o say that a majority of 'Wiese people were drinking            from

               beer   cans and bottles.     The movement and presence of these          people

               steadily grew.       I noticed that Police Officers appeared to be posted

               at the end of every road junction and several appeared to be walking

               a 1 ong'S^sppings Ln, as if they were escorting tj^e supporters.
                                                                   v      > v   N 23(^0
               At about 2.30 pm <1430)      the same day,     togetncr witn* my wife, we drove
S.O.£_         f rom^uii^house                              ~| onto Lepprh^s Ln at that point

               I saw a mass of pe op le .     I drove very s 1owly along Leppings Ln

               towards Catch Bar Ln.

               I OK^uld say that there were .RVidreds standi ng outside the entrance to

               the grdVnd.    They appeared to tm. pushing towards the turnstiles

               There was a large number of people corrd ng from all directions.               I

               could sense that with all the number of people there would be

               trouble.    I could not see how all of them would be able to enter the

               ground prior to kick off.

               On previous match days,      I had seen fans being walked into the ground

               with a large Police      presence's.   On this o c c a s ion either due to the

O n            large number of fans, PtKUce       presence appeared sparce.         I noticed one
                                                                                    --------------

               shopping   centre.     I must have driven for about one mile from the

               ground.    I could see a steady flow of Liverpool          fans walking towards

               it.

               Whilst shopping      in Hi 11sborough, at about     1500 h o u r s , I noti ced a few

               fans walking out of the local Pubs.

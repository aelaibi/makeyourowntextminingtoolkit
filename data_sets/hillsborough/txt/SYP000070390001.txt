                                           I don't know where they                                    live.      We went         in a

     car owned by|______ .                    We    left Liv e r p o o l        at about        10 am     (1QQ0 hrs)         on the

     Saturday.            T r a v e l li n g       direct    to S h e f f i e l d without             stopping.        There

     were     no    serious            delays       on route and we a r r i v e d               in S h e f f i e l d at about,

0^   12.30        (1230 hrs)            and    parked       the    car on the            car    park of       'The

     s u pporters         drinking alcoh ol                 before a r r i v i n g at           the    pub.    We    had half a

     pint     of beer and               it didn't          taste    very good so we               left after 20 minute*

     and went         to the           chip shop opposite                for fish and            chips.        The    other

     suppo r t e r s were              drinking        in the      pub but          I didn't      see anyone          drunk,,

     everyone         was     in good humour.                  This was           the only       pub that        I saw open.



     On   route       to the ground                 I saw Police              standing     around,,       but we were            not

     route.         When we a rr iv ed at the ground                            there were        very few          people       in

     the area.            We decided               to go    into    the        gnjund     straight        away      in order          to

            We    remained          in this     p o s ition for about an hour and a quarter.                                               Due

            to the         crowds      that    had since         been entering                the     pen we m oved                   to a

            about      2.30        (1430 h r s ).      The     fans were          in good           pre match humour.                           The

            crowds         began     increasing        but     it was         nothing       to be concerned about.                                 I ’m

            used     to crowds at Anf ield.                    The      crowd was         still          good h u m o u r e d             singing

            and shouting and swaying.                         I saw a few fans who,                          it was             obvious        to me,

            had been drinking                 quite     heav i l y but         they were n ' t               causing a problem and

            I saw no drinking                 of alcohol         in the        pens.

            next     to me.          I knew at        this     point         s o m ething     was        going             s e r i o u s l y wrong,

         also     saw that      the game         had stopped.             Po l i c e and fans were              now standing

          on the    fences at         the front           of the     pen pu 1 1 i n g^^ep^fT e over and onto the

          into    the stand to the             rear.        As    the    crowds      started        reducing       there
                                                                     C M JO d l ,

         Someone       next    to me    s ho u t e d      “Give    us a hand someone               here     is still

         alive",       I looked down and saw a pile of bodies                                in the well         by the

         wall.      I saw my friend                                under      two    of the bodies and                I saw he

         was     the one alive.             We      both    pulled                 out of the        bodies and

         passed     him over         the fence a n d onto               the   pitch.         I then f o l l o w e d him,

         and     collapsed onto         the      pitch with          relief and exhaustion.



         When     I stood up I saw that my three                         friends were w ith me.                  A stew a r d

         came    up to us and d i r e c te d us to the S o u t h S t a n d a rea and we                               sat   down

          in the dug out          by the       players        tunnel.         People        both Police         and    fans and

         S t e wards   were     helping        dead and          injured fans across               the    pitch to where

         the a m b u l a n c e s were.



         At about       4.15    pm    (1615 hrs)           we deci d e d      to    leave     the ground and we were

         directed       by a P o l i c e m a n      out    into P e n i s t o n e R d ,       During      the    period       of

         time     I was      in the    gr o u n d    I did not w i t n e s s any             criminal      offences.



         I feel     that      the disaster           was    caused by         l^k      of    control      or o r g a n i s a t i o n

               helping    the fans who were          o b vi ou s l y getting     crushed to death.      T hey

               just    stood there     not know i n g what      to do.



               On getting      outside   the gr o u n d   I phoned my mother          and all   of us then

               drove   back    to                 , getting    home at about       6 .30 - 7.0 0   (1830 hrs

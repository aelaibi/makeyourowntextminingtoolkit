              I am a life       long Liverpool        supporter and as often as                         possible            travel

              to all     the matches.         On S at ur da y         IS April        1989     (150489)           I was      going

              to the semi       cup final     between Liverpool                 and N ot ti n gh a m Forest.                   My

together at the H i l l s b o ro u gh ground.



On the S at ur d ay morning,            possibly a bout        twelve      thirty    (1230)   all

four    of us left                    house and       caught   the    local     bus to

M i dd l ew o o d Road,      from there we w al k ed the           rest of the way to the

ground,      a distance        of probably three            quarters      of a mile.

There were          no problems       on the way to theg round.                 There was an obvious

presence          of Liverpool     fans getting         ready to go to the match.                I did

not see any u nt oward behaviour                 or u n ne ce ss ar y drunkenness.            I noticed

ja/ few police officers w it h in the v ic in it y w hich was to be expected.

le   got to the Leppings Lane                 end of the ground at about              13.30hrs

(1330).           There were      not man y fans at the            turnstiles,       there a pp ea re d

to be more          on the a p p r oa c h    road,    our   initial    idea was      to arrive      early

so   that we w ould          not have to queue and access w ou ld be easy,                    coupled

wit h the fact that wa w ould                 not have any hassle           finding a place         on the

ter r a c e s „



We were      not hindered         in any way at                urjysti 1 es apart        from the

e xp ected body search by police                 off                 We were all      s ea rched as     I

recollect and tickets were                   checked,       Once     through the      turnstiles and

in the     concourse area we wa it ed a few minutes                       for         as he see me d to

have a more             t ho rough search than the          rest of us.         Wi th in   this area        I

noticed a couple             of stewards and          police   officers milling about            near

the exit gate and also a programme                      seller w hich we took adv an ta ge            of

this whilst wait i n g          for                  I had not been to the ground before

a nd therefore            did not ila          clue         to where      to go,    I d i d n ’t see any

signs     for the te r races Kffijt                   see some     steps    leading up to the

stands and also the              tuv\a«fl which       I a s su me d was    the only access       to the

terraces          but    in any event       the mai n   reason for going early was             to get

behind the          goal a rea with a bar            behind your      back and get as
                                                                                                         PAGE
                                                                                                         S3 4 9 7

comfortable as           possible.            So had there          been any directional

signs     I w ould still            have gone to the same                olace*/'



All     four of us made our way through the /Cuytne 1 , I did not see a police

officer       or stewards           present at this access j p c i njf.               When we got         to the

bottom^ o f . the       tunnel       we all    turned       left    into a. ( p e n w hich      I understand

is pe/t          l/would        hazard a guess and say I was 'k fe & u t               1 0 - 15ft from the

re a r//b f   the    oen and        riqht of centre.               The    pen was very sparse            of
     1/
fans.         There was         probably only about 30 or so fans                     present,      we

a ct u a l l y sat     down     all    in a line.          There were a couple            in front of us

basking       in the sunshine.



More     fans    started       to    come    in,    in a steady flo                   out twenty to

three     (1440)       it was       becoming       fairly fuli                                     iose       to

capacity.            Someone        had brought a beach ball and we were all                         playing

wit h    it, we were able             to jump ar ou nd at this stage.                     I recollect          it

bursting        just    before       the    crowd becarfie uncomfortable.                  We   kept being

pushed forward at different                    stages,      but     I d i d n ’t think     untoward as             it

was     normally e x p e ct ed as fans              came    into the       pens.



There was        four    lads       to my    right    pushing       their way across            in front of

us one of them kept                 telling    them to keep going as far over                     to the       left

as    possible.          He seemed to bs d istraught                     for w ha tever    reason,       he

seemed to be           pushing       quite    forcefully.            The    pen was    certainly at

capacity at this              time,    this was       prior    to the       players    coming onto            the

I remember          that as the        players       came    through the        tunns 1          ranee/the r e

was a loud          cheer,     I was       thrust    forward,       I wasn't all jmat wor r ied at

            crowd,         I realised     I couldn't and the                    pressure      from behind became

           'greater.         It was at       this   point         that    I became separated.                     The

            pressure was       somuc h    I remember          thinking             I ’d have to move as I

            w o u l d n ’t be able    to see     the       m atch       in any event.         /I        c o u l d n ’t see

            anything       on the    pitch at all.                The    p r es su re /a ro un d me was           increasing

            quite    swiftly.          I realised I'd be                in trouble        here and might faint.

            There was a man           in front      of me         in                   f f i cultJ^lT.           He s 1 owl y

            t urned around,         he was    struggling           t or W r /      he j ^ p e a r e d     to be slithering

            to the ground,          I kept asking           him if he was alright                   but he w a s n ’t

            replying.         I tried to reach out to him by pushing my arms above my

            head but       I got my arm       caught.             I just        c o u l d n ’t get to him his face

            went    redder and       redcier,    his m outh            remained opened.                 I screame d for

            some    help and    for someone         to open the gate but to no avail.                                   I saw

            his face,       he was    just    staring        into my face,            I think        1 made       up my mind

            that    he had died and          I looked a way f r o i y m m             when     I looked back he had

~bO         disappeared,       he seemed about                           r %,    he may have had a mous tache

            but    now    I sm not a ltogether         s      ,    I cannot        now say anything               for    certai'

            I was    being    pushed more and more                 to the front,           I just mi ss ed a front

m           barrier and       1 saw that they had op en ed the gats,                           people were starting

            to go forward through the gate,                       I was     being     pushed along             towards        it,

            there was       like a slight        tunnel       going       towards       it.         I could just             reach

            the    perimeter    fence and tried to                 pull myself         up on it but             c o u l d n ’t,

            there were about          five    people against              the fence,          but    I could only see

            the    backs    of their     heads.            About       six of us after          the       count of three

            tried    push backwards          to gain more              room but     it was useless.                 It was

            just a matter       of trying        to keep on my feet and                    concentrate            in getting

            to the gate       I knew     I w ould get there               eventually,          I stood on the edge

            of the       big step by the        gate,       I c o u l d n ’t breathe,          there were two

me but    I fell     back.         The    police    officer       on the     right    o fy 'th e    exit gate

pushed forward and grabbed my arm and h a u l e d t h r o u g h                                          the

gats a nd onto       the    track,       I walked to the          left cyf the gate,           I must        have

one of the first           few to come through as                it was j u s T a s    the game got

blown up to stop,                I tried    looking       for my friends          in the     pens,       I

still    h a d n ’t realised       the e no rmity of the situation at all,                         it just

d i d n ’t register,         I d o n ’t know how          long    1 was walking about              for

before    1 walked       over     towards      the other      side      just wa nd er in g about.

There was a lot of a ct iv i ty behind the goal mouths and a lot                                    people

walking woun de d whatever,               coming    out of the          pens.      1 then went and

stood    p ractically on the goal               line,     it was     here that                 found me,

We wa lk ed ar ou nd a wnile,             this was after          the supposed time that the

fans were      charging,         the Forest       fans,    I recollect seeing a young                    boy

about    17yrs    he was     lying       on the    pitch almost          central     to the goal mouth,

he was    having dif fi cu lt ie s         in breathing,          we event ua ll y got a St Johns

Amb ul an ce   person to attend to him,                  d o n ’t think he w ould have             died.



I ’ve no track       of time whatsoever,                the fans were       ripping      the hoardings

off    to utilise     them as       stretchers, / } W e          went    to help,     a policewoman

called us over        to the       corner                 m orth ffit'and and West S t a n d , there

was a male       p e r s o n , I cannot/cie^cr i/e h i j f i anyway,            I believe      he had a

back    injury of a^/iort,          we l y C   a Nbar^fing down,           he was     lifted onto            the

hoarding and ^ l o t         of us       carried him down the             pitch,     there were          too

many    carrying     him so       I let go, and followed.                  They took       him      into the

gymnasium,         I wa i t e d    for             to    come back out.          We went       back      to the

West Stand,       but there        seemed to be suffi ci en t             people a t te nd in g       to

everyone,      everything         seemed to have stopped.                  We then saw

leaning on a crush barrier almost where ws had started                                 off     in Pen 4,

We tried       looking     for            but even tu al ly gave up and              climbed over            into

found             at the    rear of the N orth Stand,          this was    just before      the

announcement        t cj leave      the ground.



That    day I was wearing a white               iee shirt




blue jeans and dark               trainers



I feel     that    things     that    could have been       rectified that day were         that

there    could have        been more     directional    signs,    as the tunnel a pp ea r ed

to be the      only entrance,          I believe    someone   either a steward or police

of fi cer^ should hcjye been on duty to the entrance and therefore able                            to

JT'oniy^     the §#ffount of fans entering.             T h e police   on the   pit ch near to

tha/ rferiij^er fence             seemed to be    inadequate,    they didn't appear         to

sffiow any    initiative,          it was as though they d i d n ’t know what        to do and

were waiting        to be told.          They were    very slow to react.           The    police

o r g a n i s a t i o n outside    the ground    could have    been more    professional.

There were        insufficient        exits thro ug h the     perimeter    fence.

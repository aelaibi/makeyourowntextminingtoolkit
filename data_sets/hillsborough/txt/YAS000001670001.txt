Alan Hopkins states:-



1.    I am employed as the Deputy Chief Metropolitan Ambulance
      Officer for SYMAS.


2.   My date of birth is 15th November 1936.


3.   I am trained in ambulance aid and, every five years, I
     attend a two week refresher course in ambulance aid.    I have
     attended management and supervisory courses.           I have
     attended major incident courses and been involved in major
     incident exercises.


4.   SYMAS covers the areas of the district health authorities of
     Shsffield, Rotherham, Barnsley and Doncaster.   Every year we
     hold a major exercise in one of those four areas.         This
     involves principally the emergency services         for that
     particular area but will also include the emergency services
     from the other areas.     If I am involved in an exercise.    I
     am not told that an exercise is taking place.


     ^ joined the Sheffield City Ambulance Service as an
     ambulance man in 1967.    In about 1973 I was transferred to
     Longley Station.        In early 1974   I was appointed the
     Superintendent at Corporation Street and Lodge Moor
     Stations.   In 1974 a reorganisation of the National Health
     Service took place and it was at this time that SYMAS was
            established.   Shortly after that I was appointed Assistant
            Divisional Officer (Operations) at SYMAS.    In 1987 I was
            appointed the Divisional Officer (Operations) for Number 1
           Division (which covers the Sheffield and Rotherham areas).
            I was subsequently transferred to the post of Divisional
           Officer (Control and Communications).        In 1988 I was
           appointed the Deputy Chief Metropolitan Ambulance Officer.


£    6*    MY normal official working hours are   0900 to 1700 Monday to
           Friday but outside those hours either Mr Page or myself are
           on call.   The on call rota runs from 0900 on Monday to 0900
           the following Monday morning.   During the week commencing
           10th April 1989 Mr Page had been on call, but I had agreed
           "that I would do Mr Page's on call duty on Saturday 15th
           April because he was attending a course. It is not at all
           unusual for he and I to reach such an arrangement.


    /7-r   Approximately two weeks prior to 15th April David Jones, the
           Assistant Chief Metropolitan Ambulance Officer (Operations)
           had sought my approval for two ambulances to be deployed
           specifically for the F.A. Cup Semi-final between Liverpool
           and Nottingham Forest.    This was in addition to the two
           liaison officers who would be at the game anyway.            I
           discussed this request with Mr Page and subsequently told Mr
           Jones of the approval.   One ambulance was to be stationed
           inside the ground and the other at Middlewood Ambulance
           Station which is approximately one mile to the north west of

the ground.    We had arranged for the same ambulance cover
for the ground for the Identical match the previous year and
there had been no problems.


When on call I carry a bleep and in addition there is a
telephone and radio in my car.    All messages to me come from
ambulance control at Moorgate Road, Rotherham.


When on call it is only necessary for me to be contactable
and to be reasonably near to ambulance control.


Although I was only on call I took my vehicle up to the Ml
motorway to Junction 33 because if there was to be an
incident at that time (lunchtime) it was likely to be on the
motorway.   Nothing happened there and so I went to control.


I arrived at control at 1410 .    I had a cup of tea and took
a couple of calls relating to routine admissions to
hospital.   At 1430   a call came in from the liaison officers
(Eason and Higgins) to say that they had arrived at the
ground.



At approximately 1506 I saw the police line light up.   There
is a direct line to control from the police headquarters at
Snig Hill in Sheffi«»ld^^Supe^nl^endent Clark took the call.
I heard him sayA"What is it.     We've got liaison officers
there" but he did not seem to get a satisfactory reply.    He
                                                                                  f




      put the phone down and told me that the police had said that
      they wanted a fleet of ambulances at the Leppings Lane end
      of the Hillsborough ground.           I commented that ambulances
      could not get into that end of the ground and I questioned
      why they would want them.       The police line then lit up again
      and this time Contrpl Assistant                    took the call.     I
      heard her say/V"What do you want ambulances there for, what's
      happening".     She did not seem to get a satisfactory reply. ,
      I contacted the ambulance which was on standby at Middlewood/rV*-)
      and instructed it to go to the Leppings Lane end of the
                                                 TkaxeAlv>*w/vvcifl(2-ci<'ISO?.Cj-I■.
      Hillsborough ground to report what was going o n / I Stnew^*^36^
      that the liaison officers inside the ground would have
      difficulty getting out to Leppings Lane and so would not be
      able to report on what was happening there.              I then told
      Superintendent Clark to contact the liaison officers to see
      if they had anything to report and I then immediately left.


3^.   As I left the control building Mr Morley was arriving in a
      marked Range Rover.      He was the duty officer that day and
      had been on the Ml carrying out a similar roll to that which
      I had carried out at Junction 33.        I told him that there was
      an incident going on at Hillsborough and we did not know
      what it was.    I drove the Range Rover to the Ground.


      As we drove to the ground we could hear the conversations
/•    from control to various vehicles, but not the responses from
      the vehicles.     That is quite normal operational staff can

                                      were clearly sending more and more ambulances                  to the
                                      Leppings Lane end of Hillsborough.           I knew the ambulances
                                      could not get access into the ground there              and I remember
                                      commenting to Mr Morley that if any ambulances did try to
                                      get in there they would be damaged.                    The reason why
                                      ambulances cannot gain access at the Leppings Lane end of
                                      the ground is that the entrances are not sufficiently high
                                      to permit access.          I knew there had been an incident some
                                      ten years earlier wiraae/san ambulance^had tried to gain
                                      access to the ground from the Leppings Lane end and the top

                                      the message by adding "particularly Sierra mobiles".              This
                                     was a reference to vehicles in the Sheffield area.                 This
                                     would put all ambulances on standby and would authorise
                                     control to bring ambulances in_from other areas to cover for

                                     the Range Rover in the position coloured yellow.                In the
                                     position coloured green was the ambulance which had been
                                     stationed at the ground but the ambulance men were not with
                                     it.        I do not recall seeing either of the ambulance men or

subsequently been told that one of the liaison officers
spoke to me then.               I told Mr Morley to stay with the vehicle
and not to move and I went onto the pitch to see what was
happening   iA,   Q ^ d < U -             c t e h u   (s. ~ h o   C * \ + r o ( .




There was a line of police across the ground roughly in line
with the edge of the penalty area in front of the goal at
the Leppings Lane end.                 The police were standing two or
three deep.           They were letting people through and there was
a lot of people on the pitch on my side of the police line
with injured people on hoarding.                       As I came onto the pitch
people started grabbing at me and shouting at me to help;
they were all spectators who were helping injured people.                                    I
ignored them.               I knew that the injured were coming from the
Leppings Lane end of the ground^ and that there were ten or
fcwaJrvo ambulances at that end of the ground and I thought
that they could not get access to the injured.                                       The most
important thing for me to do was not to provide immediate
help to the injured immediately around but to supervise the
whole of the ambulance operation.                      I went through the police
line and the scene looked like a battlefield.                                       There were
people lying on the pitch and I saw others behind the fence
with their faces pressed against it.                               I only stayed there
for a few seconds and ran back across the pitch towards the
area where I had left Mr Morley and the Range Rover.                                         I
believed that the ambulances at the Leppings Lane end could
 not get to the incident from where they were and I had to
 get them round to the Penistone Road end of the ground.
£"~When I ran through the line I saw a police officer carrying
 a little girl in his arms.                                                    He stumbled, I took the child
  from him and continued running towards the area where the
 Range Rover was parked.                                           I got to the ramp between the north
 stand and the cop and looked at the girl who was quite
 obviously dead.                             The policeman then caught up with me and I
 told him to take the girl's body to the gymnasium which I
 knew, from our standard plan for Hillsborough would be the
 mortuary/patient treatment area.


 I went over to Mr -Moisey lit the Range Rover and tfriTft him 1~n

 I also asked him to tell control to try to contact Mr Page
 at his home.                         The major incident vehicle is a communications
 centre and a mobile store.                                               It contains dressings, triangles
 for slings,                         tubes for intubation,                                stretchers,   helmets,
 protective clothing, body bags, and road cones amongst other
 things.


 I then went to the gymnasium.                                                     Outside the gymnasium were a
 group of St. John's ambulance people.                                                     They were aged about
 14 and were clearly extremely upset.                                                         I went into the
 gymnasium where the scene seemed to be one of chaos.                                                      There
 were police officers in there and already some bodies laid
       on advertising boards.        I had gone in there to see if any of
       our staff were there;         there weren't.       There was nothing I
       could do in there and so I went back to the area where the
       Range Rover was parked to find that our ambulances were
       starting to arrive.


       The yard was full of police vans which had also been there
       when I arrived and these hampered vehicles entering the
       yard.   In fact, the entrance marked on the plan as "main
       police access" could not be used because it was blocked.
       There were also police horses in the yard.           I   c   &   M   o   L   /   v   o   t   <x

l/>.   The first ambulance which I saw arrive was driven by C Z
               with Mr Flack as the attendant.            I told them to get
       their ambulance onto the pitch because I thought this would
       help to calm down the crowd who would see that the ambulance
       services were present and also, of course, be able to take
       some of the casualties away.


       Meanwhile Mr Morley was lining up ambulances which were
       arriving outside the ground.           The drivers stayed with the
       vehicles and the attendants came into the ground, onto the
       pitch to help bring injured people off the pitch into the
       yard area.


/fl.   I sent another ambulance onto the pitch driven by Mr
       Station Officer Higgins then reported to me, he is one of


                                          2 ~ U o
       the liaison officers.     I told him to find the crew of the
       ambulance which was parked in the yard which had been the
       ambulance originally assigned to the ground.      The cots were
       not in that vehicle and I presumed that its crew had gone
       onto the pitch, to the Leppings Lane end to help with the
       injured.     I told him to find the crew of the ambulance, to
       get it loaded up and off to hospital.      The ambulance itself
       was full of dead and injured people who had apparently been
       brought there by the crowd.     Someone was trying to get into
       the cab and seemed to be looking for the keys.       I told him
       to get out and he did so.      I began to unload the back and
       was assisted by Station Officers Eason and Higgins and the
       two crew who had then come back.       We put casualties in the
       ambulance and took the bodies to the gym.        The ambulance
       went off to hospital.     They would have known to go to the
       Northern General Hospital.    The emergency procedure is that
       all casualties are taken to the nearest hospital (in this
       case Northern General) until instructed otherwise.


2ftK   I recall that when we were trying to get              \   vehicle
       onto the pitch a St. John's ambulance appeared at the bottom
       of the ramp.      I had not seen the St. John's ambulance
       previously but I presumed that it must have been on the
       pitch when I was there.       The St. John's ambulance became
       wedged against the stanchions holding up the fencing on its
       right.     Our vehicle was backed off the ramp and then pulled
       forward to let the St. John's ambulance out.     The St. John's


                                       26 7
        ambulance forced its way off the stanchion and up the ramp.
        It left the ground.
                                                                           txl-fkiauJ   C                    tk&J-    i<ve^v^'

        the further ambulances were reversed into the yard so that
        they could be quickly loaded with casualties before going

        The last occasion which I had been at the ground was a year
        before when the same match had taken place.                                              I had attended
        then simply to speak to the liaison officer.                                                 Since then a
        wheelchair access ramp had been put on the ramp which went
        from the yard on to the pitch.                                 The wheelchair ramp was
        evidently to get wheelchairs into the north stand.                                                           The
        presence of this wheelchair access ramp had considerably
        restricted the width of the ramp down to the pitch which had
        caused difficulties both for our ambulances and the St.
        John's ambulance.


        I was then approached by Alan Hornsby (the Assistant Chief
        Fire Officer).         He told me that he had forty men and that he
        had deployed them to help bring casualties onto the pitch.
        He asked what else they could do and I believe I told him to
        continue what he was doing.                            By this time ambulances were
        arriving all the time.                    I only saw those ambulances which
        were actually coming into the yard and I did                                                not know how
        many there were outside the ground.


                                                             2 b $
I do not recall when the ambulances came off the pitch.


I was then approached by Leading Ambulance man              at
the top of the ramp from the pitch to the yard.       He is a
trained paramedic and was the first one that I had seen.     I
sent him to the gymnasium where I knew there were already a
number of injured as well as dead.     I told him to check all
the injured, do what he could do for them immediately and
decide upon the priorities for getting them to hospital.


I then went to the Range Rover and spoke to control to find
out where the major incident vehicle was.      I was told it
would be there in three minutes.     They also told me that Mr
Page was on his way to control.    The major incident vehicle
arrived shortly afterwards.   I understand that it had been
directed by police off Penistone Road onto the service road
round towards the Leppings Lane end of the ground.      I was
also told that the police had been in the road to prevent a
disturbance between rival fans who were, by then, leaving
the ground.


I instructed the driver of the major incident vehicle
(Station Officer          ) to position the vehicle in the
position marked in blue on the plan attached to this
statement.    I took some body bags from the major incident
vehicle and was on my way to the gymnasium when I met Mr
      Jones who had apparently come round from the Leppings Lane
      end of the ground.     I was very pleased to see him.                I told
      him to take control of that area and to be responsible for
      getting the ambulances in and out.


      I am not sure whether I took the body bags to the gymnasium
      or whether I gave them to someone else but at about that
      time I was approached by a Doctor.          He had been in the crowd
      and said he had three other doctors with him.                I do not know
      who he was but he was 45/50 years old and was wearing a
      short coat.   He said that they did not have any gear.                I saw
      a Leading Ambulance man nearby (I do not remember who) and
      told him to take the four doctors to the gymnasium and
      introduce them to leading ambulance man                             who had
      his paramedic equipment with him.                I told him to tell
      Boyington to take the doctors names.                   Mr Morley then
      approached me with four or five ambulance station officers
      (not from SYMAS) who had been in the crowd.            I asked them to
      help and bring casualties from the pitch.              Mr Morley gave
      them all yellow ambulance jackets and sent them onto the
      pitch.   I do not recall seeing them again.


A .   I then   went   back     to   th,e g y m n a s i u m   and    saw    Chief
      Superintendent Addis ^    I needed to speak to him to ensure
      proper liaison between the ambulance and police services.
      He told me that he had just spoken to the coroner (I think
      by telephone or radio).         He told me that the coroner had


                                         170
said that the bodies should be taken to various locations.
In fact, the coroner subsequently changed his mind about
this.     W h ilst   in the   gymnasium   talking   to   Chief
Superintendent Addis I noticed that there was a medical team
present and I was told that they were from the Northern
General Hospital.    I am not sure how many people were in the
team but I recall that a coloured doctor was in charge and I
also remember seeing two or three nurses holding saline
drips.   At this time we had just started moving the injured
out of the gym.


By this time the police vehicles which had been hampering
entrance and exit from the ground had been moved.    Mr Jones
and Mr Dale had ensured a clear passage for ambulances.     Mr
Jones came into the gymnasium and told me that he had ten
ambulances on Penistone Road and five outside the ground
with a further twenty five in Herries Road bus garage, which
was the pre arranged overflow site.    He told me that he was
aware of eleven bodies on the circular road at the Leppings
Lane end of the ground although I was not clear as to
whether he meant inside or outside the ground.      I sent Mr
Higgins with three ambulances to the Leppings Lane end of
the ground to collect the bodies which Mr Jones had told me
about.   By this time we had ambulances to spare.


The last ambulances took the injured away before 1630 hours.
        At about this time Chief Superintendent Addis told me that
        the coroner had now decided that he wanted all of the bodies
        taken into the gymnasium.   I arranged for a number of bodies
        to be brought back from the Northern General Hospital and
        one from the Royal Hallamshire;      I believe that these were
        all people who had died in hospital or en route, with the
        possible exception of the people who had been taken to
        hospital by the St. John's ambulance.



4   -   Some time later the coroner arrived and we discussed with
        Chief Superintendent Addis the question of what to do with
        the bodies.    The coroner decided that the bodies would be
        photographed by polaroid, that the bodies would be taken to
        one end of the gymnasium and the photographs put up at the
        other end so that relatives could look at the photographs
        and then be asked to identify bodies if they thought they
        recognised the photographs.         The coroner did not want
        anybody to be moved prior to identification.     The gymnasium
        was divided into three by nets to make courts and we put
        blankets over the net towards the east entrance of the
        gymnasium.    The bodies were kept at the west end and the
        photographs put up in the eastern section.     Mr Page arrived
        at about this time.


        I introduced Mr Page to Chief Superintendent Addis.    By this
        time a number of ambulances were parked in the car park
        around the gymnasium.   Earlier vehicles belonging to players


                                      272
       and various executives had been parked there.         There were
       ambulances from other districts as well as Sheffield and
       Rotherham.    I arranged for the ambulances belonging to other
       districts to be sent back.     Mr Jones dealt with this.         I
       also told Mr Jones that I wanted just six SYMAS vehicles in
       the back yard by the gym.


3^.    Bodies were removed to the Medico Legal Centre at Watery
       Lane as they were identified.      The Medico Legal Centre is
       approximately two miles south of the Hillsborough ground.


       The number of ambulances was later scaled down to two or
       three.


*#9.   At about 2000 hours I went back to control where a number of
       senior officers discussed the day's events.


       I then went back to the ground and by 0300 hours on Sunday
       morning the number of people coming to identify bodies had
       gone down to a trickle.     The last of the identified bodies
       left     the ground at 0448 hours      and   then   all   of   the
       unidentified bodies were also taken down to the Medico Legal
       Centre.


       I closed the incident at 0530 hours.

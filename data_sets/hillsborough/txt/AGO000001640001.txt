FILE NOTE:


SWooler spoke to Wynn Davis   (Daily Telegraph) on 24 March and


explained that the Attorney General had received correspondence


from Messrs Russell Jones and Walker.     They did not ask the


Attorney General to give his reasons for not proceeding against


the Daily Telegraph but sought "an outline of the explanation


from the Daily Telegraph".




SJW wondered whether one approach might be to give them a sight


of the letter from the Daily Telegraph.   Wynn Davis said he had


no difficulty in principle but would need to take instructions.


He would come back to SJW asap.

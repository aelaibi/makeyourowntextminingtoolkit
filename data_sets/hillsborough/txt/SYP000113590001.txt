carried         from       t he      pitch     towards          t he    Police          room      but       still

could      not     ascertain what                   was     happening.              We     were        then

instructed            to       return       to ' P e n i s t o n e     R o ad .     This        we     did.

On    s p e a k i n g to       other    officers             standing             by we    believed               there

had      been     a       pitch invasion and a                   large        fight        had       taken        place

and      s o m e o n e sai d         they     t h o u g h t f o ur      p e o p l e we re       d e a d . Shortly

after      this       a    civilian,           male,        a p p r o a c h e d me w i t h           a female

of a b o u t     25 y e a r s , who            stated        she       was    a doctor            and wanted

to a s s i st .           I thanked          them      both      and      immediately                took        the

doctor       towards            the P o l i c e      Room       and     on    passing           under         the

cantilever            of       the    North Stand            I saw        people          lying        on

advert isment              boards       on     the     ground,          they were              obviously

injured         and       I believe          some      were      dead.            Some     were        being

carried         into       the       gymnasium.             I entered             the     gymnasium with

the    do cto r a n d           spoke       to S e r g e a n t       Sewell        *B * G r o u p , Haramerton

R o a d , and      he      showed       the      doctor         to a n       injured male                 who     was

lying      on    the       floor        looking        very      pale.            I saw many              injured

pesons       lying         down       one    wall      of    the       gymnasium and                 on     the

other      side       of       the    gym,     I saw maybe               thirty         people         wh o

appeared         to       be    dead.        I was        unsure        whether           to    stay        and     try

and assist            with        the   injured           but    still        being        unable           to

ROGER PEARCE.    P.C. 995.   OPERATIONS DOG SECTION.

0800 Saturday, 15 th April, 1989 , I commenced duty in connection with the Semi final
football match at the Sheffield Wednesday ground between Notts. Forest and Liverpool.
0915   Attended briefing at Niagara Club by Supt. Marsh and Inspector Phenix.
0930 Commence patrol in company with P.S. 108 Mellors, Notts,. County, Middlewood
      Road from Hillsborough Park to Middlewood Hospital and surrounding area. Resposble
      to Inspector Phenix.
1030 Increasing difficulty in main road patrol due to heavy traffic. Particular
      attention given to public houses in the Wadsley area and side streets where hundreds
      of Liverpool fans were parking cars and wandering around in groups obviously
      looking for pubs. Many groups of Liverpool fans seen drinking from bottles of
      spirits and cans of beer outside several off licences in the area. Crowds gradually
      building up outside public houses namely Beehive, Dykes Hall Rd., Horse and Jockey,
      Wadsley Lane, Middlewood Tavern , Middlewood Rd. North, Sportsman, Worral Rd. and
      Wadsley Jack, Rural Lane. Many drunken fans seen urinating and throwing down glasses
      outside public houses. Due to large number s of fans we could do little to stop or
      deter these offences due to lack of manpower.
1230 Wadsley Lane near to Middlewood Road. Spoke to Supt. Marshall and informed him
      of the situation at Wadsley and he requested me to continue monitoring the
      situation closely. Continued patrol. Several fans seen openly urinating on
       Middlewood road near to Sheffield Wednesday Training Ground.
1^30   Horse and Jockey, Wadsley Lane, approx. 200 Liverpool fans outside the premises bot
       on the car park and on grass verges. The majority appeared drunk and were still
       drinking, several seen with a pint glass of beer in each hand. Glasses and beer can
       and bottles strewn over footpaths, grass verges and roofs of private cars in
       car park. Some causing inconvenience and perhaps likelihood of injury to foot
       passengers. Due to large number and excessive drinking both myself and Sergeant
       Mellors decided to take action. Ground control informed and assistance requested.
       Assistance of transit crews and two more dog handlers arrived quickly. Sergeant Mirfc
       Mellors asked Landlord to stop serving and together we attempted to persuade
       the fans to stop drinking and move on. They immediately began chanting, " You
       may have taken the miners but you'll never take the reds.” We realised that we
       were in a potentially explosive situation due to lack of manpower although no
       undue aggression was seen. The crowd gradually began to move off down Wadsley
       Lane towards the football ground still chanting and generally unruly, several
       were so drunk they were being supported by others. We travelled with them down Wanhs
       Wadsley lane and saw beer glasses and cans thrown into private gardens and
       members of the public being jostled. Unable to deal with any offences seen due to
       such large numbers .
1500   Middlewood Road still very busy with pedestrian and vehicular traffic. Radio messag
       from Supt. Marshall heard re situation at Leppings Lane outside the ground.
       Mr. Marshall sounded by the tone of his voice to be very concerned and was shouting
       to make himself heard over the noise of the fans. I believe some one mentioned over
       the radio if the kick off was to be delayed due to large number of fans outside
       the ground in Leppings Lane. Further messages from Supt. Marshall to the effect
       that the situation was very serious in Leppings lane and I believe he requested
       a gate to be opened several times and eventually said that a serious incident was
       taking place and if the gate was not opened someone would be killed. We began tr
       travelling towards the ground to see if we could assist in any way although I
       was not clear as to exactly what was taking place from the poor messages due
        to background noises from the fans.
1506    Radio message from Operations for all dog handlers to go immediately to gate 'O'
        at the ground. Whilst passing the top of Leppings lane on Middlewood Rd. I
        saw a large number of fans outside the ground filling leppings Lane almost to fete
        the river bridge. Attended outside Gate 'O' in Penistone Rd. and parked vehicle
        on central reservation so as not to cause obstruction although many Police
        vehicles were already parked on the carriageway. I saw several upset and hysterical
        people leaving the ground at this entrance but at this time we were unaware
        what was taking place. I believed that a large fight was the problem.
        We were instructed to enter the ground by Gate 'O' with our Police dogs and
        as we did so I saw people rushing about as if in panic and the area at the
        rear of the gate and turnstiles was very crowded with both Police Officers and
        civilians and I feared that someone was going to be accidentally bitten. We stood
 y ■                                                                              ^uc
 by on instructions from Sergeant Dent, Dog Section, near the ramp which leads onto
 the pitch but I had great difficulty in controling my dog under such crowded conditions.
  I saw several injured people being carried from the pitch towards the Police room but
still could not ascertain what was happening. We were then instructed to return to
  Penistone Road. This we did. On speaking to other officers standing by we believed
  there had been a pitch invasion and a large fight had taken place and someone said
  they thought four people were dead. Shortly after this A civilian male approached me
  with a female of about 25yrs. who stated she was a doctor and wanted to assist. I
  thanked them both and immediately took the doctor towards the Police Room and on passing
  under the cantilever of the North stand I saw people lying on advertisement boards on
  the ground , they were obviously injured and I believe some were dead. Some were being
  carried into the gymnasium . I entered the gymnasium with the doctor and spoke to
  Sergeant Sewell, 'B' Group , Hammerton Rd., and he showed the doctor to an injured
  male who was lying on £he floor looking very pale. I saw many injured persons lying
  down one wall of the gymnasium and on the other side of the gym' I saw maybe thirty
  people who appeared to be dead. I was unsure whether to stay and try and assist with
  the injured but still being unable to ascertain what had happened I decided it
  would be best to return to Penistone Road to my dog and Sergeant Mellors and await
  further instructions. Shortly after we were instructed to ener the ground with dogs
  and formed a cordon along the length of the spion Kop and half the length of the
  North and South stands, standing on the pitch. I saw a row of uniformed officers
  forming a cordon across the front of the West stand on the pitch and injured people
  being carried from that area towards the gymnasium. Several individual football fans
  were wandering about on the pitch obviously in great distress. Firemen and ambulance
  crews and Police officers were assisting in reviving unconscious people. One male fan
  ran and stood close behind me and started shouting obscenities at the Notts. Forest
  supporters on the Kop and I beckoned to two officers to remove him as the situation
  was very heated. Press camera crews were making the situation difficult running close to
  the dogs making them bark which did not help the situation. We were later instructed to
  return to Penistone Road, as the match had been officialy called off and Notts. Forest
  supporters were then leaving the ground. We were instructed to Patrol towards City
  but found that impossible due to Penistone Road vehicular traffic being at a standstill.
  Sergeant Mellors instructed dog handlers to patrol with dogs on foot, and with him I
  patrolled along Penistone Road towards city. On receipt of a radio message we entered
  Hillsborough Park and with mounted officers, split up a large fight involving both
  factions of supporters. Eventually we returned to our dog van and made our way into
  the city centre where possible trouble was expected. Supporters began fighting in
  Pond Street but had dispersed on our arrival at the scene. I there saw Sergeant 721
  Hill , South Yorks. Dog Section who instructed us to continue patrol of the City
  centre until it was quiet.
1830 Returned to Niagara for first meal break of the day.
1900 Resume single crew patrol of 'F' Division.
2200 Off duty.

  OBSERVATIONS.
  I have in the past I7yrs as a Police officer attended many big games at S.W.F.C.
  In my view policing has been well organised at this ground and I cannot remember
  any large fights or problems for a long time. On carefull reflection I have never
  seen so much drunkeness amongst football supporters at any match that I have policed.
  I have obviously been shocked and distressed at what I saw . Since the incident
  several people have approached me regarding the disaster and expressed their concern
  over drunken supporters but I have received no criticism of the Police.

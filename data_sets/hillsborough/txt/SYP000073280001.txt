checked          the       coach       to       make       sure.           I only          saw          one       or       two       people             with

cans       of    beer       but       they          were       walking       to    the             ground             in    Sheffield,                   but       I

wasn't          taking          that       much          notice       because          I was                hurrying             to       get       into          the

match.           Having          arrived             in    Sheffield          at       about                2.45pm          (1445)             we       hurried

weren't          escorted             from          our    bus,       we    just       made             our       own       way          there.              When

we    got       to    the       turnstiles                it    was    very       crowded                   and       there          was       no       orderly

queues          and    you       had       to       go    with       the    flow       when             you       arrived.                    Although             my

ticket          had    been          for    the          West    Stand       I swopped                      it    with          my       friend          and       I

were       well       enough          signposted.                    The    volume             of       the       crowd          forced             me

towards          the       West       Stand          turnstiles             but    I       think             that          was       because             the

outer       gates          in    front          of       the    terrace       turnstiles                         had       been          closed.              I    did

see    a    couple          of       mounted             police       officers             in       the          vicinity                but       there          was

little          they       could       do       in       the    way    of    crowd             control,                because                of    the       size

of    the       crowd.           I also             saw    a    s enior      Police                Officer             with          a    flat          cap       and

a    stick       on    the       roof       of       the       West    Stand       turnstiles.                             I d o n ’t          recall

seeing          any    stewards             outside             the    ground.                 I    did          have       an       initial             problem

of    getting          into          the    ground,             because       the          crowd             forced             me       to    use

the    turnstiles                I    didn't             want    to    but    even             though             I    got       through                the

turnstiles             into          the    ground             after       about       5       minutes                in    doing             so    I    handed

my    ticket          to    the       attendant.                 At    no    time          did          I    see       anyone             opening             any

gates       nor       did       I see       any          gates       open.    /t)nce               in       the       ground             I went          through

a    space       in    the       wall       dividing,                theyCerrace                   compound                from          the       West       Stand

compound             and    made       my       way       along       Jme    tunnel                to       the       terraces.                I    knew

where       I was          going       so       I    d i d n ’t ^ > a r t i c u l a r l y           look          for       any          signs          giving

off    time          and    I was          hurrying             to    my    match          viewing                position.                    I    had       no

difficulty             in       getting             down       the    tunnel       as          there             was       no    police             or

problem          getting                onto       the       terrace                    itself       and       I       took       up    a

position          in          the       rear       1/3       of       pen           3    near       to    a    barrier,                but    I was          getting               „

moved       about             in    a    general             sway          of           the    crowd          and       I was          aware       that       the

crush       was       increasing                   because             I was                 unable       to       move       my       arms.        One       was

fully       trapped                by    my    side          I stayed                    in    that       position                after       the    kick         off

and    was       there             until       a    couple             of           minutes          after             the    game          had    been

stopped.              I       found          myself          with          a        bit       of    space          behind          me       and    I made         my

way    back       out          through             the       tunnel.                     I    initially                got    onto          the    terrace           at

about       3    or       4    minutes             to    3pm          amj/at                 that    time          apart          from       the    excessive

c r u s h i ng    t h e re          were       no       othp r         unusual                 incidents                or    any       disturbances.

At    no    time          in       the       grouhQ          did       I       see           any    consumption                   of    alcohol.              Once

out    of       the       tunnel             I was       uninjured                       and       made       my       way    into          the    West       Stand

and    watched                what       was       going          on       in           the    terraces.                I    did       not    witness           the

death       of    any          person          nor       did          I assist                 anyone          who          was    injured.          I would

think       that          those          who       died       or       were              injured          was          the    result          of    the

excessive             crushing                in    the       terrace                    pens.           Subsequently                   I    left    the

ground          after          about          4pm       (1600).                     That       was       after          about          the    3rd

loudspeaker                   announcement                   the       one              that       thanked             the    fans          for    their        co­

operation             and          asking          people             to       leave           the       ground.

At    no    time          during             the    day       did          I witness                 anything                that       I would          consider                 ...j

to    be    a    criminal                offence.

I    don't       think             that       when       the          incident                 started             the       authorities             realised

what       was    happening                   and       when          some              of    the    fans          ran       up    the       pitch       to     get

the    hoarding                for       stretcher                the          Police              formed          a    line       across          the       pitch

thinking          there             was       going          to       be       trouble              between             the       rival       supporters.                 I

think       the       Police             view       initially                       of       the    incident                was    one       of    crowd

trouble          and          they       tried          to    deal             with           it    along          those          lines       and    the

result          was       that          they       could          have              given          more       assistance                to    the    fans         than

they       did    but          when          they       realised                    that       it    was       not          crowd       trouble          a    lot

             more    of    them       helped       out.

             I    think    it    is    important          to    say    that     Liverpool            FC    should       have       been

             allocated          more    tickets          and    allowed       the     use   of       the    Spion       Hop       and    it    was

             an    error    by    the       Football        Association          to    prevent            this    I also          feel       that

             in    not    doing       so,    the    F .A.      should     have      chosen       a    different          venue.          I    have

             been    told       that    last       year     the    crush      was     almost         as    bad,    and    even          the

             fans    had    to    be    pulled          from    the    terraces        into      the       West    Stand          to    prevent

             them    being       injured.           I    only     heard    that       second         hand    because          I    didn't

             attend       the    match       last       year.     We    were     discussing               this    the    week          before

             the    Hillsborough             Disaster          because     we    realised            that    the    F.A.          had    done

             the    same    thing       2   years        running.

   Dear Mr Kennedy

   Enclosed please find the copy of a letter dated 23 May 1990 from Messrs Davies
   Arnold and Cooper Solicitors, acting for Sheffield Wednesday Football Club,
   concerning removal of the remaining barriers and safety fence to the Leppings
   Lane terrace before the start of the 1990 football season.

    I have already replied acknowledging receipt of the letter indicating that
    before I respond I would wish to consult you concerning any objections you may
    wish to raise.  In this connection will you please let me have your views in
    writing before mid July 1990.

    From my point of view, I can see no valid reason for objecting to the
    proposals.

    Yours sincerely

    Dear Sir

    Hillsborough                          D is a s te r

    Further to my letter of the 17th May, I have been informed by
    the Club that it is their intention to remove the remaining
    barriers and safety fence to the Leppings Lane terrace
    immediately before the start of the forthcoming season.
    The Club have already agreed to the removal of a further
    barrier from the ground for testing in accordance with the
    agreement reached between the experts in the litigation at
    their meeting on the 5th April. It is anticipated by the end
    of July/beginning of August, that these experts will have
    completed their enquiries for the purposes of preparing a
    report, and therefore from that point of view, there is no
    need for the Leppings Lane terrace to remain in its present
    state as the parties to the litigation will not be prejudiced
    by such works being undertaken. I have informed the parties'
    Solicitors of the Club's intentions in this regard, and have
    said quite clearly that the whole matter should be reviewed
    once again at the end of July when we have a much clearer
    picture of any potential problems that may be caused by these
    intended works.
     However, I am of course extremely conscious of any continuing
     interest your investigation team may have in the terrace
     remaining in its present state, together with that of H.M.
     Coroner and the Crown Prosecution Service. I would ask y o u to
     confirm whether there is any objection to these works being
     carried out.    As stated above, the position needs to be
     reviewed at the end of July, but at this stage I would be
     grateful if you would indicate whether there is any continuing
     interest in the terrace.


                                                                                                                                  Contd..J *•

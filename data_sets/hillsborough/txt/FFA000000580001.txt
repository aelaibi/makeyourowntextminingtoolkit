Mr. E. England,
Secretary,
Sheffield Wednesday F.C.,
Hillsborough,
Sheffield,
S6 1SK.




     Thank you for the information about the attendances
at your matches.   The average receipts does make very
interesting reading.    Presumably during that period
you were also able to have less Police in the ground
with only seated spectators and had no crowd troubles.
Assuming th&se assumptions are correct, please do not
bother to reply.
     I very much appreciate you providing the information.

                      Yours sincerely,




                        E.A. Croker
                         Secretary

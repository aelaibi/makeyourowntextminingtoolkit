            I live at the above addres s with my parents and                             I am a s uppor ter          of

            L iver poo 1 Football         Club.       I am also a member              of the tye-       of E n gl an d

            Supporters          club w hich    is operated from Coventry.                   I often go to home

            and away matches,            att en di ng     on average about            15 matches    this      season.

            I usua l l y go with my father a lt ho ug h                  I have     been alone.

            As a member          of the Heart        of Engl an d Club            I was able to obtain a ticket

            for the Semi-Final             of the FA Cup between Liverpool                   and N o t ti n gh a m

            For e s t    on the       15th of April       1989. _ k    had asked the s ecretary of the
                                                               I
            Heart       of Engl an d Club,                        t ov t bt ai n tickets for us together

            wit h    travel following the quarter final                       game.
                       M-ISO       /
            We,     my f a t h e r/and I, did obtain tickets                 for the match and we were to

            meet     the    coach at the       library        in N un ea to n at      10.20am   1020.        My mother

            gave     us a lift to the meeting                point and we got on the              coach w hen        it
                                                                                                      PAGE          2
                                                                                                      S25Q5

a r r iv e d w hich was about             10.35am     1035.

We s el ected a position on the                     coach about       half way along         on the    right

walk in g      towards      the    front.       I recall      that    12 others also got on the

coach at Nuneaton.                 I don't      know any of the            people   on the    coach by

name     but    just to say hello             to,    not the same          people attend all matches

so    I h a v e n ’t, got    to know       people     specifically.

We then        proceeded towards S he f fi e ld making                 two other stops,         one at

Hirtckly and one at Leceister.                       My ticket was          handed to me on the         coach

by the       organiser]_________ [            It was for the L ep pings             In terrace and       cost,

£6.     The     entry    point was B.

I don't        recall any of the            people     getting       on at the two stopping

points.        We then set off             onto the m ot or w ay and had an uneventful

jour ne y towards Sheffield.                    We did make       one further        stop at a m ot or w ay

junction,        I don't know w hi ch one,                 to pick up a regular          supporter,      I

Know     mm     as                          His     proper    name    is            but he knows

also r t s     of facts and figures about                   football       and so the nickname.

The     coach went       past      the S h ef fi el d junction         so as to a pp ro a ch the

ground along with other Liverpool                          supporters.        I saw no evidence         of

excessive        drinking and            no S/ign of bad behaviour              by anyone     either    on

the     coach or off         it.     Tj-uf e^ach was         s t o p p e d on the outskirts      of the

C ity    by the Police ana                             search was made           presumably for drink

or weapons           of offence.         This     is a standard        check made      by the Police.

As nothing was           forward we         continued our journey having                 been directed

to a parking area.                 The      coach was e ve nt u al l y        parked about     quarter       of a

mile     from the ground on an                industrial       estate       road.

We    parked up at about, 1.45pm                  1345 and my father and              I wa lk ed to the

ground.         At    this time      I      saw several       Police Officers but            no sign of any

trouble.         We were      not    e sc orted to tine ground but directedf/ a l t h o u g h                 I

know the way having a tt en d ed the Semi-Final                            in 1988 QQj6{^B8 . / E n    route

to the ground Police Officers                       were    keeping    us to the      |a^sd area and          it

                                                                                                  S25Q3

was a comfortable walk wit h no crush,                           I d i d n ’t walk with anyone        else

from the       coach other      than my father.

At   the turnstiles          I saw that orderly queues                  had formed to enter the

ground.        I also      saw groups       of people       outside      the ground whereas          last

year    these    groups were mov ed by the Police and ushered either                             into the

ground and       if not away from it.                   This was      not the    case    this year

although       I dirci see some Police             present       on foot by the turnstiles and

also a         -iP3/e/yf Police Offic er s              on Horses.       I recognised one of these

as a Li ver pf6olVj2j»l i ceman.            H e ’s about 40 years          of age with a silver

" d r o p p e d 3 moustache.

We a r ri v e d at    the t u r ns t i l e ^ at about 2pm             14QQ )and joined the       queue.

There was       no question of          p u s h i rig TTT sih u v      , "it was a properl y formed

queue    to the entrance.

I did notice         outside    the ground that             compared to         last year,    a lot of

people were asking            for    ’s p a r e s . 9    I thought      that a lot had not got

tickets.

I got      into the ground with my father and                        purchased a programme        from

sellers       just   inside.        I was    not searched going            into the ground.

1 believe       I saw a couple          of stewards         between the turnstile and the

tunnel     entrance.         I nat ur al ly headed for the tunnel                  firstly as     I had

gone    into    it last year and s ec or id ly ie ca us e               I d o n ’t know of any other

e ntrance and d i d n ’t see an y s i gt^if /nqi cat i ng other areas                      to stand.        I

believe       that   I saw some Police             in    atten da nc e behind the turnst iles            but

as   I said     I w a s n ’t s ea rched whereas            the      previous year       I was s ea rched

on three       occasions.       I then,        with      my father, made my way            into the

tunnei f         walked thro u gh         it with        no trouble at all.

It had b e e n D u r       intention to find a space to stand and then                         perhaps      go

back    out    of the tujfnel to saviour the a tm o s p he re                   of people    coming    in

a n d to have a raad of the               programme.         At the end of the tunnel             we went

to the      right    hut    instead of the expected space                  it seemed as full at

this    time    (2.10pm)      1410 as      it had been at kick-off                time the year

before.        We made     our way about       six feet to the             right and about            four

deep from the wall            to the West Stand.             The entrance          to the standing

a rea was      blocked     but that       is not unusual       as    people always             gather    in

that area.         I stood     in the same         position    last year a lt ho u gh            it was       not

as    crushed.

At this early stage            I was able      to move and the             crowd was swaying,

making what        it seemed to be a good atmosphere.                       As time went          on it

seemed to get tighter and tighter.                     I had not seen any stewards                      or

po licemen      in the tunnel        or the    pen I was       in.        I did notice          the side

pens    seemed to be sparce and               people were                able    to sit on the           steps an

move with some freedom.

Whilst    in the      crush the most          I got   s eparated from my             father was about

3 yards,       a l th ou gh the    crowd were swaying and it was                 getting         more

c rushed as more and more              entered.

At about 2 . 5 0 p m     1450 my father took           his jumper          off,    w hich sounds a

simple    task     but he m a na ge d      it with some difficulty.                 He told me to

take mine off but           I was    not able to do so as my arms were                         pinned to my

side    by the     crowd.     The    heat at this time was                considerable and            I was

s weating      to such an extent           it was u npleasant and               I was w o rr ie d about

the    crush and      I was    thinking      I would be unable             to stand the          crush and

heat    for the game.          I was      thinking at this          time that       I must       keep my

head high to enable me to breathe and that                          1 must also keep my feet as

if I fell       I hit filld not be able to get up.

At k i c k-o fjf/y iipe I was       f rightened and of         course as the whis tl e went a

surge took        place and       I was    trapped,    having       no    control       at all    over my

m o v em e n t s and was    taken wit h the         crowd.     I also       recall a surge            prior

to kick off.         After    kick     off and                                     to    it,    the   crowd

mo ve m e n t w hich    is the    normal      thing after a surge,                   I was        now

frigh te n e d    for my safety and wanted to get out.                            It was obvious               that

something was          very wrong.      Nobody m ov ed for what                   seemed ages and               lots

of    people were shouting           to get back.         1' noticed a few people                       spilling

onto    the   pitch and the Police            seemed to be telling                   them to get back

in,    obv i o us ly not fully aware of the total                     crush.

I saw about 50 people             on the      pitch at this           time and        I saw one           in

particular,        a ginger hair man,          about 23         years of age wearing                     denim

jeans and shirt.            He was    then beconning            people        onto the       pitch from the

edge    of the     pitch.      He then moved forward onto the fence and

indicating        people to get back because of the                        crush at the front.                    This

seemed to anger           people ar ou nd me as they were                   obviously        irratated and

very hot with no way of moving                  in any dir ec ti on at all.

I was    a helpless        si tu at io n as   I c o u l d n ’t of help anyone                nor they           I as

you    c o u l d n ’t move anyth in g   except your           head        if you were        lucky.

The    game was still        going    on and suddenly a lot more                      people        seemed to

be ar ou n d the front         fencing.        I didn't see m any Police at this                           time.

I saw one P o li ce ma n go onto the             pitch and the game was stopped.                                A lot

of fans were        on the     pitch fay this time and everyone                       else was          trying        to

get out,

I was    in a panic and          I seemed to fae trapped for ages,                        not knowing what

to do or where         to go.      I must     have been        in that         situation for about                    13

m i nu te s and    I was asking my dad what              to     do.        I was thinking whether                     to

go to the        front,    the tunnel      or over the          ferfces.          A l th ou g h    people

s pil l e d onto the       pitch and     people were          b e i]n \    lif.ty d r upta        the s t a n d

above,     the    crush d i d n ’t get any easier.               1' presume          now that this must

have meant        others were      still      coming    into     the       pen,    filling         the space

created.

My dad decided to try and get upto                     the stand.            The     pressure           eased

s li g h t l y and my dad       cupped his hands         to make a stirrup and someone

else    pushed me upwards.              I outs tr et ch ed my arms and I was hauled               into

the seating area,              As          pulled up I hit my knee on a chair,

hurting myself.              I was   told to move back and           I said    "What about my

dad,    my d a d ’s down there."           I was    told    " W e ’ll get him" by someone.              I

d o n ’t recall       any of the       people,    s i moved   back a couple of          rows and as

I turned       back    I saw my fatfofer / j s    1 eg and head appearing as he was

lifted up also          into the Cs^a

We moved back about             five    rows and stood and watc he d below.               I was

still    in shock.

I could see       people       spilling    onto    the   pitch but     .it was   not the front

rows of       people     but the ones behind them             climbing over them.           The

f ront four      or five       rows of    people were       slumped    like a collapsed          rugby

scrum as other          s tr uggled for safety.            I never    noticed a gate at all,                I

just    saw    people    spilling       out.

I could see Police             fans and other Off ic ia ls       helping       or doing    their

best    to assist       everyone.        I saw a lot of       people    giving others       the kiss

of    life and fans          carrying    people off a dv er t is e me n t     boards.     I was

looking at the scene as a whole and not at anything                            specific    except

one    incident.

I saw a person on the ground with                   policemen    trying       to revive    him.

Someone       else was by him,          I took them to be a friend or relative,                   they

seemed very distressed.

The Police m oved away and the                  person on the ground          looked    lifeless,           I

then saw a photographer move                   in towards this       scene and he was taking

photographs.           The    photographer was about 5 ’S tall,               average   build,     he

had brown hair and a bushy beard,                   he was about 40 to 30 years             of age

and was wearing a beige ski                type jacket.        This a ct i on upset       several

ar ou nd that scene an d about 2 or 3 tried to move                      him but he       persisted

and then others jo in ed these and a tt ac ke d the                   photographer.        The

P olice      stepped     in just after and he was              ushered away to the far              side

of the       pitch.

1 saw during          this    time nothing         of the a pp arent     drunkeness,       looting*

urinating       and violence as            reported    in some      of the gutter        press.       The

fans were all well              behaved that        I saw.    The     photographer       incident         took

place     to the      right of the goal.             I was    looking at by the          IS yard box.

F rom that      time     everyone was joining           in to p / i     and    j. was    in a dase and

was    looking at the ground               in shock,             1/

W hen an a n n ou n c em en t was made to           leave the ground with my               father I

left the       ground.        That was      at about 4 . 4 0 p m 1640.     We then         wa l k e d back

to the       coach and sat          in shock and disbelief as to what                had gone       on.      I

left    shortly after          to    phone my mum,      but    I c o u l d n ’t get through'.         I

went    back to the          coach and my dad said two were missing                     off, the    coach

but    the    police hadr been and said carry on, we will                      provi jjya , a n y t n j

I subsequently           returned home having           stopped at a service             station to

phone my mum,          which      I did.

I w ould      like to add that            I thought    the Po 1 i ceyfAmitfu lance Service and

all    supporters        did a tremendous           job under V i e     mrrayfances.            The

p r e - o r g a n i s a t i o n didn't   seem to be good and theL^communi cation d i d n ’t

seem to be very good as the Police were acting as                             individuals       helping

people       rather    than as an org a n i s e d body.

Liverpool       Fc    have a far         greater    following    than N ot ti n gh a m Forest         but

still     had a smaller           viewing area.        I a p p re c ia t e g eo graphy dic ta te d

could be used,           namely either        collapsable       fences or opening          fences.

Also    at the Leppings Ln end               individual       pen separ at io n was up,

                the mini         bus     but not all.

                I was      picked up from my house at                            1 0.00am on the morn i n g                 of the match

                not stop on the way,                    and    parked          in a side           street      in S h e f f i e l d about

S h e f f i e l d and took a slow walk                 to the ground.              I saw no trouble             or

problems       on the way to the               ground.       A l t h o u g h we all        started       to walk

t ogether      we soon got            split    up and when             I reached         the ground       I was          on

my own.       We did not         keep together            because we were all                   going    to

different       parts     of the           ground.

1 entered the ground and                     there was       no    problems,            I was    in my seat at

the    five minutes            past    two,    my seat was at             the front and               I could see

that    the area to my            right       the Leppings Lane               end was       very full          and

people were       climbing            over    the    fences       to   reach the          side    pens w h i c h

w e re quite     e rnp t y .

When    the    players         carne out at         ten to three          I saw that            the    pens    behind
                                                               Ij /7 a t f    *
the goal at the Lepp i n g L ane                    end were? (rvrf: 1 e r     than ever and a few

people were        climbing           over    the    perimeter         fence       into    the    pitch.       I did

not    see any    crowd surges at about                    twenty       to three          I saw a large             beach

ball    being    knocked a r o u n d          in the L e p pings Lane               terrace and          usually

when    this    takes     place        the    crowd sway but            it a pp e a r e d on this             occasion

that    they were       so tigh t l y         packed      they     could not move.

The    next thing       I saw was a P o l i c e m a n             running      onto       the    pitch towards

the    referee and the game was                     stopped.       There      was a lot of            c o nfusion

and    I didn't     know what           had happened,             but a s u p porter            came and       shou t e d

to    person behind me            that       people were dead.               On hearing          this    1 got       onto

the    pitch to     look       for G a r y and my other                friends.

The    first    person         I saw on the          pitch     receiving a t t e n t i o n was Gary,                     he

was    being given oxygen and                  chest massage,             I do not         know who       they

were.    1 got, down and held his                    hand,     an a m b u l a n c e      came across          the

pitch and       I helped         place Gary          in the ^amb'u^fafnce.                 I placed him             in

the a m bulance                             . I was     not a l l o w e d     in the a m b u l a n c e a lt h o u g h

I. told them      it was my            cousin,       I got a       lift      off   two     d i s abled    persons

             the    hospital     and told them what              had h a p p e n e d .

             I then made my way           back     to the mini         bus where          I met all       the    other

             persons,       from there we went            back    to the     hospital          and w a i t e d   for more

             information.        1 was    taken a r o u n d the        hospital          by a social       worker      to

             try and find Gar-y.

             We all     stayed at the H o s pital           until G a r y ’s mum and dad a r r i v e d and

             then    came     home.   I was a s k e d to     identify the body but                   refused as        I wa-

                               and this    was     done    by Garys       father whe n he arrived.

             Since    this     time   I have     spoken     to the       people who went             to the m a t c h

             in the mini        bus and    no one     stood with Gar y and                 no one     can give any

             further        information.

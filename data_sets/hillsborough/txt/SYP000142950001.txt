       IT WAS PAINFULLY OBVIOUS WHEN I ARRIVED THAT THERE WERE FAR MORE

<337»    DO YOU HAVE ANY VIEWS ON THE WAY THIS DISASTER WAS CONTROLLED

         FOLLOWING THE RECOGNITION OF THE INCIDENT HAPPENING?



         MY VIEW 13 THAT AFTER ABOUT 25 MINUTES EVERYONE REALISED THAT A

         DISORDER HAD OCCURRED BUT I SAW NO EXECUTION OF ACTION BY THE

         EMERGENCY SERVICES AS A WHOLE,,       THE ONLY ACTION SEEMED TO BE

<338 . IS THERE ANYTHING THAT YOU WISH TO ADD WHICH YOU FEEL IS VITAL

        TO THIS JUDICIAL INQUIRY?



        IN HINDSIGHT AND BASED ON WHAT 3. HAVE BEEN INFORMED OF AND NOT

        WHAT I SAW THE PERSON RESPONSIBLE FOR OPENING THE GATE AT

        LEPPINGS LN HAS TO BE ACCOUNTABLE FOR 0-1AT HAPPENED.        I BELIEVE
                                               -------------
        THAT IT WAS PROBABLY BETTER TO HAVE ITiE PROBLEM OUTSIDE THE

        GROUND WITH A SMALLER NUMBER RATHER -THAN PUSHING THEM INTO THE
                                               ■

        GROUND AND AN ALREADY OVERCROWDED AREA. /HAVING SAID THIS THE

        SUPPORTERS WHO ARRIVED WI THOU'j/ TIC K ET5 /C AtjgEP THE PROBLEM BY

        ATTEMPTING TO GET IN W I T H O UT TICKETS.

        ONCE   IT HAD BEEN REALISED /A DISORDER HAD OCCURRED IT SEEMS AS

      Dear Dr Popper

     Hillsborough Disaster
     One of the victims on whom I carried out a post m orte m examination
     was Chr istopher Barry Devonside. At the time of the examination I
     was informed by the police that the spelling of his surname was
     DEVENSIDE and this is the way the name has been spelt on my report
     to you, dated 18th April 1989.

     I have been asked by the father of the deceased via the West Midlands
     Police to correct the spelling on the post m orte m report. Presumably
     the spelling has already been corrected on the death certificate.
    Would y o u kindly make the necessary alteration on the report in
    yo u r possession?

     With many thanks
     Yours sincerely
Formby 78097

         Dear Sirs,                           ^

         Re: RESUMED INQUESTS 19th NOVEMBER 1990.


         If you are not already aware, I intend to resume the Inquests into the deaths
         of the 95 people who died at Hillsborough, one or more of wh om you represent,
         on the 19th of November 1990 at 10.a.m.  Details of venue will be notified in
         due course.

         I do not have to remind you of the fact that a considerable amount of
         evidence has already been taken, nor of the nature and limitations of a
         coronal investigation which you will recollect is not adversarial but
         inquisitorial in nature, and which of course has only limited objectives.

         Subject to the Co ro ne rs ’ Act 1988,and the Co roners’ Rules, the Inquest is
         under my control, and in particular, it is my responsibility to select the
         witnesses who wish to give evidence.      I am at present engaged in considering
         this and in determining who I wish to invite to attend.

         Without prejudice in any way to my rights in the matter, I am writing to you
         to give you an opportunity to draw to my attention the names and other
         appropriate details of any witness or witnesses wh om you would like me to
         consider calling to give evidence at the resumed Inquests.

         May I please ask you in considering whether you wish to draw any names to my
         attention, to bear in mind the scope and limitations of an Inquest.

         I also want to make it absolutely clear that the submission of a name or
         names for consideration is nothing more than that, and that the decision as
         to who to call to give evidence is and remains a matter for me.

         I would be grateful if you could respond as soon as possible. If I have not
         heard from you by the end of Ssfrfember I will assume you have no names to
          submit.

         Yours faithfully

Dear         Sirs,
   , OMTffPPHWt MWDBBUM ito a tu td ) . to .1 7 .

As you. are aware, the Inquest(s) arising out of the Hillsborough
Disaster stand adjourned to a date to be fixed. You may also
be aware that it had been in my mind to resume these Inquests
on the 15th of January 1990.

I have now been informed that the Director of Public Prosecutions
has decided to have a criminal investigation undertaken on his
behalf. In these circumstances, I have decided not- to resume the
Inquest(s) on the date mentioned.

I will review the matter further after the Director of Public
Prosecutions has announced his decision as to what action (if any)
he may wish to undertake.

I am not in a position to say how long the Police Inquiry
or the Director of Public Prosecutions consideration of the
matter will take. I anticipate however that there will be
a substantial period of time before I am in a position to communicate
on this matter further.

I would be grateful if you could please ensure that this information
is conveyed to members of the bereaved family so that they may be
fully informed of the position regarding the Inquest(s).

Yours faithfully,



S.L.Popper,
H.M.Coroner.

        Dear Sirs,

        You will be aware that I do not normally release post mortem
        reports until the resumption of the Inquest, when they are
        in fact put in as evidence.

        However, in view of the numerous requests which I have received,
        and the obvious distress which delay is causing to your clients,
        I have decided that subject to certain conditions set out below,
        I am prepared to release to you upon request, the post mortem
        report of your client^).

        The release of these post mortem reports are cn the basis that:-

               a.       They have to be treated as provisional, and therefore
                        subject to amendment or alteration until such time as
                        they are given or produced in evidence at the Inauest.

              b.       They are to be used only for the purpose of bereavement
                       consalling of the deceased’s relatives or for proper
                       legitimate purposes in conneocfcion with any legal proceedings
                       in which solicitors may be engaged.

              c.       Subject to the.-;ab§?§, they are to be kept confidential until
                       they come into the public domain at the resumed Incjuests.

        I have your request for the post mortem report to hand in respect
        of each of the persons listed on the attached sheet, and on the
        assumption that you will confirm that the report in respect of
        each of your respective clients is accepted on the terms set out
        above, and in order to save further delay and upset to your client,
        I enclose a copy of the relevant post mortem report. If for any
        reason you cannot agree to the contents of this letter, ■please return
        the post mortem report to me, without of course making any use of it.

        The cost for the copy post mortem report(s) is        per sheet (total £                                %, 2^ )
        Please make your cheques payable to the City of Sheffield.

        Yours faithfully,

          myself but I have no objection whatsoever in you contacting him with a view
          to him supplying you with a copy if he is willing to do so.

          To assist you, his address is as follows

         Dear Dr. Nicholson,

         I hope that you are keeping well.  I enclose a copy of a letter dated the
         24th of February 1991 which is self-explanatory.

         When I received it I asked Mr . Devonside if he would allow me to defer
         action, but I have now been reminded that he would like me to deal with the
         matter.

         I have no objection to you letting him have a copy of your report and I am
         enclosing a copy of a letter which I have written to him which states this.

         In fact, I have a nasty feeling that I do not have a complete H.S.E.   report
         though I must admit I have not yet unpacked all the paperwork.

         If I find that I do not have a copy, do you by chance have a spare which you
         would be able to let me have if needs be.

         Yours sincerely,

            Our ref:           SLP/LRR

            Mr B W Devonside




            Dear Mr Devonside
            I refer to your letter of 25 February 1991 regarding releasing details
            in relation to your son and I have also just seen Mr Jones' response
            to you of 26 February 1991.
            I understand that the point that concerns you is the possible release
            of the post-mortem report to an independent pathologist instructed by
            the Hillsborough Families Group.
            In order to avoid any possible misunderstanding, the position regarding
            the release of documents and information which form part of the inquest
            proceedings is covered by Coroner's Rules and in particular, Rule 57
            Sub 7 clause 1, which reads as follows:
            (1)      A coroner shall, on application and on payment of prescribed fee
                     (if any) supply to any person who, in the opinion of the coroner,
                     is a properly interested person a copy of any report of a post­
                     mortem examination (including one made under section 21 of the
                     Act of 1926) or special examination, or of any notes of evidence,
                     or of any document put in evidence at an inquest.
            You will see that the rule provides specifically for the release of
            post 7 mortem examinations to a properly interested party.
#
            There is, of course, no doubt that, as Mr Jones pointed out, you and
            your wife would be properly interested parties in respect of your son's
            post-mortem report. However, any other person or persons who, in my
            opinion would be properly interested person would also be entitled to
            copies. You will note therefore that the rule is rather wider than
            Mr Jones' letter might indicate.



                                                                          cont




    R8606
27 February 1991


Mr B W Devonside

- 2 -


Whether or not a pathologist instructed by the Families   Group
would fall within the term of properly interested party   is
something I would have to think about very carefully in   the event
of a request being made. I have, of course, noted your    concern.
For the sake of completeness, I should perhaps also mention that
coronal documents do come into the public domain but not in fact
for very many years. It is also normal practice for coronal
documents to be used by bona-fide researchers but, where I allow
this to happen, I normally require that any information extracted
would be anonymised.
Yours sincerely

MR RftKBY DEVONSIDE - PATHOLOGY REPORT


I was approached by Barry DSVONSIDS just before Court on Monday, 25th February.

Mr DEVONSIDE raised his concern about the fact that the Hillsborough Families
Group, of which he was no longer a member, were intending to employ an
independent pathologist to look at the pathology reports on the 95 deceased.

He said this would obviously involve the report on his son, Christopher, and he
wondered whether this was correct and whether it could happen.

He made it quite clear that he d i d n ’t want any personal details as contained in
the pathology report being handed over to an independent pathologist employed by
the Families Group.

I have since written to Mr DEVONSIDE informing him of the position.       A copy of
the letter I sent is enclosed for your information and retention.

CONFIDENTIAL



Mr Barry DEVONSIDE,
C/0 Hillsborough Inquests,
Town Hall,
Sheffield,
South Yorkshire.




Further to our discussion at the Town Hall on Monday, 25th February, I wish to
confirm the position as follows as far as the pathology reports are concerned.

It is true that the pathology reports on all the deceased enter the public domain
by being raised by the Coroner in open Court.  However, the  Coroner advises me
that the release of such pathology reports would only be to interested parties.
In that connection, an interested party is your goodself or your wife but would
not be an independent pathologist employed by the Families Group.   The Coroner
has assured me that if an approach is made by an independent pathologist employed
by the Group he would not release the pathology report but would refer the
pathologist to you.

Whether that pathology report is available from any other source very much rests
in your own hands, so you must ensure that you, or people you may have passed the
report to, keep it secure if you wish to continue your policy of non-release to
the independent pathologist.

I trust this is of help to you.

If I can assist in any other way,   please do not hesitate to contact me.

FILE NOTE MB. DEVONSIDE.


Mr. Devonside phoned.    He asked whether it would be possible
for him to receive a complete set of the transcripts.
My first comment was that this was quite expensive and
I then considered the aspect further and realised that
it might create problems because it was arguable that
he might perhaps not be an interested party as far as other
people were concerned.    I said that I would consider the point
that he had raised.     I said that I anticipated of course that
the solicitors would be requesting transcripts.
He asked whether I would only send one transcript out.    I said
not really, I would be quite willing to send as many as people
required.    He wanted to know whether we had fixed the venue for
the first day.    I said not yet . He said that they had a meeting
last week*    It was the biggest meeting since the Disaster and
about 136 people    and a lot had indicated that they would want to
come on Day 1.    I told him that we are looking at presmises
which would be large enough, but I wasn't going to say anything
further because we hadn't yet decided.

1 March 1990



Dear Mr Popper

I am writing on behalf of myself and my wife, as parents of an
18 year old boy Christopher, who died on 15 April 1989 at
Hillsborough.

We want to complain in the strongest possible terms about
comments made by the Chief Constable of South Yorkshire,
Mr Peter Wright, both stated orally and published in "The Star"
on 5 February 1990. I want the following points Recorded:

1. An astonishing reluctance by Mr Wright to accept the
findings of Lord Justice Taylor. It is fundamental in any
civilised society that justice is respected and that all
persons accept and operate within the judicial framework. The
alternative is an anarchistic society, dominated by persons
accepting the Lewis Carroll principle of "Words meaning what I
want them to mean" regardless of the supporting facts.

2. The distressing innuendo insinuation and veiled hints that
alcohol played some part in the tragedy. The post mortem
reports do show that some of the deceased had been drinking;
so what? It is not in a free society, an offence to consume
alcohol, and if police officers were vigilant and suspected
alcohol-related offences outside the ground then no doubt great
play would have been made of those arrest figures. In our view
Mr Wright is trying to fabricate a smoke-screen after the event
to protect his officers, and maybe even his own reputation.

3. An apparent attempt to influence either public opinion or
the minds of potential jurors by making sweeping statements in
and out of the press. I don ’t know how the sub judice rule
applies, but the lawyers in Liverpool have advised us strongly
not to allow ourselves to be exerting any persuasive influence.
Surely the same applies to Mr Wright?
I hope you do not mind me writing to you, as above. I am very
concerned that we all abide by the rules, and that there is no
misuse of privileged information, or of positions of power and
authority, such as to devalue our trust and faith in the
judicial system.

I look forward to hearing from you.

Yours sincerely

           Dear Dr Popper
           Hillsborough Disaster
          One of the victims on whom I carried out a post mortem examination
          was Christopher Barry Devonside. At the time of the examination I
          was informed by the police that the spelling of his surname was
          DEVENSIDE and this is the way the name has been spelt on my report
          to you, dated 18th April 1989.
           I have been asked by the father of the deceased via the West Midlands
           Police to correct the spelling on the post mortem report. Presumably
           the spelling has already been corrected on the death certificate.
          Would you kindly make the necessary alteration on the report in
          your possession?
           With many thanks

                Dear Dr Popper
                Hillsborough Disaster

                Following our telephone conversation this morning I received a
                phone call from Mr Devonside, the father of Christopher Devonside.
'lejSgP*/       I indicated to him that you would be dealing with the release of
                the post mortem report. He requested that it be sent to Dr Gibson,
(>              Formby Health Centre, Formby, Merseyside.
                The other enquiry concerned Adam Spearritt. Mr Spearritt's General
                Practitioner is Dr David Colin-Thomas, Castlefield Health Centre,
                Castlefield, Runcorn, Cheshire.   I had spoken to Mr Spearritt before
                we had our conversation and I suggested that he contact Dr Colin-Thomas
                early next week. Perhaps if you do not intend releasing the
                report by then, could you kindly write to Mr Spearritt to explain
                the position. His address is
                Yours sincerely

 Mr. B.W. Devonalde,




 Dear Mr. Devonside,

With reference to your telephone conversation with ay office
on the 25th of May, I understand that you apparfwfcly have
not received copy of the interim Certificate of Death.

We cannot really understand how this could have happened
but in any event I enclose a duplicate copy for you.

I understand that you requested a copy of the poet mortem
report. I am not, at the present time, prepared to release
these generally and indeed from past experience, would be
reluctant to send a poet mortem report directly to a member
of the family as it can be very distressing for them.

If you specifically want a copy of the post mortem report,
I ’would be grateful if you could write and request it.
Arrangements will then be made to mark your file accordingly.

Yours sincerely,



S.L.Popper,
                                                                           D   ept     , or    Pa t h o l o     g

I am writing in reply to your letters of 6 February to the Home
Secretary and to the Minister for Sport in which you sought
meetings to discuss the implementation of the Final Report into
the Hillsborough Disaster.
The Minister of State, Lord Ferrers, whose particular
responsibilities encompass safety at sports grounds, police and
fire matters, would be happy to meet representatives of the FSA
and the Federation of Football Supporters Clubs. Perhaps you will
contact me on 01 273 2468 so that we can try to arrange a
convenient time and date.
Your letter provides a general area of discussion but I am sure
that there are specific points that you will wish to raise with
the Minister. It will be helpful if you would be kind enough to
provide a list of those items in advance of the meeting. I would
also appreciate a list of those attending and it will be helpful
if you could indicate their positions in the respective
organisations.

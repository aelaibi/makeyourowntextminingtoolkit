DRAFT REPLY FOR THE MINISTER TO SEND TO KEITH RAFFAN feSQ MP



Chris Patten has asked me to thank you for sending him a copy of

Mrs   Joan   McBrien's   letter   about   the   death   of   her   son   at

Hillsborough.    I have now replied to Mrs McBrien and you might

like to have the enclosed copy.

DRAFT REPLY FOR THE MINISTER TO SEND TO MRS J MCBRIEN,

                                  HOLYWELL, CLWYD.



As you know Mr Keith Raffan MP has sent the Secretary of State

for the Environment a copy of your letter to him of 13 November

about the death of your son John at Hillsborough last April.                               The

Secretary of State has asked me to reply.



I    should     first of    all    like    to pass          on to you    my   own    and   the

Secretary of State's sincerest condolences on the tragic loss of

your son.        I know no one can truly put themselves in the place of

another who has suffered such a bereavement but I can appreciate
                                                   c
the terrible sense of loss and griesgft that you are feeling.



I have noted very carefully all the points made in your letter

particularly what you say about the proposed national membership

scheme for football supporters.                The other points you have made

have,       I   understand,       all   been   covered in aletter             from         Lord

    Ferrers at the Home Office to Mr Raffan.                     I can assure you that

    the Government recognises that the vast majority of those who go

    to   football     matches   are decent,        law abiding          people   who   simply

    want to watch a match in comfort and safety and return home in

    the same way.       Unfortunately there remains a minority who go to

    football    who    appear     intent    only       on    spoiling    the enjoyment      of

    others.     It is to deal with these people that we have decided to

    introduce the national membership scheme and I hope that all true

    supporters of the game will accept that this is a genuine attempt
on the part of the Government to tackle the problem. Existing
          *t, i       i     {-v**
                                 .
measures have only contained and not solved the problem of

football       hooliganism        either     inside     or     outside      grounds.        By

providing the means to keep the troublemaker away from football

the    national          membership    scheme    offers        the   real     prospect      of

breaking the link between football and hooliganism.



I can, of course, understand your fear that the scheme will cause

delays        at    turnstiles.             However,     the     Football          Membership

Authority,         who will be responsible             for devising the scheme and

then submitting it to the Secretary of State for approval will

need     to    satisfy       itself    that     the    turnstile      process        time   is

minimised.         A Working Party I chaired which considered the broad

principles          of     the    scheme      accepted        that    there        would    be

unacceptable         delays      if   the    turnstile       operators      were    asked   to

check the photograph as well as undertaking electronic checking.

I hope you will             be re-assured to know that the Government has

always made it clear that the scheme will not be introduced until

it is satisfied that it will be effective, workable and will not

endanger the safety of spectators.



I am sending a copy of this letter to Mr Raffan.

              QPE/89 52/3/171(S)




              Thank you for your letter of 23 November with this one from
              Mrs Joan McBrien of                                    Holywell,
              Clwyd, whose son, John, died so tragically at Hillsborough. You
              also wrote to Colin Moynihan and, as you know, that letter has
              been passed to the Home Office.

              I was deeply moved by Mrs McBrien's letter.   She suffered an
              appalling tragedy and I can well appreciate how difficult and
              long a task it is for her to come to terms with such a
              devastating loss.

              Time will never erase events, but it does usually lessen the
              poignancy of them, and I hope that in time Mrs McBrien will be
              able to face the future without the constant sorrow of the past
              being overwhelming. I do hope you will extend to her and to her
              husband my deepest sympathy.

              I understand that Mrs McBrien recently met officers from the West
              Midlands Police team who have been asked to make enquiries into
              the policing of Hillsborough. I gather they were able to answer
              the outstanding issues surrounding John's death and that
              Mrs McBrien has now made a formal complaint against the South
              Yorkshire Police.

              We all seek the answers which will prevent a reoccurrence of this
              or any other sort of accident at a major sports ground in this
              country.   The particular causes which led up to the terrible
              events at Hillsborough have been examined by the Inquiry and are
              set out in its Interim Report.

              The Inquiry is now looking at the more general issues of safety
              at sports events, including the present safety legislation,
              safety guidelines and pitch fences as well as questions such as
              membership schemes and all seater stadia.    We shall consider
              carefully what the Inquiry has to say on these and any other
              issues when it reports next year.



                                                                        / T h e G o v e rn m e n t


              K Raffan Esq MP
The Government has made it clear that the national membership
scheme under the Football Spectators Act 1989 will not be
introduced until it is satisfied that the scheme- will be
effective, workable and safe.

We share Mrs McBrien's view that there should be moves towards
all seater stadia for major football clubs.      The Football
Spectators  Act also enables    the Secretary of    State  for
Environment, via the licensing mechanism, to require clubs to
replace standing accommodation by seating.

I am arranging for her letter, together with this one, to be
passed to Lord Justice Taylor so that he is aware of her
sentiments and views.

Dear Mr Mould

PSO CASE: MRS McBRIEN TO KEITH RAFFEN MP


I said I would provide a contribution to this letter.

You are probably better placed than me, to                      deal with the
points raised on alcohol consumption and the                    police allowing
ticketless spectators into all ticket matches.

On all seater stadia my line would be:


         "The Government shares your view that there should
         be moves towards all-seater stadia for the major
         football    clubs.     The Football   Spectators Act
         enables the Secretary of State for the Environment,
         via the Football Licensing Authority, to require
         clubs    to    replace   standing  accommodation  by
         seating."

On the membership scheme:

         "Existing measures have only contained and not
         solved the problem of football hooliganism either
         inside or outside grounds.   By providing the means
         to keep the troublemaker away form football the
         national membership scheme offers the real prospect
         of ending this problem.      Turning to your point
         about turnstile delays, before recommending the
         scheme   to  the   Secretary   of   State  for  the
         Environment the Football Membership Authority will
         need to satisfy itself that the turnstile process
         time is minimised.      The Minister for Sport's
      Working Party on the scheme accepted that there
      would be unacceptable delays if the turnstile
      operators were asked to check the photograph as

      Government has always made it clear that the scheme
      will not be introduced until it is satisfied that
      it will be effective, workable and safe."

I hope this is helpful and I would be grateful for a sight of
reply.

Dear Tony


PSO CASE: KEITH RAFFAN MP

Thank you for the contribution to the reply to Mr K Raffan MP.
Although I have still to amalgamate any contribution from F8
Division here, I have adapted your contribution as shown in
the attached draft,. Would you let me know if you are content
(telephone will do).

                                                  Yours sincerely




                                                  DAVID MOULD

                                                  (Fire and Emergency
                                                  Planning Department)
Thank you for your letter of                                 with this one from
Mrs Joan McBrien of                                                        IHolywell.
Clwyd, whose son, John, died so tragically at Hillsborough.                           You
also wrote to Colin Moynihan on 23 November and,                        as you know,
that letter has been passed to the Home Office.


I was deeply moved by Mrs McBrien's letter.                       I hope you will
extend to her and her husband my own and the Home Secretary's
deepest sympathy over the sad loss of their son.                     I am arranging
for her letter,        together with this one,             to be passed to Lord
Justice Taylor so that he is aware of her sentiments and views.


We all seek the answers which will prevent a reoccurrence of this
or any other sort of accident at a major sports ground in this
country.       The particular causes which led up to the terrible
events at Hillsborough have been examined by the Inquiry and are
set out in its Interim Report.               I do not think it will help to
rehearse them again here.


The Inquiry is now looking at the more general issues of safety
at    sports   events,    including        the   present    safety      legislation,
safety guidelines as well as questions such as membership schemes
and all seater stadia.              We shall consider carefully what the
Inquiry has to say on these and any other issues when it reports
next year.


The Government has made it clear that the national membership
scheme   under    the    Football      Spectators     Act    1989       will    not    be
introduced     until     it   is    satisfied     that     the    scheme       will    be
effective, workable and safe.              The safety of spectators will not
therefore suffer as a result of the scheme.


We share Mrs McBrien's view that there should be moves towards
all   seater    stadia    for      major   football      clubs.      The       Football
Spectators     Act     also     enables     the    Secretary       of     State       for
Environment,     via the licensing mechanism,              to require clubs to
replace standing accommodation by seating.

As you know Mr Keith Raffan MP has sent the Secretary of State
for the Environment a copy of your letter to him of 13 November
about the death of your son John at Hillsborough last April.   The
Secretary of State has asked me to reply.     I am sorry about the
delay in replying but I am sure you will appreciate that my reply
 ad to. take account of Lord Justice Taylor's final report on that
tragedy.

I should first of all like to pass on to you my own and the
Secretary of State's sincerest condolences on the tragic loss of
your son.  I know no one can truly put themselves in the place of
another who has suffered such a bereavement but I can appreciate
that terrible sense of loss and grief that you are feeling.

I have noted very carefully all the points made in your letter
particularly what you say about a national membership scheme for
football supporters.    The other points you have made have, I
understand, all been covered in a letter from Lord Ferrers at the
Home Office to Mr Raffan.

As you will probably know Lord Justice Taylor concluded that he
could not support a national membership scheme because he did not
believe that the technology would work well enough to avoid the
danger of congestion and disorder.     The Government has always
made it clear that it would not implement the scheme until it had
given full consideration to Lord Justice Taylor's final report.
In the light of his report we have decided not to proceed with
the establishment of the Football Membership Authority which
would have had the responsibility for drawing up arid implementing
a detailed scheme.

Lord Justice Taylor recommended an alternative strategy for
combatting football hooliganism including the creation of new
offences specifically related to football, the use of attendance
centre  orders  and   electronic tagging   of  offenders.    The

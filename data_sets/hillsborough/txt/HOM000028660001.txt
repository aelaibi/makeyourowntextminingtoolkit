 Dear Minister

 FA Cup Semi-Final - Liverpool v Nottingham Forest

 I attended the above football match on Saturday April 9th 1988, and write
 to protest in the strongest terms at the disgraceful overcrowding that was
 allowed to occur (in an all ticket match) in the Leppings Lane Terrace area
 (ticket counterfoil No.135 attached).

 The whole area was packed solid to the point where it was impossible to
 move and where I, and others around me, felt considerable concern      or
 personal safety (as a result of the crush an umbrella I was holding in my
 hand was snapped in half against the crush barrier in front of me).     I
 would emphasise that the concern over safety related to the sheer numbers
 admitted, and not to crowd behaviour which was good.

 My concern over safety was such (at times it was impossible to breathe),
 that at half time when there was movement for toilets, refreshments etc.
 managed to extricate myself from the terrace, having taken the view that my
 personal safety was more important than watching the second al .

 This unfortunate overcrowding spoiled for a great many people what would
 and should have been a pleasant and enjoyable footballing occasion.

 With current concerns over crowd safety and behaviour it would be helpful
 to know how such an event could occur at an all ticket major spor m g
 occasion.

 I   have    written   in   similar   terms   to   the   secretary   of   the   Football
 Association.

 Yours, faithfully

outside       the    public house-           but    I saw no disorder whatsoever.                          We also

did not        «:<perierce a_>y cU 1ay             iT' getting        into the South St a Ad.

Having       entet'i'j the       ground we         lock up our         seats       fry in whic'i we h^d

perfect        view of the goal             line cf the Leppj.n3 ?. Lane end.                      Our teats

consumed          i rts i dfe the ground.

At a p p r o x i m a t e l y   1.3 0 pm the S p i e n Hop on the South Stand were                           fairly

full     but      I noticed that the N o r t h St a n b d that was                     opposite a p p eared t

be empty.           'I remember         particulary noticing              the shortage             in the N o r t h

Stand       but     I cannot      recall      how full        the West Stand was at this                     time.

However        by S.3 0 pm I can recall                that the       central        area of the West Star

w*s weei          o c c u p i e d but   the outer wings          of this           are* significantly              not

well        occupied.          I now this terrace             area well        because at the same

 fixture        last year        I a c t u a l l y stood on th*           central      terrace of the West

 Stand and          1 am awar*          of the     narrow exit         points.        ie two gates at              the

 top of the           radio     fencimj.         On looking across             this year        I was aware o'

 either        Polite Officer            or S t e w a r d s   at thete     gates.

 At ar o u n d 3. 0 0 p m       1 became       aware of what appeared to me of                        crowd

  surging         in t h e ' section of the West End terracing and                            it     gave the

  impression of            crowd misbehaviour.                 People     sat around my              area were       al

  commenting          on this.          E ven after       the game was stopped there                       seemed to

  be    crowd m i s b e h a v i o u r    and this        continued to be my impression for

  sometime.

P olice were         still    treating    this     incident        a disturbance        in the crowd.

Ther* was       nc    i^-^sion      of     co-or d i n a t i o n   in respect of police          action,

they a p p eared w ust         to be shouting and waving               at the      crowd to move

back-     There was          re i m pression of        control      over the       actions of the

Police.
I did not see          anything w h i c h I fceleive was directly                   concerned wit n th.

breaking       of the     barrier in pen 3.              My   recollection         is though after 4

or 5 mninute*          after     the game       ending    it became apparent            that the-e was

a serious       situation and        casulatie*          were      being    brought out.       At this

Point Police          action seemsd        to    change       but to despite        this there

a p p e a r e d to still       be surging       in the     back of the        crowd.     I would       also

 say that       for at       least half     an hour      there was         still   no co-ordination o

 action       by the Police.        I w ould       say though that           the Police,       St Johns

 Am b ulance     and    in the    later     stages Fire Brigade who were there worked

 very hard at an individual                 level.

 As time       progressed       I became      aware      of the seriousness            of the situatior

 as more and more             casulaties were          receiving       first aid such as mouth-te

 «r,outh and heart massage.                The one thing that struck me and others                           th«

 we ware       given no        information as        to what was           happening.        I think Kenns

 D a l g l e i s h made      an appeal    to the      crowd to w hich he said there was                  one

  or    two   problem*.         I can also       remetr-ber an annancement             for    people    to

  stay    calm but no information was                  given.

  We    remained       in our seats       for a p p r o x i m a t e l y * 0 minutes and saw the

  tragedy unfold with fans using m a k eshift stretchers and more and mor

  injured       lying down*        1 recall        an ambulance        coming onto        the pitch and

  driving       around the edge slowly to the scene                         behind the goal,       I thoug

  at the time why does              it just drive across               the    pitch.

  H aving w i t n e s s e d     the appauling tragedy               I was very concious          that at t

   very same m atch            last year     I had .tood           in the    central section of the

The whole             was     packed solid to the            point were        it was     impossible

ho lei in -3 in ny hands was          snapped    in half against           the crush barrier          in

frort     of me,     I would      emphasis*      that the      concern over safety             related

to th* shear        number, admit t e d an d not           to crowd behaviour what was

good.      My    concern over        safety was     *uch and at times              it was    impossxbl

 to breathe       that at     half    time whe n there was movement                 for toilet?,

 refreshments       etc     I ma na g e d to extricate myself              from the terrace,

                    I am a Chief         Inspector         in the S ou th Yo rk sh ir e Police and work at

                    Force H e a d q u a r t e r s , Sheffield.        F ro m time to time         I a tt e nd a football

                    match as a spectator.                  I had few commitments          during    the weeke nd

                    15“ 16 April      and. so obtain ed a ticket              for the F.A.        Cup semi-final         game

                    between Liverpool            and N ot ti n gh a m Forest.

                    My ticket was          for seat NN 28         in the S ou th Stand u ncovered enclosure.

                    (The seats       number      1--230 from West        to E a s t , my seat was therefore

                    relatively       close      to the L eppings Lane             enclosure   on the    13th row from

                    the front) .

                    The    day was    fine and sunny,           I left      the    city centre about        1«£0 pm in

                    my    car to travel         to the ground.          I drove      from Bridge Street          out of

                    the    city via. West Bar,             Gibraltar Street and Langsett Road.                   1 had

                    allo we d for heavy traffic               but was    s urprised that there was            very

                    little     problem until          the usual      b ottleneck at H i ll s bo r ou g h     corner

                    traffic     lights.         I travelled thro ug h the junction towards

                    H i l l s b or o ug h Football        Stadium.    There were        no hinderances      as    I

                    tr avelled down L ap pings Lane              onto Pen is to ne Road and          left    into

                    Clayw he el s Lane.

                    I parked my        car     in C laywheels Lane and wal ke d towards H i ll s bo r ou g h

                    Stadium.       The     time would        be about    1.45 pm,        (1345)
                                                                                                   PAGE
                                                                                                   R 274

Many    people were milling around,                    but there were no       large      crowds as        I

made my way to the P enistone Road                      roundabout and along L ep pings               Lane.

All    the way along my journey                 I was    continually asked for            'spare'

tickets and         ' s w a p s 1' by young male Liverpool           supporters.          I politely

answe re d the first            few but the       number       of enquiries    became      so

ove rw he lm in g    that   I. simply wal ke d          past    or shook my head.

My ticket was           green    in colour and showed a d mi ss io n by a S ou th Stand

gangway     closest       to the South West             corner    of the stadium,          I consulted

the schematic map on the                 rear and the          natural   route a pp ea r ed to be

via L e p pings Lane an d a service                road w hich      leads to the S ou th S t a n d «

The    ticket     bore    no ment io n of        colour    coding - I a s su m ed until a long

time after        the event       that ALL tickets were green.

I saw no reference              to colour       coded d i re ct io n boards.         F u rt h er mo re     I

reached the S ou th S tand service                 road and found the way barred                  by a

serial    of officers,           under    the    command of       Inspector Harvey,,          ensuring

the    proper     s e gr eg at io n of fans.           I was a ll ow ed to pass throu gh           but an

awful    lot of s upporters were                invited to walk          round the block and

enter    the S ou th S tand        from P e ni st on e R o a d .     The    point    of   relating

this    is to     indicate that the             i nformation      provided on the ticket

itself     could have       been much more             comprehensive and the dir ec ti on

boards more         p ro mi nently displayed,

I took up my seat and saw from the electronic                             clock behind me that

the time was         1.54 pm.      (1334)       The gr ou nd was     very spars el y       populated.

There was,        h o w e v e r , a quite densely           packed area in the two            centre

enclosures        behind the Leppings Lane                end goal.

I bought and         read a match         programme         as   I waited for the game           to

begin.      I remember at one stage,                   looking across       to the West S tand

terraces and seeing              the supporters          patting a m u l t i - co l ou r ed     beachbal1

a r o u n d the   centre    enclosure.           The    significance       of this     is that the

crowd were        not    so tightly       packed as they were able to raise                     their arms
                                                                                                   PAGE
                                                                                                   R274

and bounce        the ball around.

The two teams           came    onto the      pith for a w a rm -u p session.             1 don't

remember       the time        precisely      but    remember    that    it was    early,       perhaps

S . 30 pm or 2.35         pm.     (1430-1435)          W h en the teams        left the    pitch I

remember       that the ground seemed more                   full.

A bout 2.45       pm (1445)       I can't      remember       precisely,       I saw several       fans

from the       centre     enclosures       scaling      the wall and       climbing       into    the

seating       enclosure.         I interpreted         this as m is ch ievous          rather    than

arising       because     of overcrowding.             I saw about       four    or five     police

officers,       one an     Inspector       standing      in the aisles          of the seating

enclousre       close     by the      front    of the s t a n d .      I was    not s up rised to see

the officers move              to prevent      this a c t iv i ty and thought           it proper

that    officers        should eject       those who had mana ge d to climb                into the

stand.        He escorted the young man up the aisle and out of the                               stand.

The    climbing from the standing                   to the    seating area       ceased apart        from

a very occasional              person.

There a p p e ar ed to be sufficient                 officers    on the perimeter          track

a round    the ground.

The    two teams        returned to the         pitch at about 2.55             pm and    I considered

it unlikely that           the    game would be able            to start at 3 . 0 0       pm h o w e v e r ,

the    preliminaries           were   curtailed and          the teams were       in posit ion       to

kick    off aro un d that         time or a minute afterwards.                   The    crowd    in the

S o u t h Stand were all          standing.          I sat down before m any a ro un d me and

t hereby did not see the kick-off.                      As    people    began to sit down there

was a cheer        from the       crowd and my a t t e n t io n was drawn to the                 'players

tunnel'.        1 gues se d that the N o t ti n gh a m Forest manager was taking his

seat    but    could not        see the subject         of this      interest.

I saw very        little       football    played because,           seconds afterwards,           my

a t t e n t i o n was   drawn to fans         being a l lo we d out of the L ep pi n g s Lane

enclosure and onto              the   pitch.        1 immediately assumed that             the    centre
                                                                                                 PAGE.
                                                                                                 R274

closure had become           overcr ow de d and that        the    police     there were

transferring        fans    to another     enclosure.        I became        concerned whe n I

saw that the        fans were     just sitting        on the      pitch and were         not moving

towards other enclosures.               Other    fans were scaling            the    perimter

fencing and dropping           onto the      perimeter      track.

Members     of the      public around me who were            less than        100 yards       from the

incident     i nterpreted this as a pitch              invasion and there were many

calls    for strong        police ac ti on to get         the fans back        into     the

enclosures.         The ma n sitting       beside me       suggested        putting     police    dogs

into the enclosure.            Because     the   police officers were               not just

allowing     but ass is ti ng     the fans over the fence and out of the

em er g e n c y gates    I realised that this was            not a pitch invasion and was

definitely a ma11 e r for           concern.

I recall     that    the football       players and officials               continued     the game

for an inordinate           period after      I had    realised the need for the game

to be halted.           Fans were a ct ua ll y sitting         on the       pitch.      The football

m atch was     not he 1 ping     the offi cers attempts           to deal w ith the

si t u a t i o n because    there were     cheers and surges and the a t t e n t io n was

drawn away from the matter at h a n d .

I saw S u p e ri nt en de nt Murray       come from the d ir ection of the                police

control     room and go       to the perimeter         track.        He went    to the area

behind Leppi ngs Lane goal and then walked                     very quickly,          almost     ran,

to the    linesman       in front    of the S ou th S t a n d .       He    clear 1y wa nt ed     the

game    to be stopped.         '1 w ould have      thought     the    linesman       could not have

m i s i n t e r p r et e d S up e ri n te n de n t M u r r a y ’s intentions and. yet    he simply

ran away from him keeping              up w ith the       play on the        pitch.

My a t te nt io n was      now totally     fixed on the Leppings Lane                 end of the

ground and      I saw at one        point that S up er in t en d en t G r e e n w oo d        ran onto

the    playing area and ensured that the m atch was                        stopped.

More and more        people    streamed onto        the    playing are a via the emergency
                                                                                                         PAGE
                                                                                                         R274

gates at the front              of the enclosures            or by climbing over             the    fencing

at this       point.      The    first    indication         1 had of the extent             of the

problem was when two Constables,                    one was PC M arsh           T*     Division,

carried a young            boy from that area            to the      pitch    immediately          below

where    I was     sitting and began to give m o u t h - to - mo u th                 r e su s ci ta ti on to

the    boy.     They wor ke d with a member               of the      public    to resuscitate             the

boy for some        time and a pp ea r ed to have been successful                       as the       crowd

wh ic h had gathe re d          round turned towards               the stand and cheered.

It seemed to be a long time until                       the single St.         John's A mb ul ance

a p p e a r e d on the     playing area.          The    scene was      becoming more and more

chaotic a lt ho ug h there were more                than enough         police       officers who were

doing everything            they    possibly      could to deal with the situation.

I thought       that,     as there were          so m any     police officers          on the       pitch

there may be a            lack of      control    ar ou nd    the back of the stand                so,    at

about 3 . 2 3 - 3 . 3 0   pm    (1525-1330)       I left      the stand and went             to a point

at the South West              corner,    immedi at el y behind the            police     control

tower.        There were        other    police    officers         there,    none    of who m had radio


I imagined that all              the    injured w ould have           been brought        onto      the

pitch and w ou ld be e vacuated at this                      point.    It being       the nearest

access     point    for ambulances,          I therefore            looked towards making                the

area a casualty station.                   There was          a police       landrover       parked       in

just    the spot where           I considered the a mbulances may                    park and       I wasted

an awful       lot of time         getting   the    landrover moved - there were                     no keys

in the vehicle.

At this       time a middle aged man wit h a stewards                        tabard    rolled up in

bis jacket       pocket walked up to the young                      steward who was wearing                his

tabard and d u ti fu ll y manning            the gate at this            point.        The    older man

said    " O i , get that        jacket off,       some supporters            just    beat a couple of

our    lads up when they found out they were stewards."

When    I next     looked around          there were         two    casualties at this             point.

                                                                                                  R274

One male about 6 feet                tall and heav il y built,            2S--3Q y e a r s , laying on

a metal      stretcher.           He was very o b vi ou sl y dead.             I helped a

p olicewoman and a member                  of St. J o h n ’s Ambulance         in their attempts           to

revive him but was              struck at that            time by the futility of the

operation.           The    other    casualty was very much alive,                holding      his arm.

An a m bulance arri v ed and after attem pt in g                     resuscitation for a few

seconds      on the        deceased man the am bu la nc e            crew suggested        putting       him

in the ambulance,             I helped them to do that and then told the group of

4-5 PC *s at         this    point that          I w an t ed one of them to a cc o mp a ny       the

body,      A young male           constable who           spoke with a Mers ey si de        accent,       but

who    I 'm sure,      was wearing             the unif or m of S outh Yor ks hi re Police           said

" I ’ll go,      I know his family."                   1 was ama ze d at this     comment      but had

not    time to follow           it up.

The    other     slightly       injured         man got    into    the same a m bu la nc e and the

a m b ulance     left.       There was          nothing    to do at this       point so    I

instructed the PC's               to keep the a rea          clear for a mb ul an ce s and walked

along the service             road towards L ep pings Lane               to ensure unre s t r i c t e d

access      for the eme rg en cy services w hi ch                  I expected to arrive.

As    I turned a corner             of the service          road walking       towards Leppings

Lane    I was met          by the full          tragedy of the situation.            There were a

row of a m bulances at              this       point    beside    the perimeter wall        of the

stadium,       numerous        people were         receiving medical attention.                But at

least     ten male         bodies were          laid out    in att em pt ed    recovery     position

along     the fence         beside     the      river and     no one was      paying them any

a t t e n t i o n w h a t s o e v e r , they    were    obv io us ly dead.     Their skin had        a

m o t t l e d blue    pallor and their              limbs were      completely     limp.

There were         literally dozens,              if not a hundred or more,            police

officers       at this       point under          the    control    of Chief    Inspector Purdy.               I

was    in civilian          clothes without a radio and felt                   completely helpless

in this situation.                I continued to the end of the service                     road and
                                                                                                         P AGE
                                                                                                         R 274

there     e ncouraged several                 s upporters who were trying to walk                  down the

service      road that              they    could not do so until          the eme rg en cy services

had departed.                 1 a rr an ge d a group of         police    officers,,      who were       not

e nga g e d wit h anything,                 into a cordon across          the mouth of the

j u n ct io n .

I now found myself                   outside the          cordon and had felt of          little       use

inside,.     I decided              to    leave   the stadium to telephone my wife                 to

reassure          her    that       1 was    uninjured.        The    telephones    in L ep ping s Lane

were,     not unexpectedly,                  full and had queues          of people outside.

As    1 walked along Leppings Lane there were                            groups of Liverpool

s upporters         standing aro un d and they a pp ea r ed very aggressive.                             A

police     car was            driving       up and down L ep pings Lane,           asking       via the P.A.

system,      for        fans    to       clear the way for ambulances.              I saw more          than

one supporter                kick    out at       the slowly    patrolling       car.     I returned to

my car     parked at the                  junction of C la yw he el s Lane wit h N i ag a ra Road.

X decided that                I w ou ld drive to H a m m e rt o n Road,          telephone my wife

from there and assist                      in any way       I could at the       police    station.

1 arrived at             the    police       station to find          it much    calmer and well

staffed than             I    had anticipated.              I tele ph on ed home.       After a short

time    the talk was                of    relatives and friends          being    received at

H a m m e r t o n Road.         I decided          that   this was an area        in w h i ch    I could

offer     useful         assistance.

Together wit h other                     officers,    notably DC I A g a r , I helped to transform

the    ’n e w ’ CID office at H am m er t on Road                    into a relative       reception area.

In the early evening                      friends and       relatives    began a rr iving at

Hamme rton Road,               1 d o n ’t know how they had got there                   or who    had

decided upon H a m m e r to n Road as the                     point of    reception.        It quickly

became apparent                that we would need a larger area for them to gather

a nd wait.          The H i ll s bo r ou g h Boys Clu b Hall was suggested,                      the

keyholder was known and so it was arranged.                                All    the Social       Workers/
                                                                                                        PAGE
                                                                                                        R274

Helpers      gathered there and               received the          friends and      relatives         of

supporters, w hen we had ob tained a formal                          report about a missing

friend or relation.

The   system wo rk ed as            follows;      S o me h ow    (?)    people who had          lost

contact with f r ie nd s/ re la ti ve s at the                  time of the        incident were

d i r ected to H a m m e rt o n Road Police Station.                     The team of officers

working with me w ould                complete a M.F.H,             report and we w ou ld then pas

the   person making           the     report    over    to the Social Workers at the Boys

C 1 ub .

During      the     course    of the eveni ng /n ig ht           our growing        list   of    ’missing''

persons was          checked with        lists of casualties              at hospital       and with

lists      of a r r e st ed   persons.         About O iO O am the stream of friend/

relatives         ceased and,         after    contacting Chief S up er in t en d en t Mo 1e at

the makeshift          mortuary,        I closed our          operation down.

The   final       duty was      to drive       to the m o r tu a ry and check          the M.F.H.

reports against           the    list of deceased.               1 handed all        documents         to

DI Charles who was work in g at the m o r t ua r y and who said he would be

w orking      the    following        day.     I left duty at 0400 am Sunday,                    16 April

■1989.

As a postscript           to this       report about          the    incident,      1 am    reminded of

an earlier          visit to H i ll s bo r ou g h Football             Stad iu m   in my y ou th when

there was a very              large    crowd.

The match was a first                 div ision   league        game between S he f fi e ld

W e d n e s d a y and M anchester City.             It was       the    last game of the          season

and S h e ff i e l d W ed n es d ay     needed to win the              game to remain        in the firs

division.           It w ould be about          1971.

It was an a ll - ti ck et           evening game and my ticket was for L ep pings

Lane.       I a r r i v e d w ith a friend        in good time and took up my                    position

on the terracing              behind the goal          but,     before the start           of the game,

the terraces          had become        so full     that      not only was         I unable      to see
                                                                                                                 PAGE
                                                                                                                 R274

           m uch of the            pitch,    but    it was a very uncomfortable              situation.          There

           was    no room to move and                I remember,      at one time,        being     squased

           against a barrier                to such an extent         that   1 was exerting all my

           energies        to prevent         injury and quic kl y became              totally un co nc er ne d

           about     the game -          I dreaded any goals           or near misses as this was

           followed        by a surge         of people w hi ch        caused me to be squashed

           painfully against                the barrier.

           By half time             I had seen very          little   football    and was       thoro ug hl y fed

           up w ith the situation.                   Half   time was     the first       o p po rt un it y    I had to

           move my position and,                   after    fighting my way through the              crowd      I found

           a more      comfortable           position at the front           of the south west               corner   of

           the Leppings Lane                terracing.        I' had been in very         large football

           grounds       before and since             but had never       e xp er ie nc ed a ny thing        quite

           like the        pressure         that was       created    in this   crowd at Hillsborough.

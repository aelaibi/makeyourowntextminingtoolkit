           On Saturday,        9th April,      1988 (090488)          I worked football match duty,

           the FA Cup Semi Final            between Liverpool and Nottingham Forest at the

           H i11sb o ro u g h F oo t ball G rou nd at S h ef f ie 1d .

           My serial         sergeant was PS Higgins and our serial number                     was N o . 14.

           Before       the start of the match our serial was                  detailed to perform duty

           inside       the ground at the Leppings Lane end searching Liverpool

           supporters as they passed through the turnstiles.

           Whilst       carrying out these duties           I cannot      remember any rowdy

           behaviour of any kind.             All the fans        I searched did not object and

           seemed friendly taking            into account that most of them had already

           been searched before entering the turnstiles.                         Nothing untoward was

           found during my searching of the fans,

           At the       end of the match 1 believe our serial                  accompanied the

           With reference to the Liverpool United V» Notts. Forest,          which took

           place at Hillsborough Ground Saturday the 9th April          1988 (090488).

           I worked this game by way of overtime with the Maltfay contingent,,              the

           serial    sergeant was PS Jones who        is now at A3«

           I believe    I was   positioned at Leppings Lane just prior to and during

           the match and cannot      recall anything of note occurring,     there was the

           usual    carnival atmosphere with the fans but nothing else       I can

           remember.     I have been unable to contact anyone else who worked this

           duty,    to confer with them about the matter.

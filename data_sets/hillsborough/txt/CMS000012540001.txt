HILLSBOROUGH^FOOTBALL DISASTER - REQUEST FOR FINANCIAL ASSISTANCE

The Secretary of State has seen a copy of Mr Morrison's minute to
you of 4 May reporting on his meeting with the Directors of Social
Services of Liverpool and Sefton. He is not impressed with the case
which Liverpool and Sefton have put forward for extra financial
assistance to provide social service support activity to those
affected by the Hillsborough disaster and he would be grateful for
your advice on how we should handle any formal request for such
assistance.

HILLSBOROUGH FOOTBALL DISASTER - REQUEST FOR FINANCIAL ASSISTANCE

At their request I attended a meeting yesterday with the Directors of
Social Services of Liverpool and Sefton.    A note of that meeting is
attached (Annex A) but in essence they told me that the authorities
involved in social service support activity to those affected by the
Hillsborough disaster wished to approach Government for

       i)      financial support towards the establishment of a
       regional unit to co-ordinate the relief and counselling effort
       (Annex B )

       ii)     more generally, financial assistance towards the costs
       already incurred and ongoing as far as the separate local
       authority social services departments are concerned.
I was not of course able to give them any assurances about what level
of support, if any, the Government might make.       I suggested they
directed their request in the first instance to the Secretary of State
for Health given his Department's Inspectorate role for local
authority social services.   They accepted that advice but indicated
that they intended to put the issue before the Secretary of State for
the Environment in view of his responsibilities for local government
expenditure.

Thisminute   is to alert you to what has transpired and the likelihood
of an approach to the Department for assistance.   I have also alerted
colleagues in the Department of Health's Social Services Inspectorate.

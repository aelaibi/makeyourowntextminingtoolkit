               I arn a        Detective             Constable              in    the    South           Yorkshire          P o l i ce , present, ly

               stationed            at    Woodseats                 Police       Station.

               At    S.OOa.m         (0800)          on      Saturday            15th       April        (130489)          I    commenced             duty          at

               Woodseats            Police          Station           in     uniform.I             was    transported                to    the    stadium

               where,upon            arrival             I attended              the    briefing              in    the    North          Stand       „

               My    duties         were       to    work           with    serial           16    at    the       Leppings          Lane       end       of    t he

               ground.             After       the       briefing           I saw       Inspector              Purdy       to       whom    I was

               responsible               at    the       Leppings           Lane       end        of    the    ground          where       he    outlined

               to    the      serial          how    the       area        would       be     policed.              The    time       was       about

               11.15a.m.             For       the       next        few    hours       I accompanied                 Inspector             Purdy          in       his

               supervisory               inspections                 of    the    turnstiles              at, t h i s      end       of    the    ground.

               (He      instructed             other         officers            to    work        in    pairs).           We       also    stopped             and       ]

               searched            fans       who    were           attending          at     the       ground       and       helped       others

               with      ticket          and    direction                 enquiries.

               The      fans       attending             were        at    this       point        good       natured,          offering          sweets,

               chips         pop    etc,and          a    good        atmosphere              prevailed.

               During         this       period          I had        thought          that        more       fans    would          be    arriving

               and      it    surprised             me    that        greater          numbers           were       not    attending.             At       about

               S.35-2.40p.m               (1435-1440)                 greater          numbers           did       start       to    attend       and          at

               this      time       I was       standing              inside          the     railings             near    to       turnstile          G.
                                                                                                                                                  PAGE
                                                                                                                                                  R 389

The    pressure             started             to     build          in    this       area       to    G       between          the       railing

and    a    blue       conertina                -type        door          opposite          me.As          a    result          of     this        I

was    pushed          up       against             the     r a i 1 i n g »T h i s      caused          considerable

discomfort             and       I slid             underneath              using       the       railing             to     protect

myself          from       the       pressure.              It    was       obvious          that       people             were       in     great

distress          in       the       crowd          which        continued             to     swell         rapidly.

Inspector             Purdy          climbed           on    the       railings             and      appealed              to    the       crowd

to    stop       pushing             as       people        were       being       crushed.             They          either

disregarded                him       or       did     not    hear          him.    In a n y          event           the    pressure

continued             to    mount.             People        were          shouting          from       the          crowd       to     the

police            to       do    something. I                pulled people                  from     the             crush       a n d as

they       came       out       they          sa id       t,he    s am e t h i ngs:          ‘'P e o p 1 e        are      d y i ng i n

there-do          s o m e t h i n g 1' . T h e y          were        gasping          for     air      and          holding          their

chests.          I began             to       fear     they       were       right          and      that        people          were        no t

merely          being       injured             and       frightened              but       crushed             to    death        up

against          the       turnstiles                 arid t h e       gate       opposite.

A    young       boy       was       passed           over       the       top    to    the       edges.I             thought           he

was    dead       his       arms          were        dangling             like    a    doll's.                 Fortunately,                 on

taking            hold          of    him       with other             officers             Is a w   signs           of    life         and

he    was         taken          to       a   First Aid           Post.

People          continued             to       cry     for       action          saying        "do      something,                 do      something

people          are    dying!"                 I saw        one       elderly          man     just         out       of    a r m ’s       reach.

He    appeared             in    great          distress              and    was       being         swept           along       in     the       tide

of    people.              The       mood       of     the       crowd       was       now     aggressive                  and     fearful.

The    situation                was       extremely              dangerous.                 People          were       also        climbing

over       the    gates          and          walls.

Near       to    the       railing             a young           boy       was    being        crushed               against          it     with       his

neck.           His    face          was       red     and       he    was       crying        and      obviously                frightened.

I    tried       to    take          hold       of     him       to    pull       hirn f r o m         the       press.            His       father

shouted          at    me       aggressively                 "Fuck          off    -• y o u ' r e       not          chucking           him       out."
                                                                                                                                                  PAGE          3
                                                                                                                                                  R389

I tried           to    tell          hirn h i s       son       was    in       danger          and       he    just        said       “F u c k       of f,

we're        going          in       there."           He       was    agitated             and       aggressive,                 his      son       was

in    great        distress                and    I    could          not    believ4             that       he       d i d n ’t w a n t         to     come

out    from        the       press.              He    must       have       seen          the    young          lad       passed          over

earlier.

The    pressure              was       still          mounting,             the    people             coming          in     the       late       rush

appeared           to       be       the    stereo-typed                ’b e e r       swilling             f a n ’ obviously                   just

turned        out       of       the       pub.

At    some        point          I    looked          to    my    left       and       saw       Inspector              Purdy.          He        was

making        his       way          through          the       crush       towards             the    outside             gates.            He

signalled              me    to       follow          hirn.       I did          but       could       not       catch          up     with       him

due    to     the       great          numbers             of    people          and       police          horses.              I saw        him

talking           to    another             man.           I did       not       recognise             him       b ut      saw       his     gold

braid        on    his       hat.

After        this,          the       gate       to    the       side       of    the       turnstile                and     at      right        angles

to    them        was       opened.              I was          thankful          for       this       because             I knew          it     would

releive           the       pressure             outside.              People          ran       towards             the     gate       to      get

in.      I    pulled             people          out       from       the    crush          area       and       directed              them       to     the

gate.         Almost             all       of    them       made       the       same       comments             -    "people           are       dying        in

the r e / p e o p l e        are       being          crushed          in    there.              Do    something,                 do    something."

The    pressure              rapidly             eased          and    I moved             in    front          of    the       gate       shouting                 '


at    people           to    walk          in,    n ot      run.        After          a    short          while        the       gate       was       closed
                                                                                                                                                                    I
again        and       the       pressure             was       greatly          eased.           I    looked           in      to     the      crush

area     for       any       sign          of    injured          people          but       could          see       nothing.           At        th e

outer        gates          people          continued             to    stream             in.        It    looked           like       it      could

build        up    again.              The       gate       at    the       side       was       re-opened              but       this       time

barriers           and       a       mounted          policeman             were       in       position.               I again            started

to    pull        people             out    of    the       crush       area       and          direct          them       to     the      gate        but

this     time          they       were          entering          in    single             file.           They       were        more       orderly

but    still           complaining                that          people       were          being       crushed.                 They       held

the    counterfoils                   were        taken.

It    was       at    this       time,        which             I think          was       around       3.00       pm       (1500)        that       I

saw    the       gate        opposite             open          up.        I did       not     see      any       sudden          rush        through

the    gate,          taut      the     area       was          still       packed.             I looked           into       the       area

inside          the    turnstiles                 between             the       gates       and       the    stand          entrances.               I

do    not       recall          seeing        masses             of    people.              I then          heard       a    mesage           over

s o m e o n e ’s      radio        saying          “a l l        personnel             to     the      playing          area,          a ll

personnel             to        the     playing             area".          I saw          policemen          running             to    the

right       of       the     stand           to    a    passage            which           leads       onto       the       pitch.            When I

went       on    to    the       pitch        I saw             people          sitting            on the         pitch.          My    immediate

reaction             was     that       it    was       a       pitch       invasion               in p r o t e s t a t       the

conditions             outside.

As    I walked             to    the        goalmouth             a    policeman              said      to    me:       “T h e r e      are

people          dead       down       there."                   I was       shocked.              I    could       not       believe           it.       As

I approached                 I     could          see       people          being          pulled       through             the    gates        at the

front.           I    could        not       get       to       the    front          of    the       fence       to    assist          because              of

other       officers.                 An     officer             shouted,             it    appeared          to       be    anyone           who    was

listening             " Go      round        the       back       to       the    tunnel          and       get    the       crowd        out."          I

went       along       with        other          officers             to       the    entrance             tunnel.           I saw

Inspector             Sykes        there          and       other          officers.                   Iwent       to t h e       front        of    the

terraces             and     took       hold       of       a    large          man    on     the       g r o u n d. He           appeared           to

me    to    be       dead.         It       was    a    shock.              Now       I had       to    accept          the       worst.

With       other       officers              and       fans       I    carried             hirn b a c k      to    the       gate       at

Leppings             Lane       where        I saw          an    ambulance.                  I do      not       know       who       the     officer

was.        I took           him      to     the       crew       and       left       him     in      their       car       and       returned

to    the       terraces.               I    recovered                another          body       with       other          officers,           to

the    Leppings              Lane       end       again.

Whilst          moving          one     of    the       bodies,             a    fan       pushed       his       face       to    mine        whilst

I was       holding             the     body,          waving          a    ticket          around          and    shouting             "I     want

extremely              aggressive             the    way          he    was       shouting,                 I      ignored            him        and

carried           on    with       the    body.              He    was       so    selfish              and        insensitive                   -    the

type     who       I believe             caused          the       disaster.

1    returned           again       and       went       through             the       gate       at       the        front,          onto           the

pitch        to    assist          with       the    injured.                  I saw         men        and       women          laid        out       on    the

pitch        in    various          states               dead,          dying,          injured.                  They          all    had

officers           or    ambulance             men       with          them.           I decided                 to       clear       the        area       of

walking           wounded          and    others             who       were       not     injured                to       make       more?       room       f or

ambulances              which       were       starting                to    arrive.

1"he    fans       on    the       pitch       were          in    a    mixed          state          of    shock,              anger,

frustration,                 grief       and       most       disturbing                was       a     number             who       were        looking

to     start       fights          with       the     police.                Again        I thought                   they       were        the       kind

who     caused          this.           These       were          to    a     large      extent             restrained                 by        their

awn     people.

The     stewards             I saw       before          the       disaster             appeared                 to       be    doing        a       normal

job.         However          1 have          not    worked             a    big       football             match              for    several              years.

The     two       bodies           I handled were                  both           taken       from          t he      L e p p i n g s Lane

terrace           to    the        exit       gate near                to    turnstile                G. T h e     bodies            were        left

with     an       ambulance             crew       whilst          I    returned             to       the        terraces.

One     of    the       bodies          was    a    white          male       with       a    moustache,                       about    3 0 ’ ish

with     a    large          beer       belly.           I    cannot          describe                the        other          body.

My     recollection                of    some       of       my    action          and       those          who           were       around          me,     is

sometimes              vague       because,          after             realising             the        enormity                of    the        disaster

I appeared              to    be    drifting             in a n d           out    of    reality.                     I    could       not           believe

the     rows       of    bodies          were       really             there       and       that          things              would soon              be

back     to       normal.               Then       it w o u l d         hit       me    that          it w a s        real       and I would

try     to    assist          the       injured          and       those          helping             them.

                        attitude          was       "I'm    going           to    drink           in          the        pub     until          the       last          minute.

                        I'm    going          to    get    in w i t h o u t           queueing.                      I ’m       going       to          stand       exactly

                        where       I want.              Hard        lines       for       anyone                  else."

                        In m y      opinion          the    decision              to       open            the       gates           was    a       correct             one      and       I

                        am    sure       it    was       correctly           arrived             at .               Whoever           took          the    decision                  was

                        right       to    take       it.

^                       If    it    had       not    been       taken        I am          convinced                     that        there          would       still             be    an

                        enquiry          taking          place,        this       time          to         see       why        people          were       killed               outside

                        the    ground.

                        People          who    attend       situations                 like            football                 matches             or    any       other

                        activity,             must       accept        responsibility                              for    their        own          actions.                They

                        cannot          merely       say    "Why        didn't             we    have               the        kop    end?"              "Why       weren't

                        there       more       gates?"               "Why    wasn't             the           match            delayed?"                "Why    weren't                the

                        Police          there       to    stop        me?"       or    any       other               excuse.

                        I    later       attended          the        de-brief             and         was          ordered           back          to    Woodseats                  wit.h

                        my    colleagues.

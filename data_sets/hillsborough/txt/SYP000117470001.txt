                 The    mobile            patrol          was    also       to      be    used          to    ferry          foot      patrol       officers

                 At    1.30pm         ( 1 3 3 0 ) in      company          with       Dl' S c a i f e         and       DC    Jones         I attended

was    now very             c o n g e s t e d and   progress was          slow.       The   same       brief applied

and    particular a t t e n t i o n was               g iven to Wisewood,              Foxhill,         Middlewood,

people         could be seen drinking                    in groups        outside      public houses             in the

area.          I    can     remember        seeing    not    only      loud men,       and w o m e n drinking

out of glasses                 but also       drinking       out    of bottles and              cans    (cider,

beer,     lager).              It was a p p a r e n t     that     the    public      houses were         full and

the    people           outs i d e were       the    ’overspill".

This    c o n tinued           right       up to kick       off time.          The    radios were         constantly

large     buildings).                 A message was          received at 3pm            (1500)         to attend the

managed            to   contact       F2    control      from this        location and as a result of

that we were                instructed        to get      to the       ground.

This was a t t e m p t e d            i m m e d iately    however        clue to volume         of traffic           the

looked shocked and                   dismayed.           Ambulances        were      present at         that

location and               i njured        persons we re being           t reated.       D 1 Sea.i f e had a

 wandering          and    rushing        in all      directions.             Many Police           officers were

 stru g g l i n g    to    carry    injured and as              it turned out,               dead,    persons          from

 the   field        and we tried to assist                    w here    we    could     in t h i s    respect

 a lthough,         I presume       due to our           casual        mode    of dress,        we were       not

 immediately            r e c o g n i s e d as Police         officers.            Although     I gave

assistance           I left       the    bodies with the               officers who a l r e a d y           had

 p o s s e s s i o n and    1 did not           see the L e p p i n g s       Lane     gate    ope n e d or even

know     at    that       stage w h a t       had happened.

 I be 1 ieved there              had been a          pitch     irivas ion      by L i v e r p o o 1 fans a t this

stage and t h o u g h t          that      possibly f i g hting              had    caused the        injuries

although         this      was    later       to   be cla r i f i e d as       not so.         It was a scene

which      is d i f ficult         to describe           since      some matt e r s          remain    clear       in the

m i n d and. other's become                fogged.         I feel       that       unless you were           there

then the         scene      cannot       be     imagined.        DI Scaife           obviously        saw   the     need          t

work     in a n o r g a n i s e d manner             and together            w i t h DC Jones        I left       the

f ie 1 d, w ith h i m       to att e n d       the    gym,,     Once     there       it was     apparent          that

the    s i t u a t i o n was     grotesque and the               problems          enormous.

Del.     toupt. M c K a y was           in a t t e n d a n c e at      the    gym.      DI    Scaife    approached

bodies        lying     on the      floor with Po l i c e             officers        in a ttendance.             DI

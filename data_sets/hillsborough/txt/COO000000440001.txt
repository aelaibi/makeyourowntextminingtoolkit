            Thank you for copying to me your letter of ^j0<fuly to
            John Wakeham.  I am content with what you propose, subject
            to two points:

                     i       I take it that there would be provision for me to
                             be consulted about appointments to the licensing
                             authority.

                     ii      I assume that if the possibility arose of a Welsh
                             club's stadium being required to convert to allÂ­
                             seated acommodation, any recommendation to that
                             effect from the licensing authority would be made
                             to me, and it would be for me to make the
                             appropriate direction. No doubt the amendment
                             will provide for this.

           I am copying this to the Prime Minister, other Members of
           H Committee, David Waddington, Sir Robin Butler and First
           Parliamentary Counsel.

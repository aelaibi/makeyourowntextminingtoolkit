 I FEEL THE EMERGENCY SERVICES & GROUND STAFF>^WERE SLOW TO REACT.    (IE) OPENING

 THE GATES TO THE FENCES.

 Q54

 VITAL TO THIS JUDICIAL INQUIRY?

 THERE SHOULD HAVE BEEN BETTER ORGANISATION OUTS IM r THE GROUND, CHANNELLING

 FJAfS THROUGH BARRIERS UP TO THE TURNSTILES.   IE/’THIS HAD BEEN DONE THIS

 TRAGEDY WOULD NOT HAVE OCCURRED. THE SEMI~f/ENALS SHOULD BE PLAYED ON A HOME &

 THERE SHOULD BE BETTER DIRECTIONS^HOW TO GET AROUND TO THE TERRACES AT THE

 SIDE WITHOUT GOING DOWN THE /TUNNEL.                 THERE SHOULD NOT BE FENCES DIVIDING

 THE LEPPINGS LANE UP INTO SMALLER PENS.

 IS THERE ANYTHING THAT YOU WISH TO           ADD WHICH YOU FEEL IS

 VITAL TO THIS JUDICIAL INQUIRY?

 I THINK THAT LIVERPOOL F.C. SHOULD           HAVE BEEN GIVEN THE LARGER END   OF THE

 GROUND.      I D O N ’T THINK HILLSBOROUGH   FOOTBALL GROUND WAS THERIGHT GROUND       FOR

 THE EVENT. OLD TRAFFORD WOULD HAVE           BEEN A BETTER CHOICE.

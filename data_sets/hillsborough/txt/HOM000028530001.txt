            ANALYSIS OF LIVERPOOL SUPPORTERS QUESTIONNAIRES
            NUMBERS OF NON-TICKET HOLDERS

            You will recall that at our meeting with Lord Justice Taylor on Tuesday
            6 June we discussed a number of aspects which could be viewed as
            priorities. My staff at Nechells have carried out some research with
            regard to the above subject.  Their findings are as follows:-

            All Liverpool supporters questionnaires which have been received into
            the Inquiry have been researched.

            The information contained therein in relation to the purchase of
            tickets has been evaluated.

            Assumptions

            The supporters most likely to come forward are those genuine
            supporters who were in possession of tickets.

            The evaluation of a number of questionnaires , where the supporter
            arrived in Sheffield without a ticket, shows that other persons were
            in the group.  In some instances it is not possible to identify
            whether or not these persons had tickets.

            The numbers identified without tickets refers to conclusive cas e s .
            For these reasons, the statistics may be accepted as absolute minimum
            and it is reasonable to anticipate that in reality the numbers are
            h igh e r .

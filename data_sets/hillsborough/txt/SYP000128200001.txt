                I am a single man and              live wit h my        parents at        the above address,

                On S a t u r d a y    15th April      1989    <150489)      I went to H i l l s b o ro u gh football

                ground to w atch the FA Cup semi                   final     between L iverpool            and

                N o t t i n g h a m Forest.I   went w ith nine friends               in a transit van b elonging

                to                       works.        These friends were I                           L

                                                                                                                           and

                two others           I know only as

                I know that           five of us had tickets            I d i d n ’t have a ticket              for the

                game.      On the way to S he f f i e ld we stopped at a m o t o r w a y service

                station near to Sheffield,                   we w e r e n ’t sub je ct ed to any traffic             delays.

                On the way all           the   lads    in the van had a couple of cans of beer each,

                When the van stopped on the side of the m o t or w ay so we                               could go to the

                toilet a police           patrol      s to pp ed and    checked us out,         all       the    cans of
                                                                                          PAGE         2


beer had been drunk           by then,

We got to S h e f f i el d at about 2 * 1 0 pm     (1410)     and    I'm not sure where we

parked    it M,>as off the m ain P en ni st on e R oa d North*           When we parked up

some    of the    lads w it h us had been there            before and knew the way to the

ground,      there were     quite a feM; police ar ou nd but none of them gave us

an escort       to the ground.

W hen we got to the ground            it was about 2 .2 0p m        (1420)    and the queuing

a re a was     really congested       it was    just a mass      of people with no

o rg a ni s at i on and    I just got    into the queues w ith

                                                                                 and whilst

queuing became          s qu ashed up against     a bin near to a turnstile.               I had

been    refused entry to two turnstiles,

At this time when           I was   being s qu ashed     I could see that there were

some    police officers        on h or seback    but they seemed to move out,              I then

wriggled       into a third turnstile where            I put a       10 note onto the

counter and said to the gateman,                'There you are m a t e , 5       He said,    ’In

yo u g o . ’    I then got     into the ground       I d i d n ’t see any other      gates open

other    than the turnstiles          I then met    up with the other           lads who had

got    in before me.        A couple of mates went           into the N or th Stand.         We

tried to get       into the N or th S tand but a couple of officers were stood

there    checking       tickets,,   then we went down the tunnel              leading to the

terracing,        I wal k e d the    tunnel with

                                        at the end of the tunnel             we went to the

right    into Pen 3 and made our way through the                    crowd to the front,           We

got to the m at c h viewing          position at about 2 . 4 0 pm       (1440).     The    crowd

a ro u n d us at this      time was     full   but not     packed,    it was    comfortable,           I

could see the       pitch without any          problem*,    the atmos ph er e was great.

Then at about 2 , 5 5 p m      (1455)    there was a bad crush          it h ap pened     in a

split    second,    the     crush   came from the back and s ud denly            I was    packed

into the       crowd,     it became unbearable,        I feared for my life,         I just
                                                                           PAGE


c o u l d n ’t breath property,   I thought at first   it was   just a sway but

the   crowd never went    back,    this   crush took my breath away.    I was
still    having       great d if fi cu lt y breathing           I was       crushed against a blonde

girl at       the front,         she was     screaming at first             then seemed to go

unconscious,          I thought she had died.                 This    crush went on for about 20

minutes,       there were          police officers          in front       of the fence shouting at

us to move         back,    my hands went           numb,    I just    c o u l d n ’t move   in any

direction.          E v en t u a l l y the   crush began to subside an d              I got a bit of

air space        then                        H who    I saw had a young           lad aged about           10

wearing       red tracksuit          bottoms,       red Liverpool          top a n d blonde hair,

betw e e n his      legs*        he had been protecting             him.     ________________ then

lifted this         boy who was        still alive          up onto the fence         in front of us,

a police       officer then lifted him over the fence.                          As ________________

went    to get      out    I g r abbed hold of his            shoulder a nd said to him,              "Lets

get this young girl                out.’     At this time       I thought       she was dead, ______

myself an d        police officers           m a na g ed to pull      this girl     up and over the

fence.        E ve nt u al l y    I pulled myself       up the fence and another               police

officer a n d supporter              pulled me over an d            I fell    to the ground.          At

first    I c o u l d n ’t walk and a police             officer       helped me up and asked me

if I wa nt ed any oxygen.                  I said    "No"    I w an te d to look for

As    I stood up I saw him             coming over          the fence.        I ‘
                                                                                w ent onto the        pitch

and    could see        people      lying on the floor everywhere.                  A steward then

told me to get off the                pitch and       I went and sat on the advert is in g

boards    in front         of the S o ut h Stand.           T hen other supporters           came up to

us and a sk e d us for the boards w hich used as stretchers.

We wal k e d a r o u nd     for a bit        in shock a n d d is belief and           left the gro un d

at about 4 .2 0 on dir ec ti on of a loudspeaker announcement.

I think a factor             in the deaths and          injuries       to these     supporters        was

that    the    police were slow to             realise       that    people    in the    pens were

being    crushed right             in front    of them,       they sh ou ld of      reacted quicker

            by opening          gates   onto the   pitch to ease the        pressure,     also a lot of

            police officers were            put across     the   pitch at the      half way     line,    this

            a n no y e d me as they w ou ld have        been better used helping the             injured a nd

            giving     first aid*

            The grounds medical            f acilities were      not adequate      at all,     there just

            w a s n ’t eno ug h St., Joh n A m b u la nc e a n d some    police officers        d i d n ’t seem

            to be    helping,       they were just walking about doing               nothing-

            There was also          bad lack of     commu ni ca ti on betw ee n police        inside a nd

            outside       the    ground.

            F ro m beginning        to the end     it was totally d i s o r g a n i s e d .

            I am a single man a n d           live wit h my         parents at the above address,

            On Saturday          15th April       1989    <150489)       I went to H i l l s b or o ug h football

            ground to watch the FA Cup semi                   final       betw ee n L iverpool     and

            N o t t i n g h a m Forest.I   went w ith nine friends               in a transit van belonging

            to                       works*        These    friends were

                                                                                                                   and

            two others        I know only as

            I know that five          of us had tickets             I d i d n ’t have a ticket for the

            game.     On the way to S h e f f i e l d we stopped at a m o t o r w a y service

            s t a t i o n near   to Sheffields           we were n' t s ubjected        to any traffic delays*

            On the way all          the    lads    in the van had a couple              of   cans of beer each.

            W he n the van stop pe d on the side of the m ot or w ay so we                        could go to the

            toilet a police          patrol       s t op pe d an d checked us out,           all the     cans of
                                                                                                 PAGE             2


beer had been drunk by then.

We    got to S h e f f i el d at about 2 , 1 0 pm <1410)             and    I ’m not sure where we

parked      it was       off    the m ai n P en ni s to n e R oa d North.       When we    parked up

some    of the      lads w it h us had been there                before and knew the way to the

ground,         there were quite a few police a ro un d but                   none of them gave us

an escort         to the ground.

Whe n we got to the              ground    it was about 2 . 2 0 p m        <1420)    and the queuing

a re a was       really     congested      it was     just a mass      of    people w it h no

o r g a n i s at i on and      I just   got    into the queues w ith

                                                                                         nd whilst

queuing         became    s qu ashed up against a bin near to a turnstile.                        I had

been refused entry to two turnstiles.

At this         time whe n      I was being s qu ashed           I could see    that there were

some    police      officers       on horseback        but they seemed to move out,               I then

w r i gg l ed    into a third turnstile where                I put a        10 note onto the

counter and said to the gateman,                      ’There you are m a t e . ’        He said,    ’In

yo u g o . ’      I then got        into the ground         I d i d n ’t see any other      gates open

other     than the turnstiles              I then met up w it h the other              lads who had

got    in before me.             A couple      of mates went         into the N or th Stand.        We

tried to get         into the N o rt h S ta nd but a couple                 of officers     were stood

there     checking        tickets,      then we went down the tunnel                leading to     the

terracing.          I w a l k e d the tunnel w it h |                                                   ~

                                              at the end of the tunnel we went to the

right     into Pe n 3 an d made our way through the                        crowd to the    front.        We

got to the m at ch viewing                position at about 2 . 4 0 pm         <1440).     The    crowd

a r o un d us at this          time was       full   but   not   packed,     it was    comfortable.           I

could see the            pitch without any problem,,              the atmo sp he re was great.

T hen at about 2 . 5 5 p m          <1455)     there was a bad crush           it h ap pened     in a

split     second,        the    crush   came from the        back and s ud denly        I was    packed

into the         crowd,     it became unbearable,            I feared for my life,          I just
                                                                                                   PAGE         3


couldn't        breath    property,          I thought at first          it was     just a sway but

the     crowd never went back,               this    crush took my breath away-              I was

still     having     great d i ff ic u lt y breathing            I was    crushed against a blonde

girl     at the     front*     she was screaming at first then seemed to go

unconscious,         I thought       she had died*           This     crush went      on for about 20

minutes,        there were       police      officers       in front of the fence          shouting at

us to move        back,     my hands went           numb,    I just    couldn't move       in a ny

direction-          E v e n t u al l y the    crush began to subside           and    I got a bit of

air space then ________________ M/ho I saw had a young                            lad a ge d about        10

w ear i n g    red tracksuit        bottoms,        red Liverpool        top and blonde      hair,

betw e e n his      legs,    he had been          protecting him*                             It he n
lifted this         boy who was still             alive     up onto the fence         in front of         us,

a police officer            then lifted him over              the fence.       As                         I

w ent    to get out       I grabbed hold of his shoulder and said to him,                            ’Lets

get     this young girl         out*’        At   this    time   I thought     she was dead,

m y s e l f and police       officers m a n a g e d to pull this girl up and over                       the

fence*         Eventually      I pulled myself            up the fence a n d anot he r       police

officer        and supporter        pulled me over and            I fell     to the ground.          At

first     I c o u l d n ’t walk a n d a        police     officer     helped me up an d a sked me

As    I stood up       I saw him coming over                the fence*       I M>ent onto    the     pitch

and     could see      people     lying on the floor             everywhere.         A steward then

told me to get off the               pitch a n d I went an d sat on the a dv e rt i si n g

b oards       in front of the S outh Stand-                 Then other       s upporters    came up to

us an d a s k e d us for the boards w h ic h used as                     stretchers.

We w a l k e d around for a bit               in shock and disbelief and              left the ground

at about        4.20 on d i r e c t i o n of a       loudspeaker announcement*

I think a factor            in the deaths and injuries to these s upporters was

that     the    police were       slow to realise that              people    in the pens were

being     crushed      right     in front of t h e m r they should of                reacted quicker
                                                                                                       PAbE      4


             by opening gates onto the             pitch to ease        the   pressure,   also a lot of

             police     officers were      put across         the   pitch at the half way      line,    this

             a n n o y e d me as they w ou ld have         been better used helping the         injured a nd

             giving first aid.

             The grounds medical          f acilities were          not adequate at all,      there    just

             wasn't     en ou gh St, J oh n A m bu la nc e and some       police officers      d i d n ’t seem

             to be helping,          they were just walking about doing nothing.

             There was also          bad lack of        c om mu ni ca ti on between police   inside a nd

             outside      the ground.

             F rom beginning         to the end    it was totally disorganised.

               I have during my time as a special                        constable      policed four football

              did not     perform police duties at the                       1988 FA semi-final          w hi ch was       held

              at S h e f f i e l d Wedn e s da ys    football       ground.



              At about 9 . 3 0 a m     (0930)       on S a t u r d a y   15 April      1989   (150489)       I reported

    At about     10.00am      (1000)   on the same day together w it h other Special

    Cons ta bl es an d Regu la r Police Officer            I a t t en d ed a briefing w hi ch was

    w e r e a d v i s e d of the coded m e ss ag e that w ould be broadcast on the

    l o u d s peakers    in the event of an e mergency and also the               coded message

    whe n the e m er ge nc y was over he also a d vi s e d us from w hi ch dir ec ti on

    the fans w ou l d be coming f rom and where              to direct    them.       The entire

    briefing     lasted about 3 0 minutes*



    O n comp l e t io n of the above briefing         the Special       C o ns t a b l e s were then

    di re ct ed to the gym in H i l l s b o r o u g h football       gr ou nd for a further

    briefing and         postings.     My    posting was to the N ia g ra Sports         ground

    club w hi ch was       to be kept       clear at all    times*      I was not     issued with

    a radio and         I left the H i l l s b o r o u g h Football C lu b by myself     to the

    N ia gr a Sports      ground to relieve the Special           Co ns ta bl e who was on duty

    there already.            I a r ri ve d at my post at about        11.00am    (1100)   and the

    Special     who was there        I relieved,    I d o n ’t know his name but         I know he

    was H a m m e r t o n Rd Pol S t n r also there was one Regular Police Officer.

    I d o n ’t know his name but            I believe he was     in the dog section.           This

    officer did not have a radio.



    At about     11.30am      (1130)   on the same day a further two Regular Police

    O ff ic er s a rr i ve d at our    post.      I believe they were from the Don ca st er

    Pol S t n r I d o n ’t know their names and neither               of these officers had

    radios either*



    The first officer          that was at the      post w he n I a r ri ve d at about       11.45am

    (1145)    he went      to make e nquiries      regarding a wedding at          the sports

day*       That    left the     post w it h the two Regular Offic er s and myself*



At    12.30pm     (1230)    on the same day I left the a bove                post to take my

refreshments at Claywheel                 Ln Police     garage*      Up until    this time       I had

not w it n es s ed an y disorder or behaviour by a n y fans w h a t s o e v e r .                 I

returned to my post at about                 1 „ 15pm   (1315)    and the same two       regular

police officers were still at                 the   post.        On my return there w e r e a

lot of fans and vehicle              traffic on the           road a lot more than whe n I

left for my meal           break    the crowds g r ad ua ll y built         up over   this   period.

I only saw one group of fans wit h beer                       cans and that was about 2 * 15pm

(1415)     after      they had a l i g h t e d off a coach.          T he y were a bit

boistrous       but    in good humour.           I d i d n ’t see a n yb od y that a pp ea r ed to

be drunk a l t h o u g h they were          in high spirits        I saw one fan urinating

ad j acent to the        cafe a take        in drive     in place.      This fan was spoken

to by one of the Regu la r Officers.                     The build of fans       increased from

2 . 15pm   (1415)      up until     about 2 . 4 5 p m   (1445)    whe n e verything went quiet

an d there were hardly an y fans about at just                      the occasional       few.



At about 2 . 4 0 p m      (1440)    we were    joined by a further           two Special

C on st a bl e s both male one of w hom had been issued w it h a radio and                        I

was    listening to the         radio*        The   person on the       radio   identified

himself as S up e ri n te n de n t MARSHALL,            and    I could recall    the following

c on ve r sa t io n betw ee n himself and the            control    at this time he sounded

calm.       He M/as saying about            the build up of fans at the L ep pi ng s Ln

end and was        requesting       for further m o un te d o ff icers and police

officers     to assist at          this    location.          I heard the    reply    ’Sending

serials Mr M A R S HA L L gave his           location as Lepp in g Ln turnstiles*

There w e r e     two or three requests by Mr M A R S H A L L for the a bove to take

place and by the third              request Mr M A R S HA L L sound      panicy on the       radio*
                                                                                          PAGE        4


It was s h or tl y after       this that he made       requests     for the gates        to be

opened.         He   requested this man y many times saying               ’Get the stewards

to open the gates *.            The   replies M/ere ’We are trying S i r ’ *             I then

said to the officer w ith the             radio shall we go mean in g the Leppings Ln

turnstiles.           He   replied no they are sending nine serials,                 I d i d n ’t

hear this on the           radio and Mr M A R S H A L L soun de d to be very panicy.

The    last    c o n v er sa ti on I heard from Mr M A R S H A L L w a s , ’Am I a

Superintendent         or not a S up er in tendent,     open these        gates now to let

the fans       in or s o m e o n e ’s going to get killed out h e r e ’ *        The     reply

f rom the      control,     ’The gates are open S i r ’ *       There was a lot of

b a c k g r o u n d noise on the   radio at    this time,     and then the      radio went

quiet.



The two       regulars then left my p os ition I presumed for their

refreshments,         a nd the two specials       carried on w ith their        patrol      w hi ch

left me on my own.             I pre sumed the time to be about 2 . 4 5 p m           (1445)

to 2 * 5 0pm    (1450),



At this time there was a serial                of about 20 regular         officers     past my

post    I d i d n ’t recognise an y of the officers at every th in g was quiet*

These    officers      had gone about twenty yards          past me whe n they about

turned an d      returned toM/ards my post*            I a sk ed one of the officers

what was happening and one of the officers                  said,    ’All assi st an ce

required’*           He d i d n ’t say where    I joined M/ith these officers and

a r ri v e d at Lepping Ln whilst were making our way to Lepping Ln I heard

the roar of the crowd w hi ch           I took    to be kick off an d M/e were           nearly

at Lepping Ln turnstiles.               It was    further   two to three minutes after

this    that we a r ri v e d at the Lepp in g Ln gates.             All    I could see from

the Leppi n gs Ln gates was the tunnel              and no fans to be seen and about

thirty police officers*               The serial    I M/as w it h remained at         the gates
                                                                                                 PAGE            5


entrance       for about        five minutes*         There M*ere only about           three

officers       out of the fifty of us w it h radios.                      We were trying to

listen to them but                c o u l d n ’t hear anything.



A n officer did go to the tunnel                  entrance       I am     unable to say whether             he

M*as a sergeant            or a PC but he b ec koned towards              us an d ten of us

f ol lo we d him.           Whi ls t enroute     to the tunnel          a ma n came out of the

tunnel who was o bv i ou s ly            in a very d is tr e ss e d con di ti on and having

d if fi c ul t y   in breathing and a p p e ar e d to be           in shock.         He was     in his

late twenties*               I helped him out of the gates                I d i d n ’t see any

injuries       to this ma n he sat down by the gates                     leaning against the

M/all*        I a s ke d him       if he was alright an d he said yes*                 So    I wa lk ed

back     towards         the tunnel     and numerous     police officers were going                  into

the tunnel at             this time.         I also some more fans          coming     out the tunnel

I had a good view of the tunnel.                      I must add          here that this        is    the

tunnel      to the        N or th S t an d and West    S ta nd    corner.      At this time          I was

a p p r o a c h e d by    a n ot he r two fans who were a s si st in g anot he r       fan

who a p p ea r ed to be           in worse    c ondition to the first          I had a tt en de d

to*       This     fan was still         br ea th a n d was   placed      in the   recovery

position*           He seemed to be alri gh t           I then noticed the first ma n whom

I had a s s i s t e d he was         leaning    back an d     I could see a        line of blood

from under his             chin dow n his neck he d i d n ’t appear            in immediate

a ss is t an c e so       I carried on back       into the football          ground*



I gained access             to the     pitch I could see about twenty               people    lying on

the    pitch who          had their faces       covered over an d a p p e a r e d to be dead*

I noticed one             young    lad ag e d about    14 years      I c o u l d n ’t see any

injuries       to the bodies.              I then went      to front of pen four with

Inspector D E W ES and             I a s s i st e d Mr D EWES to pull a person who a pp ea r ed

to have died from out of                 pen four through a break            in the MJire this man
                                                                                              PAGE          6


was    in his     late twenties w it h a mo us ta ch e an d S a nd y            coloured straight

short       hair he was well       built,       he was wearing        jeans and a shirt he had

vomit on him*           He was     put on a bill           board wit h the help of some fans

and we       conveyed this       person to the           corner   by the S p i o n Kop and the

North Stand        I left    them by the gate an d returned back to terraces at

L epp i n g Ln»      On my arrival          the fire       brigade    had a r ri ve d and were

giving      ox y ge n to people*          I also saw that a further             ten bodies had

appeared,       their faces were          not    covered and nobody was att en di ng to

them*         I then a s s is t ed a fan who had injured his                 leg a n d got him     in a

c omfortable       position,      it a p p e a r e d    it may have been broken*            I a sked

him if he wan t e d to get           to hospital and he said             ’Mo,   h e ’d miss his      bus

ho m e ’*     There was also an amb ul an ce               on the    pitch and lots of fire me n

w it h o;<ygen a dm in i st e ri n g    it to the         people who    required    it*



I then went to girl who a p p e ar e d to be in her early twenties                          her hair

was    dark brown wit h a wave to               it,    shoulder     length    wearing     blue jeans

and trainers a 9T ’ shirt w h i ch had                    been pulled up to cover          her head.

I a d j u s t e d her jeans      to cover her s t om ac h up.            She had become

s li gh t ly exposed,       she was     then t r an sp or te d away by three         fans on a

bill    board*       F ro m there on there was general                 con fu si on w it h minor

scuffles taking         place     in various           places*      I also   noticed the smell         of

stale       lager around*



I   left the ground at about 4 * 15pm                   (1615)    and protected about 20 bodies

from the view of the             public a n d as the fans M*ere leaving the ground

they were       throwing     insults and abuse at us*                  I then went to the N orth

S t a n d at about 5 . 0 0 p m    (1700)     for a        d ebriefing an d went     off duty at

about 5. 4 5 p m    (1745)    the same day.

              On S a t u rd a y   15th April    1989    (150489)        I went    to the football m a tc h at

              H i l l s b o r o u g h betw ee n L iv er pool & N o t t i n g h a m Forest.      It was an FA Cup

              Semi-final,           I am a L iverpool      supporter an d a season ticket holder,                         I

                 o bt ained my ticket       from A n e f ie l d and it was a            14.00 N o r th S tand

              seating ticket,

              I t r av el le d to the m at ch by coach,            wit h Helms of E a st h am together with



              We tra ve ll ed straight to Sheffield,                   there were     no delays,       we arri ve d

              at S h e f f i el d at about     12 n o o n , (1200)

              We then went to a pub for a drink,                   I    cannot    remember the name of            the

              pub but     it was a good twen ty minu te s               walk from the ground,

              I left the          pub wit h a g roup of others at about               2 .1 5   pm (1415) and

              wa lk e d to the ground.          On a rr iv i ng    there at a r o u nd 2,45 pm           (1445)
                                                                                                                       PAGE         5


there M/as just a mass                  of people,             there were no queues*.                   I cannot           recall

 seeing any Police               officers or s te wards at the turns ti le s a lt ho u gh                                      I

did not      pay too m uc h attention,                     I M/as more           con ce rn ed        in reaching a

turnstile and gaining                   entry to the ground.                      W he n    I e ve nt ua ll y m an a ge d

to do M,'ith d if fi c ul t y due to the                       large mass of people,                    I ente re d via a

t urnstile and s ur r en d er e d my ticket to the operator.                                          I never saw any

u n au t ho r is e d entry       into the ground neither did                            I see any gates being

opened.

Once    inside the ground,                   I then had to ask a stew a r d w h i c h way to go,

this M/as due to the                lack of d i r e c t i o n signs M,<ithin the stadium

indicating         the various           viewing          locations.

I never saw an y disorder,                     fighting or drunke nn es s at this time either*.

I event u a l l y took up my m at ch viewing                             position and            1450 hours           I was

not sub j e c t e d to any             crush.        I M/as seated             in the front of the N or th

S t a n d near to the           centre        line and was with                                         and s e v e r a l

other memb e r s         of our        parties,       hoM/ever,

had s t i l l    not     t a k e n up t h e i r      v i e M/ i n g    positions.           The      last     time     I saw

t h e m M/as i n     the     pub-       The tM/o o f           them a r e      usually          al M/ ays t h e    last      to

leave.There          was a g o o d a t m o s p h e r e          all      round,     and I d i d         not     see

anything        untoM/ard h a p p e n i n g a l t h o u g h            I did     not    notice        the     central        pens

at   t h e L e p p i n g s Ln e n d o f        the     ground appeared to                   be     incredibly          fu ll.

Just    after      the     teams k ic k e d         off    I noticed           that     a feM/ f a n s a t         the

L e p p i n g s Ln w e r e    climbing         over       the    perimeter          fencing         and

congregating           behind the            goal    area,            I also     saM/ f a n s      being      p u l l e d up

out of     the     terracing           and i n t o     the      We s t S t a n d s e a t i n g      area.         I did      not

realise      that      people       /e r e
                                    m         being       injured         I thought         it     M/as t h e     fans      being

stupid.         My a t t e n t i o n    returned          to    the      game,    for      a few m in u tes           but

shortly after            this    the     people        behind the            goal      /e r e
                                                                                       m         increasing           in

had gone to the Leppi ng s Ln end of the ground,                         who had been d ela ye d

for some    reason or other.             I could see from the amount of fans                        behind

the goal    that    the sit ua ti on was more than just a pitch invasion,

At this    point Police officers               ente r ed the S t a d i u m from our          left and

lined up d i r e ct ly     in front of the N or th stand facing us,                       I could now

see fans being          carried    past the stand on m a ke sh if t stret ch er s and

that    their faces M/ere covered over.                  These     bodies M/ere being          carried

by other suppo rt er s and due to this the                      people    in the stand started

to shout abuse at the Pol ic e                intimating they should make an effort

to assist    in some way*           This      carried on for what a pp ea r ed to be a few

minu t e s and           suddenly jumped from            in front of the stand on to the

pitch,    pulled off an ad ve rt is in g            hoarding and ran off to see                if he

could assist.           On seeing      this    I q u ic kl y f ol lowed a n d we        ran over

towards the       penalty area of L ep pi n gs Ln where                  I saw a m an of about S ’?

tall,    white    in colour,      he    w o ul d be 25 - 27 years of age,               wit h a pale

comp l e x i o n and very thin,         his hair was f a i r / g in g er i sh w or n to neck

length an d very wavy.            He    was w ea ri ng loose fitting             blue    jeans a n d had

on a beige T shirt wit h a              collar.      He was unconscious.                     Iand    I with

some other       fans    placed him on a stretcher an d took him to the first

aid    post under the N o r th stand.               I remained w it h him and                   iho by

now was a t te mp t in g    to    rescusitate him by giving m o u th to mouth,                        I

cannot give any further             in fo rm at io n as I felt tota ll y overcome at what

I was w it n e ss in g an d      I left to      return to my seat              in the stand where              I

remained until          I heard the Police           anno un ce me nt     informing us the game

was o f f i c i a l ly abandoned,

I did not suffer any             injury at the game nor did I                   attend hospital           in

Sheffield,       I did not witn es s          the   barrier     break     in    pen 3, the      pens were

too    crowded to notice          this occurring.

I did not witness a ny th in g w hi ch              I w ou ld    consider       c onstitued a

criminal    offence.

             My views an d observations         on the way the      incident was h a nd le d after

             the game was stopped are that            I feel the Police were       initially badly

             deployed       in front of the N o r t h stand M/hen they w ou ld have been of more

             use helping wit h the dead,          injured,   elsewhere    in the ground.        Once

             they    realised the s ev erity of the tragedy they w o r k ed to the best of

             their    ability.

             I also feel       there was a lack of o r ga n is a ti o n by the E m er ge nc y

             Services,      a lack of medical      equipment    in the ground an d a total         lack

             of s tewarding w i th i n the entire       complex.

               I am a n officer        in the S o u t h Y o rk sh ir e Police,        cur re nt ly s t at io ne d at

               E c c l e s f i e l d Police Station.

               O n April     15th 1989 I a t t e n d e d the H i l l s b o r o u g h Football      S t ad i um to

               work at the semi          final    for the F.A C up between L iverpool and

               N o t t i n g h a m Forest.     I a tt en d ed the briefing at about            10 am and was          in

               serial    18 w hi ch was going         to be responsible for searching                 the

               L iv erpool      s upporters who were at the L ep pi ng s Lane End of the ground.

               At about      ten past eleven we went          to stand on the turnstiles                    ready to

               sea rc h the fans.            I was stood w it h P C 4 3 K ir by on the third turnstile

               along a nd w ai t ed for people          coming    that were going           into the West

               Stand.      At first there was a very steady stream of                       people    coming     to

               the ground*         It was m a in l y families at this time w it h quite a few

               young    children and also elde rl y          people.           As the fans a pp ro a ch e d the
                                                                                           PAGE            2


tu rnstiles we checked the tickets,                a lot of people were unsure of

where    they were       going and    I gave them the d irections as to where                   they

needed to go*           I star te d searching       the fans who seemed to be in a

jovial m oo d     in a n t i c i p at i on of the match,     most of them at this stage

were good h um ou re d an d had a         laugh an d a joke w ith us,         they were

queuing     quite s en sibly and there d i d n ’t appear to be any problems*                          We

were g iven a large         plastic dust       bin to put a n y property        in w hi ch we

confiscation.           I took a screwd ri ve r      off of one young        lad who said he

was a n electrician.            I also took a large banner from anot he r young

lad.     We also       c onfiscated quite a lot of cans but             it was m ai nl y    pop,

not    beer.    We     continued searching        in this ma nn er until about half                 past

two whe n      it began to get more         crowded.       As the   crowd increased        it

began more difficult            to se ar ch people a l t ho u gh I did try.        I saw a

couple    of people       (lads of about twenty)           get   in w it ho ut ticket    by one

person handing his ticket             in at the turnstile a n d someone else               bobbing

down behind him and they both went thro ug h at the same time w he n the

trunstile opened.

At this time         I was too    cramped to a ct ua ll y get to them to do anything

about    it.

F ro m about twenty to three the             crowd of      people se em ed to increase              even

more until       it was    just a solid mass of people.              I got   pushed away from

the tur n s t i le and became        sort of w e dg e d against the w a l 1.       People

began to panic a n d one w om an became hysterical                  screaming    because        she

c o u l d n ’t move.    Small    c hi ldren were     getting     lifted above    peoples        heads

because they were getting             t r a m pl e d on.   So they were just      passed

over    the turnstile.          I can remember       seeing a couple of old me n who

were    so drunk they could ha rd ly s tand up a n d I noti ce d that a                  lot of

the    lads had been drinking          because      I could smell      it on their      breath.

T h e y d i d n ’t seem to care who they were squashing at the turnstiles

t hey were      just    intent on getting        into the ground.        After a while          I
lost sight          of most of the other P C ’S on my serial a n d was                just w e d g e d

agai ns t the wall,          the   pressure against me was tremendous,                so m uc h that

I could feel my sternum bending an d                      it was a struggle       to breath*

I could breath in but not out,                   and just     could not move at all*

Pe op le were        beginning     to get a n g r y about      the crush an d were swearing

at me saying someone was going to get killed out there,                             there was

nothing       I could do because           I was       just as s qu ashed as they were,            I

h a d n ’t got a radio and so             c o u l d n ’t communicate w it h anyone so         it was

just a case of          looking a fter yourself*              People were     very f ri gh t en e d in

the    crush and were         panicked      into       pushing even more to try and get out*

S om e h o w one of the other P C ’S g r ab be d me a n d pushed me thro ug h the

t urnstile to get out of the                crush*        I looked at my w a tc h w hen I got to

the other side an d           it was about 3 or 4 minutes               past three*        I d i d n ’t

know whether          the teams had kicked off or not*                  I spoke to an       inspector

on the other side of the t urnstiles an d told him M.*hat it was                            like on

the outside*           He   realised the s i tu at io n but there was nothing he

could really do about              it*     P eo p le    coming through the turnstiles              were

still       shouting about the           crush and children were still             being    passed

over we stood on this side of the turnstiles                          for about    five or siK

minutes*        People were        coming up to us asking where              to go,   they had

come thro ug h the West S ta nd t ur nstile M/ith red tickets M>hich I think

were    for the L ep pings Lane            end standing       part*     After a few minutes

Inspector Sykes opened the                 right       hand side gate to let us back out

onto    the turnstile         side and the crowd has more               or   less completely

vanished*           There were just a f e w stragglers             left at the t urnstiles a nd

I a c tu a ll y s e a r c h e d two more    people*        I then heard someone       say we were

w an t ed    inside the ground a n d e ve ryone             started running*        I jumped over

one of the t urnstiles and f ol lo w ed everyone                   else and went

onto the       pitch halfM/ay doM/n on the right hand side*                    At first       it

looked       like    it was a pitch invasion but as               I got closer to
                                                                                                    PAGE      4


the fences        I could see that       people were       being    crushed.       The West           stand

crowd were very noisy and were              shouting       ’Sh it ty G r o u n d . 5      I stood      in

front    of the wire at the           centre of the pitch a n d there was just a

deat hl y silence.          There were    three faces       I can remember seeing                   pushed

right up to the w i r e ,       a girl    had her face          pushed sideways          up to       it,

her eyes were          closed and she was        blue,    her    lips were     nearly black and

she was d ef i na te ly dead.          I can't    remember m uc h about         the middle

person but next there was a boy who                  looked about        twleve,        the    person

behind him had been sick on his head.                     I can remember another

P o l i c e w o m a n stood behind me and she was          looking     into the         pen saying

’Shes dead        , h e ’s d e a d ’ etc an d just   picking       them out.           I c a n ’t

remember a ny thing else about            looking     into the pen*          There were some

officers       pulling    people over     the fences a n d trying to rip them down.

At first       I helped a few people that had w al k ed out to sit on the                             pitch

because    they w e r e     really d azed a n d confused.           I then saw P C Ki r b y have

a boy handed to him who was u nc on scious so I f ol lo we d him*                             We went to

the    corner of the pitch.           He w a s n ’t breathing       so Neil     gave him m ou th

to m o u th and I gave him cardiac massage.                     I d o n ’t know really how long

it was    before he started to breath on his own,                    but once he had

s ta rt ed to P C Ki rb y    left me w i t h him.        The boy was about twelve                   very

small an d slim with blonde wav y hair he was wear in g                      jeans an d a

L iv erpool      top the only thing he had on him was a ticket for the m at ch

in his    back     pocket.     I put him in the          recovery position an d stayed

wi t h him in case he stop pe d b reathing again.                   He was deeply

uncons ci ou s a n d d i d n ’t respond to my talking to him or punching his

ears to bring him round.               A Liverpool       fan came up to me and said "

H e r e ’s his    programme"    but    I told I d i d n ’t think h e ’d really want                   it

now.     Some     of the fans began       ripping down the w o od e n adverts from

a r ou n d the    pitch to use as stret ch er s a nd e ve nt u al l y theycame up to me

w i t h one.      We   put the boy on the        piece of woo d and ran w it h him over
                                                                                            PAGE


to the other          side of the g ro u nd by the gym where the a mb ul an ce s were.

The    board was very w ob b ly and           I felt as if my legs were going to give

way as       I was    running.      We Put    the boy on the floor          by a n a m bu la nc e an d

a doctor       came over to        look at him.        He stuck a sticker         on his back and

said he was a priority              patient an d should go as soon as              possible.

Another PC       came to sit        w it h me to make sure we were O.K,              I d o n t ’t know

M/ho it was though.             Whilst   I was   sat outside      the gym people kept

bringing more and more              bodies    round.     There was a middle aged scruffy

looking man M/ith long hair,                someone    had put an a i r w a y    in his m o ut h and

his fr i e n d was bashing his           chest and screaming at him but he was dead,

he d r ag ge d a feu1 more         people    to help him but       it w a s n ’t any use.      Tm.'o

p ol icemen brought another m an round who was dead,                     they placed him on

the floor an d his trousers              came down s li ghtly someone else threw a

coat    over his face and           I thought what an u n di gn if ie d way         it was to die

Pe op le kept filing         past me w ith dead bodies a n d I tried not to look                        I

c a n ’t remember       seeing anyone        else alive by the gym.             After some time

someone d e c i de d that        the boy could go in an a mb u la n ce           so I helped       put

him    in.     I d i d n ’t know    whet h e r to go wit h him or not soI stayed and

went    back out onto the           pitch w hi ch had cleared by now I saw a feu;

people wit h         injuries w a lk in g towards the a mb ul a nc e s to get

treatment.           By this time there was a line of P C ’S stood a long the

centre       of the    pitch.      I carried on walking towards             the other      end of

the field.           I h eard a PC ask ten officers           to go a n d s tand in the

centre       pen because     he said "People are           robbing the dead here."            So    I

M/ent in an d stood w ith some others.                  There w e r e all    sorts of property

s tr e wn around,       m ai n ly odd shoes and trainers that had come off                   in the

crush.       A scenes of        crimes   officers went       into the pen an d began to

take some       photos.      Some    of the fans must have thought he was a press

ma n a n d about a dozen ran over a n d tried to a tt ac k him.                    After   this     I

went    from the       centre    pen and out to the L ep pi ng s Lane            end of the

            the ground.        Most   of them      left quie tl y but a lot of    lads were making

            comments about       us killing        the fans an d getting overtime      for   it, also

            they d i d n ’t seem to       realise that we had been inside as w el l .W h il s t       I

                I am                             and I reside at

                                     Merseyside.

                I am a m ar r i e d man M/ith one d au ghter an d have              lived at the

                a f o r e m e n t i o n e d address for two years.      I am e mp lo ye d by __

                years«

                I am a Liverpool       supporter and have           been s up po rt in g this team on a

                regular    basis over the       last    two seasons,          visiting m a i n ly home games

                and the occasional       awa y game.       I usua ll y buy my tickets from the box

                office a n d sometimes      I*m g iven them by Reps.

                W h e n Liverpool    football    team q u al if ie d for the FA Cup Semi Final,                   to

                be played against N o t t i n g h a m Forest at H i ll s b o r o u g h football            ground      in

                Sheffield,       I decided to go and watch.
                                                                                                       PAGE        i



About    two weeks         prior    to the game/        I was    given a voucher         from a season

ticket holder and bought a ticket                      from A n fi e ld football        ground         in

Liverpool,,        The ticket        cost     6 . 0 0 an d was for the L ep pings Ln standing

area.

O n S a t u r d a y the    15th of April        1989    (150489)     about     1020 hours,         a

friend,                              from Chester,          came a r o u nd to my house as

prev i o u s l y a r ra n ge d and at       1030 hours I

                                                   a lso     came around.

He was driving a C i t r o e n BX and             it was      in that     car that we were to

travel     to the football           match.

We all     left at about           1035 hours and drove to E l le sm er e Port where we

had something         to eat after w h ic h at           1105 hours we         left to go to

S heffield.        Our     intention was to         leave early so as to be able to                         park

near the gr o u n d and have a wander around.                       We e s ti ma te d the time of

the journey on our              previous visit to the ground hashing taken about one

and a half hours.

We t r a ve l l e d towards Manchester,             I ’m not sure what          roads we tra ve ll ed

on.     I know we stopped near M an ch e st e r               for a p p r o x i m a t e l y fifte en

m i nu t es as the        car had o ve rh e at e d and needed water.

On the M63 we e xp e ri e nc e d delays of about                  half an hour as a result                    of

road works and sheer               volume    of traffic and before S h e f f i el d we also

e x p e r i e n c e d similar   delays.       The whole j o ur ne y took a p p r o x i m at e ly

three     hours.      On the way to the ground,                 I d i d n ’t see any other

supporters         drinking whilst          trave l li ng    by car.

We a r r i v e d   in S h e f f i e l d a ro u nd 1400 hours and were           not sure of where

we M/ere or where we could              park,     so we      parked where we could an d we

knew we were         near the ground,           as we    could see supporters moving                    in one

direction.

As    it turned out we were            only ten minutes           from the ground.            We       parked

the car and wa l k e d to the ground.                   We d i d n ’t see a n y Pol ic e escorts
                                                                                         PAGE      3


or     receive an y dir ec ti on but        it was quite obvious where we had to go

by f o llowing         everyone    else on the way to the ground*

I d i d n ’t see any fighting or disorder               but    did see a few of the fans

drinking        cans    of beer.     We d i d n ’t stop on     the w ay to the ground and

a r r i v e d there about      1415 hours.

As we w a l k e d      into L ep pings Lane from the River D on side             I could see a

mass of people stood              in front of the gates        to    the turnstiles of    the

terraces        entrance.     This went      right up to       the t urnstiles    itself and

the gates        in front    of those t urnstiles were open.

I c o u l d n ’t see the entrances          to the seating area.

In the L e ppings Ln         itself     I remember     there   being quite a f e w Police

vehicles        parked there and a couple of Police O f f ic e rs stood there,

further     ar o u n d near the terrace           turnstiles were several more Police

O f f i c e r s who were standing there.             They d i d n ’t seem to be doing

a n y t h i n g just    standing.

I received no Police              d i r e c t i o n at this stage and could see no

steM/ards. T here were t wo m o u n t e d Police O f ficers             in that a r e a as well.

All     three    of us went down the side of what              I now know to be the

terrace     turnstiles,        parallel    with the River Don.          We were trying to

find our way           in and a void the     crowd.     As we went      down the side of the

g round we       came to a metal        type fence,     the type e r ec te d by the Police

a nd by this were           about    eight or nine Police Officers.

T hey e n q u i r e d what we were doing and gave us d ir ec ti on s to the correct

t urnstiles.           We turned a r ou n d and joined the          crowd at this stage.

          went    off to join the queue at            the West S t an d seating    turnstile

a nd                who d i d n ’t have a ticket and had hoped to buy one outside

the ground,         decided not to bother a n d wait until              later.

I joined the mass of              people   just    inside the gates      in front of the

terrace     turnstiles alone a n d was             pushed forward.      The crowd s eemed

quite     jovial       and as the    crowd grew pressure        star te d to increase and
                                                                                               PAGE      4


people's m oo d started to change.

The Police O ff ic er s       seemed unable to control               the situation.       One

Offi ce r M/as stood on top of the turnstiles                      shouting    to stop pushing

and form queues           but that went unheard,              mainly.     The m o un te d Officers

M/ere more of a hindrance,             causing      people to surge an d then push

thems e l v e s   out of the M/ay.

I made my way towards            the turns ti le s and saw several                supporters    trying

to climb the gate to my              left an d to the          right of the West S tand

s eating turnstiles,          also    several      fans were       climbing    the wall   directly

over the turnstiles*             I didn't      see a n y of the gates open,            nor M/ere

they a l r e a d y opened.

I M/as almost       pushed thro u g h the turnstile and had to almost t hrow my

ticket     to the man at the          turnstile.

Once    thro u g h the turnstile        the area           i mmediately after a pp ea r ed quite

e mpty an d had a calm feeling after having                      been crushed       in the outside

crowd.      There were several          P o l i c e ma n    in that area and I believe          I saw

a couple of stewards.             I wasn't       s ea rched upon entering           the ground.

To the     left was an opening          in the wall and further               down a small      fenced

e nc losure made      by portable fences M/here programmes M/ere being                        sold,     I

went    over and bought a programme and stood                      in that area for a few

minutes,      catching my breath a n d reading                 the programme.

I then went to the entrance               of the tunnel.            I couldn't      see any

P olice    officers at       that entrance         or Stewards.         The tunnel     had people

inside,     some just standing and talking,                    others walk i ng down.         It was

quite     clear    though an d    I had a free             passage a long   it.

I w o u l d guess the time then to be about                    1450-55.

This M/as partly the          reason    I came down the tunnel as                 I couldn't    find

any signs to direct me e lsewhere and the m a t ch was due to start.

During     this    time    I didn't    see an y drinking           going on in the gr ou nd or

any fighting        or general       disorder.

On entering             the    pen a re a I went       into pen a rea three an d a l t h o u g h           it

was full         there still           seemed to be a reasonable amount of                      room,     In

fact    I w ou l d describe             it as having e l b o w        room,        I found a standing

position with ou t too m uc h d if fi c ul t y near the exit to the tunnel                                 and

the fence dividing                   pens three and four.

It was very close to kick off time as the                              players were M/ell into their

w a r m up whe n the            pressure      from behind started to                increase.

I w o u l d n ’t describe             it as a surge,         rather an       increase     in pressure          over

a short amount of time.                      I was forced down and to the                 right and was

a lmost      stumbling until             I M;as just     in front of the             last barrier

Section.           My    position kept         changing as there seemed to be surges of

people *

I believe a barrier was broken near to me but at the time                                        I was

unaware of this„                    As the   pressure    increased people started screaming

and shouts          came from          in front of me that            people were dead,

I M/as h a v i n g       problems       breathing,      being    crushed.          My   left   hand was        up

and    holding          onto    a barrier      leg,    the    other    was    pinned     to m y side.

To my right             side about       four metres away,            I saM/ a boy a g e d about          13-14

years.        He only looked a small                  lad but he seemed quite              high off the

g r o u n d as     if he M/as t rap p e d betM/een tM/o people.                    He   had brown

coloured hair,                cut    in a normal      short    style.        I can remember        he had a

short     slee v e d sweatshirt              on M/ith a logo on the front.                 The    shirt M/as a

broMm m u s t a r d       colour.        I saw his face Mias a deep purple                     colour and he

looked as          if he had been sick out of the side of his mouth.

I saMj him get            pushed forw a r d and sucked down                  into the     crowd.

Above me         people,        m a i n l y children,    M/ere   being thrown down an d passed

over.        All    of these either            looked unconscious             or dead.

At this       time       I was       by the barrier an d to my           left       I could see a young

lad in his teens w i t h m ou s ey               coloured hair.              His    head was     pushed up

agai n s t    the barrier almost as                if he had tried to get under the barrier
                                                                                                PAGE    6


but had been trapped*

P eople were         pushed up against            him and I could only see his face and

neck.          His face was     covered w ith blood and I could see he was trying

to push back but his              head kept being forced agai ns t the barrier.

Other     people were trying            to resist      being    pushed up agai ns t the barrier

but as the          crush increased they were               pushed up agai ns t     it..    I was

being     crushed an d felt d izzy a n d sick an d al mo st                being forced

d ownwards w it h people on my back*

People a r o u nd me w e r e       beginning       to sink under but there M/as nothing

you    could do to help.

I remember          seeing    people    climbing      the front      perimeter    fence and at one

time     I M/as pushed sideways a n d              could see    people being      pulled up into

the seated are a above.

The    pressure        then seemed to slowly stop and there was more                       room.

I made my way out             in a daze an d        into the tunnel where         I helped three

other     s upporters        carry their mate         out    into the area of the turnstiles.

He a p p e a r e d u nconscious an d once            in the turnstile a re a        received first

a id from someone and came around.                     Outs id e     in the turnstile area          I

began to feel           sick an d d izzy an d        I M/as h elped to an a m bu la nc e M/here I

received oxygen and after a while                     I recovered.

I went         back to a p r e - a rr an g ed meet in g      place   in L ep pings Ln but

couldn't         find my friends.          I then spent the next hour w an derin g ar ou nd

the a r e a      loooking for my friends an d each time                  I r evisited the stand a

P olice        cordon was being formed so event ua ll y                I was unable to get back

into the ground.

All    the time        bodies were      being      brought out.

At    1700 hours        I e v e n tu a ll y met    up w it h my friends      at the pre- ar ra ng ed

m e et i n g    place and we drove         home.

On M o n d a y     17th of April       1989   (170489)       I was    still exp e ri en ci ng   pains

in the         chest area and

                                           I give my p ermission for the Police   to

plenty of time to spare.                T here was a Police Offi c e r a s s i g n e d to my

t u rnstile        on the ground side and one to the front             on the outside         of

the ground.           Also on the ground side there were five or six policeman

s ea rc h i n g the fans,       there were also three        stewards who     I could see

through m y window,            they were als o     inside the ground,       I can say that

from m i d da y to about         14.15hrs    I had what     I w o u l d call a nice    steady

flow of fans          coming    through my t u r nstile and was      not   crushed at        all

and I can say the same for the                  police,   and the fans were       polite and       in

good humour up to this             point.

The    rush then started to build up and up until 2 . 3 0 p m it became very

busy w h i c h      is what we e x p e ct ed for this type of game,         and    real good

flow of fans          going t hr o u g h my turnstile,      and the turnstile       had w o r k e d

fine up until          this time.

From     14.3Qhrs      onwards    it became      very hectic,   and as the fans were

coming t hr o u g h they were saying they were being                crushed from outside

and the o pe ra t i o n of the t u rnstile          became very difficult.         About      this

time due to the amount             of   people    trying to get    thro u g h the gate

tota l l y jammed and at this the fans               climbed over the turnstile gate

some of the fans were showing                their tickets as      they jumped over others

were     throwing      their    tickets at me and others         I pressume    h a d n ’t got any

tickets.           There was    nothing   I could do about      it all because        they just

could not go back due to the                pressure of people trying         to get    in.

A lt h o u g h    I do not know that      the    police did put out     some of the fans

who    h a d n ’t got any ticket.         I can only describe       the sit u a t i o n at this
                                                                                                                     PAGE         3


time as total a n d utter                    pandimonium,             and I was          f r i g h t e n e d for my own

safety at this              time as I had visions                     of the entire             turnstile

collapsing a n d being                buried under             the     rubble.           This went       on until

about       'i5.05hrs whe n         it s u d d e n l y se e m e d to stop,                and there was only

the odd one or t wo fans                     coming t h r o u g h I did see thro u g h the                      corner of

my eye the fans all                 going towards               ’C ’ gate      but at that time                I was       n ’t

aware       it M/as open,          an d    it d i d n ’t really             register wit h me thats M/here

they M/ere going.

It was after              that a police           officer        came and told us to close up he

seemed calm to me M/hen he told us to do that and that was at a r o u n d

15.05hrs.            I did as I was             told and         locked the doors and put the                         chain

and    locks        on the turnstile              I then bagged my tickets                      up and put my

label       inside and outside,                 and any m o n e y taken sh o u l d also go                      into the

bag,        I never        put a n y m one y        in my ba'tsk,           A l t h o u g h some at          least    one

ten pound had been thrown at me during                                  the    crush thro u g h my turnstile

but    I d o n ’t knoM/ what              h a p p e n e d to    it.

As far as           I am aware        no one        came to take the turnstile                         readings whilst

I was       there.        There M/as only L i verpool                   tickets          that    came thro u g h my

turnstiles.

I was       then     standing       listening          t o my r a d i o whe n I h e a r d t h a t              the    match

had b ee n d e l a y e d and a t             that    time       I thought          there      had b ee n a p i t c h

invasion        a n d I had no i d e a w h a t wa s               going       on at t h a t          stage.     It w o u l d

be a b o u t    15,20hrs          that     I saw p e o p l e      carrying          people      f r o m t h e West

terrace        tunnel,       M/ho at t h a t        time       I thought       were i n j u r e d       persons       I only

saw two or           three     being       carried       out     and t h e     fans       we r e c o m i n g b a c k o u t

of    the    tunnel        in great        numbers.

T h e r e we r e t h r e e    stewards          M/ho t h e n     came o v e r       to    the   turnstiles           and

told    us t h a t        there    M/ere t h r e e     people         dead*    and       it   M/as    then    that    we

started        to   appreciate            M/hat was      going        on,     It    wa s a t    this     time    that

       ,     supporters an d we were f r i gh t e n e d to leave the turnstiles.                     We all

             thats all        the turnstile a tt e n d a n t s    got together we took our badges                      off

             so that we w o u l d n ”t be recognised,              We   left    the t u rnstile   by the

             front     to walk     back to the S o u t h Stand on the outside             of the

             ground,         It was whilst     I was   passing a gate that            I saw a white man

             aged about fourty          carrying a white man aged about                twenty slim build

             w ear i n g    blue jeans.     He was stru g g l i n g     to carry this y o u t h an d         I

             helped this man w i th the y o u t h who             to me a p p e a r e d to be dead.          We

             laid him down his arms an d             legs were straight           but they were      so

             stiff as a board,          and he was     covered over w i t h a coat.            There were

             three others        there as well      two of whom a p p e a r e d to be injured and the

             other who a p p e a r e d to be dead.               I then carried on to the office                  to

             the S o u t h S t a n d Office and handed my bag             in*

             I then went        to the stand area between the S p i o n Kop and the S o u t h

               I reside at the above address,                 together with my wife and daughter.

               On Saturday      15th April      1989    (150489),        I tra v e l l e d to Sheffield,

               together M/ith brother D av i d S t e v e n BROWN.              We t r a v e l l e d    in my own

               motor   car.     We    intended to go to H i l l s b o r o u g h Football              S t a d i u m to

               w atch the FA Cup Semi- F i n a l        b e t w e e n Liverpool a n d N o t t i n g h a m Forest,

               We both had tickets for the game                  to stand up in the L e p pings Ln End

               of the ground.          We arrived at the football              ground at 2 , 1 5 pm (1415)

               and went    into the ground via the t urnstiles at the L e p pings Ln end,

               where we handed our tickets              in.

               We went and stood direc t l y behind the goal                   near the middle              of the

               terracing.

               There was a lot of pushing about a r o un d about kick                       off time and             I got

               sep a r a t e d from Steven.      I did not see him a g a i n after               this.         There
                                                                                                PAGE        2


was a large       surge    in the      crou/d an d    I got       pushed to near the front           of

the terracing.       There was a number              of    people b adly hurt.          I saw an

opening appear       behind me a n d        I got out an d went              off the terrace to

the back of the stand.              I had a look out for S t e v e n               but I could not

trace    him,

I hung a r o un d for half an hour            then I went to where                 I ’d left my car,

but S t ev en h a d n ’t returned.          I returned to the ground a few times                     but

could not       locate him.

I reported my brother missing                to a policeman at               the ground and he

told me to go to report             it to the Police              room.

As a result of this          I a t t e nd ed at the Sports Hall at the football

stad i u m at 2 , 1 5 a m S u n da y    16th April         1989    (160489).        There   I picked

out   phot o g r a p h number    10.

I was    then shoM/n the body of a m a n who m                I iden t i f i e d as being my

brother D avid S t e ve n B RO WN born 2 9 . 9 , 6 3          (29091963)          in _________ home

            I am a Police C o n stable                  in the S o u t h Yor k s h i r e Police     presently

            s t a t i o n e d at A t t e r c l i f f e Police Station,           Sheffield.

            On S a t u r d a y   15 April         1989    (150489)        I was on duty at At t e r c l i f f e

            an d my duties were that of S u b - D i v i s i o n a l                response    car driver.         My

            observer        on that day was P C __________

            A bout 2 , 3 0 pm (1430)              that    day PC            and myself were wi t h i n

            A t t e r c l i f f e Police S t a t i on on a refreshment                break and     I was aware         of

            crowd problems at H i l l s b o r o u g h football                  stadium where a football

            m a t c h was     taking     place betw e e n Liverpool               football    club and N o t t i n g h a m

            Forest     football        club.

            At 3 . 4 0 pm (1540)           that day we           resumed patrol and were            immediately

            d i r ected by Force Opera t i o n s                room to H i l l s b o r o u g h Stadium,
                                                                                                  PAGE


We a rr i v e d at H il l s b o r o u g h at 3 .45     pm    (1545)    where    I saw Pen i s t o n e Rd

was heav i l y       congested w i th pedestrians,              but m a i n l y eme r g e n c y service

vehicles a n d various              personnel    from such vehicles.

We entered the access                gate to the stadium towards               the    police   room and

g y mn a s i u m   past   the entrance       to the    pitch,       A large number of police

officers M/ere at t ending             prostrate      bodies,     man y of w h i c h were dead.

On one o c c a si on        I saw a Po lice Offi c e r        physi c a l l y dragging a senior

a m b u l a n c e m a n away from his vehicle          shouting,       ' H e ’s still alive,       he's

still alive,          he's    breathing,      honest,'

PC           and myself       continued to the gymnasium and were obliged to step

over a number of dead bodies.

Inside       the gym n a s i u m    I spoke to S up e r i n t e n d e n t Bates who d i r ected us

to gather as m any Police Officers                    as    possible u/ho were not g a i nfully

e m p loyed at that time M/ith a view to one Police Offi c e r                          taking

custody of one dead body.

We   returned outside              on the soccer      pitch.      Separately         I informed

approximately             10 Police Officers       to consult w ith S u p e r i n t e n d e n t Bates

in the gymnasium.

At 3 . 55 pm (1555)           I returned      into the g y m n a s i u m where        I took

             DETECTIVE         INSPECTOR C HA R L E S - Ci CID

             Prior      to the m at c h    I was   in charge    of £ serials       policing     the arrival

             of     coaches     containing N o t t i n g h a m Forest   fans at   the Herries R o a d bus

              depot.      All    of these fans were        in a jovial     mood and we ex p e r i e n c e d no

              problems w ith them.

             About 2.5 0 p.m.          I heard a number of        radio m e s s a g e s over my personal

              radio     re crowds      of Liverpool     supporters a r r i v i n g at Leppings Lane

              causing      crowd    control   problems.      I recall     quite    clearly an officer - I

             d o n ’t know who - requesting           that   ’a g a t e ’ be opened to a l l o w       pressure

              on the t urnstiles          to be a l 1evi ated as    peo pie we re be i ng c r u s h e d .

             There were several            short   exchanges    regarding    this an d then        I recall a

              direct     i nstruction being        passed for     ’the gates      to be opened."

             F o l lo wi n g   this,   radio mess ages    continued      to indicate     that    there were
                                                                                                PAGE        2


still    crowd control         problems at      the Leppings Lane area.

At 3,0 0    p.m.       in line w i th the     instructions      contained      in the

operational        order,     I started off w ith my two serials               towards

C l a yw he el s Lane where we were to get a hot meal.                     As we    reached

N i a g a r a Sports G r o u nd   I r e a lised that     something was        ’going o f f ’ in the

g round as      I could hear the           control   directing     stan d b y serials      in the

gym to the West Stand,

In view of this           I gathered       my 2 serials     and 3 or 4 others that were

also making        their M.*ay to Clayw h e e l s Lane an d d i r e c t e d them to foliow

me to L e p pings Lane,           There were 2 other         Inspectors there,          one of w hom

was De t e c t i v e    Inspector Meek who       ran on a h e a d to see       if he could find

out what we        could do to assist.           As we a p p r o a c h e d Leppi n g s Lane

turnstiles       I could see a crowd g a t h e r e d there M,*hich a p p e a r e d on my

r e c o l l ec ti on to be b o r d e r e d / co nt a i n e d by Police   officers,       I halted

the serials at Vere Road a n d               told the S e rgeants        to get their serials

lined up w h i ch they did - De t e c t i v e         Inspector Meek        had still      not

appeared,        I waited for a break           in the radio traffic and reported my

position and strength to the                 controller and        requested directions/

inst ruct i o n s .

I was    i mmediately       instruct ed to get my men           into the West S tand and

clear    it as     people were being          crushed to d eath at the front,               I

s h o u t e d the n e cessary orders and set off             running towards the

turnstiles       f o l lowed by the me n from the serials                that were with me,

We enter ed the ground,            to the best of my         r e c o l l e c t i o n via a gate>

w h i c h was open and        located on the right of the turnstiles.                    A g a i n to

the best of my rec o l l e c t i o n the gate was undestructed,                    we   continued

running     s l i ghtly uphill and entered the              stand via      a tunnel.      As we

e nte r e d the tunnel        a party      of s upporters   came    out    carrying a body - it

was a male       but     I d o n ’t know    if it was     alive or dead,        The tunnel         had

people     in it but to the best of my rec o l l e c t i o n             it w a s n ’t packed.         At
                                                                                                     PAGE


the end of the tunnel           it was      split    by a fence and          I ran down to the

left,    I recall     that the        crowd Mias tightly       packed and I started                  pulling

people    back and yelling at            them to clear       the stand*

I made my way to the front               of the     croM.id which was        tightly        packed,

yelling    at the spectators            to clear the stand,              I could hear other

officers     behind me doing the same               thing.     As   I got to the front,                   the

press    of the crowd d i m i n is h e d an d a space a p p e a r e d          in front           of me-        I

could see a pile of bodies against                   the wall,      my    rec o l l e c t i o n    is that

they    looked as     if they had been piled on top of one another                                like

bricks.      I ’m not sure      how many there were            probably 7 to            10.        The faces

of the bodies       that    I could see were          purple and mottled,               they looked to

me as    if they were a lr e a d y dead.

There was an officer on the fence kicking at                        it and       I think he was

jo i n e d by another.       I d o n ’t recall       how but    I realise they were trying

to get    the fence open so that we               could get     the dead an d           injured out

onto the     pitch.      I a s s i st ed w i th this task and we very quickly mana g e d

to force an opening-            Having     done that we        lifted the bodies                  over    the

wall    and onto the       pitch where       they were       laid out.         I recall           that

of f i c e rs /s pe ct at or s also    carried some of the d e a d / i n j u r e d back up

towards the tunnel          entrance.

Once    the bodies     had been cleared           I got over the wall and onto the

pitch.      I recall     helping       to carry an     injured fan across               the       pitch

towards    the exit      ramp betw e e n the N orth S t a n d and the S p i o n Kop where

we were d i r e c t e d to the gym.

Inside    the gym the scene was one of unbe l i e v a b l e                chaos,       the area just

inside    the door was       littered with bodies a t t e n d e d by both Police

O f f i c e r s and others who        I a ss u m e d to be relatives and friends - these

people were obv i o u s l y d i st raught and some were weeping,                        others were

shouting     etc.     The middle        sect i o n of the gym was operating as a

casualty     clearing area an d several              people were         there     receiving         first
                                                                                                  PAGE          4


a i d/ tr ea tm en t - this was           the a rea     in w h i c h we    left out    casualty,        I

then    left the gym and as               I made my way back onto the                pitch I was

grabbed by a Chief               Inspector or S u p e r i n t e n d e n t an d told to get        some

m e n and     clear the ramp so as to make the access                        of eme r g e n c y teams and

egress      of    casualties          easier w hi ch    I did.

Ha v i n g sorted that           out I went      back onto the        pitch where       I was grabbed

by an    Inspector and asked to assist                    with his        friend who was     injured

and having         d if f i c u l t y breathing*       On examining         the man    it was

a p p arent      that    he had broken or fr a c t u r e d ribs a n d as            his breathing was

so laboured         I felt that he might               have a collapsed        lung*

I grab b e d a team of spectators who were                       coming down the        ramp wit h one

of the m any        impromptu har d b o a r d stretchers and they a s s i s t e d me to

carry him to the               casualty     clearing a rea of the gym,              The scene     inside

the gym p a r t i cularly             in the area where          the dead bodies,      Mias one    of

utter    chaos,         as    I was    looking about      to     see what I could do to assist              I

was a p p ro ac he d by De t e c t i v e S up e r i n t e n d e n t M c K a y who    instructed me to

take    charge of the t e mpora ry m or t u a r y before a serious                     public order

s i t u a t io n developed.            He then   left me having said that he would be

back    shortly.

W i t h the a ssistance           of var ious     officers       present     I then cleared the gym

of all      persons          including Po l i c e Officers who d i d n ’t need to be there

and a Police Con s t a b l e M/as placed on the front door to regulate access

and egress.             Officers       were then d i r ected      to arra n g e     the bodies    in rows

of   12 starting at the top left hand                     corner     of the first sect i o n       and

working       crossways         to the outer wall.

E ac h body was then s e a rched to try and est a b l i s h the                      identity of the

person      c oncerned an d to s af eg u a r d any valuables,                  E a c h body was

n u m bered      in sequence          (with number      one being     located       in top left hand

corner)       along      each row work i n g      left    to right.        These     procedures    were

in stituted on the              instructions      of Det e c t i v e Chief S u p e r i n t e n d e n t Addis
                                                                                                    PAGE           5


and D et ec t i v e S u p e r i n te nd e n t M c K a y who   returned to the gym about                 4*10

p.m.    that day*        A video team from the U*W*S*U*                    did take some footage

of the scenes         in the gym prior to their arrival*

I was also       instructed by Mr.            Addis to a s ce rt a i n details of the               places

a va il a b l e at   both the W a te ry Street M o r t u a r y and           the B a r n s l e y M o r t u a r y

and an officer was deputed to this task.                           The   results     being g iven to

Mr. Addis.

About 5.0 0      p.m.    instructions were            received from Mr* Addis that the

coroner had autho r i s e d the use of Kenyons                     to process      the bodies and

prepare     them for      p h o to gr ap hi ng /i de nt if yi ng    etc.

Once    the bodies       had been tidied up and each body had been a l l o c a t e d a n

officer     to be responsible           for    it,    the     respective     officers were          told

to stand down and relax              in the     centre area w h i c h had           noMi been cleared

of all     c asualties and kitted out with                    chairs for the        purpose*

Ar r a n g em en ts were also made thro u g h Chief S u p e r i n t e n d e n t            Mole for

fact hot      chicken and        chips was      s ub s e q u e n t l y provided.

About 6.45       p.m.    the C o r on er /P ro fe ss or Usher and Dr*            Jones a t t e n d e d at

the tem p o r a r y m o r tu ar y and following d i s c u s s i o n w ith Mr. Addis                 it was

deci d e d that Keny o n s w o u l d not be used.                Polaroid     photographs were to

be taken of the facial              features      of each body for           i d e ntification

purposes      by a SOCQ team.           These w ou l d be dis p l a y e d to persons seeking

to   identify friends          or relatives and following a possible                        ID they

            I am a Police C o n stable           in the S o u t h Y o rkshire Police Force,              presently

            a t t a c h e d to the E Division al        Supp o r t G r o u p based at He e l e y Police

            Station,        Sheffield.

            At 8 t30am on Saturday,             15 April     1989     I commenced my tour of duty at

            H e e l e y P olice Station,       a long wit h the       rest of the Support G r o u p a n d

            under     the    command of Inspector Beresford.

            A fter an       initial   briefing      by Inspector B e r e s f o r d at H e e l e y we went           to

            H i l l s b o r o u g h football   stad i u m so as to carry out          certain duties           in

            relation to the FA Cup Semi- F i n a l              between Liverpool an d N o t t i n g h a m

            F orest.

            Once     at the stad i u m     I made my w a y to the N o r t h S t a n d where a formal

            briefing was         given by Chief S u p e r i n t e n d e n t D u c k e n f i e l d an d other

            senior     officers.        Upo n the    c o m p l e t i o n of the briefing the unit took a
short meal       break before going ar o u n d to the terracing at Leppings

Lane,    our    initial    duties   being a s t a nd-by unit to remain available

from Leppings Lane.

We   remained at the        location for a short time before                    being   requested by

ground    control     to a t t e nd at    the turnstiles         on P e n i s t o n e R o a d so as to

assist other       officers wit h the           incoming N o t t i n g h a m Forest     fans.

We VMere told by Sergeant E dd i s o n to work                 in our    pairs an d to position

ourselves at the entrance               to a turnstile         leading    into the spion kop.

In company VMith Police C on st a b l e 2 3 7 2 Just i c e           I went      to one of the

turnstiles and        commenced duties.            For the first         couple of hours the

spectators       from N ot ti ng ha m    came    in a steady stream an d none             caused us

any trouble.

The major       problem was     directing        spect a t o r s to the    correct entrances as

a number of Liverpool          fans s om e h o w seemed to have            come to the wrong

end a n d we kept giving them the ap p r o p r i a t e            direc t i o n s to Leppings

Lane *

In the final       hour up until         the kick-off       the number         of incoming

spectators       increased but M,‘ith one or two minor e K ceptions                     there were

still    no real     problems.      As kick-off         time    drew nearer       there was a

noticeable       increase    in the number of Liverpool                 fans    coming up to us

asking for direc t i o n s and due to the time*                  they were m u c h more hurried

than the       previous   e n quiring s p ectators        had been.

S h o r t l y before 3 o ’clock S e r g ea nt E dd i s o n      came out of the ground and

in structed us to go to Lep pi n g s Lane end as there was                        trouble with the

spectators.        The unit     immedi a t e l y made      its way out onto the           perimeter

track.     Upon walking onto the track                I i mmediately       looked down towards

L e p pings Lane and I saw a number               of fans both on the edge of the               pitch

on the    perimeter       track and      climbing over the fencing.                I immediately

thought that the          problem was one of a public               order sit u a t i o n and we

hurr i e d down to Leppings Lane.
On initial arrival at that             end,     there seemed to be a great                    deal   of

confusion,     people standing about and                 continuing           to    clamber over     the

fencing.      My first     reaction was         to look for          instructions         from

Inspector B e r e s f o r d and these were           f o r t h c o m i n g whe n he     instru cted the

unit    to form a single       line     cordon across          the    line facing         towards     pen 4

of Leppings. Lane.         As we formed up s p ectators                 continued to          clamber

over    the fencing a n d onto the           perimeter       t r a c k ..

At this    point the football          m a t c h was    still      in play and          I recall     that a

number    of the spectators VMere continuing                   to w atch the match*,              To my

immediate     right was Police Con s t a b l e S37 S Justice and whilst                          stood     in

this    position I recall a ma n           coming up to us an d screaming at us,

tell i n g us to move and do something as there was a man and people

dying    in the   crowd.     Initially our           reaction to this was                one of

disbelief r feeling        that   it M>as more         likely that            s o m ebody had fainted

in the packed croM,*d.         The ma n      ran back tovMards the fence a nd                    I looked

over my shoulder       to see S u p e r i n t e n d e n t G r e e n w o o d    running onto the

pitch a n d towards      the referee.

It was then that       it really began to occur to me that s o mething had

gone terrible wrong an d the ma n who had s c r e a m e d at us p reviously                               came

back    to me and Police Con s t a b l e        Justice screaming                  the same thing.

This    time we went vtfith him and to the fencing                      immedi a t e l y behind the

goal,    climbed up onto the fence and                 looked      into the          crowd.

The    people at the front were            reaching up towards                 us and begging us to

get them out but       it was a p p arent         that there seemed no room for anyone.

It was    then that my a t t e n t i o n was drawn towards                    the back of the

terracing     in pen 4 where        I saw a body of a man being                       passed down above

the heads of the fans.            The m a n was o b v i o u s l y u nconscious who                I would

describe as a white male,             mid-twenties,           b l o n d e - g i n g e r i s h short hair.

I recall    he was vMearing grey           cord trousers a n d a T-shirt.                     I cannot

recall any other features             of the man.           He was      passed down to us and
                                                                                                  PAGE          4


the fans      tried to pass him up to us but due to the structure of the

fenc i n g we were       unable to get hold of him and he fell                        from our     grasp

onto the steps.          A gap then seemed to appear                around the man.              It was

o bvious    looking at him that he was                dead*

Upo n seeing      this    I v;ent back towards a group of officers                       to inform

them of what was h a ppening and then returned to where Police C o nstable

Just i c e was.       He had been joined by other officers and spectators and

they were all         pulling at the fencing trying to                    break        it down toget

into the      crowd.      I i n s t i n c t i v e l y joined   in and     the fence slowly began

to bend and give way.              Police C o n s t a b l e Justice went          in whilst        the

rest    continued to pull at           the fencing        to make       the gap bigger a n d once

done,    myself and other          officers joined Police C o n stable                  justice

and a couple of other officers who were a t t e m p t i n g                  to resuscitate              this

man.

The    crowd from this        pen were      now streaming         towards an open gate              to the

r ight - h a n d side of pen 4.

As the     crowd began to         clear,    small     spaces     began to

a ppear an d    I looked a r o u n d a n d saw a number of dead bodies or

a p p a r e n t l y dead bodies    laid on the steps            of pen 4 and on looking

through a dividing          fence betiaeen pen 3 an d 4 I saw more                      bodies     stacked

up against      the    perimeter      fencing.        This     I recall    caused me to freeze

a n d stare    in disbelief        until    someone shook me an d I turned and

clambered out of the t e rracing onto the track.

By now bodies were getting               passed out onto the              pitch       and in a d d i t i o n

there were a number           of people       stagg e r i n g about,      clutching their            chest

area.      I then became        involved      in passing        bodies    out,    but only       in so

m u c h as taking      it from s o m e b o d y and      passing    it onto somebody else,

until    I M;as nearly knoc k e d over by a St Johns A m b u l a n c e M.<hich came

a r o u n d the track and parked at the front of                   pen 3.        As    it did so two

officers were follovMing it dragging a heavy male                          toiaards      it and     I

f allotted to see      if I could help*,

I then rejoined a familiar            face    in the shape      of Police C o nstable E 496

West an d we followed a group of people who were                   carrying out a

lifeless body.        The   body was    carried out onto the          pitch and dropped at

the side of the goalpost            towards    the N o r t h Stand end.     He was         laid at

the side of another male vMho I cannot                recall any features            of,   other

than he was o b viously dead and nobody was w i t h the body.

M yself   and Police C o n s t a b l e West    then started to give m o u t h to m o u t h

and heart massage        to this youth.         The   only features       I am able to

recall about       him M;as that he was quite a stocky             lad,   with dark hair

and he was       clean-shaven.      He had a pair of newish denim jeans down

a round his ankles.         I gave m o u t h to m outh whilst Police Con s t a b l e West

gave   heart massage.        At first    I thought      he was starting         to    come ar o u n d

as   I thought     he wa s starting     to breath,.       We   c o ntinued VMith our

attempts    to    revive him until      it became obvious that we were wasting

our time.

In between m o u t h to m o u t h    I recall     glancing ar o u n d and seeing both

f r e n z i e d activity and walk i n g helpless       amongst    both fans and officers.

There was also a m a r k e d sign of hos t i l i t y from fans towards                 the

officers,    myself     included.

Once we had given up w i t h this            lad Police Co n s t a b l e West    removed his

anorak and draped        it across     the    lad and some fans       then brought an

advertising       board to us and we         lifted the    lad onto    it and then           carried

him across       the pitch and down to the g y m n a s i u m area.          I recall as we

went   past the kop end the N o t t i n g h a m Forest         fans jeering at us,

o b v i o u s l y totally unaware of what       exactly was      happening even at            this

stage „

O n our arrival      at the gym we were         told by someone       to put the body down

outside    alongside a number         of other dead bodies and we            left      to return

to the scene.
                                                                                                      PAGE       6


By the time we got back the tending to the dead seemed to have sorted

itself out and apart             from a few walk i n g w o u n d e d the m a j o r i t y of             people

were    by novM just s tood about             staring      around,      searching         for some form

of   information,       either about what             the full        extent     of the disaster was

or what was       going     to happen.          I was     unable      to tell anyone anything.

I recall     then just standing a r o u n d wit h Police C o n stable West for

quite a while        until we were joined by Inspector B e r es f o r d who told us

to go over        to some of the unit who had returned,                        but there was only

about    half the unit         there so we         continued to stand about                   until   someone

sug g e s t e d we went to find our h e l m e t s „              I m a n a g e d to find mine and

w hen   I returned the full            s quad had returned and we mere                        i nstructed by

Se r g e a n t E d d i s o n to follow him and we wa l k e d up the terracing                         steps at

L e p pings Lane and out through the tunnel                       to the back of the stand.

Apart    from one or two hostile                spectators most           seemed to have           cleared

by novM.

As we were a mobile            unit we were          instructed to go and get                   into the

police van an d assist w ith various m inor                       public s i tuations            that were

d e veloping      in the    immediate       v i c i n i t y of the ground but we were unable

to get     very far due to the t raff i c congest ion.

We were     e v e n t u a l l y d i r ected to the N o r t h e r n General             Hospital    so as to

assist     with a violent         c o n f r o n t a t i o n between    relatives an d the press

but on arrival         it did not        require muc h          intervention.            We    remained at

the hospital        until a p p r o x i m a t e l y 7 . 1 5 p m w h e r e u p o n we    returned to the

football     stadium,       M^hich by now was           clear,      quiet and almost             eerie.

After    cons u l t a t i o n w ith the a p p r o p r i a t e   authorities            we were    informed

to   return to Heeley and stand down,                     w hich we did,         going        off duty at

8 . 3 0 pm that    same day.

              I am a Chief             Inspector        in the S o u t h Y o rkshire Police,                 at     present

              amendments             M/ere    made to the Order           but otherwise            it was all           riglnt.    The

              on the evening of 5 April                      1989.

tests      carried out             p reviously had been successful,                       in fact      I believe

Su p e r i n t e n d e n t    Gr e e n w o o d    informed the officers             of the fact that                the

taped off area at the N o r t h Wing of the S p i o n Kop w ould be used for

L i verpool        supporters who                 purchased tickets           for that area.             This

s e g r e g a t i o n area would,                of necessity,       require       containment by police

officers an d Mr G r e e n w o o d                 recounted his expe r i e n c e of            last years           Semi

Finsl      and     public disorder w h i c h occurred on the S p i o n Kop at this

locat ion.

T o g ether wit h S u p e r i n t e n d e n t Greenwood,                 I then went to an area behind

the S p i o n K o p as this a r e a                 is barren and there are                 loose    stones which

could be used as ammunition.                            We found that there were stones                       in that

a r e a but      neither of us were unduly                      concerned.

I then       left S u p e r i n t e n d e n t G r e e n w o o d and wa l k e d over            to the S o u t h
                                                                                                         PAGE


S t a n d where        Inspector Darling was              in the process           of briefing        stewards

for that area.              One steward was walk i n g away whilst                     the briefing was

in progress a n d I therefore                    spoke    to him.       He told me that he had

heard     it all        before     but    I reminded him that             it was      important       he paid

a t t e n t i o n as    'sods    law"     d i c t a t e d that    if he did not        something w o u l d go

wrong     in his        particular area.

I then proceeded to patrol                    the     perimeter      track,       S o u t h Stand,    South

Stand     car    park,      sterile area,           P e n i s t o n e R o a d N o r t h an d returned

ev e n t u a l l y to the S pion Kop.               During my tour          I spoke wit h all          officers

on their        respective duties             to ensure          that all   officers were            p erforming

their a l l o c a t e d duties and that none of them had any                             problems.        I

repeated this            procedure at         regular      intervals.

At   12 noon as s pectators                began to enter the Stadium,                  Liverpool

supporters were             identified on the S p i o n K op and the se g r e g a t i o n                 plan

at the N or t h Wing was               implemented using            officers       from the S pion Kop

Terrace Serial.

I recall        seeing Police C o n s t a b l e G r e e n a p p r e h e n d a y o u t h         in the Spion

Kop whilst         I was     stood near          to the s e g r e g a t e d area.       The youth was

w e a r i n g a green rugby jersey and was                       struggling.        I went      to his

a s s i s t a n c e an d a s c e r t a i n e d that    the y o u t h had made         rude gestures

(masturbating)             to the N o t t i n g h a m Forest supporters.                 I helped Police

C o n s t a b l e G r e e n take    the y o u t h to the Police R o o m at               the    rear of the

N o r t h Stand where           I left them.           I returned to the Spion Kop for a

short while            to moni t o r     the m o o d of the        croM.‘d an d    it a p p e a r e d good

humoured.

I continued to tour                the Seri a l s      under my s u p e r v i s i o n at regular

intervals        but no problems were                 being experienced.

As the      crowds       increased on the Spion Kop and the number of Liverpool

supporters         in the s e g r e g a t e d a r e a on the K op           increased,         then I found

it nec e s s a r y to       increase       the    number     of officers          in that area.          The
number of Liverpool                supporters      on the Ko p e v e n t u a l l y    reached we 11 in

excess of 500 and               Inspector Calvert and an entire Serial                       were

e v e n t u a l l y utilized.

T h r o u g h o u t my tour of duties           I maintained         personal       contact w ith

S u p e r i n t e n d e n t G r e e n w o o d and gave   that officer         regular updates

regarding the areas under my direct                         supervision-          At one     particular

stage      I believe a r o u n d 2* 15pm I became aware                    that my radio M>as

transmitting             intermittently.         By that         I mean    I could only hear

a p p r o x i m a t e l y every other word.              I informed Police Control a n d stated

I intended to change my                 radio    battery at the G y m n a s i u m at the

rear of the N o r t h Stand,

I made my way via the S outh S t a n d                    car    park where      I spoke     to a M o u n t e d

Officer who            informed me he was          e x p e r iencing      similar difficulties             with

his     radio.         I wal k e d up Pen i s t o n e Road N o r t h where          I was    struck by the

lack of traffic an d               comparative       small       number    of N o t t i n g h a m Forest

supporters           queuing     outside    the turnstiles.               In fact    I saw Chief

Su p e r i n t e n d e n t   Nesbit   in the R ange Rover and              recall    passing     comment on

the self same subject.                  I then went to the g y m n a s i u m exchanged my

radio      battery but a test             transmission           revealed no      improvement.         I

th e refore wa l k e d onto the            perimeter        track via the access             route between

the S p i o n K op and the N o r t h Stand,                the time w o u l d be a p p r o x i m a t e l y 2.

30pm.        I noticed that           the S p i o n Kop was a p p r o x i m a t e l y two thirds           full

whilst       the N o r t h S t a n d was    only half full.               The West S t a n d was      filling

nicely but           plenty of empty seats were visible and whilst the two

centre       pens were filling            up there was           plenty of room at          both N o r t h and

S o u t h ends of the terraces.                 I remarked on this to Police Constable

L amb who was            the first officer         I met        on the track.

I was then joined by the C o m m u n i c a t i o n s               officer who stated he

un d e r s t o o d that       radio   problems     were     being experienced.              I informed him

of the trouble               I had ex p e r i e n c e d and elected to walk            him around the
perimeter         track     to the Police Control                    Room,       This     I did,    the time

being a p p r o x i m a t e l y 2.40pm.               I left the C o m m u n i c a t i o n s Officer        at the

foot    of the stairs             leading          to the Police Control                Box and     I again

w a l k e d ar o u n d the external                perimeter       of the Stadium,           all was      in order,

traffic was          light and the number of                     pedestrians manageable,

I returned to the                perimeter          track via the access                route between the

Spion Ho p an d the N o r t h S t a n d an d this                     time noted that             the S p i o n Hop

had filled up as had the S o u t h Stand.                             There was still             seating

ava i l a b l e   in the N o r t h S t a n d          (approximately three quarters                    full),   the

West Stand had filled up,                      the     centre      pens a p p e a r e d    full    but there was

still     room visible at the N o r t h and S o u t h wings                          of the terracing,

I turned to face              the S pion Kop,              looked at the s e g r e g a t e d area w h i c h by

now c o ntained well              in excess          of 500 Liverpool             supporters.          Recognising

the    potential         public disorder               problem w h i c h        could arise and a l r e a d y

mentioned         by S u p e r i n t e n d e n t    G r e e n w o o d at    briefing,      I s i g nalled to

Inspector Calvert who was w i t h a Serial                                 at the side of the s e g r e g a t e d

area that         I wis h e d to speak w i t h him at the                       rear of the N o r t h S t a n d       in

five minutes,            the time would be a p p r o x i m a t e l y 2.50pm.

I then spoke w ith five Liverpool                           supporters          who were on the S p i o n K o p

behind Gate 6.              As    I did so I saw Police C o n s t a b l e Holmes                      escorting

some L i verpool           supporters          to the s e g r e g a t e d area          in the S p i o n Kop,         I

a d v i s e d the five youths              I was speaking to,                  to join     them but they

ignored me,            (These youths               were    later     taken out of the S p i o n Ko p and

removed from the S t a d i u m for                   their      own safety).            I recall      at this time

hearing       radio transmissions                   but    I was unable          to decipher        the exact

content       due to the noise               in the ground and what                  I took to be

background         interference.              This was          despite        the fact     that my radio was

fitted w i t h an ear piece.                   I did,- h o w e v e r , hear         the    word *g a t e ' or

" g a t e s ’’ m e n t i o n e d an d   I therefore went               to the      rear    of the N o r t h S t a n d

w i t h a view to          1 istening        to the t r a n s m i s s i o n as we 11 as discussing
                                                                                                 PAGE          6



se g r e g a t i o n   problems    on the S p i o n Ho p w ith       Inspector Calvert.

On reaching            the quieter area behind the W o r t h Stand,               I distinctively

h eard the voice of a male officer,                        I w ould describe      the    tone as

e xci t e d and urgent and was asking                 for a u t h o r i t y to open to the       'gate'

or    'gates'.          T e r m i n o l o g y was used to the effect      that    if this was       not

done,      then deaths w o u l d       result.       The    request was made more than once

but    I am unable to say on how man y occasions                       or whether       by one or more

officers-

At this time            I was joined by Inspector Calv e r t *             We agreed to double

man the        cordon on the s e g r e g a t i o n are a on the S p i o n Kop fifteen

m i n u t e s after      kick off.

I then returned to the S pion Kop as                       I was aware    the game had started,

my a t t e n t i o n    being drawn by the          roar of the       crowd.     Simultaneously,          I

saw the N o t t i n g h a m Forest s u p p o r t e r s      pointing    towards the West Stand

and terracing and a p p e a r e d a n g r y an d abusive,                I did not know at          that

stage what had            caused this      reaction but on           looking   towards the West

S t a n d and terracing           from the S p i o n Kop end I saw what a p p e a r e d to

be a mass of press officers                 in between the Leppings              Lane end goal        and

the terraces.             This    bank of people obscu r e d my view of the terracing

but    I could see          people   climbing       over    the top of the       perimeter      fencing

onto     the track.          I could not see         police officers       because of the          people

behind the goal             obscuring my view and            I recall my       immediate     impression

was    that a pitch          invasion was         taking    place.

Radio      t r a n s m i s s i o n s were still    poor and this,       coupled w i t h the noise

of the       crowd,      made an y signals         inaudible,

I i mmediately           instructed all       officers on the          perimeter     track to

moni t o r     the     crowd on the S p i o n Kop as their m o o d was a n g r y and

violent.           I also saw Police S e r g e a n t B atty on the S o u t h Wing of the

S p i o n Kop terraces and           I sig n a l l e d to him to go over          to the s e g r e g a t e d

area to assist            Inspector Calvert and his S e r i a l , the             public disorder
potential           in that -area now being great.

At this juncture               police officers           came    running down the access             point

from the d i r e c t i o n of the g y m n a s i u m and I d i r e c t e d them down the

perimeter           track    in front of the N o r t h Stand,             towards      the L e p p i n g s Lane

te r r a c e s ,

The S pion Kop was              now bubbling,          the    crowd were    booing,      shouting abuse

an d making          violent      gestures         towards    the L i verpool    supporters.           The

five Liverpool              supp o r t e r s were     removed via Gate 6 at this               point.

A minor       skirm i s h o c c u r r e d but        this was     quickly brought        under     control.

A ddit i o n a l     officers       came via the S o u t h Wing of the Spion Kop and these

were    allowed onto the               perimeter       track via Gate       1 a n d direc t e d      in

front     of the S outh Stand to the L e p p i n g s Lane end.

I could see that the number                        of supporters      on the    perimeter       track was

swell i n g        behind the goal m o u t h and then was aware                  that S u p e r i n t e n d e n t

G r e e n w o o d had run onto           the      pitch an d stopped the game,

I recall Liverpool                supporters         running     over to the S pion Ko p end,

s i n g u l a r l y at    first,     and     police officers moving            forward to deal with

them.

The    crowd behind the goal                     quic k l y swelled onto the      pitch and         into the

penalty area,               A St, Johns A m b u l a n c e       came down the access           road from

the d i r e c t i o n of the gym n a s i u m and advert i s i n g           hoardings were broken

and    removed to a l l o w free access                 onto the      pitch.     It was      then driven

to the L e p p i n g s Lane end.

Police officers and s u pporters were                         together    carrying      persons on

stretchers,           on a d v e r t i s i n g    hoardings an d by hand to the N o r t h Stand/

S pion Kop          corner     of the      pitch and were a d m i n i s t e r i n g m o u t h to m o u t h

r e s u s c i t a t i o n to some.         It was a p p arent at that          stage    that    there had

been deaths,             although      I am unable        to say how many.          S u p p o r t e r s were

also    ripping dawn a d v e r t i s i n g           hoardings at      the S p i o n Kop end of the

S t a d i u m and these         in turn were          being     taken to the L e p p i n g s Lane         end.
                                                                                                        PAGE


On realising        the      potential       e n o r m i t y of the     problem       I ran to the

g y m n a s i u m and told the officers              there to        clear the area for use as a

te m p o r a r y mortuary.

I returned to the             playing area and there                 I saw Police S e r geant

             Ien route to the L e p p i n g s Lane               end,    called him over          to assist

w i t h First Aid as          I    knew he was a First Aid              Instructor,            I then turned

to a n o t h e r group in          time    to see them covering a y o u t h ’s             face and

stating     he was dead.             They a t t e m p t e d to    lift the advert i s i n g           hoarding

he was on but one man was                  so distressed,            he w a l k e d away a n d    I took

hold of the t e mporary stretcher.                        Together we        carried the body to the

gymnasium,       however,          man o e u v e r a b i 1 ity M/as limited due to         the number of

people     carrying         the    injured and dead and therefore                    the dead m a n ’s body

was   carried by four of us                 into the gymnasium.              As we      carried the dead

m a n to the gym n a s i u m        I remember       urine     flowing       from the area of the

N o r t h S t a n d Upper Level           concourse onto us and officers were sent                        to

deal wit h the        problem.          Once      inside    the g y m n a s i u m    I was aware that a

number of       people       (exact number          not    known)     were    laid on the floor,

a p p a r e n t l y dead.     A number       of    relatives and friends as well                  as    police

officers were         in the area,          m any were        distressed,           some were a ngry and

d i r ecting    insults at the             police.        D e t ective Serge a n t               approached

me and stated that                officers were       not     realising       the     importance of

r emaining w i t h bodies and               I a s s i g n e d him the duty of ensuring at                 least

one officer        remained w ith each body to ensure                        continuity,

A number of officers were                   persuading        none    police        personnel    to    leave

the g y m n a s i u m an d    I returned to the             pitch to rejoin officers                  there,

On my return         I noticed that            the number of police                 officers    on the

perimeter       track had been             increased and         I spoke w i t h some of them

reminding       them of the need for vigilance                       in respect of the N o t t i n g h a m

Forest     supporters         on the S p i o n Hop,           Their m o o d was        still a ngry and

abusive and        I formed the opin i o n that                the m a j o r i t y of them did not
realise      the enormity of what                 had occurred.

I saw S u p e r i n t e n d e n t C h a p m a n at this end of the ground and                    I spoke

w ith him,        He told me to monitor                  the N o t t i n g h a m s u pporters    in the

S o u t h S tand to ensure a pitch invasion did not take                             place.      E xtra men

had a l r e a d y been d e p l o y e d      in this area.

A cordon of police officers                     had been formed across             the halfway         line to

contain the Liverpool                  supporters.         On satisfying        self   that all was          in

order.*    I went to the halfway                  line    cordon.      There were a large number

of Liverpool         surpporters           in this -area of the           pitch,    man y were

distressed;,       m any bewildered,              a large number         smelled heavily of drink

and a considerable amount                   of abuse was         being hurled both at             the police

as well      as d e r o g a t o r y    remarks being made about              the Football

Association,

S l o w l y the moo d of the            crowd     calmed down and Chief S u p e r i n t e n d e n t

Nesbit a p p r o a c h e d me an d a s k e d me to take half of the halfway                           line

cordon outside             to s u p ervise N o t t i n g h a m supp o r t e r s as they         left the

S t a d i u m as an announcement was                shortly to be made           telling        the crowd

that    the m a t c h had been abandoned.

I took these officers                  into P e n i s t o n e R oad North,      together with

S u p e r i n t e n d e n t Chapman.       That    officer      o r ganised a cordon across the

dual    c a r r i ageway to filter N o t t i n g h a m supporters a w a y from the

Liverpool       sector whilst             I instructed Police C o n s t a b l e B u x t o n to park

his L and Rover            on the Central          R e s e r v a t i o n an d I used that vehicle's

public addr e s s system to advise                    supporters       to turn right on leaving

the gr o u n d for transport               back    to M i d l a n d R a i l w a y Station,      The

s u p p o r t e r s were    formed      into orderly queues,             buses were sent          in batches

to the Catchbar Lane                  side of the junction of P e n i s t o n e R o a d N o r t h and

Herries Road S ou t h and were                  loaded.

Whe n this      task was        completed,         I returned to the rear of the N o r t h

Stand and heard a radio t r a n s m i s s i o n                regarding     fighting     in the
H i l l s b o r o u g h Park area.       I therefore         g a t h e r e d ad hoc Tango units

together       and    instructed them to ask Gr o u n d Control                         for a call sign

before     being d e p loyed to whate v e r              incident arose.

It was then apparent               that there were a number                   of officers with o u t

specific       duties and these were                instructed to take seats                      in the N o r t h

S tand and await          further       instructions.             Officers w i t h keys to vehicles

were    identified an d were             seated separate               for deployment             if necessary.

The officers were             retained       in this area until               I received            instructions,

via S up e r i n t e n d e n t s M o r d e w and B r o o k f i e l d    to obtain

debrief      sheets from superv i s o r s            in respect of their Serials and stand

the officers          down.      I would d e s ccribe          the officers             in the N o r t h S ta n d

as shocked,          saddened,      some were d i s t r e s s e d and several                  openly wept.

On    c ompletion of this duty,               I a t t ended the g y m n a s i u m where                   I found it

had been divided             into three areas.              The    first      contained           I believe         over

80 bodies and officers were                    in the     process of          recording details                of

same and taking           photographs         for    id e n t i f i c a t i o n purposes under the

dir e c t i o n of    Inspector Charles.               I depu t e d other           Inspectors             to assist

him    in this       task.

The middle        section of the gym n a s i u m            contained CID officers whose                        duty

it was     to see      relatives,        a c c om p a n y them during           identificat ion and then

take s tatements          regarding        the same.

The third section had been kept                      separate          for   relatives,          members       of the

Social     S e r vices and       clergy-

I assisted        in the a r r a n g e m e n t s    regarding          the   id e n t i f i c a t i o n    process

an d also      c ounselled c o mforted a number of                      officers.

At    11.00pm I a t t e n d e d N i a g a r a Social         Club       and a gain counselled several

officers       before     returning        to H a m me r t o n R o a d Po l i c e S t a t i o n to ensure

that Sub Divisional              policing       requirements            were     being catered f o r .

At 2 . 3 0 a m on Sun d a y      16 April       1989,     I went        off duty.

              I am a single w oman            living at           the above          address w ith my parents.                I am

              e m p loyed as a

              •1*       I am also a special          constable w i t h the S o u t h Y o r k s h i r e Police and

              am sta t i o n e d at Wo o d s e a t s Police Station,                   C h e s t e r f i e l d Road,

              Woodseats*           I joined the special              c o n s tabulary        in N o v e m b e r    1988 and

              since       that time     I have gained a lot of experience                           in policing football

              matches*        I have a c t u a l l y w o r k e d a football m a t c h almost                      every week

              since Janu a r y       1989 a l t e r n a t i n g    between Bramall             Lane    football        ground,

              H i l l s b o r o u g h football    ground.

              At 9...45am on S a t u r d a y      15th April          1989 I started my tour of duty at

              H i l l s b o r o u g h Football Stadium,           S h e ff i e l d    in pr e p a r a t i o n for the FA Cup

special     police officers             in the N o r t h S t a n d of the stadium by one of

the senior       officers      present.            It was the usual           pre-match briefing

which     perhaps    took a little           longer than normally.                  We were told that

if an eme r g e n c y of any kind took                 place there w o u l d be an ann o u n c e m e n t

over     the tannoy w h i c h w o u l d state

"The a t t e n t i o n of Mr M E A D O W S     is required at the               police     control       box.."

This     indicated to those officers                   in the ground m a n n i n g a gate,               to open

that     gate,   and for other           officers       to    congregate at a particular                   part

in the ground,         though      I do not know where                this    is.     The briefing

lasted for half an hour and from there all                             the specials          present went

into the g y m n a s i u m to be a l l o c a t e d their duty for                   the day.

At     10.30am I went to M i d d l e w o o d Road where my duties were to                             prevent

football      fans   from    parking their             cars and to direct             them to a

s p ecified      parking    place away from the ground.                       I was     in M i d d l e w o o d

R oad w ith S.C.                             S .C                            md     two other special

constables from A t t e r c l i f f e Police S t a t i o n             I only know a s a n d

            We were a c t u a l l y      str e t c h e d out along the            length of M i d d l e w o o d

Road and I stood opposite the MiddleM;ood Hospital                                  preventing       fans from

parking      in the parking a rea for the nearby shops.                              I did not       have a

personal      radio,              and               had one each.

At first      there was      no traffic            congestion at all a l t h o u g h there were a

few fans a r r i v i n g    in S h e f f i e l d    in t h e i r    cars.     As time went on the

traffic     built up s t e adily but at no time was                         t h e r e any major

congestion.          I saw some fans           park t h e i r       cars by the Beeley Wood                public

house,     M i d d l e w o o d R oad and go to the pub,               a l t hough    I d o n ’t know       if the

pub became        packed.      I also saw a lot of cars stop n e a r                       to the Beeley

W o o d pub M/here t h e r e were a          row of       litter      bins,    get out of t h e i r          cars

a nd    put empty beer       cans and bottles                into    the bins.        By 2 . 4 5 p m these

bins were o v e r f l o w i n g    so that         t h e r e were    cans and bottles all over                   the

floor.       I was v e r y surprised,              as time went on,           that so few football

fans were ma k i n g        their way to the stadium on foot.                      It w a s n ’t until

2 . 3 0 p m that any numbers          of fans were w a l k i n g to the stadium but again

these were only            in dribs     and drabs.         Of the fans       I saw I did not           see

any who were        fighting or d is o r d e r l y or who were o b v i o u s l y drunk,

al t h o u g h some of the fans walk i n g             to the ground were still               drinking

from    cans.

By 2 4 5 pm the numbers of fans making                     their way to the ground along

M i d d l e w o o d R oad h a d n ’t i n creased to any great degree and we were                       then

told by S D O _______ and SDO                              who were w i t h Chief Comma n d a n t

Stothard,       that     there     really w a s n ’t m uch point         in staying where we were

and that we should make our wa y to the ground*                             All    five of us then

wal k e d along M i d d l e w o o d    Roa d to    its junct i o n w i t h C a t c h Bar Lane and

L e p p i n g s Lane„     At this      j u n c t i o n there    is   a car sales a rea and            I saw

the    proprietor sweeping             cans,    bottles and          chip papers      out of his yard.

We then turned           into L e p p i n g s Lane and all           I could see was      people

everywhere.         They were m a s s i n g from the turnstile                block     right    out    into

the middle       of the       road and str e t c h e d from the beginning of the bridge

on one side of the             road right      up to the tyre sales               shop on the other

side    of the    road.        I could see that many of them were                    pushing and

shoving and the crowd was                swaying from side             to side.      As we got        closer

to the     crowd and to the entrance                   of the ground       I could see that the

crowd was       pushing tightly up to the turnstiles.                        We stood amongst           the

crowd but to the            rear    so that we were            not s u bjected to any excessive

pushing and shoving.                We were     telling        people to go back        but    they

ignored us and           continued to        push forward.            I saw fans throwing beer

bottles     into the        road an d over the bridge                into the river      and m a n y of

the fans were           becoming a g g r e s s i v e    towards      us frust r a t e d at not being

able    to get    into the ground.              I saw fans        climbing onto the           roof of the

t u r n s t i l e s and getting       into the ground and quite a few were urinating

up against       the tyre shop.            A lot of them were            becoming     rowdy in a
                                                                                                       PAGE         1



drun k e n manner*            Some     fans     even a s k e d us      if we knew of anyone selling

tickets.          I remember         seeing       the head of a horse and a moun t e d

p o l i c e m a n ’s helmet amongst             the    crowd but the        crowd was     so tightly

packed ar o u n d him that was all                     I could see.

I could see a police Lan d r o v e r                   parked just        to the   left of the entrance

gates and standing on the                     roof w a t c h i n g the     crowd was a senior officer

who    I d o n ’t know*           I also      saw chief S u p e r i n t e n d e n t M A R S H A L L who was

clinging to a white                 post to the          right of the entrance           gates,    head and

shoulders a bove            the    crowd a t t e m p t i n g      to see what was      happening

at the turnstiles,.

At a p p r o x i m a t e l y 2 . 5 5 p m C o m m a n d a n t             came up to us and told us

that we were           not to go into the ground through this                         crowd*      We w a l k e d

back     from the        crowd and                 said he wanted to go to the toilet,                    so

all    of us w a l k e d up Leppings               Lane        to C a t c h Bar Lane and wa i t e d there

w h i l e I        wa l k e d to the        section house            in P a r kside a few hundred yards

away*       Whe n he had got about                 halfway        to the section house he came             back

realizing that he did not have a key.                                We then made our way back to

the L e p p ings Lane e n t rance a n d saw that                      all of the    crowd had gone*             I

can't      remember seeing any open gates nor any                           injured    persons outside

the ground*

D u r i n g the ten minutes              or so that we had been               part of the      crowd    I did

not    think that         the     crowd     increased grea t l y but           believe    that    the vast

m a j o r i t y were a l r e a d y there.             The time       between us    leaving the entrance

to the ground a n d             returning        from Catchbar Lane was             only 2 to 3 minutes

at the most.

I c a n ’t remember           entering the ground but the next thing                       I do know       is

that     I was standing a long                the pitch edge at            the S p i o n Hop end of the

g round just to the               left of the goal.                 I think that this was just after

the m a t c h had been stop p e d as                  I d o n ’t recall     seeing any of the

football        players.          At first we were               positioned so that we were
                                                                                                  PAGE


watch i n g    the N o t t i n g h a m Forest    supporters     when    I saw the        lone

Liverpool       fan run down towards             the Hop.      He stop p e d just        in front of

the g o a l m o u t h and made two f i n g e r e d gestures          to the N o t t i n g h a m Forest

fans.      He was a white man w i t h            long brown hair w e a r i n g a black tee

shirt an d blue jeans and he had scarves                      tied a r o u n d each wrist*          He

looked     like a heavy metal            music    fan,    a rocker,

I then looked towards                the L e p pings Lane end a n d saw fans             climbing    from

the terraces        up into the West Stand-                I thought at first that they

were    climbing       up a nd then jumping         back down onto         the    pitch but       I have

found    since that this was not the                case-      I then saw the stewards              line

up in a sort        of semi      circle across       the    pitch at     the L e p pings Lane        end*

I c o u l d n ’t see    if there were any fans on the                pitch at this time as my

view was       blocked by the stewards*              I a s s u m e d they had lined up because

there    had been fighting-              Everyone    just seemed to be standing around

with no idea of what was                going on*        I have no rec o l l e c t i o n of time

from this       point on as soon after the scene                  became    chaotic-

The next       thing    I k new there were         crowds of fans        on the pitch and           some

were    kicking down the a d v e r t i s e m e n t       hoardings     and using them as

stretchers       for    injured fans who          they carried out         from the       pitch

betw e e n the S p i o n Kop and N o r t h Stand-             S oon the fans were kicking

down the a d v e r t i s e m e n t    hoardings    in front     of us also        to use as

s t retchers so this enabled us to move s l i ghtly forward onto the                               pitch.

We were       orde r e d to keep our        position by a Mr Booth,              I d o n ’t know his

rank    but he     is in the         regular    force-     Soo n three bodies were

laid doM/n on the         pitch just        near me,      I d o n ’t know who by they just

appeared-         I a sked a special           nearby what was wrong wit h them and he

told me they were dead*                 Two of the bodies         had coats       over    their heads

but the other one           I remember was a white man,                50 to 60 y ears old,

short and fat,          he had grey hair and was wearing what                     I think       it was a

jumper,       I think    it was y e l l o w and was        pulled up ar o u n d his        chest    so
                                                                                                     PAGE           6



that    his    stom a c h was    exposed*         He had    light      coloured trousers           and I

know that one or           possibly both of his shoes w e r e m i s s i n g .J

The N o t t i n g h a m Forest    fans were        chanting     'Die Bastards Die*              at the

Liverpool       fans on the        pitch.      The    injured fans were            brought down to

our end of the          pitch     near to the        corner by the N o r t h S t a n d and there

were    so m any of them          that despite        being ordered to m a i n t a i n our

position       I went    further     towards       the L e p pings Lane end to see                if I

could help them.            I tried to help and             comfort the        injured but there

were    so man y of them that           I c a n ’t remember         anything about           them except

for one y o u t h who had a badly              cut right hand.             He was white,          17 years

old,    5ft    lOins    tall,     dark hair over his collar,               wear i n g a black          tee

shirt.        He was    in a state of shock and seemed very                       confused.        I told

him to go to the St Johns A m b u l a n c e             team to get         some a t t e n t i o n but he

refused saying that other               people were dying.

I saw people on the             pitch being        r e scitated by m o u t h to m o u t h and heart

massage,       by police officers and fans.                  Also      I saw o b v i o u s l y dead

bodies    on the       pitch,    some of whom still           had the plastic             re s c u s i t a i d in

their mouths.           Others were       lying on the        pitch and        I d o n ’t know       if they

were dead or not*            The whole       scene was       one of total          confusion and

chaos wit h fans everywhere,                and    I c a n ’t remember a n y t h i n g about these

people on the          pitch*     I helped those fans w ith relat i v e l y minor

injuries and did not attempt m o u t h to m o u t h or heart massage                              on any

person as most were             being a t t e n d e d to*

My m e m ories     of what h a p pened from them on are very vague and the                               next

thing    I remember        is being     in the yard between the West Stand and the

L e p p i n g s Lane turnstiles.         We were there to ensure                  crowd    control       as

people    left     the ground*         Along      the wall    to the       left    of the      c o ncertina

gates    I could see 3 barriers about 5ft                    long and 3ft high w i t h sheets

draped over        them*     I could see that            in between these barriers                  bodies

had been       piled up w h i c h were       o b v i o u s l y dead.     We formed a cordon
b e t w e e n the west stand an d the wall w hich d i v i d e d the y ard an d the

people       leaving the ground t h r o u g h the tunnel              had to go thro u g h the gap

in the wall a nd out                 through the gates    on the other side*          Most of

the fans were very abusive                  blaming the      police    for the deaths        calling

us    ’M u r d e r e r s •*    Some of them who      said their friends         had died did not

want any help,                they   continued to be abusive.          Whe n one of the female

specials        broke down           crying some of the fans did try to comfort                her,

but    in the mai n the atmo s p h e r e was one of hate towards the                   police*

W hen the gr o u n d had empt i e d we went            out    into L e p pings Lane and saw

fire     engines and a m b u l a n c e s     everywhere.      Most of the bodies had been

removed by ambulance                 by this time*

Soo n after this we were                 given a briefing      in the N o r t h S tand but      I

cannot       remember a w ord that was            said,   I had no more       involvement after

the briefing and                left the ground at 6 „ 3 0 pm to 6 , 4 5 p m to go home,

I would       like to add that            since starting     to work football        matches        I

have     never      seen such a large         crowd of    people as there was outside the

ground at         the Leppings         Lane end of the ground*           Normally    there w ould

be orderly queues there and there w o u l d be no d i f f i c u l t y                in gaining

entry*        Also      I saw more       police on duty before         this m a t c h than    I have

seen     in any       previous match.         U s u a l l y the briefing w o u l d take      place

either       inside the g y m n a s i u m or    in the yard outside but           this time

              On S a t ur d ay     15th April,       1989     (150489)      I went      to the FA cup semi-final

              at H i l l s b o r o u g h   I am a L iv erpool       supporter,          I tra ve ll ed to the game

              with a group of friends                in                        motor     car*     I o bt ained my

               ticket as a season ticket                  holder    through a postal            order   system,        I

               paid     6 *0 0 for the ticket             in the standing area of Leppings Ln*



               I tra ve ll ed to the game w it h

                            I only know the other two                lads     vaguely I d o n ’t know where                they

               live.      We t ravelled straight              to the ground.            We were delayed by heavy

               traffic at         the end of the M67*              I d i d n ’t see anyone        drinking en route

               to the game.



               We a r ri ve d     in S h e f f i el d at a p p r ox i ma t el y 2,2 5    pm (1425 hrs)         and    parked
                                                                                              PAGE


in Dykes Hall Rd*            Walk in g     to the ground we d i d n ’t receive any Police

d i re ct io n or escort,         we just f ol lo we d the flow of people         heading to

the ground*            It M>as a fine day and everyone was           in a good mood*            We

a r ri v ed at the entrance          to the ground at about 2.3 5          pm <1435 hrs).

Outside     the    perimeter       gates    there was a lot of people mill in g about*

Inside the gates,           outside        the t urnstiles   entrance B there was just a

solid mass        of    people*       In the middle of this mass         there was one

m o u n t e d Police Officer who           d i d n ’t seem to have a lot of effect on the

crowd*      There was anot he r m o un t e d officer walking alo ng si de               the    river

fence.      He was making          no efforts who were        joining    the mass from the

sides *



There was a lot of people                in this   crowd shouting at the Police

Officers     to shut       the    perimeter    gates   to a l lo w the   crowd to subside*

By this time           I ’d left my other      friends as they had got tickets                for

other     parts    of the ground*           I m a na g ed to work my way through the            crowd

towards the turnstiles.               It was the worst        crush outside a turnstile

that    I ’ve ever been in*           I d i d n ’t see an y stewards*       All   the

turns t i l e s were      open and    I entered through one of the middle                ones and

handed     in my ticket*



From    previous experience           I knew where      to enter   the ground the only

difficulty        I had was getting          thro ug h the   crowd to the turnstiles*

Whe n   I passed thro u g h          the turns ti le s I did not see any gates open or

being opened*            I only     saw one person climb over the side            gate to the

left of the turnstiles.               The    crush w a s n ’t that bad at this stage            so I

believe     this       lad was    either    in a hurry or d i d n ’t have a ticket*             As   I

got out the other           side of the turnstiles there was about a dozen

people     climbing over the          roof of the turnstiles*
                                                                                                PAGE           3


Inside the turnstiles              there was about      four Police Officers who M>ere

stopping      people without          tickets-      I saw them stop a couple           of fans who

I presume      probably d i d n ’t have tickets*              This    seemed to cause a

further     backlog        so the Police O ff ic er s    let them go and allo we d              people

to enter      through the turns tiles again*                 Having    previ ou sl y gone to the

ground and wanting            to stand behind the goal.               I knew to get to this

position      I w ou l d have      to go thro ug h the tunnel*           The only sign          I

recall     seeing was one above           the tunnel     I c a n ’t recall what        it said.

There was      no Police        or stewards       to control    or direct you to where you

w an t e d to go.         I had free    passage along the tunnel           until    the end where

I had to a g a i n work my way thro ug h the             crowd to get to my position*                      I

t urned    right from the tunnel             into the terraces what you            call    pen three.



H aving a t t e n d e d    last y e a r ’s game    I immediately       realised the terraces

were as     packed as then,          w h i ch had been u n co m fo rt ab le    but nothing

part ic ul ar ly out of the ordinary*                I wa lk ed down the      terraces      heading

towards the front.             There was a surge from behind w hi ch               carried me

forward about        ten yards*         It then stopped and I c ontinued walking

towards the front fencing.                The     surge was nothing       out of the ordinary.

The m ood     in the terracing was           good,    but there was       plenty of josteling

as   people were          having   to work   their way through the            crowd.      The       small

exit   from the tunnel             into the terrace     d i d n ’t seem to help matters*



I took up the         position       in the terracing w it h the         last barrier       behind

me on your grid            it w ould be a position near C7*              I took up my       position

in the terracing at about 2.5 3                 pm <1453 hrs>„         At 2.5 5   pm <1455 hrs)

it started to get            n oticibly worse       people star te d     crushing up against

me from behind            I know it was this time as           I a sk ed the girl      nevtt door

to me what       time      it was*     G r ad ua ll y over about a couple of minutes                  it

started to get worse.                Over a minute     the    crush became u nbearab le              it
                                                                                                     PAGE        4


ef f ected my breathing an d           I c o u l d n ’t move my hands*                At this     time

people began shouting           to get       people back.        M o me nt s      later    people

started screaming a n d some were               in obvious       distress*             I c o u l d n ’t see

the gate as someone was blocking my view-                        A l t h ou g h    I c o u l d n ’t see

m uc h I could hear        people     say t h e y ’ve got to do s om ething                now why d o n ’t

they get us out of here-



A girl    stood to my right a pp ea r ed to be having                   trouble         breathing,        she

was    screaming out       loud*      At one stage her face was                   pressed up against

mine-     This    girl   continued screaming            for a while,           and then she went

limp*     She was     quiet,    I heard a couple of moans an d then she went

quiet and then she d ef in a t e l y stopped breathing.                        She was quite a good

looking girl,        19 years       old w ith dark shortish hair,                 wearing a white

blouse and jeans-           I w a s n ’t able to help the girl                 because        I c o u l d n ’t

move myself*        I could see a lad on top of the fencing trying to                                 pull

people up-        He d i d n ’t have any effect          people were just- s t u c k -

Although       I w a s n ’t aware    the game had kicked off              I now believe at this

time    the game was still           being     played-        There    d i d n ’t seem           to bemany

people on the touchline*               The     crush was       not abating*



The next thing         I know   is that        I began to black out               I     was      having

terrible d i f f i c u l t y breathing         an d   I was    fighting        for      my life* I then

did pass out,        next thing       I know    is that two        people had got me under

their arms and were          carrying me backwards              up the terraces*                 I think by

this    time    the terracing        had cleared-        I stood leaning against                    the

barrier    recovering until a friend took me to the side fencing and

passed me over         the side fencing         into    pen 2-        Here     I w an de r ed around

trying to catch my breath*               At about       half    past    three         I w al ke d on to

the    pitch and found some water              to drink-        Whe n   I ’d been taken out from

the terracing        I d i d n ’t look behind me         I d i d n ’t realise           things      had
                                                                                              PAGE            5


been that     bad and so m an y people had been killed.                      There was a       lot of

c onfusion on the       pitch and there was no one                  in the   immediate area for

me to help.



I heard the a n no un ce me nt        that the game had been cancelled and                   left the

ground of my own ac co rd to meet my friends                    at an a rr an g ed    point.        I

d i d n ’t see anyone       committing any       criminal     offence.



I w ou ld   like to a dd that         it was    quite obvious        there was a crush in the

terrace and        I feel    that the m a t c h should have been postponed to allow

time   for the      crowd to be posi ti on ed         in the terraces.          I a t t e nd e d   last

y e a r ’s semi-final       at H i l l s b o r o u g h and it was   better orgainised.             There

were queues        outside    the turnestiles.           Police Officers were           checking

your    tickets     before     reaching    the turnstiles.           This year     the Police

d i d n ’t have    control    of the     crowds outside       the turnstiles.           I also

believe     that    if the officers        both inside and outside             had had loud

speaker hailers,        they w ould have         been able to         inform the     crowd of what

was    happining and maybe          to organise       things.       I p ersonally     consider          the

side fencing        in the terraces        to be dangerous          because    it d o e s n ’t allow

people to spread out.              The y should have been segregating                to direct

people a w a y whe n one a re a became           full.



As a result of being            in the    crush I suffered from muscle               bruising

a r o u n d my chest an d bruising         to the small       of my back.        I __________

                                          on the Monday,        I was                and

               At 9 .45 am        (09455    on Saturday,          15 April        1989    (150489)     I paraded      for

               N o t t i n g h a m Forest F.C.      an d Liverpool           AaF-C-



               I had attended the briefing                   for senior officers              M,'hich had been held

               the      previous morning         inthe N S ta nd at the Ground-                    I was    responsible

               to S up e r i nt e nd e nt   C H AP MA N   (Sector 3) and was depu te d to supervise

               su b— sector 3 B F w hi ch consisted of serials 5 7 — 64*                        in turn commanded by

               I n s p e c t o r ’s BATEMAN,     B U RG E SS and WALLACE.



               I policed the a dj acent su b— sector                   for the         1987— 88 F«A« Cup Semi-Final

               at H i ll s b o r o u g h   in my capacity as a Chief                   Inspector.
                                                                                                 PAGE




I have     performed duty at H i l l s b o r o u g h        regularly as an Inspector and

Police S er geant         have also a ss is t ed        in policing at M i l l m o o r F Bramall

LN and Qakwell           grounds       during my service.



F ol l ow i ng     briefing    the N Stand,        I commenced s u pe r vi so ry foot          patrol

along Herries RD S-, paying                particular a t t e n t io n to the Five Arches

Public House,           where six       personnel     carriers from the N ot ti n gh a m area

were    seen parked and u na tt e nd e d           in the       car    park.   As officers      from

Inspector BATEMAN* s serials arrived,                      I d ir ec te d them to prevent

further mini -b us es          parking at or near to the                 premises,    but to send

them to R a w s o n Spring RD.             This    i nstruction was to ensure that

passengers         would be aware         of their v e h i c l e ’s parking         place and would

assist     in segreg at in g       fans from the opposing                clubs.



Once there were           sufficient       officers       at the Five Arches Public House,

co ntinued up hill            to the D ev on s hi r e Arms,           in company w it h   Inspector

BATEMAN.           It was apparent        that    those    premises were also          the meeting

point for N o t ti n gh a m Forest           supporters.



I s ub se qu e nt l y    returned to the Five Arches and saw S u pe ri nt en de nt

C H AP M AN who ex pr es se d      concern that the             premises were full.           After

briefing         Inspector B A TE M AN and        Inspector W A LL A C E       (the latter     in a

’T a n g o ’ mobile)      to pay particular a tt e nt i on to the                 premises,    I was

conveyed by Mr.          C H AP M AN    in his Lan d Rover to a point               in Herries    RD S

near    to P e ni st on e RD.



Mr C HA P M A N briefed me to pay a t t e n ti o n to Public Houses                    in Pen is to ne

RD including          the Royal,       B r a d f i el d Road,    where a build-up of drinking

supp o r t e r s    had been noted.
                                                                                               PAGE




I had returned to the g ym n as i um at the stad iu m to exchange my radio

(set     14) as      it was    not    receiving    properly.



A member of the             c om municat ions   staff   checked the        radio and       returned       it

to me and        I patrolled towards Neepsend,               meeting      up w ith    Inspector

B U R G E S S and several       officers     en route     to the Royal Public House.                 On

arrival        at the   p r e m s i e s , I found a S er geant      evacuating       the   premises

following        incident      of d i s or d er l y behaviour.      The    surrounds       of the pub

were     heavily      littered w i t h empty       pint glasses,       bottles and cans.             By

2 .00    pm (1400)      the premises were         cleared and        locked.



I received          personal     radio m es sa g es of trouble at the V ic to ri a Public

House,      Neepsend,        involving Special       Constable.        Sergeant      DENT,    Dog

S e c t i o n and    ’T a n g o ’ units went- to their assistance.              I remained      in

P e n is t o n e RD to moni t o r      the behaviour of N o tt i n g h a m supporters,          who

were walk i n g along P e n is to ne RD towards              the Ground.



About     that      time,    a coach containing Liverpool             supporters       drove a long

the     road    in the same direction.            A number      of s upporters were          stood    in

the     coach g e s t i c ul at in g at N o t t i n g h a m fans.



A l t h o u g h the Forest s upporters a p p e ar e d to have been drinking                   heavily,

they were good humoured and c ontinued                    in a steady stream to the ground



I am a season ticket holder at N o tt i n g h a m Forest D.C,                    and the

behaviour of fans was                no worse   than I saw at W e mb l e y for the

L i t t l e w o o d s C u p Final    the   previous weekend.         There was more evidence

of drinking          that    I have e xp e ri e nc e d at League an d other Cup games                this

season.
                                                                                              PAGE        4




A fter 2*50 pm      (1450)     Inspector B U RG E S S and      I began to patrol            back

towards the ground,          talking w it h fans en route.



I a r ri v ed outside      the ground a p p r o x i m a t e l y 3.0 5 pm   (1505).      I saw the

N o t t i n g h a m Evening Post    reporter,     T ony DONNELLY,      and three N o t t s .

officers       in the vicinity of the          car park entrance.



On my walk       towards the ground,          I clearly heard S u p e r i nt e nd e nt M A R S HA L L

radio    for    "gate to be opened"         on two separate occasions,                A fter the

second    call,    in w hi ch there were screams and              cries of panic        in the

background/       I heard a controller advise             that    "Sergeants 916 and 993

have been sent to open the gates."                   I then heard Mr M A R SH A LL ask for

the game       to be postponed for fifteen mintues.                 I heard no reply,



At 3. 0 5 pm     (1505),    I spoke to PC       1200 W OO DW AR D who was standing at the

car park entrance          gate    and warned him that        I e xp ec te d a group of

a r o un d fifty Forest      fans    to try and      climb into the ground.



I then heard a huge          roar from the L iv erpool           end of the ground followed

by silence.        Seconds     later,      I saw PS DENT and two other Dog H an dlers

emerge    from their vehicles,             leash their dogs and        ran towards          "0" gate,

I heard nothing on my             radio.



I entered the ground and went down the                   ramp to the       perimeter        track    in

front    of the S pi on Hop,         I there    saw S up er in t en d en t C H AP MA N who

instructed me to form a cordon facing the S p i o n Kop.                      I saw what

seemed to be a pitch invasion at the L ep pings L N/ N S ta nd corner of the

ground.        I continued the       cordon along the track,           ass is ti ng    in

pushing    several Forest          fans off the fence        from where      they had climbed
                                                                                             PAGE           5


as though to get onto the field.                  I then m ov ed to the front            of the S

Stand,     w hi ch   is unfenced.      I saw Liam 0*KANE stand in g on the                pitch but

no players,          The n Archie G E MM I LL a nd Ron F EN T ON w al k ed from the

players tunnel         and gestu re d to the Forest supp or te rs            to cease their

chanting a nd gesturing.



I saw a young Liverpool             s up porter   run up the      centre    of the      pitch

towards     the -Spion Hop,      making     obscene gestures at           the opposing

supporters.          He was detained.



Minutes     later an elde rl y Li ve rp oo l       supporter w ea v ed up the           pitch

ma ki ng   "V" signs at the Fo re st         fans.         He was detained.



A man climbed out of the             S S ta nd a nd said that      he     was a doctor and

asked      if he could help.



A l t ho u gh the    public address      system a pp eared to have been operating                     the

noise of the crowd,          e x ac e r b a t e d by the    incursion of the two

Liverpool      s upporters     precluded my hearing what was               said.       I heard

nothing on my radio and had no                idea of what was          taking    place at      the

Leppings      LN end.



I a c co mp an ie d the doctor       to the oppoosite end and he went                  to tend to

 Following         briefing the N Stand,                 I comm en ce d s u p e r v i s o r y foot    patrol

 were    seen parked a n d u n a t t e n d e d           in the car      park.         As officers      from

 Insp ec to r BATEMAN* s serials                  arrived,      I d i r e c t e d them to prevent

 were w al k in g        along P e n i s to n e RD towards          the G r o u n d .



 About      that       time,   a coach c o nt ai ni ng L i ve rp oo l        s up po r te r s    drove a long

* After 2 - 50       pm (1450)         Inspector B U R G E S S a nd        I began to          patrol        back

 t o wards     the ground,            talking with fans en route.



 I a r r i v e d outside        the g round a p p r o x i m a t e l y 3 - 0 5       pm (1505)-           I saw the

 N o t t i n g h a m E ve ni ng Post         reporter,    T o ny DONNELLY,            and three Notts,

 officers       in the v icinity of the                 car   park entrance-



 O n my walk         towards     the ground,         I clearly h ea rd S u p e r i n t e n d e n t M A R S H A L L

 radio    for       "gate to be opened"            on two s ep ar at e          occasions-             After     the

 second       call,    in w hi ch there were             screams and           cries of        panic     in the

 background,          I heard a controller a d vi s e                that      " Sergeants 9 16 a nd 993

 have    been sent to open the gates ,"                       I then h eard Mr M A R S H A L L ask for

 the game t o         be p o stp oned for f i ft e en mintues-                    I h eard no reply.



 At 3 , 0 5    pm    (1505),      I spoke to PC          1200 W O O D W A R D who was stan di ng at the

 car    park entrance          gate a nd w a r n e d him that              I e x p e c t e d a g ro up of

 a ro u n d f ifty F orest            fans to try and         climb      into the ground,



 I then h eard a huge                 roar   from the L iv e rp o ol         end of the g ro un d f ol l ow e d

 by silence.           S ec o n d s    later,    I saw P S DENT and two other Dog H an d le r s

 emerge from their              vehicles,        leash their dogs a n d               ran towards            "0" gate.

 I heard nothing            on my       radio,



 I en te re d the        ground and went           down the         ramp to the             p erimeter track           in

 front    of the S pi on Hop.                 I there    satf S u p e r i n t e n d e n t   C H A P M A N who

 i n st r u c t e d me to form a cordon facing                    the S p i o n Kop,           I saw what

 s eemed to be a pitch invasion at the L e p p i ng s L N / N S t a n d                             corner of the

 ground,        I c o nt in ue d the          cordon along the track,                 a ss i st i ng    in

 pushing several F ore st                fans    off the fence           from w here          they had clim be d
                                                                                                       PAGE      5


as t ho ug h to get          onto the field,                I then m o v e d to the front           of the S

Stand,      which      is unfenced.             I saw Liam 0 *K A N E s t an di ng on the            pitch but

no players-           T he n A rc hi e GEiiliILL and Ron F E N T O N w a l k e d from the

players      tunnel       and g es tu r e d to the F or es t s u p po r te r s          to    cease their

chanting a nd gesturing.



I saw a y o u ng Liverpool                  s up po rt er   run up the      centre     of the      pitch

towards      the S p io n Hop,           m ak in g   o bsc en e gest ur es at        the opposing

supporters.           He was detained.



M i nutes    later an e lderly Liv er po ol                  supp or te r w e a v e d up the       pitch

making      "V" signs at the F orest                  fans.         He was detained.



A m an    climbed out of the                 S S t a n d a nd said that       he     was a doctor and

a sk ed   if he       could help.



A l t h o u g h the    public address             s ystem a p pe a r e d to have been o p er at in g the

noise of the           crowd,        e x a c e r b a t e d by the    i n cu rs io n of the two

L ive rp oo l     s u p po rt er s    prec lu de d my hearing what was                said.       I heard

nothing      on my      radio and had no              idea of what was             taking    place at the

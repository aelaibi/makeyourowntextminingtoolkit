             I write following our introductory meeting on 25 August, which I found
             helpful.  You will appreciate that matters have progressed and
             Mr Geoffrey Dear has now been formally appointed as the Investigating
             Officer after the request made by the Director of Public Prosecutions to
             Mr Wright for a full criminal enquiry.

             The investigation is well under way and it is obvious that there will be
             a very large number of statements and other evidence produced.  This has
             prompted me to consider the question of the future availability of the
             evidence, in particular, for the Coroner for the purpose of the inquest
             and for Mr Wright for the purpose of disciplinary or civil proceedings.

             When the enquiry is complete, in the usual way, copies of the
             Investigating Officer's report, together with statements and other
             evidence, will be sent to you as the supervising member of the Police
             Complaints Authority and to Mr Wright for transmission to the Director.
             I take the view that it would be of benefit to me and also to the Coronet
             and Mr Wright if, at this early stage, you would concur with my opinion
             that there should be no objection to the Coroner and Mr Wright having
             access to the evidence for the purposes I have referred to above.   I say
             this having regard to the unusual nature of the investigation which is
             looking, not only at the potential criminal responsibilities of those
             police officers involved, but also the possibility of criminal
             proceedings being issued against the other bodies and persons whom we
             mentioned during the meeting on 25 August.  Obviously this evidence
             could only be made available after the Director had concluded any
             criminal proceedings or decided that no such proceedings were to be
             issued.



   PLEASE REPLY TO THE OFFICE AT                  Lloyd. House, _Birmingham

I am sure that this course can be adopted in the special circumstances
of this unusual investigation and that by taking this decision at an
early stage there can be considerable savings for the public purse,
without any prejudice to the criminal enquiry or subsequent proceedings.

I have discussed this matter with Mr Newell and Mr Cleugh of the Crown
Prosecution Service who agree that this course of action could properly
be adopted and to whom I have sent a copy of this letter.

I look forward to hearing from you on this matter, however, if in the
meantime I can be of any assistance please do not hesitate to contact me.

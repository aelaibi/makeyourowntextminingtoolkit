                                 DOUGLAS JOHN LOCK

    CHIEF SECURITY OFFICER - SHEFFIELD WEDNESDAY FOOTBALL CLUB



Mr LOCK was on duty at the match and can give all the information required

regarding the club facilities and his actions on the day, much of which is

relevant to this presentation.     None of his evidence in relation to this

presentation is in the form of a C.J.A. Statement.




SUMMARY OF EVIDENCE AVAILABLE



S 671 - This is a C.J.A. Statement but deals only with the S.W.F.C. missing

video tapes.   It is dated 2 May 1989.




S 671A - Although headed 'Statement1, this is a photo-copy of this witnesses

recollections and contains much non evidential material.     There are several

pertinent questions which the defence may wish to put to this witness and

which have never been addressed.     This document appears to be signed and

dated 23 May 1989.

Yorkshire                                   STATE:


My     date of birth is                                         I am presently Chief of
Security          with        Sheffield          Wednesday Football           Club           at    their
ground        at       lillsborough.              My   employment       in        that        post      is
part-time           aad my main duties are on match days, but I -work on
a     part-time basis through the whole year - not just                                       confined
to the football season.


My main career was in the Police Force for some 30 years until
I     retired          on     28th     February,        1985.     At      the          time       of    my
retirement             I     had     the rank of Superintendent, in                      the       South
Yorkshire Police Force and I was promoted tc Superintendent in
about         1979/80              after     spending     one    year        as         an        Acting
Superintendent.


I     was     based at Hammerton Road Police Station, working in                                        FI
Sub-Division                which     covers       the northern area              of     Sheffield,
including           Hillsborough.                From Football Season         1982/3 until               I
retired            I   was,-        under        the direct     command           of     the       Chief
Superintendent, in charge of policing the Hillsborough Ground.
For     the 3 seasons that I was the Superintendent in charge                                           of
policing           the       Hillsborough Ground the Club had 1 year in                                the
Second        Division,             1 year when they were promoted from                           Second
Division to first Division, and then in 1984/5 a season in the
First        Division.              During       this period there were matches                   with
some very big crowds, for                        even in the    first of those years the
Club        was     contending             for    promotion to      the       First           Division
although ultimately it did not succeed in that year.
During     that        spell        Inspector Clive Calvert       was        my        Liaison
Officer        and     he        and I had a good deal of       contact           with     the
Sheffield       Wednesday            Club.    Such liaison was     mainly with the
Secretary       of the Club - in the early stages Eric England                             and
latterly        Dick        Chester - and each game that the                Club        played
throughout           the        season was categorised according to the                   Gate
which     we    would            expect, not least dependent      on the           kind     of
following       that the visiting team would have.                 As I recall the
games     were categorised as A, B or C.                  A category C game would
involve        crowds           of up to say 20,000 people; category B up                   to
30,000 people? and category A where yet larger crowds would be
expected.            There would be meetings with the Club prior-to the
start     of the football season proper, when the fixtures                               would
be     known,        and the categories for each game would be                         agreed.
Each     category involved a consequent minimum level of policing
and     since the Club have to contribute to the cost of policing
they     have        a financial interest in the matter.                I        would     say
however        that        in     my dealings with Sheffield       Wednesday              they
have     always        been        prepared to accept the level             of     policing
which     we thought proper and not tried to influence us to keep
the     numbers        of        Police Officers down for       cost        reasons.         I
should         also        add     that   even   though   the    games           would      be
categorised           at        the start of the season if, for          any           reason,
during     the        season things changed - e.g. if one of the                         Clubs
involved        had a successful run so that a larger crowd might be
expected - we could and did re-categorise matches.


Other     factors           were also involved of course in the                  level      of
policing we might require.                   We would typically liaise with the
Police     Force           for     the visiting Clubs'- home     town            for     added
intelligence from them as to the fans that might be expected.


About 2 weeks prior to each game Inspector Calvert and I would
have     meetings          with the Chief Superintendent and                the        Deputy
Chief     Superintendent              to discuss the policing for the                  forth­
coming     match,           and then having established the contingent                      of
Officers        required we would go to the Football Liaison                           Office
at South Yorkshire Police Headquarters at Snig Hill, Sheffield
to     arrange        extra manpower from other Divisions -               e.g.         from
Road     Traffic Division, Mounted Police, and (where                     necessary)
Dog     Handlers.            Within a week of the match we would             normally
have     confirmation of the extra manpower available to us,                            and
then     Clive        Calvert and I would discuss the whole matter                      and
draw     up        an operational plan to be put into operation on                      the
day     of     the match.           This operational plan would        include,          in
particular,           deployment of Police Officers within and                   outside
the Ground.


Our     policy was to use Officers from F Division in those areas
where        there was likely to be pressure or problems because                         of
their        familiarity with the Hillsborough area.                 Thus we always
tended        to     use the same group of Officers for duties                   on     the
pitch,        not least because if trouble were to arise their faces
would        be well recognised by regular fans who would perhaps be
more     ready        to     approach them and report         matters.       Officers
would        also be deployed on duty for off-loading coach loads of
visiting            fans      and     escorting   them   to    the   Ground            from
particular           areas, and likewise in relation to special trains.
When     large        crowds        of visiting fans were expected          we    would
control        their        arrival     by   close liaison    with    the        Traffic
Division,           who would direct traffic along a particular                   route;
coaches        coming        off     the Ml would, for example, be          asked        to
exit     at a Junction at Tankersley where there is a very                            large
lay-by        and     they would be stopped in that lay-by and fans                      on
board        would     have        tickets checked.   Care would be         taken        to
co-ordinate           the     arrival of coaches and trains so           that,          for
example,           if a train-load of fans was expected the arrival                      of
a     group of coaches might be delayed until those fans arriving
on     the     train had been escorted to the            Ground.         Furthermore
coaches        were always directed to offload in a particular area,
then     to follow a particular route around the Ground and                           park
in      Cole        Road. After the match all visiting fans would                     then
be     escorted from the Ground back via Cole Road to the coaches
or trains, as the case may be.
When     the       operational plans were drawn up copies would go                       to
each     particular                group of Officers - i.e.       Traffic      Division,
Mounted Police, etc. and they would detail the duties for each
particular section of men.                      A copy of the operational plan was
always        given to the Secretary of Sheffield Wednesday Football
Club in advance of the match.


On     Match Day, before kick-off, I would brief all the Officers
on     duty.        Those            briefings normally took      place     within      the
Ground,        either              in the vicinity of the Police Room or in             the
gymnasium depending on how many Officers were involved.                               After
a    general briefing to all, the Inspectors and Sergeants would
then     be separately briefed in more detail, but all                         briefings
essentially broke down the operation into 3 phases:-


1.      The period up to kick-off;
2.      The        period from kick-off until 10 minutes before the end
        of the match;
3.      From 10 minutes before the end to dispersal of crowds.


During        my        3        seasons   in   charge we never    had     a   F.A.     Cup
semi-final              played at Hillsborough and to my recollection                   the
largest        crowd              we. had was one of about 48,000 people          for     an
evening        match with a 7.30 p.m. kick-off.                   On that occasion         I
recall that the                    crowd of fans arriving was suchthat it became
obvious that we                    could not get everyone into the        Ground in time
for kick-off.                    When that was reported to me by my Officers, we
approached              the        Club Secretary - I believe it was           then     Dick
Chester        - and asked him whether the start of the match                         could
be     delayed              bo      that all the fans could be brought         into      the
ground.            We        received prompt agreement to that             request, the
start     was put back for 15 minutes and we announced this                             over
the     P.A. system to the crowd.                   That relieved the pressure and
in fact by 7.35 p.m. or thereabouts all the fans were in.
                                                   -    5    -




Because         of my experience of and interest in policing football
crowds,         following            my     retirement from the Force                 I    wrote      a
series      of       3    articles for a local newspaper,                       the       Sheffield
Telegraph,           on       this        topic.       Subsequently I          did        appear     on
television on a couple of occasions in discussions on football
and     the football supporters' hooliganism problems and I wrote
some articles for the Police Review.


It    was       after the tragedy at the Heysel football                              stadium        in
Belgium         that I recall I was contacted by Superintendent                                    John
Freeman         of the South Yorkshire Police who told me that hfe was
calling         at       the request of Dick Chester to enquire whether                               I
might       be interested to join Sheffield Wednesday Football Club
as    their          Security Officer.                 Having retired from the Force                  I
was     not working at that time, and I went to see Dick                                     Chester
and        following            a     discussion             with    him   I    accepted            the
appointment.


In    my        post as Chief of Security I was involved with                                general
matters          of crowd safety and I was of course familiar with the
Green       Code,         the Safety of Sports Grounds Act 1975,                            and     the
 recommendations               of         the Popp1ewe11 Inquiry.              I therefore          had
 these      matters           very        much in mind in performing                 my     task     as
 Security Officer. _ One of the early things that I did after my
 appointment             was to check all the gates around the stadium and
 to     change the padlocks on those gates to a common padlock                                        so
 that every gate could be opened with the same key.                                       The Police
 were       supplied with 2 of those keys - I gave them to Inspector
 Calvert         - so that they could copy as many as they wished.                                        I
 also       provided keys to each of the stewards within the                                     Ground
 who were manning gateB.


 I    also       checked in relation to fire precautions and                                 I     found
 that       a    number of alarms and extinguishers were                              not        readily
 accessible              on    match        day - the position was              that        the     Fire
 Brigade             would      inspect        the          Ground   without     a        full     crow<
 present,            and during matches certain gates may be locked whic!
would     otherwise             be     open    or other changes              made       which        the
Brigade        apparently             had not realised.          I arranged             for     those
matters to be put right.


All     matters          relating           to the erection of          perimeter              fences,
gates     in     the          fences, the siting of crash                barriers              in    the
standing        areas etc.             were, I believe, dealt with between                           the
Club     and     the        Committee          set    up    by   the     Local          Authority,
pursuant        to       the      Safety of Sports Grounds Act.                     I     know        for
example        that        up     to 1985 the central pen at the                    west            stand
(Leppings        Lane)           end was not divided by the fence                       which'        now
runs     from        the        centre of the mouth of the tunnel                        under        the
stand,       down        to      the    perimeter fence.            There       was        a        crush
barrier        about          12' in from the mouth of the tunnel                         entrance,
and     my     recollection             is that the positioning of                      that        crush
barrier        relatively close to the entrance from the tunnel                                       was
capable        of     causing          a build-up of fans at the mouth                         of     the
tunnel         and       it      was    often        necessary     to        deploy       a     Police
Constable           on     either       side of the tunnel              to     ensure          orderly
dispersal           of the crowd within the pen.                   Subsequently                however
that         crush       barrier        was     removed      and    the        fence          erected,
presumably at the request of the Safety Committee.


The     gates in the perimeter fence are                         closed, but not locked,
during        matches           so     far    as I am aware.            The     gates          are     so
designed        that          the latch cannot be easily opened from                            inside
the     pen, and the position is that the gates would normally be
manned        outside           by stewards and Police Officers.                         The        gates
opened        outwards on to the pitch area,‘and to open them it was
merely        necessary to press down on the Spring-loaded latch                                       to
release        it.         I     do     recall       that   after       my     appointment             as
Security        Officer              I was a little concerned that some                        of     the
advertising              boards        on    the perimeter of the              pitch          extended
partly        across           the mouth of those gates and could                        create        an
obstruction              and I arranged for the boards to be moved or,                                 if
necessary           reduced in length, to prevent any possibility of an
obstruction arising.
I     also took steps to upgrade the Public Address System at the
Ground     and       indeed last year the P.A. System              was     completely
replaced        with     a     new, more powerful, system.           Part        of     the
reason     for        this     was that I was conscious of          the        fact     the
P.A. System          was an essential part of the emergency evacuation
procedures           at the Club.     Standing rules provided for a                   coded
message        to    be announced over the P.A. and this                 announcement
would     be        an indication to Police Officers and Stewards                      that
emergency           evacuation procedures were in force.             The       Stewards
were     then         required to take up       positions at their               exitsand
gates,     and         to     open   those gates.    I   made      Bure that           this
evacuation           procedure was tested on match days to be satisfied
that     it would work efficiently in the event of an evacuation.
Indeed        in the 1988/89 season which is just drawing to a close
we     have had 2 emergency evacuation tests in which the                         Police
were also involved.              Their part waB co-ordinated via Inspector
Sewell        and      on the occasion of       these tests the coded                  message
would     be broadcast and then           we    would check quickly round the
Ground     to see that all the gateB had in fact been thrown open
and were manned by Stewards.


Following the Popplewell report the proper training of fit and
able     Stewards        was     a recommendation.       In fact     many        of     the
Stewards        at     Football Grounds are older men who                may     perhaps
have     retired or be approaching retirement from their                         regular
work     so     that it is not always possible to have Stewards                         who
are     fully        fit from the point of view of youth             and        fitness.
Where     possible, however, younger candidates were recruited as
Stewards        and     I    did take steps to ensure that           training           was
available           to them.     Thus, at the beginning of the season, for
the     last 3 seasons, I have had 2 training evenings                         organised
at     the Club.        The first evening is for gatemen, catering                      and
ground        staff, and the second evening concentrates on training
of     Stewards.            On both evenings there are demonstrations                   and
instructions           given     on first aid; there is a talk by                Station,
Officer        Miles        of the local Fire Brigade re fire             precautions
and     fire duties; there is a talk by a Police Inspector                                 (this
year     Inspector Sewell) on emergency procedures; and finally I
talk to them about Ground Regulations and we finish off with a
video     of the Bradford and Heysel disasters in the context                                   of
stewarding        of    soccer        grounds,       a        video     produced      by     the
Metropolitan Police.


In     addition the Stewards are given written instructions as to
their     duties       on    match days.          Initially these              were     printed
sheets     given to them at the beginning of each season,-but                                   of
late I have altered the system slightly so that each match day
employee is provided with a booklet at the commencement of the
season,     which       he has to sign for.                  This booklet        contains        a
separate        sheet       for     each home match, which can be used                     as    a
signed     receipt for payment of wages for match day duties.                                   In
the back of the booklet are printed the instructions for match

day staff.


 I also caused to be produced a Management Information Sheet on
 "Use    and     Training          of Stewards" which was given to                    all       the
 administrative         staff        at the Club, to ensure that                  there         was
 Management       awareness          among all of them of the functions                         and
 duties of Stewards and part-time staff.


 Finally,       on the match day itself, Stewards are briefed by the
 Police,       usually in groups for each of the 4 separate areas of
 the Ground - north, south, eaBt and west.


 The     Officer       in overall charge of policing -Hillsborough                              for
 several        seasons           until       earlier          this     year      was       Chief
 Superintendent             Brian     Mole.       Mr. Mole took over these                 duties
 very     shortly       after I retired, following the death                          of    Chief
 Superintendent Brian Moseley.                     Mr. Mole was one of those Chief
 Superintendents who took a very active or hands-on approach to
 being     in     charge          of policing Hillsborough and I                  had      worked
 fairly closely with
                "- — him in my
                     --- -   j position
                               *•       as Chief of Security of-

 the Ground up to the point where he was transferred to another
Division       in     about March of this year.              During his      spell           in
F Division          he had been in charge of 2 F.A. Cup semi-finals at
Hillsborough          -      Coventry City v. Leeds United and in                 1987/88
Season,       Liverpool v. Notts. Forest.              Inspector Clive           Calvert
had    worked        as      his Liaison Officer up to and           including          the
1987/88       F.A.        Cup semi-final but he was then transferred                        and
his replacement was Inspector Sewell.


When     Brian       Mole      was    transferred from        F   Division        he    was
replaced       by Chief Superintendent David Duckenfield and Super­
intendent          Duckenfield'b        first match at Hillsborough - v a a                  on
Saturday,            let     April,    1989    when    the    visiting      team       were
Millwall       F.C.        and   the crowd was relatively small                 and    well
behaved.


The     Club       was involved in an evening match on Wednesday,                           5th
April,       against         Wimbledon F.C. and again on that              occasion           I
met      Chief        Superintendent          Duckenfield     and   also        Inspector
Sewell.        After       that match had started, at about 7.45 p.m.                        we
pulled        in     all the Chief Stewards into a meeting                 to     discuss
with     them       the      arrangements for the        forthcoming        semi-final
between        Liverpool         and Notts, ForeBt.          In addition to           the     4
Chief        Stewards        also     present were                   (who        keeps        a
running        check       on turnstiles on match days and            arranges              for
change         to      be"    available       etc.),                            (who         is
responsible           for payment of Stewards),                             and
                We discussed with them what extra Stewards we                          would
require        for     the semi-final, for their differing sections                          of
the     Ground, and we needed to have details of numbers etc.                                so
that     special           passes could be organised for those              additional
Stewards.           Because each Chief Steward knows his own area                       well
and     we knew we would have a capacity crowd for the semi-final
their        views were very much listened to and heeded in terms of
what extra Btewarding was required.


On     the     day of the Cup semi-final I arrived at the Ground                             at
approximately 9.45 a.m. and parked my car at the Leppings Lane
end of Fielding Road.               I entered the Ground, and carried out a
general        tour     of      inspection around the whole Ground            in   the
period up to about 10.45 a.m.                 I recall that Roger Houldsworth
was     at     the Ground and indeed I assisted him by                 footing     the
ladder       for him whilst he was carrying out some repairs to one
of     the Police cameras in the west stand area near the                      Police
control        box.        I    also entered the control box and          spoke     to
P.C. Mick        Ryan who iB the regular Police Radio Operator and I
left     with       him one of the Sheffield Wednesday            F.C.     personal
radios.        These personal radios had all been serviced prior                    to
the     match and I distributed additional radios to each-of                       the
4     nead     Stewards? 1                           L to Cr&ham Maokroll          And

another        to                        his Admin. Manager; 1 for the         Office
staff        generally?         1   to                one of my    Stewards        who
performs        a flexible role at my direction? 1 for the Turnstile
Room staff; and the 12th one I retained myself.


I     told     the     Stewards that there would be a briefing                by   the
Police        Inspectors at 11.15 a.m., having already been informed
of that by Inspector Sewell.


I     recall        that       about 11.30 a.m. I went back       to    the    Police
control box when there were a number of other Officers present
besides        P.C.        Ryan.     One I recall was Sergeant         Goddard     but
there        were others whom I cannot now recall.            I had a         general
chat     with        them, they had no special requests, and              I    walked
back      from there to the offices in the south stand.                   I    recall
that when walking back briefings were then in progress in each
of the four areas of the Ground.


The     turnstiles were opened to admit ticket holders from about
 11.30 a.m.          Each set of turnstiles is covered by a CCTV camera
and     there         is a facility for recording the pictures taken                 by
 each     of     those cameras.           Each video tape however        lasts     only
 3    hours and we discussed the position and agreed that we would
 only switch on the cassettes from 12 .3Q p.m.
I     recall       that        at about 12 noon I checked            on     the        computer
print-out          and at that stage there were 600 ticket holders                                in
the     Ground.           I walked around the outside of the                     stadium          to
check       on tie position, and there were at that stage a                              number
of      fans       in     the     area       but    many   more    Nottingham            Forest
supporters          than Liverpool supporters.                   In walking around             the
Ground        I    checked        with       all    the    Car    Park    attendants           and
reminded          them     of the arrangements for that day                     where        there
were     2 different types of car park ticket - one for those who
were     entitled to park and leave their cars, and one a                                permit
merely        allowing          people to drop off passengers.                   I     reminded
them        also    that any vehicle not in the car park by 2.30                              p.m.
should        be excluded until 5 minutes after kick-off - this is a
standard           procedure          on busy match days, to avoid any                  traffic
hazard        witi       the     large number of fans who would                  be     in     the
vicinity.


I     was     back       in the offices by about 12.30                   p.m.    and     having
checked           with    the office staff I re-entered the control                            room
where        P.C. Harold Guest waB present for the Police,                             together
with        Roger Eouldsworth and a representative from the                             Company
who had installed the CCTV system.


At     about 1 p.m. I left the control room, which is immediately
adjacent           to     the     players'         entrance, and went           out    to      that
entrance           where        I .met with Superintendent Glynn Marsh                      and     a
Police         Sergeant. . Superintendent Marsh explained that he                                 had
come        out     to     see     the       Police    operation     generally,              having
recently           taken over an operations' group in the Force, and                                I
gave . him          and        the Sergeant a tour of the            control           room.        I
 recall        that       at     about       that time I also       had     a     visit        from
    Inspector       Calvert        who had been called in to assist                     at     this
    special       match,        and    was     in charge of the Kop             area     of       the
 Ground.           I knew him well of course, Inspector Calvert                              having
 been       my     Liaison Officer in the days when I was                        involved          iff
    policing the Ground.
?




    Sometime       between 1.35 and 1.45 p.m. the Liverpool team                              coach
    arrived, fallowed shortly afterwards by the Notts. Forest team
    coach.     I recall that outside the players' entrance there were
    a     number    ©f fans awaiting the arrival, again                        mainly        Notts.
    Forest     fans        but some Liverpool fans also.                 A number        of     the
    fans     were pressing forward at the arrival of the players, and
    a Mounted Police Officer eased his horse through the crowd and
    pushed     the* back.             I clearly recall that the Mounted                  Officer
    was     wearing a white shirt which would indicate to me that                                he
    was     brought        in to assist from an outside Police Force -                          The
    South     Yorks.           Police wear regulation blue shirts.                     r--recall
    this     instance          particularly for 2 reasons - in the c our Be                     of
    the     manoenvre the horse seemed to be a little excitable, and
    a     middle-aged man with a Liverpool accent complained that the
    horse     had     stepped          on his foot and indeed his               footwear        was
    visibly        dented.        I recall that Kenny Dalglish, the                    Liverpool
    Manager,       went        to speak to the fan, and Superintendent                       Roger
    Greenwood       was present and I suggested to him that the                              Police
    horse     waB     unnecessary for the type of duty at                       the     players'
    entrance.             He     agreed    that     South      Yorks.     Police        did     not
    normally        me         Mounted    Officers in that situation,                  and     said
    that     he would deal with the matter at the later                         de-briefing.
    Superintendent               Greenwood        was    in    charge     of    the          Police
    contingent        on       duty    on the pitch.          I walked    down        from     the
    players'        eatrance through the players' tunnel on to the pitch
    with     him    and after chatting for a little while                        returned        to
    the Control Room at about 1.55 p.m.


    At     about 2 p.m. one of the employees from the Turnstile                                Room
    popped     into        the Control Room to see what the                    crowd     already
    entering        the        Ground was like.         My recollection is             that     the
    computer        print-out          showed     that boihb 24,000        fans        were     in,
    mostly     in     the        south stand and the Kop are a             (Kotts.           Forest
    supporters)           and     a lesser number In the west and north                       stand
    areas.     At regular interval::; ther;                   ,er the Police Control Box
    staff     would radio in (on one* occasion they need the                            internal
    land     line     telephone) to check with ue what the e,iz&                         of     the-
crowd     was       as     demonstrated on the                computer        print-out,              and
generally           either         P.C. Guest or I would answer them and                             give
them     the        figure.         It was noticeable that the                 Notts.           Forest
areas         of    the        Ground      were        filling     up    first.            This       was
demonstrated             both       on    the     T.V. monitors          and        also       on     the
computer           print™out.            We have a separate me ..itor                within           the
Control        Rot*       for       each of the CCTV cameras                  trained          on     the
various        turnstiles            and the players' entrance.                      In     addition
there     is        aa    extra          monitor which is linked               to     the       Police
cameras        and where we do not have a recording facility but                                        we
can     switch,          at the press of a button, from one                          Police          T.V.
camera to another to see what pictures they are displaying.


Between            2,30     and      2.40       p.m.     it   we        noticeable          that          a
significant              number of fans were arriving at the Leppings Lane
end      of        the    Ground.           This       was    noticeable        in        particular
through        the Police monitor from the Police camera situated on
top     of     the        south west corner of the west star.d.                            I    recall
that     at        about 2.40 p.m. there was an announcement                               over        the
Police        radio        {P.C. Guest had one in the Control                         Room)          that
Leppings           Lane        was closed to traffic because of the                            build-up
in     that        area. I looked on the monitor at the                         Leppings             Lane
picture            aad         I   recall        the    impression        I    had        was        that
immediately              outside         the turnstiles in the area of the                          metal
gate     there           was       a very tight crush of people.                     Just        behind
them     was        en area which did not seem so densely                            packed,           and
then      further behind again in Leppir-gs Lane there seemed to be
 a     solid       crush of people coming along.                    I cannot ■ y                however
 that     1        noticed any evidence of misbehaviour amor.:.;                           the       fans
 near     the        tarnstile           area.     However there was            a     substantial
 number        of    fans waiting to get into the ground with                                  kick-off
 time approaching.


 By     2.50 p.®. the computer showed that there were about 4 5 f000
 fans     in the Ground.                  I cannot recall e-            report, of          problems,
 but     on        the    Police         monitor it was          nc-icet-hie         that           crowds
 outside           the Leppings Lane: ^ates had increasec, and they                                   vrere

                                                                                                     . - /. .
pushing     forward       and there w a e quite a crush.       The     computer
print-out        indicated that there were about 2,000 spaces                  still
to     be filled in the north stand area, and about 2,500 in                     the
west     Btand area as I recall.          On the monitor I saw a          Mounted
Police     Officer        in the crowd at the Leppings Lane end and               he
seemed     to be the same Officer ae had earlier been involved at
the players' entrance.            From the T.V. picture his horBe seemed
to     shy and slip into something of a splayed leg position, and
then recovered and this was an indication to me tf st the crush
out     there was increasing.          Then suddenly Gate C opened and                 a
crowd     of spectators burst through and P.C. Harold Guest                     said
something like "The gate's gone".               1 immediately left i            room
in     something        of a hurry, as I was concerned that thi                 :,u:
cause     problems        and   that   further help j.ight     be    nee^nid      in
manning        that gate or indeed other gates around the Ground                  to
which     the     problem       of fans trying to get    in    quickly         could
spread.         Because of that, on my way out of the Control                  Room,
I      indicated to P.C. Janet Cruttenden who was just outside the
Directors'        <. trance, thi t she should step inside the entrance
if      there    were any trouble and to the 2 administrative                  staff
who     were at the players' entrance I said that I would arrange
 for     extra    Stewards.        I   called   _______________     the    Senior
Steward         in the south Btand area, to join me at the Directors'
 entrance        and    I asked him to provide 2 burly Stewards at               the
 entrance        to    reinforce the staff there, explaining           what      had
 happened at C G a t e .


 From     then I wanted to make my way over to the C Gate and went
 down     the players' tunnel on to the pitch,            ks I walked          along
 the     side     towards the west stand area I met           Graham      Mackrell
 about     half way between the tunnel and the Police control box.
 I     told him my concern as to what heel happened at Gate C,                    and
 he     said     "Leave     it to me" and turned and vent, back           in     that
 direction.           I recall looking and seeing that each of the north
 and     south        "wings”   of the Leppincs Lana terracing         vc;..      »ot_
 over-crowded, but the centre pen seemed very fv.11.
I     started to return, and at this stage the players from                          both
teams     were on the pitch but the match had nor started yet.                              I
had     to wait, because the gangway toward? the players'                        tunnel
was crowded with members of the media waiting for Brian Clough
to     arrive.    He came down and sat in his seat/ and then I                        was
able     to walk back up through the players' tunnel speaking                           to
the      Stewards as I did so.              I went back into the Control              Room
and             Harold       Gues    said to me, m    a             -■■-■ice Doug,
they have opened the gates" .               Roger Houldsworth was not there.
I     ran back through the players' tunnel s h e w i n g            as I ran into
my personal       radio calling up the Chief £                   rd e,t    the          st
end,      Stuart       Thorpe,       asking him what in u-ippening.              I     ran
into     Graham       Mackrell and someone I & ■w know as- Glen                 Kirton,
an     F.A.     official, and told them that the Police                   had    opened
the     gates    at     the Leppings Lane end of the             Ground.         G„ sham
responded        to    the     effect "Can we get them in, are we                up     to
capacity?"       and     I responded that ws were          net.     I made my          way
down     towards the west            stand and then saw people climbing over
the     perimeter fences at that end of the pitch.                  At that point
a     Police Officer went onto the pitch and asked the Referee to
stop the gaae.


There     was a mass of people around the perimeter fence                        behind
the      goal    area and X am not able to saywhether               the gates           in
the      perimeter fence were opened to allow              people o u t .       I could
see     that     some people were being lifted over the top                     of     the
fence,        people appeared to be lying on the ground injured, and
many were wandering arouni in a di :sd condition ; id in obvious
distress.         I    helped        a number of people in th.             state back
towards        the players' tunnel are?. r .id into the south stand                     so
that     they coold             be comforted and h ped.
                                                   - I recall that -is of

stretchers        which       were stored ci       ip cf the cupboard in              ti^&t
Bar so that they could be need.
At     one    pint I recall that Brian Clough stopped me and                             said
"Sir,        I wt     you to find the Directors and the F.A. Officials
and     tell * e m I am putting my players in the bath and                        taking
them        hatmT     Hr. Clough knew that I worked wi h the Club                          for
I     had     b n introduced to him earlier that d                  ,    I was        aware
of     the     fiet    that     there     was a   meeting     going       on     in        the
Directors' room           to     discuss the situation, which              we         still
unclear        a§ I went into that rcuia to tell the : rectc s                           what
Mr.     Clouglhad said.             The message, in effect, was that                  the:
could        be m thought given to re-c            aencing the                 when            a

full natua of the tragedy was not known.


It     was at*bout that point I realised that the*;., had been                               no
announces** over the Public Address System in accordance with
the      emerpacy        arrangements        and procedures l&id           down.           The
South        Ycsfchire     Police are in ch&roe of the              Public       Address
System        lathe sense that they have an override system and the
emergency procedures stipulated that the Police would make the
necessary Iroadcast.                I therefore used my personal radio                      and
instructeiall Stewards to unlock the gates c                            ad the ground.
I      got repies from some of them only, t d I recall I spoke to
                      and asked him to get .round and ensure                   that         the
gates were opened all the way around.


 I     recoiled:      that     I was also      approached      by       Superintendent
Roger        G n m w o o d who said he wanted to take F             ny Dalglish and
 Brian       Cl«?h     to the Police Control Bos to                     dcast    to         the

 there by      2   relatively unobetrueted route.

NEW INTRODUCTION TO COVER HIS RETIREMENT AND STATUS ON 15 APRIL
1989.

During the previous four years I had worked all football matches

   Hillsborough Football Ground.    My duties consisted of working

in the video room in company with Chief Security Officer, Mr
Loc k.

Under the ground regulations in respect of the amount allowed in

each section of the ground, it is my duty to check with the

computer, the number of persons who have entered and then the

number of persons outside the ground about to enter, to make sure

that no more persons are allowed into that area than the

regulations set.    If there are, to inform Control to arrange for

turnstiles to be closed and for the persons outside the ground to

be moved to an area where there is sufficient room to accommodate

them.    This is very important at a no ticket match where the

numbers attending are not known in advance.

On a ticket match this role becomes a watching brief with the

main concerns being persons turning up at the match without

tickets.   The video room is situated near to the players'

entrance on the South Stand.   My duties are to liaise with the

Club and the Police.   Any problems which may arise on behalf of

the Club are passed over to Mr Lock, and those which involve the

Police are forwarded by radio or telephone through to the Control
Room.

* Does he have a club radio?



In this room there are twenty TV monitors which are covered by

cameras which are strategically placed around the ground to cover

all 95 turnstiles.   There is also a TV monitor which can be

operated by a switch which will operate and show any view by the

cameras operated from the Police Control Box.    There is also a

computer which shows all 95 turnstiles and can tell at any time

during a match how many persons have passed through each

turnstile at   any given point.

Each section   of the ground is shown in separate columns, each

column shows   a number of turnstiles for that area   and how many

persons have   passed through each turnstile and at the bottom of

each column the total is shown for that area of the ground.

There are six areas of the ground recorded on the computer and at

the end there is a total shown for the full attendance in the

ground.   The computer scans all turnstiles and is updated every

two and a half seconds.



* To explain print out operation ie does monitor stop operating

while print out in progress?



On Saturday 15 April 1989, I was on duty for the Semi Final

between Liverpool and Nottingham Forest, and commenced my duties

 turnstiles were open, I switched all video recorders on to record

 all the fans as they were entering the ground via the turnstiles.

During the afternoon leading up to the kick off time at about

2.15 pm I noticed that the crowd appeared to be slow in arriving

at the turnstiles.      I am not sure of the size of the crowd but

believe it to be 25,000 and 30,000.



  Can he explain how he had passed figures to Control Box, to
whom   and by what means.



At 2.40 pm, that same date, I checked with the camera which

covers the Penistone Road area and noticed that there were very

few people in the streets and on checking the computer it was

showing 19,000 plus in the Spion Kop.     When each area of the

ground gets near to capacity the totals start to pulsate, the

total capacity for that area of the ground being 21,000, which

told me that nearly all the Nottingham supporters were in the

ground and it was near to full capacity.

I then switched to the camera that was covering the Leppings Lane

end of the ground and noticed that there was a large gathering of

fans in that area.   I could see that the fans were spread from

the turnstile entrance right back into Leppings Lane, fully

blocking the road.   I would estimate that there would be between

3,000 and 5,000 fans.     I made a check of the computer and saw

that the figures for the West Stand were pulsating and showing
HAROLD GUEST                                                PAGE 4




near *-° capacity and the Leppings Lane figures were showing

aPProximately 7,000 which would be near to capacity and the

computer would be at a point to start pulsating.      The figures on

the computer start to pulsate when the capacities get to within

15 percent of the total.



* Did he know turnstiles 9 - 1 0   being used for North Stand?



As I looked at the scene I could see the crowd getting larger and

many at the back of the crowd were surging forward pushing

violently towards the turnstiles.    From that point I could also

see Police officers trying to get the crowd into some sort of

order but they were being pushed to one side out of the way.        I

saw several missiles being thrown towards the Police.     A large

contingent of the fans were climbing the walls over the top of

the turnstiles, and they were landing on the asbestos roofs on

the inside of the ground and jumping on to people who were on the

inside of the ground to break their fall as they landed.

On the South Stand of this area, I saw a mounted Policeman being

pushed on his horse towards a large double door which leads into

the rear of the West Stand.

During all this, I could hear several officers, including

Superintendent Marshall, requesting further assistance in that

a r e a » for the double doors to be opened in order to let fans into

the ground to save a major incident outside, also for the match
HAROLD GUEST                                               PAGE 5




to be delayed for a further fifteen minutes.     At this point I

noticed that what I now know to be Gate 'C' was open, and there

was a surge of about 1,000 fans running into the ground.     I could

tell from the noises on the radios from the officers in that area

that the Liverpool fans were very boisterous and excited and

appeared to be heavily intoxicated with drink.

I then turned to the camera that was inside the ground and

covered the area of the West Stand and it was obvious that the

situation was getting out of hand and people were being pushed up

against the fencing on the perimeter of the ground.



* Clarify with him which camera?   The recording one or the actual

Police monitor?



At the point where things seemed to be getting out of hand

outside the turnstiles, I tried to use my personal radio in order

to contact Police Control that further Police assistance was

required urgently at the Leppings Lane end of the ground, but

each time I tried to use the radio I was blocking others already

using the radio, so I did not try further to use it.



* To be asked did he have a club radio and did he try to use

that?



I then tried to use the internal telephone system to contact
HAROLD GUEST                                                 PAGE 6




Police Control but again each time I tried the line was engaged

and I could not get through.



* Did they know that West Stand over capacity - did Lock know?



At this point Mr Lock then left the video room in order to

organise some safety measures with the security personnel.       Also

present during this time in the video room was a Mr Roger

Holdsworth.     He is the person   who installed all the videos and

computer system.    As he could    also see what was taking place, he

also left the room in order to assist in any way he could.

I could see that    all available officers were being sent to this

area of the ground to assist with the injured and dying.

I can say that during the time prior to the major incident the

Police personal radios were working well but during the day there

appeared to be some distortion and some messages could not be

read clearly.

During the incident,   I was trying to concentrate on messages

being received on the Police radio network but did not listen to

what was being transmitted on the back to back radio system owned

by the Club, as I knew Mr Lock would deal with any situation that

had developed.    After the incident I made a note of all the

people that had entered the ground as shown on the computer at

3.00 pm and they are as follows:
HAROLD GUEST                                             PAGE 7




Spion Kop                19,906
North Stand               8,109

South Stand covered       4,740

South Stand uncovered     3,255

Leppings Lane             7,038
West Stand                5,618
TOTAL                    48,666

These numbers would not give a true reading of the exact amount

of persons entering the ground due to the gates being opened.

It is my usual practice to pass the computer figures to the

Police Control Box usually speaking to either Police Constable

Ryan if I used the telephone or Police Sergeant Goddard if I used
the radio.

On the 15 April 1989 these figures were being passed by me until

approximately 2.40 pm.



* Can he remember who he spoke to and by what means?   Should also

be asked if the phone in the Club Control Room was in use at the

relevant times.

On 15 April 1989, I was employed in the capacity of Chief

Security Officer by the Sheffield Wednesday Football Club.

Prior to that I had served 30 years with the Police Service,

retiring in the rank of Superintendent in the South Yorkshire

Police on 28 February 1985.   At the time of my retirement I was

based at Hammerton Road Police Station and from 1982 until I

retired I was under the direct command of the Chief

Superintendent in charge of policing the Hillsborough Ground.

During that spell I had a good deal of contact with the

Sheffield Wednesday Football Club, mainly with the Secretary.

During my 3 seasons in charge, we never had an FA Cup Semi Final

played at Hillsborough and to my recollection, the largest crowd

we had was one of about 48,000 people for an evening match with

a 7.30 pm kick off.

In my post as Chief of Security at Sheffield Wednesday Football

Club I was involved with general matters of crowd safety and I

was of course familiar with the Green Code, the Safety of Sports

Grounds Act 1975 and the recommendations of the Popplewell
Inquiry.



* Paragraph here to describe layout, signing and Gates at

Leppings Lane end and his knowledge of turnstile allocation.

* Needs here to describe the club computer system, in particular

the grouping of crowd capacities ie totals of   1   -   8   , 8-16,

A - G etc.   Also needs to describe how computer flashes on

 sections when 85% of capacity is reached.    Also needs to explain

the printer ie can it print while screen is operational.     Also

how and why print out was made at 3.00 pm prompt.     Also why and

how 9 - 1 6   were well over capacity at this time when he says it

was 2,500 under at 2.50 pm.

* Needs to explain club video and recording system perhaps with

some detail of which video fitted which screen ie number and

turnstiles on screen with number on video recorder.

* Needs to explain the tannoy system and override.

* Needs to explain the club radio system and who had club
r a dios.

  Needs to explain briefly the internal telephone communication
system.

* Needs to explain if he can the stewarding system and how he

understood their duties, possibly in relation to those set out

in the Green Guide which he professes knowledge of.

* In relation to ghost statement of Guest - Can he set out

Guest's role and duties as he understands them?    Can he produce

the club video tape of Gate   'C'?



On 15 April 1989, I arrived at the ground at approximately 9.45

am and carried out my normal duties, ie liaising with Police,

Stewards and other club officials etc.

By 2.00 pm I was in the Club Control Room and at regular

intervals the Police Control Box staff would radio in * (which
DOUGLAS JOHN LOCK                                           PAGE 3




radio, Club/Police?)     (on one occasion they used the internal

telephone) to check with us what the size of the crowd was as

demonstrated on the computer screen and myself or Police

Constable Guest would tell them.



* When this is done on other matches to whom do they give the

figures.    PC Ryan?   PC Bichard?   PS Goddard?   Superintendent
Murray?



It was noticeable that the North Terrace areas of the ground

were filling up first.     This was obvious from the monitors and
the computer.

Between 2.30 pm and 2.40 pm it was noticeable that a significant

number of fans were arriving at the Leppings Lane end of the
ground.

I recall that there had been an announcement over the Police

radio that Leppings Lane had been closed to traffic because of

the build up in that area.

I looked on the monitor at the Leppings Lane picture and recall

the impression I had was that immediately outside the turnstiles

in the area of the metal gate there was a very tight crush of

people.    Just behind them was an area which did not seem so

densely packed and then further behind again in Leppings Lane

there seemed to be a solid crush of people coming along.
DOUGLAS JOHN LOCK                                            PAGE 4




* We need to know - Did he or Guest notice at this time that the

turnstiles were not operating properly as Murray had?        It was

their job to monitor turnstiles and they were the only ones with

specific equipment to do so.     Did he hear Murray trying to

contact him on radio regarding this problem?



Then suddenly Gate   'C' opened and a crowd of spectators burst

through and Police Constable Guest said something like, "The

gates gone.    I immediately left the room in a hurry, as I was

concerned that this could cause problems and that further help

might be needed in manning that gate or other gates around the
ground.

After making sure the p l ay e rs ' and d irectors' entrances were

secure, I went via the players' tunnel to the pitch where I saw

the Club Secretary, Graham Mackrell.      I told him my concern as

to what had happened at Gate    'C' and he said,   "Leave it to me"

and turned and went back towards the Leppings Lane end.        I

recall looking and seeing that each of the North and South

'wings' of the Leppings Lane terracing were not over crowded but

the centre pen seemed very full.



* Did he at this stage try to contact Police Control on his

radio?



I went back to the Control Room where Police Constable Guest
DOUGLAS JOHN LOCK                                        PAGE 5




informed me that the Police had in fact opened the gates.



* We want to know here 1)   Did he make any attempt to contact

Police Control by radio/telephone?   2)   Was he informed by

Police Control or did he hear any information on the club radio

about the Police decision to open the gates?

* Was he made aware at any time that the gates were going to be

opened?   Did he take any steps or was he asked by Police to

organise or re-organise the stewarding at Leppings Lane as a

result of seeing the gates open in the control room?

* Can he produce the computer print out of the turnstile counts?

* We require a paragraph here to deal with his experiences at

the ground as a controller doing Superintendent Murray's job and

his experiences of blocking off the central tunnel in previous

years - (all included in his inquest evidence), including in

particular his knowledge of the 1988 opening.

Dear Graham,

                    Ground Safety Work during 1987

       Please find enclosed our fee account for the various services
associated with ground safety during 1987.    The various duties are
described in some detail in the account but they can be summarised
•«*-


a)     Dealing with the Officer Working Party, meetings,
       correspondence and telephone calls.


b)     Instructing V.A. Crookes (Contracts) Limited for the concrete
       repairs in the North stand.


c)     Designing and supervising the additional bracing installed by
       George Shaw Engineering (Sheffield) Limited in the South
       stand.


d)     Designing and supervising the items of general repair carried
       out by R.M. Walker Construction Limited.


e)     Miscellaneous duties.
                                                                      2




            The amount of time we have had to spend dealing with the
    Officer Working Party has increased during 1987.       The only
    consolation is that we have managed to resist many of their
    requests and there has, therefore, been some considerable saving to
    the Club.


                               Yours Sincerely,

 Dear Bill,

 Thank you for your letter dated 29th December 1987 regarding the modification
 to the Public Address System.

 I note your comments and agree that once the batteries cane to the end of
 their life we will replace them with a diesel generator.

 Kind regards.

 Yours sincerely,

Dear Graham,

                    Modification to Public Address System

     D.P. Sound telephoned on 18 December to ask whether the emergency
battery system can take the additional load from the new speakers.        They
informed me that an additional 10 amps of load will be applied to the
system.
     I         have told them that I believe this is acceptable.    The present
peak load is about 140 amps so that the extra demand is about 7%.
However, I should poi&t out that we cannot be sure how long the
batteries will last and their life will be slightly shortened by the
increased requirement.
     You may have gathered that we are living on borrowed time as far
as the batteries are concerned.    They are very old, and in the normal
way would have reached the end of their life many years ago.       However,
they have been very carefully maintained, with a trickle charge.        Thus
only one or two cells have had to be changed.
     When the Club applied for its first Safety Certificate in 1979, I
feared that the batteries would not be able to sustain the full emergency
load for the three hours required by the I.E.E. Regulations.       We
managed to obtain a relaxation on the three hours requirement, which
was reduced to one hour.    However, this relaxation applies only until
the present batteries are worn out.     When they are replaced we shall
be required to have a three hour capacity.
V




         We have carried oot checks from time to time sinee 1979, the
    most recent being in October 1986, just after the extra load from
    the new Kop had been applied.     The batteries lasted the one hour
    without signs- of distress.    The Fire Service raised the question of
    a further test during the inspection last sunsner.      It was agreed
    that one would be carried out one dark night during this season
    but they have not f o l d e d it up yet.   I am fairly confident the
                                                                           ,
    batteries will still last one hour, particularly if thejf Fire
    Service, like the last test, do not ask for the public address
    system to be in use at the same time as the lights.      But sooner or
    later the batteries are going to deteriorate totthe extent that
    we cannot maintain the specified ligh_t intensity for long enough.
         When the batteries do eventually coae to the end of their lifef
    we will almost certainly recommend that they be replaced by a diesel
    generator.   That will be cheaper and longer lasting.      It could also
    be arranged for it to take over the normal load from the offices
    in the event of a power cut or failyre.

                                Yours sincerely,

Dear Graham,

                     South Stand, Fire Certificate
                       Fire Precautions Act 1971


     On Tuesday, 24 November I went round the offices in the
south stand, with Ron Ward, looking at the items mentioned in the
recent letter from     the South Yorkshire Fire Service.   We were
left with four questions for    the Fire Officer to answer.     I have
since spoken to the Officer concerned, Roger Woodhouse, and below
is a record of his replies.


1)   The two pairs     of doors, one at the far end of the corridor
     leading to the sponsors' lounge and kitchen and the other at
     the end of the corridor leading from the Riverside Suite, do
     need spring closers and a selector device.        The Fire Officer
     insisted on the closers because without them the doors
     cannot be considered as forming an integral part of the 1/2
     hour compartment formed round the public area leading from
     the stand.


     I explained to him that the existing push bars are unlikely
     to re-engage freely once the doors have been opened, but he
     was prepared to accept that, providing the doors closed in
     the centre rebate.
     Just one more point about that particular public area is
     that it should be kept clear.     I noticed that the fire exit
     door was blocked the other day and there was a large pile of
     chairs along the side wall.     If the Fire Officer visits and
     sees them he could make life difficult.


2)   The timber partition separating the trainer's room and the
     locker can remain, providing a doorway is formed from the
     trainer's room into the adjacent corridor.     The door need
     not be a fire door.


3)   Fire call points and extinguishers should preferably be
     sited together.   The call points should be within arms reach
     by someone leaving via an escape route.     The call point in
     question is the one indicated at the top of the players'
     tunnel.   It could be positioned on the right (as you leave)
     of the general office door, or to the right of the referee's
     room.


4)   Enclosed is a copy of an acceptable form of the Employer's
     Fire Procedure Notice.     I have been told that they can be
     obtained from suppliers of fire fighting equipment or from
     the larger suppliers of office equipment.


     As you will see, each notice needs to be completed according
to its particular siting.     There are other versions which are
equally accepted by the Fire Service.


                           Yours sincerely,

  Dear Sir,

  Guide to Safety at Sports Grounds - 198$ Edition

  I refer to the revised Guide which was recently published by H.M. Government
  following the Poppelwell Report. I would like to draw your attention to the new
  Guide and particularly to Chapter 2 entitled "Management Responsibility".

  This Chapter sets out in detail the sort! of matters which ground management
  should be responsible for and I regard it as essential that the management of
  designated stadia should be entirely familiar with it and follow its guidance.

  Would you please, therefore, confirm in writing:-

  (a) that you have obtained and intend to retain on the premises-a—copy of— the__
      Guide;

  (b) that your Company and its Officers are familiar with the Guide and intend
      to perform the management duties outlined in Chapter 2 of the Guide; the
      Company should also take immediate steps to appoint a Safety Officer as
      defined in Chapter 2 and confirmation of that appointment should be sent to
      the Council as soon as possible.    '

  Yours faithfully,




 Head of Department

Dear Graham,
                Safety of Sports Grounds Act
     I have now had a response to ray letter to the Drainage
and Bridges Division of Sheffield City Council enquiring
whether there are any public sewers within the curtilage of
the Sheffield Wednesday Football Club ground.    You will see
from the attached reply that there are none.    We can therefore
discount the possibility of a recurrence of the Anfield
difficulties.

Dear Graham.
                     Signs for New Restaurant
     To complete the application f o r m for Planning ApprovalI
need to know the location of the signs.  I looked at alternative
sites on Tuesday 20 October.    Two photocopy extracts of our
layout drawing, showing each entrance, marked up with thesuggested
positions are enclosed.
     At the Loppings Lane end I suggest the sign is fixed to the
two poles on either side of the partition and at the Penlstone
Road end sited to replace the existing ’location plan'.
     Perhaps you would be kind enough to look yourselfand then     let
me know what you think of the suggestion.


                         Yours sincerely,




P.S. I contacted Howsons, the sigh manufacturers, today and they
     could not tell me from what the signs are to be nade. I
     presume painted on plywood, but perhaps this could be confirmed
     Are the signs to be 1lluslnated?

Dear Graham,
                   South Stand, Fire Certificate
                     Fire Precautions Act 1971

     I spoke with Fire Officer,                        last Monday
about the double door at the side of the players' entrance.
He does want a proper    \
    There are two options.
                           hour door, which is what I expected.
                                  One is to replace the existing
doors with new   h  hour doors.
existing doors to bring them up to a
                                    The other is to -modify the
                                           h hour rating.
    The door opening is an odd size, 1290 wide x 2390 high,
and I do not believe that veneered doors with a
can be bought that size.
                                                      h hour rating
                             Blanks can be bought, but they are
unlikely to be that height and perhaps not with vision panels.
    To modify the existing doors would mean replacing the
glass with wired glass, and fire check glazing frames and
then covering the rest of the door with a fire lining board.
To retain the present appearance, the door would need to be
finally covered with a veneered plywood.
    Both alternatives are going to be expensive and the heavier
doors may need three hinges instead of two, in addition to
neoprine smoke seals and intumescent strips rebated into the
frame and doors.     I would opt for new doors because to get
the details right, to the satisfaction of the Fire Service, may
be troublesome.   From past experience     with fire doors think of
a sum of about £300.0(V unless someone on your staff can do
the work,
     Alvin Morris Limited (693251), M a H i n s o n Deny Limited
(753353), John Carr Limited (693291) and Jewsons (700744) are
firms that may be able to supply suitable doors.


                        Yours sincerely,

Dear Graham,
                 South Stand, Fire certificate
                    Fire Precautions Act 1971

     Please find enclosed a communication dated 6 October, from
the South Yorkshire County Fire Service together with a print of
a drawing of the South Stand to which has been added various items
relating to fire precautions.
     Looking through the schedules there is just one item which
needs clarification from the fire officer, that is item 1 of
schedule    2.   I need to find out if intumescent strips and smoke
seals are all that he requires.    If so, I believe he is being
generous.
     All the other items listed on thaffcparticular schedule can all
be bought from Smith Widdowson and Eadem Ltd., on Penistone Road.
I presume that    Ron will do the fitting.
     On schedule 4 an additional fire alarm call point is asked for.
Bownes & Co. could fit the call point.        Their Mr. Parker is probably
the person to speak to.    He helped fit the present system when
working for Bradwell Electrical Co. Ltd.
     I will let you know what needs to be done to the double swing
door mentioned above after I have spoken to the fire officer.       I
have been unsuccessful in contacting him so far.

                           Yours sincerely,

            Dear Sirs,

            Safety of Sports Grounds Act 1975 - Gate Release Devices

            I refer to your letter of 19th August and the enclosed plans of a proposed gate
            release device.                                                           5

            The proposed device has been discussed by the various Authorities at some length
            and it- has now been suggested that^erhapqra prototype device could be fabricated
            and fitted to one of the gates for testing purposes. It has also been mentioned
            that with some modifications the proposed device could also be used for the
            sliding gates at Sheffield United Football Club.

            I look forward to hearing from you with your comments on this matter.

            Yours faithfully,

     please find attached a communication I have received from the Football Ground
     Improvement Trust together with a new 'blue booklet1 setting out terms and
     conditions for grant aid.

     As you can see I think that the penultimate paragraph has serious implications
     with regard to any grant aid that may be forthcoming in respect of replacement
     of the South Stand roof.

TO ALL ENGLISH AND SCOTTISH CLUBS


Dear Secretary,

     I have pleasure in enclosing six copies of the revised edition of the
"Blue Booklet".

     You will see that this edition contains minor but significant changes
to the Trust's procedures. These changes have been brought about by the Trust's
current financial position and are there to ensure the smooth and equitable
running of the Trust.

     Any application which does not follow these procedures will be automatically
rejected by the Trust.

     Please also find enclosed a new supply of proposal and claim forms which
again contain minor changes.  Please destroy all other supplies

     I would particularly point out to clubs that the Trustees have decided
that they will not consider safety work which is directly related to or as a result
of Membership Schemes introduced to comply with the Football League's new ruling
on such Schemes.

     I      should also stress that improvement applications were suspended as of
1st June, 1987 due to the Trust's financial position. Clubs will, of course,
be informed as and when claims will be considered again.

      If you require any further information please do not hesitate to contact
me.


                                         Yours faithfully,




                                             Secretary


Enclosure.

Dear John,

Attached is a copy of a letter received earlier this year from our fanner
auditors, Pannell Kerr Forster, in respect of Corporation Tax computations.

As you will see from the letter they require certain information relating
to various works of a capital nature in which Eastwood and Partners were
involved. I would be most grateful if you could look into this matter
for me and hopefully provide the information which Pannell's require.

I trust this will not inconvenience you too much.                                   Many thanks.

Yours sincerely,




ACCOUNTANT

Dear Graham,

                           South Stand Roof

     Further to Dr. Eastwood's letter, dated 24 August,to the
Chairman, the "minor matters" mentioned towards the end refer
to three trap doors and two broken boards.
     There are three trap doors, in the roof, at the back of
the stand.     I noticed during recent inspections that the hinges
and securing devices are broken.     They ought to be repaired or
replaced because there is the danger that,in a strong wind, the
hatches may be blown off and subsequently fall into the car park.
     In addition, there are two broken boards adjacent to a
chimney stack, again at the back of the stand.     Those two boards
have been broken quite recently (July) and from above 1
     I         am sure that the work is well within the capabilities of
someone like Ron.

Dear Chairman,
                      South Stand Roof
     The steel diagonal bracings have now been successfully
installed at each end of the roof, and the length of concrete
beam at the back of the stand, which was splitting due to the
corrosion of the reinforcement, has also been repaired.
     Whilst the scaffolding was in place for the installation
of the bracings, we took the opportunity to replace timber
purlins in the two west end bays of the roof.
     You will recall that in our letters dated 27 February and
17 March we indicated that the work was unlikely to cost more
than £7000 - £8000 plus V.A.T. The actual cost has been
£5,652.69 plus V.A.T.,wwhich is comfottably within the sum
budgeted.
     With regard to the general condition of the roof you will
recall that the Building Surveyor's Department reported on the
roof to the General Purposes Panel, on 2 February. Enclosed is
a copy of that report. You will see that recommendations 6.1 and
6.3 have been implemented but item 6.2, the maintenance of the
roof to prevent the ingress of water has not been attended to.
     We recently inspected the outer asbestos based corrugated
sheeting together with two local roofing contractors. It was
discovered that the sheeting is very brittle.  This is normal
for old sheeting. We fear that if an attempt is made to
replace damaged sheets, the workmen will cause even more damage.
This is likely to result in m o r e leaks, not less.
     The concern of the Building Surveyor's Department about the
leaking roof was primarily associated with the rusting of the
steelwork.   We have inspected the steel from the scaffolds and
found no serious corrosion.    Hence rusting is no longer a cause
for concern.
     It is of course possible that the timber will be affected, but
we think there will be no serious decay between now and 1991.
The purlins appear to be free from rotting, but there are a few
roof boards that have been slightly affected by leaking water and
a couple have been broken recently near a chimney stack.
     We believe that if nothing is done to stop the leaks little
harm will come to the roof between now and 1991, although routine
inspections should be made to monitor the condition of the timbers.
     The leaks are relatively minor compared with those which we
had in the north stand roof, and I think they are unlikely to result
in major complaints.
     We discovered some other minor matters in the roof which
                                        'UK'
Graham Mackrell's staff can probably report. We are passing a
note to Graham about these.
     Following these repairs, we can honestly report to the
local authority that maintenance work has been carried put on the
roof as required by the General Purposes Panel.


                                    Yours sincerely,




c.c. Mr.__________

Dear Graham,

     We understand that George Shaw Engineering (Sheffield) Ltd.,
mistakenly sent their invoice for the work directly to the Club
instead of to us.    A copy of that invoice was received from them
today.   We agree with their figures and therefore forwarded a
copy of a Certificate for the payment of £            plus V.A.T. to
them today.    The original is enclosed.


                          Yours sincerely.

 Dear Sir,

 FIRE PRECAUTIONS ACT 1971
 SOUTH STAND, HILLSBOROUGH, SHEFFIELD

Following an inspection of the above premises after receiving an application
for a Fire Certificate from yourselves, it was discovered that some fire pre­
cautions work will have to be carried out for the premises to comply with the
above ac t .

Therefore Station Officer Woodhouse would appreciate a meeting on site with
yourself and/or a representative from your structural engineering consultants
to familiarise the requirement of work that will be necessary before a work
notice is served and subsequently a Certificate issued.

 May I suggest Tuesday, 8th September, 1987 at 10.30 a.m. for the meeting.
|Could you please write and confirm or suggest an alternative date, after the
 8th if this is not convenient.

Yours faithfully,

 Dear Sirs,

 Sheffield Wednesday Football Club PLC
 Facilities for the Disabled and the Hillsborough Tavern Entrance Lobb

 I refer to previous correspondence and in particular to your letters
 of 17th July.

 As far as the facilities for the disabled are concerned the Building
 Surveyor has now made the following comments    the proposal                   o r




          "Even with the use of preservatives, the longevity of a
          timber construction is likely to be shorter than for a
          metal frame structure.

          The ramp is proposed to be positioned on one of the main
          emergency routes of egress from the adjacent Kop, and it is
          considered that any addition to the present fire load in
          that area could be dangerous in the case of an accidental
          or malicious fire occurrence.

          Since the structure is stated to be removeable, a metal frame
          should also be of advantage to achieve fixity between sections
          and less susceptible to damage on dismantling.

          To avoid the creation of a void under the wheelchair deck,
          the filling of the space is very desirable - a vermiculite or
          pearlite cementicious mix could be used so as to provide minimal
          additional weight.

          The durability of the continuous non-slip deck coverage
          cannot be guaranteed. A repeat of the symptoms of the Bradford
          occurrence should be avoided"



                                                                                         Continued


                         For telephone enquiries on this matter please ring.........................................(STD Code 0742)
                                                       Telex 54243 (Administration & Legal)               Mr. Bownes
May I suggest that in order to progress the matter further, it might be
appropriate for direct discussions to take place between yourselves and
Mr. Butler on Sheffield 73^162,

 As far as the Tavern is concerned I note in your letter of 17th July that
 you make no reference to the Club applying for consent under Public Entertainment
 Licence Condition 13 in respect of alterations to The Hillsborough Tavern. I
 would advise you that such consent is required before any works commence
 and I trust that the Club will make the appropriate application.

 I have passed a copy of this letter onto the Club as usual.

For the attention of Mr. D. Bowses

Dear Mr. Bownes,
                Sheffield Wednesday Football Club pic
                     Facilities for the Disabled

         Thank you for your letter dated 6 July 1987.
 '.y,v.1;-We see no reason why the ramp should not be constructed in
timber.   The considerations of cost and ease of manoeuvrability
outweigh the use of steel. We do not consider that by using
timber that there is a significant fire hazard. The timber will
also be treated with a suitable preservative.
     To introduce mass concrete fill for the wheelchair area is
likely to overload the existing structural members, hence the
proposal to use a lightweight construction.     The deck on which
the chairs run will be sealed with a continuous non-slip material
which will eliminate the possibility of rubbish, etc. finding its
way into the void below.

                           Yours sincerely,




c.c.   Sheffield Wednesday Football Club pic,

I believe that both the Fire Authority and the Building Surveyor would prefer
the minimum ramp width to accord with BS5810 1979 but the Builing Surveyor has
commented that the single directional flow in this instance may, however, be
satisfied with the lesser dimension of 1025 mm.

In addition the Building Surveyor has now let me have the following comments on
the proposal

        "I am however unhappy that the whole of the construction is proposed to be
        in timber. The longevity of the support legs of the ramp must be
        questioned, and the creation of a void under the timber boarded wheelchair
        standing area appears to create a future fire hazard.

        Concrete mass filling for the wheelchair standing area would be preferred.

        I note that the ramp is described as being "removable”. I would prefer to
        see this constructed of a metal frame so as to achieve non-combustibility,
        longevity and aid fixity between sections.

        I trust that further constructional details will be received from Eastwood
        & Partners before the structuue is fabricated."

I look forward to receiving your further comments in due course.

Dear Bill,

Re:   Safety of Sports Grounds Act 1975

Further to your letter dated 1st JUne 1987 I have discussed this matter with
the Chairman and we are both of the opinion that if the matter can wait until
the summer meeting then we feel it would be advisable.

We, of course, will be guided by you on this matter.

Kind regards.

Yours sincerely,

Dear Mr. Bownes,
              Sheffield Wednesday Football Club pic
                   Facilities for th® Disabled


     Thank you for your letter dated 20 May 1987 enclosing
the copy of the letter, dated 11 March, from the Fir® Service.
     They are quite correct in reporting that BS5810 1979 recommends
that the access width should be not less than 1200 nan. This we
knew about when we proposed the scheme. However, a 2900 ram access
to the pitch has to be maintained, for lorries, tractors and the like,
and this means that the clear access width for the disabled, is
limited to 1025 mm. Nevertheless there is still sufficient width for
the comfortable passage of wheel chairs which we have measured as
being not greater than 750 mm wide.
     We believe that to provide a facility for the disabled is paramount
and the access width is one of those recommendations, givaa in a
British Standard, that h a s occasionally to be set aside.


                          Yours sincerely,
                                                                                                                                         1

Dear Mr. Bownes,
              Sheffield Wednesday Football    Club pic
                Hillsborough Tavern - Entrance Lobby


     Please find enclosed six prints of each of our drawings
9070/1 and 2 showing plans and elevations of a new glazed
entrance lobby which is proposed to be constructed round the
existing staircase leading to the Hillsborough        Tavern, at the
back of the South stand.
     Formal applications for planning permission and building
regulations approval have been submitted but we thought that the
Officer Working Party should also receive a set of prints showing
the proposals.
     Constructive comments of the Officer Working Party would be
welcomed.   It is hoped that work will be complete before the start
of the next season.


                           Yours faithfully

Dear Graham,
                Safety of Sports Grounds Act 1975
                        Safety Work 1987
      Thank you for your letter dated 27 May.
      Referring to the last paragraph, I understand that on 28
April, John Strange fepoke to you about the possible courses of
action that could be taken in response to the letter dated 22
April from David Bownes, and it was agreed that perhaps a
meeting with the respective members of the Officer Working Party
would be the best way of dealing with the matter.
      It was our intention to wait until the summer meeting to
discuss the matters raised in David Bownes' letter but if you wish
we would be willing to meet the Fire Officer and David Bownes sooner.
      Before Sheffield City Council took over the responsibility for
administration of the Safety Certificate regular meetings were held
twice a year, one in the winter and one in the summer. You will have
noticed that this is no longer the case, the last meeting with the
Officer Working Party being last August. There are advantages in
having fwwer meetings. It is less costly to the Club, but it means
there is likely to be more correspondence.    We have less chance to
deal with matters before people have committed themselves in writing.
It is then difficult to persuade the writer that in many instances
their comments are misdirected or inaccurate, which is largely
the case with the letter from the Fire Service.
      If you wish us to organise a meeting perhaps you would
let John know a convenient date.   I suggest it should be held
at the ground so that we can inspect the items mentioned in the
Fire Officer's letter.

                             Yours sincerely,

Dear Bill,

Please find enclosed a communication I have received from the South Yorkshire
County Fire Service which I would be grateful if you could handle on our
behalf.                                                                    i X

The Chairman mentioned to me the other day the outstanding letter dated 22nd
April 1987 from the City of Sheffield regarding Safety of Sports Grounds Act
and I wondered if you or John are in a position yet to resolve the matter. I
await hearing from you.

Yours sincerely,

Dear Sir

SHEFFIELD WEDNESDAY FOOTBALL CLUB PLC
FACILITIES FOR THE DISABLED

Further to the above proposal as detailed in the letter dated 2 March 1987 and
drawings 7771/2Af this Authority has the following comments to make.

a)    The timber platform that is to be built over the front three rows of the
      North Stand to be so constructed that no debris, cigarette ends etc can fall
      through and accumulate underneath.

b)    The width of the ramped approach is not in accordance with BS 5810 1979
      Access For The Disabled, which states in Section 2, paragraph 6.2.1
      that the width should not be less than 1200 mm. ?

TO ALL ENGLISH & SCOTTISH FOOTBALL CLUBS


Dear Secretary,

      The Trustees have become concerned at the number of clubs who fail to
abide by the Trust's established procedures as clearly detailed in the "Blue
Booklet" issued to clubs on 3rd July,    1986.

       The Trustees now take this opportunity toadvise all clubs that failure
to comply with the procedures as laid    down in the "Blue Booklet"will
automatically lead to any application    for grant   aid being rejected by    the
Trust.


                                       Yours faithfully,




                                             Secretary.

    Itear Graham,
                       South Stand - Executive Seats
        In view of the comments made by the Fire Service, in their
    letter dated 18 February, I suggest that the idea of inst lling
    a barrier, or rope, or whatever, to segregate the executive seats,
    should not be raised with the Local Authority, at least for the
^   time being.
        However, it you feel that effective segregation cannot be
    achieved by stewarding, then we could perhaps have an informal
    discussion with the fire officer at an appropriate opportunity.

                              Yours sincerely,

                   Sheffield Wednesday Football Club pic
                             North Stand Roof

     As requested in your letter dated 22 April we write to give
details of the roof sheeting.
     The new steel sheets are galvanised, profiled sheets coated
both sides with p.v.c. plastisol, similar to those used an the
Spion Kop roof.
     The finish has a surface spread of flame rating of Class *0*
and is deemed to satisfy the requirements for a roof covering d
designated AA in accordance with the Building Regulations.
     The new translucent sheets are manufactured from g.r.p. and
have the same fire ratings as the general roof sheeting.

                          Yours sincerely,
                                                                                                      FILE

  Dear Sir,

  Safety of Sports Grounds Act 1975 - Sheffield Wednesday Football Club

  In November 1986 I asked both the Police and Fire Service to comment on the
  condition of your stadium having regard to the provisions of the 1975 Act. I
  have also asked the Building Surveyor to make similar comments but I have not
  received them as yet.

  The Police have indicated that as at 6th January, 1987 they are quite satisfied
  with the stadium and have indicated that the degree of co-operation which they
  receive is very satisfactory.

  The Fire Service have, however, made a number of comments and I attach for your
  information a copy of their letter to me of 18th February. Some points in the
  letter have now been further clarified as follows:-

  (a) The timber buildings referred to should (if still required) be re-sited away
  from the walkways.

  (b) As far as the locked doors in the south stand are concerned they will be
  dealt with by the Fire Service under the Fire Certificate.

  (c) Gates must be unlocked and stewarded at all times, during matches: if this
  cannot be arranged, panic fastenings would probably be insisted upon.

  I think the rest of the letter is largely self-explanatory but I would
  particularly like to refer to the comments which are made in respect of final
  exit gates. As you can see from the letter the Fire Service are concerned about
  the sliding gates and have indicated that as and when they reach the end of
  their useful life they must be replaced with outward opening doors. The Fire
  Service have also produced a drawing (a copy of which I enclose) to show a
  better arrangement for securing the sliding gates against forced entry from the
  outside during the course of the game. The Fire Service feel that this hook
  type arrangement will be more easily used in the event of an emergency than the
  current locks, about which they are very concerned.

  Encs.
  8H                                                                                                   - Mr. Bownes

                                                         Telex 54243 (Administration & Legal)
Would you please let me have your comments on the Fire Service letter as soon
possible.

Yours faithfully.

     For the attention of Mr. D. M. Bownes



     Dear Sir,

     SAFETY OF SPORTS GROUNDS ACT 1975 - SHEFFIELD WEDNESDAY FOOTBALL CLUB

     Thank you for your letter dated 3rd November, 1986,                             in respect of the above
     Club.

     Please find below my observations in response to outstanding matters.

     An inspection of the ground was carried out on 17th November, 1986.        The
     comments appended below do not take into account the numbers of persons using
     individual areas, lateral and radial gangways or units of exit widths, as
     it is assumed that from previous correspondence and documentation that the
     various working parties and committees have adequately dealt with these items.

     .MEANS OP ESCAPE IN CASE OF FIRE

     North Stand

     Timber framed and clad buildings are constructed and located under the stand.

     The only reference as to the acceptance is minuted in meeting dated 7.8.85
     in which one large store for bulky items was agreed on a temporary basis.

     There is also no record to indicate whether these buildings have been treated
     with fire retardant paint or solutions. Confirmation is required as to treat­
     ment of these buildings.

     Spion Kop

     A.    Timber framed and clad unit located on main central exit                                  route has not
            received any approval, no approach has been made by the                                   Club for its
            installation, this should be removed immediately.

     B.    It is understood that the gates in the pitch perimeter     fencing form
            part of the emergency exits. The gates for reasons of security, fasten


                                 All communications to be addressed to the Chief Fire Officer.
         with barrel bolts secured to the gate both top and bottom and open in
         f sideways direction.    It is doubtful that if it were necessary tcr
         evacuate* the stand onto the pitch in an emergency that the gates would
         open if pressure were generated by a crowd.      No record can be
         in respect of ^discussion on gate fastenings:' It is recommended t
         a satisfactory security device easily openable from the pitch side sho
         be found and fitted to all perimeter gates.

C        During the inspection it     was observed that several concrete steps on
         the lower terracing were in need of repair and in one case the
         step had erroded away.     Every endeavour should be undertaken to ensur
          that all steps are kept in a good state of repair.

D        The wire mesh protecting the stanchions and bracing supports from being
          c l L L d is ineffective.  It has been observed that patrons visiting
          the Kop can, in large numbers from the back of the Kop, c im 1
          lower half of the roof.   The mesh should be extended to alleviate this.
         situation.

E.       It was observed that where the terracing is above 1 m higher than the
          lateral gangways wire mesh infill had not been located along            lull
          lengths.   Where the mesh had been p r o v i d e d this had been spot welded
          but the mesh had not been given an additional vertical support.

F.       Exit   gates   should   be   unlocked   and keys     held by    stewards   manning    the
          gate before patrons enter the stands.

West Stand

A.       Timber framed and clad units located under this stand have been there
          for some considerable time. No record exists of.-

          (1)   acceptance of these units or,

          (2)   that they have been treated with fire retardant paint or solutions.

    B.   Exit gates to the pitch perimeter as item B under Spion Kop aoove.


    South Stand

    The accommodation is divided into iour areas.-

                                                              players    area,   function     suite,
    A.    Ground floor     offices,     directors   suite,
          kitchen etc.
                                                               lounge,   players    lounge,    paint
    B.     First floor, upper stand walkway,          press
           stores, disused bar area.

    C.     Lower stand, uncovered stand seating.

    D.     Rear stand, covered seating.

                                                  observations are made:-
    With respect to the four areas, the following

    A.     Ground Floor

                (i)   During normal working hours most doors from the o f f i c e area
                      are kept locked shut.   All doors marked    'Fire ^ Exit   shoul
                      be made readily available for use byjany person within the area.
                                  - 3 -


  (ii)   A number of rooms at this level i.e. kitchen, laundry, stores
         and directors* suite ventilate via openable windows and/or extract
         fans into the long corridor between areas A and C above.       It
         also appears that a number of the openable windows are protected
         by corrugated, lightweight plastic sheeting.

         The separation between the corridor and such ground floor areas
         should be to a minimum half hour fire resistance, any ventilation
         requirements being met by ducting to outside on the South Wall.

 (iii)   All storage should be removed from stairway enclosures and these
         areas always maintained free from such storage.

First Floor:-

   (i)   Again, a number of rooms i.e. players' lounge, press lounge,
         the store room previously used as a licensed bar and the paint *
         store ventilate into this area.     Any ventilation requirements
         should be met by ducting to outside on the South wall.

  (ii)   Valves should be fitted to the gas supply line to each of the
         five refreshment positions in order that the supply can be cut
         off should an emergency arise.

 (iii)   All timber construction within this      area   should   be   suitably
         treated so as to be flame retardant.

  (iv)   The paint stores contain a quantity of flammable paints and
         mixtures and present a hazard which it is considered should
         be removed from this area.     Proposals to relocate the stores
         should be discussed with the Fire Authority before any work
         is commenced in order that suitable siting and any need for
         licensing under Petroleum legislation can be ascertained.

   (v)   The timber constructed cupboard and     the portable     sales   kiosks
         should be removed from this area.

  (vi)   In the cleaners'     cupboard to this area, the fire resisting
         separation between    the ground and first floor levels is breached
         by the passage of     cables through a wall.   The area around the
         cables should be     infilled with material to ensure a minimum
         fire resistance of   thirty minutes.

 (vii)   All rooms onto the upper stand walkway should be separated from
         it by minimum half hour fire resisting construction, any doors
         being to the same standard and made self closing onto 25 mm
         rebates.

(viii)   Spaces above toilet accommodation are being used for storage
         purposes. Again, these areas must be maintained clear of storage.

Uncovered Seating Area:-

The means of escape from this area is along the corridor in front of
the rear part of the stand.   Should this route not be available then
evacuation onto the pitch is possible subject to persons having the
ability to climb over the front wall on to the pitch perimeter track.
This wall is approximately 1.5 m high at the Spion Kop end decreasing
to 1 m high at the West end.
     To facilitate easier forward evacuation on to the pitch’it is recommended
     that openings be provided in the wall at the foot of radial gangways.

D.   Covered Seating^Area (Rear Stand)

     The means of escape from this area is not considered to be satisfactory
     in that escape is possible in one direction only, this being down through
     areas described in A and B above.

     Subject to all the recommendations outlined in A and B above and made
     later in respect of automatic fire detection being implemented, the
     means of escape from the covered seating area would be acceptable.

AUTOMATIC FIRE DETECTION

In 1979 the working party discussed the provision of automatic fire detection
in the South Stand.

It is recommended that such provision should be made in all areas beneath
the seated area of the stand as soon as possible.    The system should also
cover the Tavern Club which has a direct link on to the first floor corridor
of the South Stand.

The automatic detection provided should be tied in to the existing fire warning
system.

In order that persons using the Spion Kop can receive early warning of any
fire occurring in the "Stands" Club, it is also recommended that automatic
fire detection be provided in that Club.

EMERGENCY LIGHTING

Spion Kop

The emergency lighting has yet to be tested - no test certificate received.

South, North and West Stands

 In letter dated 12th November, 1980, from Eastwood and Partners, it was
 suggested that following test certificates dated 11th August, 1980, a period
 of 5 years should elapse before re-testing for South Stand and 2 years for
 North and West Stands.  As of today no record appears to exist as to whether
 these areas have been re-tested or that the test certificates together with
 maintenance records have ever been re-presented.      The emergency lighting
 system should therefore be re-tested for the whole of the ground and test
 certificates produced.   In addition the whole of the system should conform
 to B.S. 5266.

 FIRE ALARM

 West Stand

 Existing call points to be relocated to accessible positions outside of
 franchise areas and be increased to cover the upper areas of the stand.

 North Stand

 As West Stand above.
                                     - 5 -


South Stand

This stand appears to be well covered with regard to the provision and siting
of call points.

Indicator Control Panel

The indieator/control panel is situated within the Police control centre
between South and West Stand.    Whilst this is reasonable for match days it
is not considered to be practical for the majority of the time.

This panel should be duplicated with control at each location which should
be: -

1.      Police control box

2.      Main office reception area

FIRST AID AND FIRE-FIGHTING EQUIPMENT

The current standard and displacement of First Aid     fire-fighting equipment
is considered satisfactory.

GATES

The sliding gates already in situ in the ground have been accepted by this
Authority after due consideration and account being taken both of their location
and the fact that they are of existing construction.     I would wish, however,
to point out that it is the view of this Authority that doors required for
means of escape should open outwards and it is recommended that notice be
given to the Club to the effect that when any such sliding gates are to be
replaced then their replacements must open outwards even if this involves
structural work to recess the opening to avoid impinging over footpaths.
While the sliding gates remain in use however, they must be immediately avail­
able for use from the inside by any person should an emergency situation
arise. Any method of securing the gates against illegal entry from the outside
must be by way of a simply operated device not requiring the use of a key,
additional security being afforded by the presence of a steward who should
be familiar with the emergency evacuation procedures for the ground.

If there are any queries on these matters please do not hesitate to contact
the Officer concerned.

Yours faithfully,




Divisional C o mman d^

  The Secretary,
  Sheffield Wednesday Football Club PLC,

  Dear Sir,

  Safety of Sports Grounds Act 1975 - Sheffield Wednesday Football Club

  In November 1986 I asked both the Police and Fire Service to comment on the
  condition of your stadium having regard to the provisions of the 1975 Act. I
  have also asked the Building Surveyor to make similar comments but I have not
  received them as yet.

  The Police have indicated that as at 6th January, 1987 they are quite satisfied
  with the stadium and have indicated that the degree of co-operation which they
  receive is very satisfactory.

  The Fire Service have, however, made a number of comments and I attach for your
  information a copy of their letter to me of 18th February. Some points in the
  letter have now been further clarified as follows:-

  (a) The timber buildings referred to should (if still required) be re-sited away
  from the walkways.

  (b) As far as the locked doors in the south stand are concerned they will be
  dealt with by the Fire Service under the Fire Certificate.

  (c) Gates must be unlocked and stewarded at all times, during matches: if this
  cannot be arranged, panic fastenings would probably be insisted upon.

  I think the rest of the letter is largely self-explanatory but I would
  particularly like to refer to the comments which ars made in respect of final
  exit gates. As you can see from the letter the Fire Service are concerned about
  the sliding gates and have indicated that as and when they reach the end of
  their useful life they must be replaced with outward opening doors. The Fire
  Service have also produced a drawing (a copy of which I enclose) to show a
  better arrangement for securing the sliding gates against forced entry from the
  outside during the course of the game. The Fire Service feel that this hook
  type arrangement will be more easily used in the event of an emergency than the
  current locks, about which they are very concerned.

  Encs

Dear Mr. Bownes,

                   Sheffield Wednesday Football Club pic
                             North Stand Roof

     III the Aast few days the Club have given the authority to
re-sheet the North Stand roof. The sheeting is now twenty aix years
old and over the last few years leaks have been troublesome.
     The work is to be carried out during the coining closed season
and will be completed before the start Of the 1987-88 season.
     In essence the work 3imply involves removing the existing
sheeting and replacing it with new plastic coated galvanised sheets.
     We doubt that there is any involvement for the Officer Working
Party but if you wish to receive further details perhaps you would
let us know.
                               Yours sincerely

Dear Chairman,
                   ■                    ■■' South Stand Roof -
      We have now received tenders for the installation of the
bracings in the roof. Although we invited four firms to tender
only two have replied. Those firms, together with their tender
prices are as follows

      George Shaw Engineering {Sheffield)   Ltd.        £        plus V.A.T.
      Gasgoyne & Beever Co. Ltd.                        £        plus V.A.T.
      Shaw's price is lower than weejected. It may be that
they have under-estimated.   They are well known to us and their
standard of work is usually good.   They have worked on the ground
on several occasions in providing or strengthening crush barriers
and safety fences.
      We have also received   tenders for repairs to the spalllng
concrete beam running along   the back ofthe stand.    The tender sums
are as follows

      R.M. Walker Construction Ltd.                     £        plus V.A.T.
      V.A. Crookes (Contracts) Ltd.                     £           plus V.A
      R.M. Walker have already been awarded the oontract for the new
entrance on Penistone Road and I think this has enabled them to under­
cut Crookes tender price.
          You will recall that there are some leaks in the roof
    at the back of the stand, some of which have contributed to
    the spalling of the concrete. These leaks will have to be
    investigated and repaired. I think the overall cost including
    the leaks and our professional fees will be 'Within the range
    £               which I originally indicated might be the cost
    of the roof steelwork only. I am fully confident that the
    whole of the works will be contained within the E        which
    the Board has santioned as a maximum.   Unless we hear to the
    contrary in the next two or three days, we will place orders
    with George Shaw Engineering and R.M. Walker.

                                   Yours sincerely,

Dear Bill,

Thank you for your letter dated 19th March 1987 and for the work carried out
to satisfy our Mr. Bull.

I know it may seem a little excessive but at least we have put his mind at
rest.

Dear Graham,
                    Safety Work 1987
      Further to the last paragraph of our letter dated 12
February 1987 we have pleasure in reporting on the tenders
received for the various items of safety work requested by
the Officer forking Party last year.
      The items of work are repairs to damaged and spalling
terracing, repairs and strengthening of the corroded stanchions
supporting Gate 'A' at Leppings Lane, repairing a gable stanchion,
at ground floor level, at the back of the South stand and filling
with concrete between the flanges of a column at the back of Spion
Kop.
      Three tenders have been received and the tender sums given
in the documents are as follows i-
      R.M. Walker Construction Ltd.           g|          plus V.A.T,
      Hallamshire iiiilders Ltd.              £           plus V.A.T.
      Ay *J* Loveland Ltd.                    g           plus V.A.T.
      Bach tender includes a contingency sum of s|     which may
or may not need to be expended.
      We recommend that the tender submitted by R.M. Walker
Construction Ltd. is accepted.   They have started wo»*,k on the
new entrance on Penistone load this week and their tender price
probably reflects that they are already working at the ground,
hence their advantage over the second lowest tender.


                          Yours sincerely,
                                                                                     <1,

Dear Sirs,

             Sheffield Wednesday Football Club pic.
                           Safety Work 1987

     Thank you for your recent tender which will be considered
by the Board of Sheffield Wednesday Football Club on 26 March, 1987.
     Since preparing the contract documents more work has been
found to be necessary in the South stand.       This involves repairing
some of the concrete columns and connecting eaves beam at the very
back of the seated area.     The areas to be treated have been marked
in yellow crayon and a list of the repairs is attached, together
with a short specification and technical literature for the
materials to be used.
     Will you be kind enough to submit to us a price for your own
men to do the work.     If the cost is acceptable, we would include
the work with that for which you have already submitted a tender.
The same conditions will apply.
     We wish to report to the Club on 25 March, 1987 so an early
reply would be appreciated. You may visit the site at any time
between 0830 and 1600 hours.

                           Yours faithfully,

Dear Graham,
        Following the receipt of the copy of the letter from
Mr.   J. Bull which referred to movement in the deck of the
Kop   at high level, John Strange has had a careful look when
the   Kop w&s empty. There are no signs that any movement of
the   concrete steps has occurred.
       As I said in ray letter of 10 March, there would be no
cause for concern if some parts of the deck were deflected
as much as 1$ inches when the Kop is fully occupied. But the
spectators are not aware of this deflection because it gradually
builds up as the crowd gathers and then gradually reduces as
they leave.
      We know that there is very slight springiness if someone
jumps on the deck, and a slight vibration can be felt.   This
arises mainly because the frame is of steel, which is more springy
and has less 'damping' than concrete.   I think Mr. Bull musth
have felt this vibration when someone purposely jumped. I suspect
the movement was less than one-hundredth of an inch, but as I said
before the human frame is so sensitive to vibration that the movement
feels much ■ore.   It is not at all uncommon to have statements that
•it moves an inch* when the true position is that the movement was
probably not wore than one hundredth of an inch.
      There is absolutely no cause for concern.   If Hr. Bull is at
all worried, ask him to phone John Strange before he next attends
a match and John will meet him at the top of the Kop and chat with
him about the design.


                              Your8 sincerely,
                                      , l z / W   ^

Dear Graham,
       Many thanks for your letter of 9 March enclosing a
copy of the letter from Mr. J. Bull.      We will have a look
at the area of the Kop where Mr. Bull says he was standing
but I am sure there is no cause for alarm.     Firstly, I should
say that the Code of Practice to which the structure was designed
permits deflections under full load of the span divided by
360.    Some of the longer beams are about 30ft. long so that
the deflection of the steel which is permitted is in fact
about 1".      In addition, the concrete step is also permitted to
deflect by one 250th of its span which is about i".      However,
a total deflection of 1§" would not normally be felt by spectators
because a tiny part of the deflection takes place every time
another spectator comes on to that area and the deflection is
then recovered when the spectators leave one by one at the end
of the match.
       It is possible that if there is a crowd surge, extra load
come* on to certain steps and they deflect a little more.       However
we have reduced the amount of surging by the close spacing of
crush barriers.    In addition, the sight lines are so good in that
area that people do not have to lean forward to see over the heads
                                                                                                         -     - V         -

of people in front when there is an exciting goal mouth
incident.     This reduces the tendency to surge forward.
        One of the fields of expertise of this firm is
vibration and deflection of structures and from time to time
we are asked to investigate deflections which are reported
under live load.     The human body is so responsive to vibration
type movements that it is quite common for a person who makes
the complaint to say that the floor moved about an inch when
in fact measurements show it to be less than one 100th of an
inch.     This experience of ours is supported by a report
from the government's Building Research Establishment.in which
graphs appear which demonstrate that a very tiny deflection
can appear to be very largeto someone standing on the deck.
        You will know that we have a considerable number of our
own staff standing in various parts of the Kop at every home
game including John Strange.     None of them have everyfelt
any significant movement.      John Strange generally standa in
the general area indicated by Mr. Bull.    Nevetheless, John
will make an inspection in the next few days when I will write
to you again.

B.S. McGee Esq.,                                     17 Uarch 1987
Chairman,
Sheffield Wednesday Football Club PLC,           *
B/o Presto Tools,
Penistone Road,
Sheffield 6.



Dear Chairman,
                    South Stand Roof
      Mr.         of the Building Surveyors Department in the
Town Hall telephoned yesterday to say that they have now
checked our calculations and proposals for bracing the South
stand roof and these are considered satisfactory.   We shall
now invite tenders with a view to having the work done during
the close season. I am reasonably confident that the cost will
not exceed my original estimate of £7000 - £8000 and so think
tt unlikely that we shall be near the limit of £10,000 set by the
Club.
      One matter which I should mention )s that as part of the
joint inspection, it has been discovered that considerable
spelling of concrete is beginning to occur in the concrete beam which
runs along the back of the stand at the very top just below
the roof.   It is Important that this concrete be kept in good
condition because it is likely to be retained as part of the
structure whenever the new roof is provided.
      The spelling of the concrete is being caused by rusting of
the reinforcement. In some cases, it is clear that an important
factor has been leakage of water from the drainage gutter. The
The reinforcement has rusted and forced off the oorrcrete cover,
I also aentloned in a recent letter that there has been some
leakage developing in the roof at a few places along the very
back of the stand and this has also been a contributory factor.
 ^       We are obtaining tenders for repairs to the concrete using
epoxy jfcaterials, which are likely to last longer than the ordinary
"CWBent repair,    we are also taking steps to have the roof leaks
Cured.     I assume that we can proceed with all the items including
the    bracing in the roof provided that the overall cost of everything
including our fees (but excluding V.&.T.) does not exce«d the £10,000
authorised by the Board.
         One of the difficulties about repairs to concrete is that
the full extent of the rusting does not become apparent until the
concrete cover is broken out.      Should we find when we open up
that aore money is required I will immediately come back to you.


                                 Yours sincerely,

                          South Stand Roof

     We have pleasure in enclosing two prints of our drawing 8722/5
showing details of the proposed diagonal roof bracing at the gable
ends. Also enclosed are single copies of our calculation pages
1 to 7. We have considered two wind cases. The first is wind
blowing directly onto the gable. The second is wind blowing into
the front of the stand at an amgle of 45°.
     It is intended to install the bracing towards the end of May.
The work will be carried out on scaffold platforms which will allow
us to inspect the two gables and first two trusses, together with
the existing bracing. Two centre trusses can be inspected from
the television access walkway. We are fairly confident that it
will be found that the steelwork is in good condition and if this
is the case we do not intend to carry out any further detail
inspections at this stage. Djming the last heavy down pour we
took the opportunity to record the positions of a few leaks in the
roof . ISie «?on&itic>n of the timbers and steelwork at those places
will be inspected more closely.

                             Yours sincerely,

 Dear Graham,
                     South Stand Roof
        I have today received a copy of a letter from Sheffield
 City Council to the Chairman, together With a copy of the minutes
 of the general Purposes Panel meeting on 2 February 1987.
        I        am pleased to see that the contents £<6 the minute are very
 much in line with what I told the Chairman in my letter of 27
.February. '
       Only two matters require comment. You will see that
under recommendation (a)(i) an inspection and survey has to be
undertaken at least twice a year. I hope that this can be limited
to £»erw more than walking round so that the Club is not irivolved
in too much unnecessary expense.
      In paragraph '(b) it is to be laid down in the safety certificate
that the stand is not to be used under conditions likely to impose
unusually high loadings on the stand roof atrucutre.    There has been
an informal commitment of this kind ever since 1979.    The
South Yorkshire County Council were content with an undertaking
by the Club that in the event of a gale warning on the morning of a
match or a forecast of heavy snow, a detailed weather report would
be obtained from the Bawtry Weather Centre (I believe we now have to
telephone Leeds instead of Bawtry).   frankly, I regard this
as completely unnecessary because the kind of gale which
would be needed to severely stress the roof would make it
quite impossible to play football.   Similarly, if there
were a sufficient fall of snow to load the roof heavily, the
pitch would also be unplayable.
      There is due to be a visit to the ground by the Working
Party in the next few weeks and I suggest that in the course of
the meeting the Club reiterates that it will make these enquiries
about weather on any occasion when it seems appropriate.

                            Yours sincerely,

Dear Mr. Bownes,

           Sheffield Wednesday Football Club pic.
                    Facilities for the Disabled

     You will have probably gathered, whilst reading through the
files, that the Club have been actively considering, for some
time now, accommodation foi; the disabled.      Various locations
throughout the ground have been investigated.       It seems likely
that the Board of     Directors will decidetohave    constructed,
facilities for the disabled    at thefront of     the North stand,
towards the Spion Kop end.
    A proposal has been drawn up to show a possible arrangment
of a viewing platform occupying the front three rows over a
length of approximately 30m.     Six prints of our Drawing Number
7771/2A are enclosed showing the general arrangements.
    The disabled will be under cover, as are paying spectators,
at the front of the stand.     The roof projects beyond the front
wall by approximately 5m and it is only under extreme rain and
wind conditions that spectators get wet whilst sitting in the
still very popular first few rows of seats.
       Access onto the wooden platform will be by way of a ramp
alongside the gable wall,       This is shown on the side elevation.
A guard rail will be erected on top of the existing wall and
a timber partition erected at the back of the area.
       The facility is also within just a few metres of the new
disabled toilet which was completed toward the end of last
year.
       In addition, on big match days, there will also be the
facility to allow more disabled spectators into the ground by
locating them on the perimeter track, where they now sit to
watch matches.
       Car parking is also available at the back of the North stand,
within e a s y   reach of the proposed fac ility.
       We, therefore, believe that the proposed site for the disabled
is the most readily converted and most convenient situation in
the ground.       It would be much appreciated if the comments of the
Officer Working Party could be sent to us, fairly quickly, so
that' the next stages in the provision of the facilities can
be started.


                            Yours sincerely,

Dear Chairman,

                             South S<fcand ROvpf

     '«e have prepared a scheme for bracing the roof and have had a
meeting at the ground with representatives of the local authority
Building Surveyor's department.     They have accepted our proposals
in principle, and are now considering our calculations.
     The scheme involves the provision of diagonal bracina in each
of the two end bays of the stand.     Each of these two bays will have
to be scaffolded to enable the work to be carried out.        However this
will enable us to make a close inspection of four of the steel roof
trusses to assess the amount of corrosion.  It has been aqreed that
if these four trusses are not badly affected, no more inspections
will be needed.
     The work on these roof trusses should not cost more       than the
£7,000 to £8,000   which   I indicated      some weeks ago.
     During our inspection we have found six locations where the
roof leaks. The Town Hall have asked for these leaks to be sealed
to protect the steel from water.
     In addition there are several places along the back wall where
the concrete beam which runs along the top is splitting due to
rusting of the reinforcement. It is very desirable that repairs
  should be carried out.
J      We have already invited tenders for the new roof bracing and
  will report back to you towards the end of March.
/      We shall be inviting tenders to repair the cracked concrete
  in the next few days.
       It is proposed that the repairing of the leaks should be
  carried out on a time and materials basis. We suspect that there
  are cracked roof sheets which will have to be replaced. The cost
  should not be more than a few hundred poundsr but the sheets are
  now so old that they will bebbrittle, I shall be threatening
  blue murder if the contractor caused new leaks.

                            Yours sincerely,




 c.c.   Mr. G. Mackrell

Dear Graham,

     Thank you for your letter dated 7 February 1987 referring to
the various matters discussed at last week's board meeting.     Progress
on the items is a s follows


a)   South Stand Roof

     After oulr meeting on Monday afternoon we inspected the south
stand roof. We saw that there is probably a fairly simple method
of providing sufficient bracing in the roof. Design calculations
and a drawing are now being prepared so that our proposals can be
forwarded to the local authority for comment.

b)   North Stand Roof

     Drawings and tender documents are almost complete and will be
issued within the next day or so. The tenders are due back on
11 March, in plenty of time for the next board meeting.


c)   Entrance to the Car Park from Penistone Road

     We have had a meeting with R. M. Walker Limited this morning
and they intend to begin demolition on 23 March 1987. Your official
order has been given tottiem, thank you.
d)   Cracked Beams In the North Stand
     By the time you receive this letter we expect that the repairs
will have been completed,


e)   "Stand1s” Public House
     We have sent a letter of intent to Re-mastic Limited and
materials are now ordered. They expect to begin work within seven
to ten days, depending upon deliveries of materials.
     Perhaps an official order should be sent to them from the Club.
A draft of a possible order is enclosed.
     Although it is too early to begin painting the outside of the
property, we are obtaining prices for painting and woodwork repairs,
The work is probably best done during the summer or autumn, after the
woodwork has had the chance to dry out.


f)   Further Safety and Maintenance Work

     As we mentioned in our meeting last Monday, the steel frame
supporting Gate *A' at Leppings Lane is severely corroded and over
the last few months has |>egun to lean outwards. We have prepared
a drawing showing repairs and strengthening of the stanchions on
either side. Tenders fojr the work will be issued shortly.  Included
in that work are several other small items of safety work, requested
last year by the Officer Working Party. We will report on the
tenders in time for the next board meeting.


                              Yours sincerely,
                          Draft of Order

letter dated 12 February are to be constructed and' maintained

For the attention of Mr. G. Mackrell


Dear Graham,
                 Safety at Sports Grounds Act 1975
                  Cracked Beams in North Stand
       During last Summers inspection cracks in two concrete beams
in the North stand were noticed by two members of the Officer
Working Party.   He knew that the cracks were there and they have
probably been present, though not as wide, for many years.   However,
we were asked by the Officer Working Party to have the concrete
repaired.
       Although the cracks are wide, and in one case the end corner
of the beam has now come away there is no danger of a failure at
present. But the reinforcement of the concrete beams is open to the
atmosphere and will continue to corrode.   This will result in
further damage which could eventually lead to some danger*   As
damage progresses the repairs will become more expensive.
       Having looked at the cracks again last week we believe that the
time has come to have the repairs carried out. We have spoken to a
local specialist who has given us a price of £510.00 for repairing
the broken beam end and for also injecting the crack with epoxy
material. The repair of concrete using epoxy materials requires the
services of a specialist and there are hot many suitable firms in
the country.   We doubt whether any firm from outside Sheffield
will be able to give a lower price for the work.
       We consider that £510.00 is a reasonable price and therefore
recommend that the Club employ V.A. Crookes (Contracts) Ltd. to
carry out the repair.
       Enclosed is a copy of their quotation.   Perhaps the matter
could be given consideration by the Club so that the retpairs can
be completed before the next visit of the Officer Working Party,
which is likely to be in February.
       If you want to see the cracks for yourself, walk along the
ground floor of the North Stand, from the Spion Kop end, and the
cracked beams are just past entrance N, at high level, one over
the bar, the other over the ladies toilet.


                           Yours sincerely,

H.E. McGee Esq.,                                      27 January 1987
Chairman,
Sheffield Wednesday Foobball Club PLC,
c/o Presto Tools,
Penistone Road,
Sheffield 6.


Dear Chairman,
                     South Stand Roof
       First I should report that we have still not received
a copy of the letter which you have had from David Bownes.
Quite by chance, a few minutes after you telephoned me,
***•           of the Building Surveyors Department, rang me
on another matter and I was able to establish that he also had
gained the impression that the five year reprieve had been
granted subject to his department reaching agreement with us
on minor remedial works and maintenance,and the Committee was
not deferring its decision until it had received another report.
       A few days later, Mr.         telephoned to say that he
had now been asked to put in a report to the General Purposes
Panel for its meeting on 2 February and that this left very
little time for us to negotiate an agrewsent.
       Needless to say, it has not been possible to reach
agreement in the time available.   Mr. Sheriff wishes to inspect
the top boom member of every roof truss and he suspects that
thesewill not have been painted over the years and are now heavily
corroded. He therefore requested that we should scaffold the
full length of the stand a bay at a time.   As it would have cost
about £600 per bay, I refused to countenance such a suggestion or
even his alternative suggestion that we should do wvery alternate
bay.   For the time being he has agreed that we should inspect
the trusses either side of the TV access platform and as much
of the top boom as can reasonably be looked at from a ladder
at the back of the stand.    Depending on the findings, I hope
to be able to persuade him that nothing further is necessary
in that regard.
       He is wtill wishing to have some additional bracing
installed but I have persuaded him that It should be left to
us to make proposals.   In that way, I think that we have a
better chance of limiting what is eventually agreed.
       The discussions have been kept at a very friendly level
and as a result, I have been given in confidence a copy of the
report which is going to the Committee on 2 February.    A photo­
copy is enclosed.    The important parts are the recommendations
at the end.   if taken literally, these can have very considerable
financial Implications but I think there is plenty of scope
for "damage limitation".
       My feeling is that there is no need for us to request
permission to be present at the meeting next Monday but if the
Club so wished, I can arrange to attend.


                                Yours sincerely,

                                                REPORT TO GENERAL PURPOSES PANEL
                                                2ND FEBRUARY, 1987

SHEFFIELD WEDNESDAY FOOTBALL CLUB
STRUCTURAL CONDITION OF THE SOUTH STAND

Introduction
  .*‘

This report is produced in response to the request by the General Purposes
Panel held on 5th January, 1987 for a report on the structural condition of
the South Stand.

It does not deal with other aspects such as Fire or Police Authorities'
responsibilities. The Fire Authority's approval of the South Stand was given
in correspondence presented to the meeting.

The report outlines in general terms the structural matters involved and
associated legal considerations, together with recommendations which should be
observed to give a further five years' use of the Stand.

1.0     Construction and Design Concept

1.1     The South Stand was built in 1913. It consists of steel roof trusses and
        columns supported on concrete bases. Roof cladding is of timber joist
        and board construction fixed to the roof steelwork.  Timber decking and
        seating is fastened to a reinforced concrete floor system.

1.2     The structural design concept is that all vertical loads from self weight
        and imposed snow loading are transferred through the roof construction to
        the front and rear supporting columns to foundation level.

        Lateral wind loads are resisted by the roof elements forming a diaphragm
        to transfer horizontal forces through the columns and back to shear walls
        and foundations.

2.0     Comparison with' Current Regulations

2.1     The structure would have been designed to comply with the Bye-Laws and
        Codes of Practice existing at the time. The design wind and imposed
        loads recommended in these Codes would be less than used at present.
        Permitted design stresses would also be less although it is possible that
        the steel used in construction may compare favourably with that produced
        today.

2.2     An analysis of the structure has been carried out by the Structural
        Assessment Unit of the Building Surveyor's Division using modern finite
        element computer techniques and assessed to current Codes of Practice.

        The result is that under the extreme loading conditions envisaged by the
        Codes several members are overstressed and it must be concluded that the
        structure would not comply with present Building Regulations.

2.3     It should be borne in mind, however, that the basis of this report is to
        make recommendations for the safe use of the structure over a projected
        period of up to five years.

        No building can ever be guaranteed to function perfectly over an
        indefinite period and the design parameters given in Codes of Practice
        are based on an accepted statistical probability of limits being exceeded.
Safety at Sports Grounds Act

Sheffield Wednesday F.C. became designated in accordance with the Act in
August 1978 and a Safety Certificate was issued by the Administration
Authority (then South Yorkshire) in conjunction with the Buiilding, Fire
and Police Authorities in December 1979 (effective from 21st December, 19

A large number of modifications to the Stand have been carried out in
recent years in order to comply with the A c t . These have included
reinstatement of corroded members, strengthening of elements such as
staircases and repair of spalled concrete. Testing, maintenance and
survey work is always on-going to meet the safety needs.

It is perhaps in these areas that the Certificate requirements should be
more formalised with particular reference to the South Stand and some
recommendations are given in paragraph 6.0.

General Structural Appraisal

The roof trusses are out of alignment in several instances and although
this may have existed for a long time, there is bound to be a loss of
structural efficiency.

From an overall stability aspect there appears to be lack of bracing
particularly between the main columns and in the extremities of the roof.

On the credit side the structure is orientated such that the most severe
wind load condition (from the south-west) would have least effect. Over
its life-span so far the structure has shown up well to the severe
loading conditions encountered from both wind and snow.

Legal Administration

The Authority has two main safeguards in this respect

a) Safety at Sports Grounds Act and the clauses in the Safety
   Certificate. These would ensure that spectators would not be present
   during the extreme conditions outlined - although it is doubtful
   whether an event could take place under such conditions anyway.

b) Building Act 1984 sections 77 and 78. In this case the Authority
   could act directly to ensure the safety of staff or other persons at
   the ground by either the obtaining of a Court Order or in extreme
   circumstances taking action to remedy danger itself.

RECOMMENDATIONS - The South Stand should be satisfactory to be used for a
                  further period of five years, provided the following
                  points are observed:-

An immediate inspection and survey of the Stand should be carried out by
the Club's Consulting Engineer in conjunction with the Authority's
Building Surveyor's staff. A similar inspection and survey to be
undertaken twice a year.

Planned maintenance to be carried out by theClub,particularly   to
prevent water penetration through the roof.

Proposals to be submitted for approval by TheBuilding   Surveyor of any
bracing and strengthening works required.

                                          -   3   -



    6.4   The Safety Certificate to be amended to include paragraph 6.1 and to be
          re-drafted to ensure that spectators will not be in attendance under
          extreme loading conditions.

    6.5   The Club to be reminded of the Authority's powers under sections 77 and
           78 of the Building Act 1984 in relation to dangers to persons generally.

After 1st minute egress became difficult for about another minute
because spectators coming, down the gangway met spectators leaving
on the lateral gangway at the bottom of the flight.        This slows
down egress and results in a lot of pushing both at the bottom and
further up the gangway.         The handrails up the gangway help to
reduce a sudden flow of people onto the gangway but they also
prevent people getting onto the terracing easily before the start
of the match.    Spectators are then left standing in the gangway.
At half time there was a general melee at the bottom of the gangway
with people leaving for and returning from toilets and finding a
better view.    There were three policemen present but they only
managed to make the situation worse by standing in the way.
The police offered no assistance and when more police arrived,
the sergeant did nothing but look at the situation.        All calmed down
when the second half began.

Dear Graham,
                  South Stand Roof
      You will know that following the meeting with
representatives of the Licensing Authority which was held
at Hillsborough on 25 November, I undertook to write a note
regarding the structural stability of the South stand roof.
A copy of the note dated 19 December is enclosed for your
records.   The Chairman already has a copy and I have also
passed copies to Keith Addy and Ernefet Barron, both of whom
were good enough to support me at the meeting with the
Town Council on 5 January.
      You will probably have heard that the General Purposes
Committee decided that subject to agreement between the Club
and the Building Surveyors Department regarding some bracing
to give additional stability, the roof would be acceptable for
up to five years. I will be entering into discussions with the
Building Surveyors Department fairly shortly.     I have discussed
the matter with the Chairman and it has been agreed that provided
the measures which are requested do not cost more than about
£7000 - £8000 I can go ahead on your behalf.
      I shall of course start from the basic position that
in my view no bracing is necessary but tactically I think
the Club will have to concede a little. I shall try to limit
the amount that has to be spent to a figure as far below the
maximum which the Chairman has set as possible.

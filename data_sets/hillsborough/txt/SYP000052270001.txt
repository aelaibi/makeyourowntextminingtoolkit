                       Football Ground Sheffield

                   By             (A.S.O.) Mrs                              (Div. Nursing
                   Officer - Barnsley Division                    Mr        ZIU] (Ambulance
                   Member - Stairfoot Division


      At around 3.15pm on Saturday 15 April, I (            J was
      at home and switched on the television to ^
      ball matek:at Hillsborough. It was immediately apparent
      that a large scale disaster had occurred, though little
      hard information was reported. Believing the Barnsley Area
      ambulance may be able to assist, I travelled to Oakwell
      football ground, knowing that I would be able to muster a
      crew from the members present.

      Arriving at Oakwell at .pproximately 3»30pm, I informed the
      Senior Officer Div Supt Mrs :___________ of the circumstances,
      and she acceeded to my request for Mrs          1 and Mr       1
      to accompany me to Sheffield.

      We three then travelled to Cudworth and transferred to the
      Area ambulance. Using lights and sirens we made best speed
      to Hillsborough encountering standing traffic at the junction
      of Doe Royd Lane and Halifax Road. Police traffic controllers
      waved us to the "wrong” side of the dual carriageway, thus
      avoiding the traffic and we procceeded to the traffic island
      at the junction of Penistone Road Nth and Leppings Lane. Traffic
      Police there directed us towards the Leppings Lane entrance
      of the football ground, where we joined a queue of waiting
      ambulances, the time being approximately 3.55pm. After some
      five minutes, Police instructed us to go to the other side
      of the ground, where, we were told, the injured had been
      taken.

       With Police motorcycle escort, we drove via Parkside road
       to the east side of the ground where Police directed us to the
       internal access road, leading to an access point between the
       south and west stands. The ambulance was reversed to the access
        ramp and made ready to receive casualties. The three of us made
        our way onto the pitch and although there were numerous people
        obviously suffering from shock and exhaustion, we were informed
        by Police that all casualties had been removed to the Sports
        Hall.
Returning quickly to the ambulance we drove back to the Peniatone
Road entrance, turning left toward the Sporta Hall. There we
joined another queue of waiting ambulances, and aa we atopped
behind ua arrived the Barnsley Ditrict Major Incident ambulance'.
We gave asaiatance in carrying their equipment to the Sporta Hall
where we were informed that all injured had been dispatched to
hospitala in the area, and that all that waa required was -a large
quantity of body baga for the numeroua bodiea laying on the floor
of the hall, theae being temporarily covered by an aaaortment of
plaatic baga, coata and jacketa.

Not being able to help, we carried the equipment back to the
ambulance and we believe the Barnaley SYMAS ambulance then returned
to Barnaley. A senior ambulance officer asked ua and aeveral other
ambulancea to make our way to the bus depot on Herries Road South
and atand by there, to await the eventual removal of the bodies.

On arrival at the bua depot a few minutea later, another ambulance
officer aaked if we could eatablish a First Aid Station there,which
we duly did. There were large numbers of fana at the bua depot
awaiting tranaport, aome of whom were obvioualy intoxicated, many
of whom were very aubdued by the eventa, and aome distreaaed and
tearful. Mra L. __. .□ and Mr      H offered help and sympathy to
those who aproached, whilst I went back to the ground to contact
Mr       of Sheffield Area. Having reported to Mr        and it
being evident no more could be done, I returned to the bua depot.

At 5.15pm we were directed      back to the Sports Hall entrafteet^ere
a senior ambulance officer      aaid that we could atand down aa the
disposal o£ the dead would      be done by six SYMAS ambulances for
adminastratiye-reaffons. He     thanked us for our help and we then
returned to Barnsley.

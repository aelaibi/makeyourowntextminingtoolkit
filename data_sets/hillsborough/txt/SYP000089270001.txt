                    On Saturday 15 April 1989 <150489) my tour of duty was 8 am (0800) to

                    4 pm (1600) on Sub Divisonal                crime duties, however as a result of the

                    incident at the Hillsborough Football Stadium I was put on standby

                    duties at the Sheffield Medico Legal Centre with other officers to

                    help process the deceased from Hillsborough.                           At 10.30 pm (1030) no

                    bodies had arrived at the Centre and it became apparent that

                    it was going to be a prolonged operation therefore together with

                    other officers I was stood down from duty

unidentified bodies,           if they thought they recognised one then the

appropriate body was formally shown to the witness.               If the

identification was positive then together with                                 we

completed the necessary paperwork,                              doing the CJA

statement forms and myself the GEN/18 (Sudden Death Form).                 By this

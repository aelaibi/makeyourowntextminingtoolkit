HILLSBOROUGH: THE TAYLOR REPORT


I attach, as promised, a draft brief which Sir Robin may wish to
give the Prime Minister before the meeting at No 10 at 11.00 am
tomorrow.   I have had to prepare it without sight of the Home
Secretary's promised minute, but I hope that it covers the main
points adequately.

Draft
PRIME MINISTER
HILLSBOROUGH: THE TAYLOR REPORT
You are to discuss with the Home Secretary and the Environment
Secretary at      11.00    am tomorrow the handling             of Lord Justice
Taylor's final report on the Hillsborough disaster.                       The Lord
President, the Chief Whip and Mr Moynihan will also be present.


LORD JUSTICE TAYLOR'S CONCLUSIONS AND RECOMMENDATIONS


2.   A copy of Lord Justice Taylor's report is attached.                        His
conclusions       on    the      football    membership        scheme     and   his
recommendations are flagged (A and B respectively).


3.   On the football -membership scheme (Part I of the Football
Spectators      Act    1989),    Lord Justice       Taylor makes    no specific
recommendation.        But he concludes (paragraph 424):


        "...I   have    grave     doubts    about    the    feasibility    of the
     national membership scheme and serious misgivings about its
     likely impact on safety.          I also have grave doubts about the
     chances of its achieving its purposes and am very anxious
     about its potential impact on police commitments and control
     of spectators.             For these reasons,         I cannot support the
     implementation of Part I of the Act".




                                   CONFIDENTIAL
                                  CONFIDENTIAL




4.   Lord Justice        Taylor       derives    these    conclusions   from his
consideration of the safety and crowd control implications of the
scheme.    He finds that the scheme as conceived would add to the
danger of congestion and disorder at grounds.                   Specifically it
would add to the         delay    in processing          spectators through the
turnstiles and the technology involved is unproven.                   It would be
difficult to test the system effectively and it is likely that
hooligans will attempt to defeat the system, so adding to safety
and crowd control problems.                 Lord Justice Taylor also doubts
whether the scheme will prevent hooliganism within grounds and
believes   that   even    if     it   does,     it will    simply   transfer the
problem outside.    He is also worried about the substantial impact
the scheme will have on police resources.


5.   Lord Justice Taylor puts               forward an alternative strategy
(paragraph 426) for tackling hooliganism.                  This would rely on a
combination of all or some of the following measures:


     developing the detection and evidential potential of closed
     circuit      television          and     the   new    National     Football
     Intelligence Unit;


     creating     criminal       offences       to prohibit    the throwing of
     missiles, chanting of obscene or racist abuse or going on
     the pitch without reasonable excuse;




                                  CONFIDENTIAL
                             CONFIDENTIAL




      extending courts' power to make attendance centre orders, in
      conjunction with exclusion orders, so as to keep hooligans
      away from grounds;


      using electronic monitoring (tagging) for the same purpose.


Lord Justice Taylor believes         that,     together    with the other
measures recommended in his report, these steps would give the
best chance of minimising hooliganism.


6.    Lord Justice Taylor's recommendations         centre on the phased
introduction of all-seating and other improved accommodation at
grounds.     The powers    in Section 13 of the          1989 Act for the
Football Licensing Authority to oversee the way local authorities
discharge    their   responsibilities    for    ground    safety would be
retained.    Other recommendations are directed to improving crowd
control within grounds, and to the arrangements made by clubs,
the police and the other emergency services for ensuring crowd
safety.‚Äù


GOVERNMENT LINE ON THE MEMBERSHIP SCHEME


7.    The provisions in Part I of the 1989 Act were hard fought.
As   well   as the   official    Opposition     a number    of Government
supporters expressed reservations about them.              (Part II of the
Act - which introduces Restriction Orders on those convicted of




                                CONFIDENTIAL
                                 CONFIDENTIAL




football related offences designed to stop them travelling abroad
- was generally welcomed and is endorsed by Lord Justice Taylor.)


8.   The Government line during the Parliamentary proceedings on
the Act was that the football membership scheme had to be seen
against the background of several decades of problems with crowd
safety and hooliganism.      The Act was so constructed as to require
               Resolution Orders to set up the Football Membership
Authority and to approve the details of the membership scheme.
In   answering     questions      on    2 0 April    in    the    aftermath     of
Hillsborough you said:
      "Let    me   deal   with    the    very   important        matter   of   the
      'membership scheme'        part of the Bill.        The Bill itself does
     not provide such a          scheme: it sets up a procedure through
     which others may propose such a scheme for the Secretary of
     State's approval.           It will then have to laid before the
     House.    The Bill will not pre-empt any decisions that may be
     made by Lord Justice Taylor."
A copy o:f the full Hansard extract of this answer, and of another
on 25 April, are attached.


ISSUES FOR DISCUSSION


9.   I understand that the Home           Secretary will be submitting a
minute before tomorrow's meeting identifying three options on the
football membership scheme:-




                                  CONFIDENTIAL
                                CONFIDENTIAL




      i.    to reject Lord Justice Taylor's conclusion and press
            ahead with the implementation of Part I of the Act;


      ii.   to   accept   his   conclusion      and    announce    that    the
            membership scheme is being dropped;


      iii. a middle course, viz to say that the scheme will not be
            implemented while      Lord Justice       Taylor's    alternative
            strategy is tried but indicating that the Government
            intends to keep the scheme          in reserve       in case the
            alternative strategy proves unsatisfactory.


Both the Home Secretary and Mr Patten are likely to support the
middle course.


10.   The main questions on the football membership scheme for
consideration tomorrow are therefore


      i.    Does anyone wish to argue that Lord Justice Tavlor's
            conclusion    should be       rejected?     The   Chief Whip    is
            likely to argue that he could not guarantee a vote in
            favour   of the     scheme,    given   Lord   Justice Taylor's
            reservations about it.


      ii. Are there any difficulties in accepting Lord Justice
            Tavlor's alternative strategy?            Most of his proposals
            build on action already put in hand by the Government.

                                                 CONFIDENTIAL




            But        some would                 require      legislation.                       Can these be
            accommodated?                    (A Criminal           Justice              Bill       is a likely
            runner for next session's legislative programme.)


11.   No doubt you will want to take the Home Secretary and Mr
Patten's views on the acceptability or otherwise of the rest of
Lord Justice Tavlor's findings and recommendations.                                                  Most seem
unexceptionable,               but          it    is clear that            they have major cost
implications for football.                          Lord Justice Taylor suggests (para
108) that some of the product of the football pools might be
diverted to the clubs.                       The Chancellor will need to be consulted
on this.


12.   You   will          also          wish       to       consider      the               handling    of the
Government's response to the report.                               It would seem desirable, if
possible,        to       set        the         response      to        Lord           Justice        Taylor's
conclusions on the football membership scheme in the context of
the Government's response to as many as possible of the other
findings and recommendations of his report.                                     Can the Government's
response     to       the        recommendations               be    worked                 out    sufficiently
quickly     to    allow            this?           On       timing. I          understand              that the
earliest     the         report             can    be       published          is           next    Tuesday    or
Wednesday,        if       printed               copies      are    to    be        available           in HMSO
bookshops nationally.                       The Home Secretary would make a statement
to the House on the day of publication.                                        This delay carries a
danger that the report's contents may leak meanwhile.                                                   You may
wish to suggest that a contingency plan is needed which would

involve bringing forward the Home Secretary's statement should
the report's contents show signs of leaking.     Duplicated copies
of the text of the report could be made available to MPs and the
media if necessary.


13.   As well as a statement on publication, there may well have
to be a Parliamentary debate on the report in due course.       It
would seem sensible for the Government to offer this from the
outset.   You will wish to take the Lord President's mind on this
and other aspects of Parliamentary handling.


HANDLING OF THE MEETING


14.   No doubt you will wish first to take the mind of colleagues
on how the Government should respond to Lord Justice Taylor's
findings on the football membership scheme.     The Home Secretary
could be invited to introduce his minute and the Environment
Secretary and Mr Moynihan to add their views.   The Lord President
and Chief Whip will be     able to deal with the     Parliamentary
implications.   Once the line of the Government's response to the
report is decided,    you will wish to move on to consider the
handling and other presentational issues as identified above.

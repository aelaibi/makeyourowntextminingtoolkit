After what appeared like several minutes the door was opened and a

large flood of people entered shouting and complaining at the crush.

Numerous were gasping, for breath some                          close to unconsciousness the

maj o rity v isibly shocked.

After the initial             flood had died down 1 took my officers to the front

of the Leppings Lane terrace via the South side of tfae ground.                                               As we

be si;-; or seven deep.              The exit' gate was opeij/fiowever due to the

volume of people nobody                 could get out.            There was only a couple of

police officers             there at     chi s time,,       It was obvious 'Chat a large

number of people at the front were already unconscious                                     or dead.

                    'D' Group, West Bar Police Station, Sheffield.


At 8am on Saturday 15th April 1989 I commenced duty at West Bar Polise Station
and took charge of serial 8 . Our duties for the initial phase was to supervise
both the Nottingam Forest Fans and the Liverpool fans as they arrived at the Midland
Station by train. They were then to be escorted by buses to, the Hillsborough football
ground.


After a briefing at West Bar Police Station at 9am my serial took up position at the
Midland Station at 9»30 am.


This duty continued until shortly after 2pm when my serial travelled to the ground
and took position in the Gymnasium at Hillsborough awaiting further intructions.

Whilst at the gym    it became apparant from the radio traffic that there was an
increasing problem developing at the turnstiles at the ^eppings Lane end of the
ground. In view of this Inspector Sewell directed myself and 9 police Constables
who were close at hand, to make ourway to the Leppings Lane end in an attempt to eleviate
the problem.

On route to the Lepppmgg Lane end I saw a problem developing at a set of large blue
coloured concertina doors. I saw persons climbing over the dooss in an effort to
gain entry. I could see through the turnstiles that persons were on the floor outside
the ground and due to the crowd they were unable to get to their feet. Persons were
screeming at us through the turnstiles to open the doors or people would be crushed.

The large door was visibly moving under the pressure being exerted on it. Screems could
be heard coming from the other side of the gate. After what appeared like seteeral
minutes the door was opened and a large flood of people entered shouting and
complaining at the crush. Numerous were gasping for breath some close to unconsciusness
the majority visibily shocked.

After the initial flood had died down I took my officers to the front of the “eppings Lane
terrace via the South side of the ground. As we made our way on to the pitch I could see
that the "^eppings Lane terrace in front of the goal was full to over capacity. As I
looked at the front of the terrace I saw that persons were being crushed against the
perimeter fence unable to move. The bodies appeared to be six or seven deep. She
exit gate was open however due to the volume of people nobody could feet out. There was
only a couple of police officers there at this time It was obvious that a large number
  of people at the front were already unconscious or dead.

Screems of pain could be heard coming from the trapped. Victims ranged from small
children to women and old people. The crowd at the rear of the terrace however appeared
unaware of the carnage at the front and were aggravating the situation by continuing
to push. The tunnel    connecting the terrace with the outer part of the ground was full
with persons still entering. On   seeing this I directed the officers to attempt to get as many
persons as possible out of the ^errace and onto the pitch. Numerous attem ts by myself
to get the crowd to move awajr from the front was met fey a hail of abuse and several
missiles were thrown at us. It was obvious that a large number of the rowdy crowd had
been drinking and were drunk. I then tried to get as many out of the terrace as possible.

After a while I climbed over the fencing to gain entey into the terrace in order to
administer first aid to people.

I approached a young   fliale youth at the front of the terrace who had been trapped under
the crowd. The young   man showed no signs of life I theerfore commenced mouth to mouth
resusitation. After several minutes, no response was apparant I therefore carried the
body onto the pitch. Details of the deceased are as follows:

 Henry Charles ROGERS l7yrs of               Didsbury in Chester.

The youth was carried to the Gymnasium by myself and another officer where      he was laid
out. At 3.20 pm Dr Riddell certified life   extinct.


The body was then left in situ until 5 .15 am on the 16th April 1989 wherethe     youths father
Stephen ROGERS formally identified the body to me. I completed a GEN 18 for the
deceased.

The body was then conveyed by ambulance to the Sledico Legal centre where the deceased
was laid out by the mortuary staff.


I then returned to West Bar Police Station and went off duty at 5.V? am 16.^.89.

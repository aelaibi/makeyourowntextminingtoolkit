David Maclean's Private Secretary, Catherine Webster, wrote to you on 31 January
about your request for information on those who were due to give oral evidence to the
Taylor Inquiry into the Hillsborough Disaster but who were not called and therefore did
not do so.

* Although Miss Webster indicated that your enquiry had been passed to the Department
 of National Heritage to investigate, I understand that the Taylor Inquiry papers which
 they once held are now stored at the Public Records Office and it has been agreed,
 therefore, that I should reply.

My officials have made enquiries into this matter but I regret that the information you
have requested is not readily available and could only be obtained at disproportionate
cost. Lord Taylor's report contained details of the evidence submitted to the Inquiry,
including a list of those who gave evidence in person. No information was given,
however, about anyone whom the inquiry intended to call but who subsequently did
not give evidence. It may be possible to ascertain from the Inquiry papers whether
there were any such cases but there are some 106 files relating to the Taylor Inquiry
and we cannot readily identify those files which might relate to the matters which you
are interested in. I regret, therefore, that we have been unable to answer your query.

As you know, the Home Secretary undertook in December to consider the points which
were made in the programme "Hillsborough", and the representations made to him by
the bereaved families and by others before reaching a decision on whether to reopen
the Hillsborough inquiry.

In addition, he has now received a detailed report of all the points raised by the
programme from the Chief Constable of South Yorkshire, and he is also considering
copies of the video surveillance tapes used at the ground that day which have been
supplied by South Yorkshire Police. He will reach a decision on any further action to
be taken as soon as possible.

     Mr Maclean


^    HILLSBOROUGH-EDDIELOYDENMP


     Issue

    Mr Loyden telephoned your office seeking a list of people who were due to give oral evidence
    to the Taylor Inquiry into the Hillsborough Disaster but who were not called. This followed
    several written Parliamentary Questions which Mr Loyden asked in January (copies attached).
    Miss Webster’s note of 27 January to Paul Pugh refers.

    liming

    2.     This case has been delayed with the Department of National Heritage, who were
    originally intending to respond to Mr Loyden, so it would be helpful if we could reply as soon
    as possible.

    Recommendation

    3.     We recommend that you write to Mr Loyden as set out in the attached draft indicating
    that the information which he has requested is not readily available.

    Consideration

    4.     In our reply to Mr Loyden’s Parliamentary Questions about the Taylor Inquiry, we
    indicated that information about those who gave or submitted evidence to the Inquiry was
    contained in Lord Taylor’s interim and final reports. Mr Loyden subsequently asked for a list of
    those who were due to give oral evidence but were not called and, therefore, did not actually
    give evidence. We have no indication of whether there were any such cases but we have made
    enquiries to see whether it is possible to ascertain this information from the Taylor Inquiry
    papers. In the event, it has not been practical to do so.

    5.     We understood from the Department of National Heritage (DNH) initially that they held
    the papers relating to the Taylor Inquiry. Consequently, they undertook to examine the papers
 and write to Mr Loyden to inform him whether the information he requested was readily
 available. Miss Webster wrote to Mr Loyden on 31 Januaiy, informing him of the position.

6.      We have since discovered that the 106 files relating to the Taylor Inquiiy were
subsequently passed to Record Management Services in the Home Office for review, and DNH
have therefore suggested that we should reply to Mr Loyden. The files are now in the Public
Records Office in Kew.

7.     It is not apparent from the titles of the files which ones might contain details of those
witnesses who gave, or who were due to give, oral evidence to the Taylor Inquiry, or even
whether any of the files contain the relevant information. In view of the large number of files, it
would require considerable time and resources to do an exhaustive search of the papers. We
therefore, recommend that you advise Mr Loyden that the information requested is not readily
available.

Handling / Presentation

8.      Although there has been renewed interest in the Hillsborough Disaster as a result of the
Granada television programme and the families’ calls for a new inquiry, we do not believe
there are any particular handling considerations to this correspondence.




                                                              MJPYNE
  DRAFT LETTER TO EDDIE LOYDEN MP FOR SIGNATURE BY M of S



 My Private Secretary, Catherine Webster, wrote to you on 31 January about your request for

PHONE CALL FROM EDDIE LOYDEN MP

Mr Loyden contacted this office as he was not entirely happy with the response to his
written questions (No 151 & 214) which he received on 21 January.

In addition to the answer he received, he would like a list of people who were due to
give oral evidence but were not called and therefore did not actually give oral
evidence.

I would be grateful for a draft letter for Mr Maclean to send to Mr Loyden by close on
Friday 31 January.

 Qqo^t m r

You requested further information about those people due to give oral evidence to the Taylor
Inquiry, but who were not called and therefore did not do so.

The papers relating to the Taylor Inquiry are held by the Department of National Heritage,
and are currently in storage at Hayes Record Centre. Officials at the Department of National
Heritage have undertaken to investigate whether the information you have requested is
readily available, and will write to you further in due course.

I am copying this letter to Mr Sproat’s Private Secretary at the Department of National
Heritage.

Mr Pu

PHONE CALL FROM EDDIE LOYDEN MP

Mr Loyden contacted this office as he was not entirely happy with the response to his
written questions (No 151 & 214) which he received on 21 January.

In addition to the answer he received, he would like a list of people who were due to
give oral evidence but were not called and therefore did not actually give oral
evidence.

I would be grateful for a draft letter for Mr Maclean to send to Mr Loyden by close on
Friday 31 January.

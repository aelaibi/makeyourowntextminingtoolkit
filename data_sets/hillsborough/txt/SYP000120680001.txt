               At      The       Travellers              Pub    we    were      approached              by    the    licensee,             who       told       us

sat    drinking              been       and    playing          football.              All     were    moved        on      and

advised        to       go    to    the       ground.

In    company           with       PC    E749       Alien,       walked        to      our     point       fenistone             Road

North     apposite             junction             with    Wardsend           Road       North       outside         Funeral

H o m e , J . Fairest.

There     was       a    pub       opposite          but    this       was     closed          to    Liverpool           fans.

Liverpool           fans       were       already          arriving          by     car,       bus    and      van.         At       o ne

stage     whilst             Sgt.       Atkins        with       us    heard      of a       stolen        car f r o m L i v e r poo

being     found          by    a    Special           Constable.

As    -fans w a l k e d        past       u s , many         were       drinking             cans     of    beer,lager,                 e t c.

and    gradually              lines       of    empty        cans       began        to      grow.         It b e c a m e    obvious

that     many       fans       had       arrived       without           tickets          and       were     walking         around

saying        "Any       spares          mate?"

Soon     the    flow          of    fans       began       to    reverse          itself        till       there      were           more

leaving        the       ground          than       were     heading           for      it.

E nqui ries         revealed             they       were     either          going        to   The     Fox Pub           on Fox         Hi 1 1

Road     or    looking             for    art o f f - l i c e n c e     to     buy beer.

The    Fox     appeared             to    be    a     meeting          p o int for        manygroups             of f a n s .

Whenever        possible                fans    were       advised        to      go    to     the    ground        early            and

those     without             tickets          not    to    approach           the      ground.            This     advice            was

n o t tak e n by an y t h at 1 c an r e c a 11 .

Numbers        arriving             were       increasing,             many       drinking           and     carrying            a    suppl

of    beer     though          generally             the    crowd       was       well       behaved        and     in      good

humour.         By       now       cans       and    bottles          were     lining          the    walls       everywhere.

Several        coaches             arriving          which       had    been        directed          to    Halifax          Road           to

discharge           passengers,                attempted          stop       on     Penistone          Road       North          these

were     prevented             from       doing       so    as    they       were       obstructing             traffic.               They

were     sent       to       Halifax          Road.

Fans     arriving             in    large       numbers,          but     some         were     still        heading         for        The

Fo     Pub .
A    Special       Train        due     to       arrive          at       2.OHpm          (1402>          arrived             early         1.30pm

(1350)       approx.            Its     passengers                   were          quickly          marshalled                outside           Wads ley

Bridge       Station         then       escorted                towards             the     ground.             Only          a    few     of    this

group       were     drinking,              but       there          were          some     without            tickets             as     they       were

asking       for     any     spares          as       they       passed.

I saw       one    man     who        appeared             to    be       selling           tickets            as    I approached                    he

saw    me    and     moved        off       into          the    crowd.

The    train        crowd       were        in    good          humour             and    gave       little          or       no    cause        for

ca ncern.

As    kick    off        time     got       nearer          the          pace       of    fans       quickened                from        fast

walking       to     trotting           to       running.                 A    lot       seemed          to    be    coming             out     of       Fox

Mill    Lane       and     must-       have       beer* d r i n k i n g              right          up    to    the           last minute.

They    were        obviously           trying             to    make          up    for       lost       time.

Some    time        near     to       3pm    (1300)             when          we    were       walking          towards             Travellers

Pub    with       Sgt.     Atkin,           overheard                a    radio          conversation                between             an

officer       on     Leppings           Lane          tu r n s t i l e s , ,        he    was       having          problems             with        a

late    build        up    of     Liverpool                fans          and       that     things            were       getting           out       of

hand,       someone        would        get       hurt          if       matters          w e r e n ’t        sorted          out       quick.

Also    heard        a    request           for       a    possible                delay            of   kick        o f f to           give     time          to

get    fans       in a n d      I got        the          impression                that            there      w o u l d be              ad e l a y «

were    several           police        horses            and        uniformed              officers            about,             but     no    great

fans       the    worse       for       drink        who      kept       insisting                 to    get       in.           We    were       not

aware       of    what      had     happened             until       I saw           a       casualty             being          brought          out       of

the    ground          by   a PC        who       immediately              gave          mouth          to    mouth.              As       an

ambulance          arrived,             we    were       directed           through                a    large          open       gate          into

the    area       behind       the       Leppings             Lane       terrace.

There       I saw       many       people          laid       out    with        police                and    other             fans       giving

aid    some       were      trying           to    resuscitate              people.                    Also       saw       many       fans,

attacking          Police,          verbal           a b u s e , spitting                    etc.

Was    then       directed              down      the t u n n e l     which                  had       only 2      or       3    people          in    it,

to    the    terraces.                  There        I was         confronted                 with       on my         right          in    one       pen

a    pile    of    people,          all       on     top      of    each        other,             the       Police             and    fans

pulling          these      trapped           o u t , total          confusion                    with       people             getting          in    each

o t H e-;r s w a y .

To    my    left,       the    other           pen      was    relatively                    clear,          to    avoid          the

confusion          I made          my    way       onto       the    pitch           through             this          pe n .         An

ambulance          had      arrived           behind          the    goal.               I went          to       the       gate       in       the

fence       where       fans       were       trapped          and       with        another             officer,                pulled          one

fan    out       and    clear.           We       carried          him     to    a       clear          spot       immediately                   behind

the    goal       net,      the     area          was    littered           with             people          and       began

resuscitation,                 1 gave             mouth       to    mouth.               The       other          PC    gave          heart

massage.           This       went       on       for    5 - “10 m i n u t e s           and       there          was       no    response.

and    brought          out    another             person,          took        to       a     spot      near          to       first       one       and

During       this       time       confusion             reigned           supreme.                    There       were          obviously             n ot

enough       equipment             to    deal        with      this.            It       was       becoming             obvious             that
this     was       a major          disaster           and       many          were       dead       or    seriously           injured.

Liverpool              fans    were       also        helping             their       own       and       many     did    a    great           j o b.

Sadly       many        caused       trouble,              picking             fights          with       Police,        abuse,

I was       kicked        twice          whilst        trying          to       resuscitate                people        and       spat        on     by

Liverpool              fans.

By    now        the    who 1 e     of     the        goal       area       was       littered             with    the        deadand

injured.               Many    in a        state           of    s h o c k » many trying                   to    find     best friends.

Small       groups        of      Liverpool            fans       were          still          causing          problems           for        Police.

By    now        someone       had       begun        to     clear         bodies          and       injured        from       the        pitch

Liverpool              fans    were       still         causing            problems             on    the       terracing,              missiles

must     have          been    thrown,           PC        Robinson             from       B e n t 1 ey was         hit       on    the        back

of    the        head    by    an    unknown           object,             probably             a    coin.

During          all     this      I heard        3     PA       announcements                   -    1.     Early        on    an       appeal

Then     at       last    we      got     an    order           from       Supt.          to    fall       back     and       form        a    line

then     gently          usher'      everyone              off    the          pitch       and       terracing           out       of     the

ground.

Met    up       with     other       officers              from       A3       Sub    Division             but     only       one       from        my

Eventually              met    with       rest        of    serial             33    outside          ground.

             By   now    it w a s    apparent         many    lives          had    been          lost    either      on    the

             terracing       or     at   the    turnstiles.

             I do    recall,        whilst      serial       33    on    its       way       to   Loppings       Lane,       that       a

             request      was     made     over   the    radio          to    open       a    gate       and   that    request          was

             granted,       I believe          that    came       from       the    Poli, ce C o n t r o l       and       was    due       to   a

             crush      outside      the    ground      at    Leppings             Lane.

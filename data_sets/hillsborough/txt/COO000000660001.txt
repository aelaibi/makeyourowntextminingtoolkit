I am s or ry not to have replied earlier to your letter of 21 April!
a s k i n g a d v i c e in c a s e t he p r i m e M i n i s t e r w a s a s k e d a b o u t the
p o s s i b i l i ty that Lord Justice Taylor might take a different view
on m e m b e r s h i p c a r d s f r o m Mr j u s t i c e P o p p l e w e l l . I have also
r e c e i v e d a l e t t e r f r o m N i c k G i b b o n s in t he L o r d p r i v y S e a l ' s
o ffice on the same subject. We have since agreed the line that
"the G o v e r n m e n t w o u l d h a v e to g i v e v e r y g r e a t w e i g h t to L o r d
Justice Taylor's views though it would need to study c arefully
why he had taken a d if ferent view from Mr Justice Popplewell. it
w ould then be for G overnment and P arliament to decide."

You will also have seen the letter of 26 April from Colin Walters
in the Home Secretary's office to Alan Ring in my S ecretary of
State's office, from which it seems that Lord just ic e Taylor may
not comment on the question of the National M e m b e r s h i p Scheme, or
other legislative issues, until his final report at the end of
the year.   Min is te rs will c l e ar ly need to c on si de r the serious
implications of this for the Football Spect at or s Bill.

It would be p os sible to amend the Bill, as you suggested in your
letter, to provide that the Football M e m b e r s h i p A uthority would
only prepare a scheme,                 "if so d i r e c t e d b y t h e S e c r e t a r y of
State", though, of course, the. implication would be that there
c o u l d be a s i g n i f i c a n t d e l a y in b o t h t h e p r e p a r a t i o n a n d the
impleme nt ation of the scheme.                We might also need to consider the
p o s s i b i li ty of another amendment to ensure that the scheme to be
drawn up within the f ra mework imposed by the Bill could be made
s u b j e c t to a n y r e l e v a n t c o n d i t i o n s r e c e i v e d b y L o r d j u s t i c e
Taylor.          Both courses of action pose serious problems.

I am copying this letter to Colin Walters (Home Office), Steven
C a t l i n g ( L o r d p r e s i d e n t ' s O f f i c e ) , N i c k G i b b o n s ( Lo rd p r i v y
Seal's Office) and M urdo Maclean (Chief Wh ip 's Office).

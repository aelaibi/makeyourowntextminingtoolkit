         My    father           and J       then managed                to       push a n d      shove       our w a y       towards

         As    I got          inside         I saw a gr oup                 of a b o u t      25 - 30 youths                standing          in the

Gradually          people          came       stag              g out        of      the    tunnel.            People         were      out

of    breath and             the    numberv^t                 the   head        of    the       group     coming          out w e r e

panic       stricken.              As    mo^e       people          came     out      I became           aware       of      the      fact

that       some    were       in d i r e       need       of    help.



One    of    the       youths       who       had    come       out       i n i t i a l l y was         a young         blonde         haired

lad    of a b o u t       16 y e a r s        old.        As    space        was      made        for    the    people            coming

out    of    th e re ,       this       young       lad was          laid       down       on     the    ground         to    the      right

of    the    tunnel.           He       was    being          attended          to    by    the       people      wh o       carried         him

out.        His    fa c e     was       white       to    start       with        but      then       turned      red,        then      blue

in the        10 m i n u t e s      or    so    t h at        I stood        there.




I paid a          lot     of a t t e n t i o n       to       the    care       that       wa s     b ei n g   given         to    this

young       lad,       and    was       only    later a war e              of     the      f ac t     that     about         3 - 4      dead

bodies       with       faces       covered          up,       they were             in the         immediate           foreground            to

the    tunnel          entrance.



At    this       po int      by a b o u t      3.25       pm    (1^5*5 hrs),               gate       C ha d    been         opened

A    lot    of    people        were      p^rtiic s t r i c k e n          and       out    of      b r e a t h as      they       emerged

from       the    tunnel.           Although             1 didn't          see       it,    I can        be    s u re     t h at      the    3 -

4    bodies       that       I saw,       in a d d i t i o n         to    the       young        16 y e ar     old,         must      have

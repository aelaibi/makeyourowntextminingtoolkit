Dear Sir

Hillsborough - Resumed Inquests

We refer to your letter dated 8th November and the attached summaries.
We have considered the facts with our Client, Chief Superintendent D G
Duckenfield.

We would wish to make some general points as to the nature of the facts
upon which you seek agreement.

Firstly,   the most significant point is that a quantity of detail
contained in the factual summaries was not within our Client's knowledge
at the time of the disaster, and, therefore, cannot have had any bearing
on decisions made or not made by him.

Secondly, we trust you will appreciate that certain of the facts comprise
information which has only been obtained subsequent to the disaster and
again, cannot be said to have had any influence on our Client with regard
to the events of the day.     Accordingly, our Client would not wish to
challenge the veracity of much of what is stated, but we would wish to
place on record that this is not to say that he would necessarily accept
that certain of the detail is factually correct.

Our Client has some specific comment to make in respect of the two draft
proposals

First draft commencing "the present road network                                                    "

Pages 3/4                "Police arrangements"

With regard to the distribution of manpower, our Client considers that so
far as he was aware at the time of the disaster, manpower levels for the
1989 semi-final had been reduced from those of 1988. This decision was
made by others and he was not a party to it. Based on calculations made
by our Client, we understand the respective total Police manpower levels
to be 901 in 1988 and 729 in 1989. Perhaps the representatives of the

      Chief Constable of South Yorkshire can assist in resolving this apparent
      discrepancy.

      Second draft commencing "Sheffield Wednesday Football Club       "

      Page 5

      At paragraph 5 thereof, that prior to the match our Client was not made
      aware of the facility of the board and its capability to display messages
      prior to the match.

      As to the final paragraph of this page, our Client advises that the 1981
      semi-final and any facts relating to that match were never brought to his
      attention prior to 1989 semi-final, so far as he can recall.

      Can you advise whether it is your intention to provide the jury with a
      copy of the summary, as agreed, if appropriate?

      Of additions or deletions suggested by others, we trust that you will
      submit a copy of the amended draft to us for our consideration. Given the
      proximity to the Inquests reconvening, perhaps such a draft could be
      provided on the first morning when submissions are being made?

      As a final point, you did indicate that you would give consideration to
      providing in advance lists of witnesses which you are intending to call
      to give evidence. We would ask that such advance notice is given as soon
      as possible to enable us to consider how best to represent our Client's
      interests.

      The Writer was requested to forward a copy of this letter to Detective
      Superintendent Beechey and has done so by fax today.

                                ther questions please do not hesitate to contact
      the Writer, Mr/Coughlin

Hillsborough - Resumed Inquests

We refer to your letter dated 8th November and the attached summaries.
We have considered the facts with our Client, Chief Superintendent D G
Ducken£i«ld,

We would wish to make some general points as to the nature of the facts
upon which you soak agreement.

Firstly,   the most significant point is that a quantity of detail
contained in the factual summaries was not within our Client's knowledge
at the time of the disaster, and, therefore, cannot have had any bearing
on deeicions made or not made by him.

Secondly, we trust you will appreciate that certain of the facts comprise
information which has only been obtained subsequent to the disaster and
again, cannot be said to have had any influence on our client with regard
to the events of the day.     Accordingly, our Client would not wish to
challenge the veracity of much of what is stated, but we would wish to
place on record that this is not to say that he would necessarily accept
that certain o£ the detail is factually correct.

Our Client has some specific comment to make in respect of the two draft
proposals:~

First d ^ f*- <^>|w»encinq "the present road network                                                11

Pages 3/4                 "Police arrangements"

With regard to the distribution of manpower, our Client considers that so
far as he was aware at the time of the disaster, manpower levels for the
1989 semi-final had been reduced from those of 1988. This decision was
made by others and he was not a party to it. Based on calculations made
by our Client, we understand the respective total Police manpower levels
to be 901 in 1988 and 729 in 1909. Perhaps the representatives of the

      Chief Constable of South Yorkshires can assist in resolving this apparent
      discrepancy.

      Second draft commencing "Sheffield Wednesday Football club      "

      P&9S. 5
      Jit paragraph 5 thereof/ that prior to the match our Client was not made
      aware of the facility of the board and its capability to display messages
      prior to the match.

      As to the final paragraph of this page, our Client advises that the 1981
      semi-final and any facts relating to that match were never brought to his
      attention prior to 1989 semi-final, so far as he can recall.

     Can you advise whether it is your intention to provide the Jury with a
     copy of the summary, as agreed, if appropriate?

     Of additions or deletions suggested by others, we trust that you will
     Submit a copy o£ the amended draft to us for our consideration. Given the
     proximity to the Inquests reconvening, perhaps such a draft could be
     provided on the first morning when submissions are being made?

     As a final point, you did indicate that you would give consideration to
     providing in advance lists of witnesses which you are intending to call
     to give evidence. We would ask that such advance notice is given as soon
     as possible to enable us to consider how best to represent our Client's
     interests.

     The Writer was requested to forward a copy of this letter to Detective
     Superintendent Beechey and has done so by fax today.

                               ther questions please do not hesitate to contact
     the Writer, Mr/Coughlin

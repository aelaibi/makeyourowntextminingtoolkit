               On S a t u r d a y   15 A p r i1 1989         ( 150489)   N o t t i n g h a m Forest and Liverpool             met

               each other at S h e f f i el d W e d n e s d a y ’s ground,             Hillsborough,         in the Semi

               Final     of the FA Cup,



               I had tickets             for the m at ch and got to the ground at about                        12 midday

               (1200).        I t r avelled       to the ground wit h my wife,                            and son,

                           ■15.     We    tra ve ll ed   by car and       I parked       in S h ef fi el d W e d n e s d a y ’s

                :ar park,         no 2,    on Herr ie s Rd.
                                                                                                      PAGE
                                                                                                      S2040

On the way to the ground                 I e x pe ri en ce d no traffic            problems.       It was

busy but       there was       no     problems.



On the way to the ground                 I saw s upporters        but    I saw no disorder             or

drunke n n ess.



I made rny way       to the grou nd and went              to the gate at the                rear of the

S p io n Kop on Penistorte Rd North.                A P ol i ce m an asked to see my tickets

and then       let me,     my wife and son into the ground.



We made     our way      to the sponsors'           lounge,   w h ic h       is u nd er n ea t h the

centre     of the S ou th Stand.



Du ri ng   the day,      prior        to the match,      a number       of    people    came to the

lounge.        We share     the       lounge with

                           and                                      The       people who used the

lounge     that day were all             friends,    family and         customers       of the

d i f ferent     companies,         there were forty       people       in all.



One    of the     people    in my group was                                  who    is a surgeon.



Between     1430 hours and             '1445 h o u r s, all/the    people          inside    the   lounge

took    their    seats     in the S outh S t a n d /       I was on the very front                  row and

I think     it was      seat     no          "he row is Row A.



                  sat    behind me on Row C.



I looked across          to the West Stand on Leppi ng s jLn and saw that                           the

middle     two   pens were          packed full     of   people,    j/ut that the            corner    pens

had    plenty of     room.
                                                                                                           PAGE        3
                                                                                                           S2040



I saw    people       in the middle          two    pens    climbing       up the wall            into the

seats    behind them.           The    people       in the seats were              reaching        forward and

pulling the          people    up into the seats.                 At this      time the          players

were    on pitch having a kick around before                           the match.



At this       time    I also    saw    people       climbing       over the        per                fence and

onto    the    running wall       that       surrounds       the       pitch             they got       onto the

running       TrraTTT, m e     Ponce     were       taking       the    peof le      o the       corner    pens

were    there was       still    plenty of room.



The    game    kicked off at          1300 hours,          I never a ct ua ll y w at ch ed the game,

because       I was more       i n terested        in what was          happening         in   that    sect i o n of

the    crowd.        Just after       kick    off more       people       seemed /o            climb over    the

top of the fence.              We all    thought          that    the fans        hJ d    started fighting.



I saw all       the    fans    in the    two       pens    behind the goal               surge    forward.


                                                                                                  /
A   lot of     people were       by/now on the             pitch and       I saw a you^ig man be

carried       to just    by whe/e we were.                 They    lay him down j g x \          the ground       in

front of us and a mat/ started to give m outh to moil'll to him. Dr
    fe<5v
PURCELL, the Club D/ctor, came down and started to work on him as well



A no t h e r man was     carried out          near    to the       centre      post and          laid him down,



At this       stage a Police Of fi c er             ran onto       the    pitch and spoke              to the

referee.        The Ref       then took       the    players       off the        pitch.



My daughter,                                                                                       r became

upset    by what was          happeni ng and asked me to go and help on the                                pitch,

      M ys e l f and                           went to the top of the stairs and spoke                       to a

      Po li c e Sergeant.           He    contacted somebody on his               radio and told them

      that               was a doctor.            We were a ll o we d through the different

      tunnels and to the             p l a y e r s ’ tunnel    that    leads to the          pitch.        There we

      met a P o l i c e m an who a sk ed          if we were     the two doctors.                We told him

      that    I w a s n ’t but that                  was and we were a l lo we d onto                the    pitch.



      We    headed towards          the    goal    near to the West Stand.                  we    came across a

      man    lying on his         back with his arms            raised.        He was a bout         18 years       of

      age,    fair      hair,    a sandy        colour,    slim build,        5*5 tall,          clean shaven,

      He was a white man.                 He was wearing mult/^-coloured t hr ee-quarter                          cream

      shorts -and a paisley               shirt,    possibly w:i/h a yellow b a c k g r o u n d .             He had

      a    pair    of    black and white          sneakers     on/ similar        to Baseball            boots.     I

      knelt       down to help this man and                        beached forward and               touched

      his    forehead.          He said the man was            dead,    so we     left him where            he was.



      we    just we nt f rom o ne          pe rson to an ot he r h e 1pi ng t h e m .             I can* t r e a 11y

      I remember    one w om an we wor ke d on.                 She was about 30 y ea rs/of age
PCi                     -------                                         -----------------
      perhaps 2 7 - 3 0 years, 5* tall - 5*2                   perhaps, a white womarf, rounded

      features.          She    had short        hair,    p os si bl y m ou sy brown        col our.       We worked

      on her for quite            some     time,    trying     to get       her to breath.

                  e v e n tu al ly said that       she was     dead and we        left her.          There was

      a n o t h e r man helping          us.     I d o n ’t know who        he was,



      She was wearing            a blouse,        p o s s ible a yel lo w one,        and    it was short

      sleeved.                                                   a multi       coloured          loose   fitting

                                                       The skirt was       intact     but            pulled   it down

                fully    now and then to          check    her    pulse   in her groin,



                T here were      some    lads    behind the       perimeter    fence who        shouted to us to

                throw her       to them.        They made     comments     like,      "Throw her     in here,    we'll

                fucking    fix her up.'1          There were about         ten to twelve         of them.      J. was

                s h oc k e d by this and stood there.                       grabbed me and         I then went

                w it h him and went and helped some more of the                        injured.



                At one    stage an amb u l an ce         came aro un d the outside          of the    pitch and

                parked    behind the goal.                       wan t ed a m ou th    piece so I went        to the

                ambulance       and got    one    off one     of the ambulancemen.



                On the way back          from the amb ul an ce        I saw a man hitting another m an on

                the    chest,    as he    lay on the floor.            I went across and          pushed the man

                to the side.        I saw the man          lying on the       floor had swa ll ow ed his

                tongue.        I pulled his       tongue out

                           At this       I got up and left the man.                He was a white may,          aged

                a bout mid twenties,            S'6 tall,     very s tocky/fat         build,    black   tyjr 1y ha j r .

                   remember at one stage a P o l i c em a n being              pushed ar ou nd arid s h o u t e d at

A number          of Police     Officers were        pulling at, the fence        that    se parates

the   terrace        from the     pitch.       They were    using    their   bare hands         to   pull

the fence away to             let, the fans onto the         pitch.



I also       remember a number          of    people going a ro u nd and taking           p hotographs

of the       bodies and what was             going on.     I don't know who         they were        but    I

think       that    it was    very    inconsiderate.        They were      climbing      over    us as

we we re all wo rk i ng on the               injured   people.



Whi l s t    going a r ou n d    I noticed that a number            of   people were      drunk.       A

number       of    people were       flaking    out and    it was    down to them having             had

too riiuch to dr i.nk .



p a o p 1e were      car rying    the    i njured and dead on ad ve rt is in g         hoar d i n g s to

t he o t her       end of the     pi t ch.



We made       our way to the          other    end of the    pitch,      where    by now a mb ul an ce s

had arrived.             We helped out on two other           people and then found that                   it

was    by now       1SOO hours.         I rejoined my family and stayed at                the ground

until       about    1930 hours.        My    children were      very upset, by all        this and

            had to have a word wit h them.



We    later made         our way home.



I was w e a r in g a                             and a blue and white            s/iirt and a blue

tie that          day.                       had a                   and gryey slac:        on .

foot     and    in private            cars.        On arrival         at the       garage we were              given

further        detailed         instructions             by both         Insp,     Charles         and Ps Sow n as to

of the     fans        from off           those     coaches.       This      entailed a            larger      group of

officers        remaining            at    the     garage      and the        remainder         being     split       into

two's     and    t h r e e ’s and          patrolling Herries                R o a d S o u t h outside          of    the

garage     together          with other             serials.       I commenced            patrol      with Pc 933

M u g g i e s t o n e and Pc                                               , Fro m     the    very start         of

p atrolling        there was a steady stream                          of suppo r t e r s       coming         down Herries

R o a d under      the      five arches             on foot mainly             but     some    in motor         vehicles.

E v e n at this         early time              people were asking                the w h e r e a b o u t s    of the Five

Arches     Public House as                   if    it was      some      p r e - a r r a n g e d meeting       place and

in general         most       people were            in a carefree             and friendly mood a l t h o u g h

one or two were a n t a g o n i s t i c                towards        us    for    no apprent         reason.         As    time

p r o g r e s s e d and more          coaches        began arriving               some    started dropping                 their

passengers         at     the       j u n ction of Herries               Road and Herries             Road South

instead of         bringing           them down to the                garage,        a p p a r e n t l y to evade          the

passengers         being        scrutanised            by our     serials          and even when the                 coaches

u n l o a d e d where       they should             have    people were            piling      out    of every exit

The    steady flow          c o n t i n u e d up    to just after           2pm w h e n       the flow of

coaches       increased         cons iderabley and at appro;-; imat ley 2..30pm when the

last    coach a r r i v e d      there were          very     large     numbers        of fans       coming down

Herries       Roa d     towards      Hillsborough           football       ground.        When      the    coaches

had a p p e a r e d to have          stopped a r r iving we             reform with           our    serial         at the

garage and         prepared         to go to        Clay w h e e l s   Lane      garage       for our      lunch

w h i c h we were        due    to take at          3pm after          the start       of     the match.        It was

at    this    time 2 , 4 0 p m that         messages        could be heard             coming       over     the

personal       radios w ith          regard to        crowd      problems at           the L e p p i n g s     Lane

turnstiles         and    people         being     crushed against            a gate and 2 or 3 requests

made    for    the      gate    to be opened.           By this        time we were           stood at         the

roundabout         at    the    j u n ction of P e n i s t a n s Roa d and Leppings                   Lane and

numbers       of   people       could still          be seen       coming      down the         road from

Wads ley Bridge and going along Leppi n g s                            Lane    towards        the ground.            Ins p

Charles       directed         that we      should      remain together             as two serials              and

move    further         down L a p pings         Lane and       nearer     to the       turnstiles.            At    this

time    a request was made                 by someone         on a radio         for    the     start      of the

match     to be delayed.             This    we did,        noting      the    very     large amount            of

assist,.      It was      apparent         from the        radio t r a n s m i s s i o n s    that    could be

heard     that     there was         some    form of major             disorder at           the Leppings            Lane

end of the         ground and almost                immediately we were                direc t e d    by Ground

Control       to enter         the Lepp i n g Lane S t a n d           inside     the ground and assist

w i t h an evacuation.              On arrival        at the L e p p i n g s      Lane       turns t i l e s    there

were    still      a number         of    fans     standing      about     but    no signs          of disorder,,

some    people        a p p eared    to be buying           tickets      from a tout and what

appeared       to be a police              cordon was         formed at       the j u n c t i o n of Leppinga

Lane and the            ground frontage.             We went       thro u g h this        cordon with           no
specific       instructions             except     that        received        over    the    radio and entered

the    back    of the          central       section      of     the    stand.       There    were     two     or three

ambulances          parked outside             of the      back        of   the

stand,       all    facing       towards        the mai n stand and P e n i s t o n e Road and                      people

were    stood,          sat    slumped,       bemused and dazed by these a mbulance s.                              There

were    also two or three                bodies       laid on the             floor    and these male              persons

a pppeared,         at a glance          to be dead,            others        were    receiving        treatment

from amb u l a n c e          personnel,        police     officers           and    civilians,.       There       was an

air of       chaos       about    the whole area an d                  civilians       were    v e r bally abusing

me,    blaming me for what                   had gone      on a l t h o u g h       I had    no exact        idea of

what    had    in fact          happened.,       I w a l k e d onto         the     concourse at         the    rear of

the    central          sect i o n and this area was                   crowded with ma i n l y           civilians

and a few          police       and S t . Johns        Ambulance.,            As    before    people were           stood,

slumped,       dazed,          bemused,       some were          laid down          receiving       t r eatment and

artif i c i a l     r e s u s c i t a t i o n and some    bodies,           apparently        dead,     were       just

laid there wit h               people        crying   over       them.      People were            coming    out of the

tunnel       from the          central       sect i o n of the          stand and these             people were        in

an angry mood             v e r bally abusing me and blaming                         the    police     for     causing

all    the    problems.,

1 went       into       the    tunnel        w hich was    full        of     people and as          I did so a

y outh was         being       carried out., I went               with        him onto       the    concourse and

carried out artificial                   r e s u s c i t a t i o n to no avail,.            I then     placed the

body on one             side   of the        concourse         with a s s i s t a n c e     from    some     civilians

and by this             time    there were        a number          of bodies         laid about,

approximately             ten,    all    mixed     up wit h others                 receiving       treatment       from

ail    sorts       of    people.       1 then went         back        into    the    tunnel       w h i c h was   still

full    of    people and a t t e m p t e d         to get         people       to    clear    the     p a ssa geway    taut

they were          abusive       and    resisted any            physical           effort    to get them to

move., Another            body was       carried from             inside       the    ground       by fans and so

I f o 1 lowed thent onto               the    concourse         and gave ar t i f i c ia 1 resusc i tati o n ,
again to no aval 1 and                  I again        laid the        body to one                -side,, I 1 was at

this    time     that a Po l i c e           Inspector        wa l k e d    into       the    concourse and            I

pointed out to him the                      number     of dead bodies              lying about and s u ggested

that    they should            all     be m o v e d    into     one a rea and isome kind of

o r g a n i s a t i o n take     place       but    he a p p eared         to take       no notice,           t urned

round and wa l k e d away,                  8y this      time    one of        the a m b u l a n c e      was    nearly

ready     to    leave      by driving          along      the    back       of the m a i n stand and onto

F e n i s t o n e Roa d    but    I saw       that     the way was           bloc k e d by two            fire    engines

p arked at the            top end of the stand                  behind       the       police       control      box.       As   I

ran towards         the     firs       engines        I was a g a i n       v e r bally a b u s e d       by fans

coming from the             side       of    the    stand,.     I removed some metal                     barriers          and

asked     the engine           drivers        to move      their       vehicles..            This    they     did and        I

then went        down the whole               length at the            back       of    the stand and            informed

the    police     officers           there what was             hap p e n i n g    as they a p p e a r e d        to be

unaware        of how serious               events were         at    the    time.       The first          ambulance

then    left     via this         route.,      I then went            back     to the         concourse w h i c h was

still     in a state           of disorder            although        other       officers          appeared      to nave

a r r i v e d and were         starting        some      form of       crowd       control          and moving         the

dead    bodies      to one        side,.



I a s s i s t e d further         by     removing        bodies w h i c h had been                   placed     in the

tunnel     and also m o v e d other                 people      still       stood       in the       tunnel.      It was

then that        I heard the            sounds        of disturbance,              the       crowd     roaring and

shouting,       and       I forced my way              into     the    enclosure             area to see         the

devastation         the re f o r ths           f i rst    t ime wi1 h        c:r owds        of    po 1 i ce of f i ce rs

a nd   people     on the         pitch,       police     officers           at the       fencing,         bodies       laid

on the     floor,         some    receiving           assistance,           some       not and some           people       just

stood a r o u n d dased.             People were         still        climbing         out        of the enclosure

into    the    upper       stand where             others were        tearing          hoardings          from off         the

balcony and         lowering          them down to be used as mak e s h i f t                          stretchers.

P eople      in the        balc o n y were      swearing           and shouting      at    the Pol ice

officers           and some were        apparently            spitting        although     it may have            been

w i t h the        force     they were       shouting         that     this    happened,       A    large number

of fans were               running    onto     the    pitch from the L s o pings               Lane    end towards

the Kop and            the Motts       Forest        Suppo r t e r s    and as     they seemed         to be the

most     urgent        incident       at that        time and to          prevent    any further            disorder

I s c r a m b l e d onto       the    pitch thro u g h a hole              in the     fencing        halted       the

L iv e r p o o l    fans    together      wit h      other     officers who         had formed a line

across       the      pitch under Supt,              Mesbit        and wal k e d them      back      to the

halfway        line where we           held them,-          a l l owing    only    rescue      personnel;

emergency           cases a n d      relatives        through.         The N o t t i n g h a m Forest       fans were

singing        football        chants     at    this     time and this            further      incensed the

L i verpool         supporters.        The     s i t u a t i o n s t a b a l i s e d on the    pitch,       there was

still      a great amount             of a c t i v i t y on and         in front     of the Leppi ngs

Lane     stand       but    other     personnel         had    by now a t t e n d e d     and we were

instructed            to    remain where        we were.           Pockets     of trouble          broke    out    in

the main           stand and      the N o r t h      stand and a number             of small, groups              of

fans,      m a i n l y L i verpool      fans      had to be          removed,.    After       some    time a

public a n n o u n c e m e n t       was made        over     the    tarinoy that        the game      had been

a b a n d o n e d and      people     began slowly            to    leave the     ground.          Gradually       the

bodies       were      removed       from the        pitch and         the stands        empt i e d without            any

further        problem s .



When     the       ground was        nearly empty           I went      into the L e p p i n g s Lane         stand

together           w ith a younger       officer         who       I had never      seen before and

obtained           names and a d d r e s s e s       from     people      still   stood about,             looking

for    relatives           or w h a tever asking            where      they had been stood and who

they had a t t e n d e d with,. We were                  then       instructed      to    remove      property

lying about            in the     central       stand are a and this was                  done,      leaving

certain        items w hich          had been tied to broken stancions                        to form
           makes hi ft memor ial s . The                 property was           placed     in bin    I iners and

           deposited            in the G y m / C a s u a l t y      bureau    together      wi th numerous        other

           baqs.      We were          informed        that   we     could    be of     no a s s i s t a n c e at that       time

           in the         gym w hich         by this     time       had numerous        bodies    laid on the       floor

           with a large              number      of    people m i l l i l n g about.,       including      club directors

           who      had       come   to see      the full        extent      of the     disaster.     I then went            back

           into      the N o r t h S t a n d where            I stood     by,    together with        quite a number of

           other      officers,.            O nly a handful          of our two       serials     were   present,        I

           later      learned          that    some were         involved       in the gymnasium-          Reports       of

           t rouble           in the City Centre              and    public     house    could be heard over             the

           radio      but we were             not     used as       it was    explained      that    there was

           insu f f i c i e n t       transport        and the traffic           jams    outside were       too great,.

           Some      time       later,       a l t h o u g h we were    still     held     in reserve      we were

           allowed            to go to 01 a y w heels          Lane    for a meal        if we wan t e d    one    but       soon

           after arrival               the re we were          stood down and almost              i mmediately we were

           transported               back    to R o t h e r h a m DHQ met       by C / l n s p Warne,    briefly

           d e b r i e f e d and       then     released,        off   duty at 7 , pm.

              At    1115 hours,        Saturday       150489,     I. com m e n c e d turn stile     duties      on gates

              A--G, leading         to the L e p p i n g s Ln terracing.             I was    engaged     on search

              duties     w i t h POL P C 963 EVANS.




             The      gates were       opened at       1200 hours,        midday,     and a steady        stream of

             L i verpool       fans went          inside.     They were     in good spirits and well

              behaved„



             About      2 prn <1400)        I saw a y o u t h                              arrested by POL PS'1288

             PAYNE      far a t t e m p t i n g    to enter    the gr o u n d    in p o s s e s s i o n of alcohol.

             Th ere     were     a number         of Liverpool     fans s t a nding      both on the appr o a c h e s

              to and     in the       roadway at L e p pings Ln.,           From     co nversations       overhead        it

              appeared       they were        not    in posse s s i o n of m a t c h tickets,        but seemed

determined           to get      inside and w a t c h      the m a t c h



At 2 . 2 6     pm     (1426)!        I a s s i s t e d PC C O N E Y to arrest a male             in p o ssession

of two       cannabis          reefers.        This y o u t h was      later   taken to the           charge

office.            I returned         via the    rear    of the S o u t h S tand and saw numerous

Liverpool           fans    congregating         outside     the      t urnstiles     in Leppings Ln,

ma n y were young              persons who were          s w e aring    co n t i n u a l l y and their         breath

smelled        stron g l y of alcohol.              M a n y of these were          the same        persons          I

had earlier            seen on the a p p r o a c h e s     to the       ground..



The     crowd surged towards                 the t u rnstile       pushing and shoving and despite

continual           pleas from both m o u n t e d and foot               officers        they     refused to

form up        in an orde r l y manner.



I saMj several             young      boys   no more     than f o u r t e e n years        of age     being

crushed agai n s t             the    turn stiles    at B and a c t u a l l y      saw     Insp P URDY         pick

up a lad and            pull     him out.



The Liverpool              fans still        pushed forward and towards a metal                       shutter

gate.        They      m/ere    r epeated ly     told to     refrain       but a g a i n    refused.           I saw

the    gate        bowing and heard a S u p e r i n t e n d e n t        shouting        to O f f i c e r s    to

open the gates.                 I consi d e r e d this     the     right    d e c i s i o n as   persons        were

b e c oming        trapped.



The gates were              opened and there was a surge                   forward of numerous

Li v e r p o o l    fans,      many of w hom were         drunk and aggressive.                  They all           made

their way down the                   central    tunnel    into     the terracing.



A few minutes              later      I heard a m a s s a g e    on    I think a tannoy           system

requesting           all Police         onto the     pitch.        I made my way towards                the     pitch
                                                                                                          PAGE


via    the Po lice         control       room.     I was    about      to go onto         the    pitch when

Insp S Y K E S d i r ected me            to the tunnel        on the L e p p i n g s Ln terracing.



I a r r i v e d about 3 .05         pm    C1505)    to find POL P C 3 2 1 7 W A D S W O R T H giving

first     aid       to a female.          Alongside      this    female        was a male aged about 2

years,      I checked him for a pulse and                     could not         find anything,           he

appeared        dead.



1 then a s s i s t e d PC W A D S W O R T H w ith the female               before       going       into the

rear of the           tunnel    w ith other Officers.                  I removed a male who was

o b v i o u s l y dead from b e n e a t h the tunnel             having        been dragged           there    by

su pp o r t e r s    and as    I did so      I saw a teenage             bay    laid face down

u n d e r n e a t h this man.        The y o u t h was      removed       by other O f f icers           and

taken to ou tside an exit.



I a g a i n went        into the     tunnel      and a s s i s t e d    other O f f icers        to    remove

bodies,       all male,        several      appeared, to be dead.



Despite       con tinued       pleas from myself            and other Of ficers               for     the able

bo died     fans      to make a clearance,             most     refused        and    in fact       jos tled

Po l i c e Of fi ce s      carrying       bodies about,.         Fans were           contin u a l l y swearing

and d i r ec ti ng abuse at myself and other Officers.



On    leaving        the   tunnel    I assisted Officers               to form an e m ergency

ambulance           bay and to sort an e m e r g e n c y         p r i ority     list    of     casualties,

saw a total           of around 40         casu alties      together       w ith eight          or nine       dead

bodies all           laid on the ma i n d r i v e w a y       leading      to the directors'              suite,.

Throughout           the   entire    incident,       at no stage          did    I hear any

ins tru ct io ns       to Officers         given by any S e n i o r Officer.

            On S a t u r d a y    15 April       198?    (150489)       I paraded at W o o d s e a t s Police

            S t a t i o n at 8 .43 am.           At about 9 am together               w ith numerous        other

            officers         I was      conveyed by double          decker      bus    to H i l l s b o r o u g h F o o tball

            ground for           croM>d control         duties at the Semi            Final    football      match

            betw e e n Liv e r p o o l      and N o t t i n g h a m Forest,

            On arrival           at the     ground      I went    to the seating area             in the North Stand

            allocated         to my serial-             I checked that all my             contingent were           in

            place«       My      serial     con s i s t e d of PC 3142 Webb,           PC 2197 Lave r a c k ,       PC 892

            209 7 Cousins,             PC 32 8 F r o g g a t , PC 388 Thompson.

            S h o r t l y a fter       10 am Chief S u p e r i n t e n d e n t D u c k e n f i e 1d gave a mass

            briefing         to all      the a s s em b l e d   officers.       Several       other    officers also

            spoke     on specific aspects               of the     police     operation.          On   completion of
                                                                                                                 P AGE


this     briefing          I col l e c t e d a radio and              packed meals        for my serial,

At    11 am        I took my serial              onto    the S p i o n H o p where        I was     joined        by

several          other    serials a long with my                  immediate      supervisor.           Inspector

Booth,       S u p e r i n t e n d e n t G r e e n w o o d and    Inspector Calvert*              Specific

problems           relat i ng to      ’o u r ’ end of the ground we re discussed.

Particular           emphasis was           placed on the fact               that a small         number         of

Li v e r p o o l    fans w o u l d be at          the S p i o n Ko p end close            to the N o t t i n g h a m

Fo r e s t S u p p o r t e r s .

A fter     a further         short        briefing       from     Inspector      Booth      I took my serial

together w ith that                 of PS    767    J e s s o p out    to the       ground onto Pen i s t o n e

Road.        My brief was            to    cover    turns t i l e s 55 to 64,           to m a i n t a i n order

and    to search for alcohol,                     offensive and          p o t e n t i a l l y dangerous

weapons*            We    took     up p o s ition a about             11.20 am and        I a l l o c a t e d an

officer          to each turnstile,                A pair        of officers        w o r k e d on two

turnstiles           side    by side.The           t urnstiles         did not      open straight away*

It was       after M i d d a y       before       they were opened.              Between       the opening             of

the    t u r n s t i l e s and about 2 *30              pm the N o t t i n g h a m Forest       s u pporters

fi l t e r e d     into   the    gr o u n d wi thout          large   queues     being     formed.        T here was

no    public        disorder*         It was       obvious        however     that many fans had been

dr i nking and many were                   in a bo i st rous m o o d ,         Numerous        f ans   tried to

enter      the      ground w i t h        cans of alcohol,            all   were     c o n f i s c a t e d and

d i s p o s e d of.       Several         soft   drink        cans and      large    banners      were also

confiscated.              One    of my officers               a r r e s t e d one man who w as o b viously

too drunk           to be a l l o w e d     in the ground.             Several       ticket     touts were

m ov e d on and           I verbally warned              one     not to sell        tickets a l l o c a t e d         to

the N o t t i n g h a m Forest            end to a Liverpool             Supporter,

Fro m 2.3 0         pm onwards        the    crowd started to build up outside                         the

g r o u n d = P e n i s t o n e Road.       I got       the    i m pression that        some    supporters             were

milling          aro u n d with o u t      tickets,       hoping      either     to buy one or

gain e ntry to the g r o u n d               by some way,
                                                                                                                 PAGE


At a p p r o x i m a t e l y 2 .45     pm I heard several               message       in quick        succession

over my personal              radio.

The first mess a g e was               to the effect            that a gate          had been        closed          in the

L e p p i n g s Lane end of the ground.                       I took    this       to be the metal

gates        at the    entrance        to the outside            enc l o s u r e    betw e e n the        ground and

the    roadside        pavement.          I then heard someone                 state       that     fans    were

trying        to break       down a gate.           I w a s n ’t sure w h i c h gate was                  being

related to.            The    next m e s s a g e was a request                for the m a t c h to          be

d e l a y e d for fift e e n minu t e s           because       of the       large    number        of fans          still

o utside       in L e p p i n g s Lane.          I did not hear a reply to that                       request.lt

was    obvi o u s     from the       radio traffic             that    serious       problems        had ar i s e n at

the L e p p i n g s    Lane     end of the ground.                I could not

however make           out e v e r y t h i n g    that    came over          the    radio     because       of the

i n creased      noise       in P e n i n s t o n e R o a d    from traffic and fans.The                    next

request        I heard was         for    the gate at the L e p p i n g s Lane                  end to

be opened,           because     of the serious               crushing at          turnstiles        at    that       end.

That     request was          gran t e d after a few minutes.

On P e n i s t o n e R o a d several           youths were        hanging about M;ho obv i o u s l y

didn't        have    tickets and         I was a n t i c i p a t i n g      some    kind of        last minute

a tte m p t    to get     into the ground.

At about 3.05            pm I heard a message                  come over my          radio,       I believe           from

Superintendent            G r e e n w o o d to the effect             that    he had a serious

p rob l e m at       the L e p p i n g Lane       end of the ground.                 He    requested the

assistance           of other      officers.

I a p p r a i s e d officers         of my serial             and that        of the PS J e s s o p ’s of the

situation.            I deci d e d to       close all         the turnstiles              at the P e n i s t o n e

R o a d end and take my men to the L e p p i n g s Lane                            end.      Some    of the

gate men were            reluctant        to     close   but did so after                 I insisted.            I

wa n t e d    the turnstile          closed so that             no one       could    cause       trouble        after       I

left M;ith my serial.
                                                                                                       page:          a



I then took my serial                 into the S p i o n K.op down to the front an d through

a metal       gate    onto the        pitch.      There was      plenty of        room at       the   front of

the S p i o n Hop and our access                to the       pitch was     easily gained,

I looked across             the L e p p i n g s Lane    end and saw an           increasing       number         of

P o l i c e Officers        and fans        on the    playing a r e a     to the     rear and to the

side    of the goal.            The    players and       referee     had    left the       pitch.

Together       with other        officers       I w a l k e d across      the    pitch to the Leppings

Lane    end.        On arrival        I saw that       the fans     in the       centre    pen were         in

serious       trouble w ith man y            being    crushed-      I first saw the ones at                  the

front.        They were       pressed        up agai n s t    the wire    fencing.          Some had

their    eyes       shut,    some were        going    blue,    some were        trying    to protect

others,       all were       in a very d i s t r e s s e d     state.      I m m e d iately behind          the

ones at       the    front,     who were m a i n l y still         on their feet           there a pp e a r e d

to be a heap of bodies                 on    top of each other.

I saw several          police      officers a n d a few civilians                 on the fencing

trying       to assist       people     over    the top onto       the     pitch.

I saw fans at          the    rear of the terracing              being     lifted on to the stand

above.        The    fans at the        rear however          in the mai n were          just    standing

there gr o u n d an d ma k i n g        no effort       to move    out     of the e n closure          to

release       the    pressure.

T o g e t h e r w i t h other    officers       from my serial           I went    to the       fencing      to

give what       I assistance           I could,        I stood on the           b o u ndary wall      up

agai n s t    the    fencing     I shouted to the fans at                 the    rear    to move      back to

relieve       te pressure at          the front.         They d i d n ’t take any          notice.          In

company w i t h other           o f f icers    I a s s i s t e d one y o u t h over      the    fence.       He

was    shaky an d      in a state of shock.                He did not appear             to be s e r iously

hurt    he had been          lucky to be on top of the               pile of fallen             people.

I then       saw that a metal          gate     to the       rear of the goal           netting was

open.        I saw officers           pulling     people      through the gate           of what a p p eared

to be heaped          pile of bodies.            It was      obvious     that man y of the
                                                                                                               page:



poeple       they    pulled out were               either        dead or     in a very serious               condition

I went       to the      rear     of a small             line of Po l i c e Q f f i c r e s     at this gate and

took hold of a y o u t h of about 20 years                            dressed      in bl u e / g r e y t shirt

and blue       jeans who was               being    passed out.            W i t h the a s s i s t a n c e    of fans

I carried the man onto the                       playing area.             He was       unconcious       but

appeared       to be        breathing        very shallowy.              I placed him           in the       recovery

po s i t i o n and a t t r a c t e d the a t t e n t i o n of a St Johns A m b u l a n c e man to

see to him.            The St Johns man and                   two or     three     fans     began a t t e m p t i n g

to    revive the youth.

I deci d e d at this            point       that    things were          getting a bit            chaotic.

Pe o p l e were m i l l i n g around.               Some were         crying and         in a d i s t r e s s e d

state.        Most     police       o f f icers were          either     emplo y e d on        recovering       people

from the       crowd or trying               to a d m i n i s t e r   first aid to people               lying on

the    pitch.        Some     s u p p o r t e r s were       becoming      very aggressive,             blaming         the

police       for what        had happened.                This    o b v i o u s l y d i d n ’t help the       rescue

operation,          s e r i o u s l y ha m p e r i n g    help,     police and fans            trying    to

p os i t i v e l y help.

There were          so many       people       on the        pitch by this         time     it was      becoming

very    con g e s t e d near        to the goal area,                 I d e c i d e d that      there were

eno u g h    people at        the     fence w h i c h by now had ben cut                    in some way.            I

remember       being at         the    fence       trying        to help w hen a long metal                  barrier

pole was       thrown by the               fans at the           police m a n n i n g    the    fence.

I just       c o u l d n ’t believe        the m e n t a l i t y of those          that had thrown it,

I m o v e d away from the              fence and began to                circulate a r o u n d the            people

lying       on the     pitch,         I checked to make               sure e v e ryone who          could be

helped was          receiving attention.                     I i n structed one or two fans                   on how

to    r e s u s citate who were            not doing          it properly,

1' saw several           bodies       of    people who were             o b v i o u s l y dead.     Some      had had

there       faces    covered w i t h         coats.

As    time went        on    I began to notice                that    numerous      supp o r t e r s were
                                                                                                          P AGE


wandering         around        in a very d i s t r e s s e d    condition,         I attempted          to

console       some       of them.         Some    r e sponded but others          became        very

a g g r e s s i v e about       the Police-         Some were       drunk and m a n y others             had

o b v i o u s l y had     consumed a large amount                of alcohol,,        A number          of fans

however a c t e d         in a positive a n d           respon s i b l e way.

Several       because        of the       shortage      of s t r e t c h e r s made mak e s h i f t

stret c h e r s      out of the advert             boards a r o u n d    the ground.

As the      removal         of the     dead and       injured g a t h e r e d m o m e n t u m    I assisted

one grup of fans                to take an uncon c i o u s        man to the Hop end of the

ground.         As      I got    to the Kop and others              came    to help,      so hurried

to return         to the L e p p i n g s     Lane     end.      A large g roup of Li v e r p o o l            fans

then made         there way towards               the Kop,.      They were      a p p a r e n t l y upset

by chanting             from the N o t t i n g h a m Forest       Supporters.

I became        involved wit h officers                 from my serial          in turning        back    this

crowd to prevent                disorder.        As we f o l l o w e d the L i v erpool          supporters

back     to the L e p p i n g s Lane End,             1' was    i n s truted by     Inspector Wall a c e             to

form a      cordon across            the    centre of the         pitch.

1' remained          in the      cordon wit h the m a j o r i t y        of my serial           for    some

con s i d e r a b l e    time.      I o b s e r v e d the    rescue     operation      being      carried out

by other Police              officers       and the acti o n s        of the fans.         Many were

helpful       man y were         o b v i o u s l y shocked and upset and some were a

disgrace,         h a m pering      the    rescue     ope r a t i o n and abus i n g    the      police

officers,         press and t e l e v i s i o n       people.As       the   recovery of the dead and

i njured became more                o r g a n i s e d and

systematic,             together w ith the officers               from my serial          I was        released

from the        cordon for duties                outside     the ground.        I went     to

P e n i s t o n e R oad and       s u p e r v i s e d the   loading     of s upporters          onto buses.

Along     wit h      Inspector B o o t h         I did a public         order   patrol     along Pen i s t o n e

Road.I      eventually           retur n e d to the ground            for a debri e f i n g       in the

N o r t h Stand.          I made a short           report      of my serials        involvement and was

We did       not    stop a ny wh e re            on the way to the game except                  on the m o t o rw a y

w here we      stop pe d the van for               two of the        1 ads to       go to the

toilet       but    the     police         came an d     reported t hem for            it-*

On the way we were                     dela ye d for      about      twenty minu te s         by road works       on

t h e 1162 motor way ,

W h e n we    got    to S h e f f ie l d we had a few               cans of beer         and    went to       a pub

for a couple          of pints.                Mo-one       in our    party got drunk, I also                    saw

other    fans d ri nking                but    it was a really nice            day and everyone was                just

having a couple                  of    cans,       Isaw no d ru nk enness at all.               We a rr iv ed      in

S h e f f i e l d at about             12.40      pm having    left R u nc o r n at about

10,30 am.

Wh en we      got    to S h e f f ie l d we        parked      in a road off Pe ni st on e Road about,

twenty minutes              walk        from the ground.            This    was my third visit              to

H i l l s b o r o u g h and we had             parked    in the     same    place      last year.

Af t er ar r i v i ng a nd             parking    tha    van we     sat    in the sun f o r a. bi t and

then went          to a pub on the               corner     of the     road where we           parked for about

one    hour.        We then made               our way    to the ground,            I received         nor saw any

police       d i r e c ti o n or escort           to the      ground,       1 saw      police       officers      on

the way       to the ground               but    they did not give direc ti on s                but as      I said

we    k ne w where        <
                          f ie    were    go i ng ..

I saw no fighting,                     disorder    or drunk en es s        betw ee n    parking       the   van and

the ground.

We had split up from the others at the                               pub because         a ma n on the door

was    only    letting            two    people    in at a time even though                   it was    not

crowded.           I stayed w i t h _________________                 W h en we     left      the   pub we got          to

the    ground at about 2 , 3 0                  pm - 2.4 0    pm.    When we got         to the turnstiles

there was a lot of                     people m i ll in g    about    in L ap pi n gs Lane as           I. w ould

expect       at a F,A            cup semi       final.      However d i r ec t ly outside            the

turnstiles          it was            very quiet.        There were        only about         half a dozen

people       in front            of me w he n     I. joined the queue at the                  particular

The?re were P o l i c e m e n           on the       turnstiles       t h e ms e lv e s    but they were       not

di r ec t in g anyone or               sea rc hi ng    people.        I saw no stewards            at all.       W hen

I e n t e r e d t-here were             no    pro fa3.e m s h e r e w hat soever.

I had no          problem finding              the    turnstile as         I have         ente re d here on

three         occ as io ns    including         the    19SS semi       final.

W he n    I e n te r ed via the              t urnstile    1 s u r r e nd e re d my ticket         to the

t ur n st i le     operator.            I saw no gates open other                    than the     t urnstiles        and

no u n a u t h o r i s e d   entry          to the ground.

Once      inside        the ground           I did    not see any signs              d irecting    fans where         to

go,      however,        I was     not       looking    for any because              I wanted     to go through

the      centre     tunnel        as    I    had done     in 1988.       As you       enter    the tur ns ti le s

the      tunnel      is a he ad of you and you can see the                           pitch through       it.

W he n    I entered          through the          centre      tunnel     I had free          passage along       it.

I saw no          police or stewards                 contro ll in g    the     tunnel*

I saw no disorder                 nor a ny thing         I consider        to be unusual          between

en tering         the   turnstile and getting                  into    the terraces and            into Pe n 3.

I saw no one             drinking           alcohol    w it h in the     ground.

I got         into P en 3 and           took    up my     initial      p os ition which          I have marked.

* 1A*     on a grid showing my m ov e me n ts w i t h in                     pens 3 & 4.          This was about

S . 45    pm.      P en 3    at    this       time was     very crow de d so together with

                we moved       over         to the    dividing    fence        betw ee n Pen 3 and 4,            We

climbed over            this      into Pen 4 w h ic h v>as full                but    not as    crowded as Pe n

3.       We    then moved         to the front          of Pen 4,        across       the front of the          pen

to the dividing              fence          betw ee n Pens     4 and 5.         We then moved back up the

terrace         and then       climbed up and sat               on top of the dividing                 fence at a

point         I have m ar k ed         M B ’ on the grid.             W he n the      crushing     later took

was      t r a p p ed by the       people       pushed against           the    fence a nd      it took a while

I did        not     see and was        not near        the    crush barrier         that    broke w it hi n          pen

3.,

Wh en    1 first           got to the       position       I have marked* 1A * it was over                     full

but     no    crushing was           taking      place*

I got        to the        position m ar k ed        M B ’ at about 2.50            pm.                 ,^as w i t h me

all     the     time and sat           on the      fence      just    behind me*

I saw no fighting                or disorder          at all     at the time         of taking          up my m a t c h

viewing         point*        H o we ve r whe n we sat on the fence                  MB'     I noticed that

the a dj ac e nt           pen proper,       Pen 6 was         vir tu al ly    empty.       At any other

g ro un d     if we had sat on a fence as we did the                            fans w ould have             told us

to get        down        because we w ou ld        obscure      the    view,    p a rt ic ul ar ly                 as

he     is about 6*2           tall*      How e ve r     because Pe n 6 was           so empty we did not

block        anyones        view.

At about- 2.53              prn Pen 4 s ud de n ly       changed from being               full    to    crowded and

crushing            star te d to take        place*        It seemed to happen all                 of sudden

w h e n the         teams    came    onto    the    pitch.       My    right    leg was      hanging         down

inside P en 4 and               people were         s ud denly s qu as he d against              the divid in g

fence        and my        leg was     pinned against           the fence.

             a nd       I then thought       there w ould be           problems      so d e ci de d to move

over     into Pen 6 w h ic h was                still    empty.                 jumped down            into P en 5

an d    I t ried to follow*                 I c o u l d n ’t though because my              leg was       pinned b]

the     crowd against            the    fence.        I started        to   panic as       I could see          the

d if f ic u lt i es        people were       getting       in and that         they were         being    crushed,

but     I c o u l d n ’t get away.              E v en t u a l l y after    about    two minutes          of

pulling         I m a na g ed    to free my         right      leg and then dropped down                  into      pen

5,      As    I dropped         down    into Pen 5 I landed a w k w a r dl y and sprained

my     left ankle*

I did        not see what           I w ou ld    call    a surge w i th i n the           crowd.       The
                                                                                                            PAGE         5


pressure        just       built     up w i t h in a couple          of minutes*




Once                 and    I had got          into Pen 5 we then            climbed back         upon the Pen

5 side        of the dividing              fence and helped about               twenty     people     out    of Pen

4 between           us.     The     people w it h in Pen 4 were              being      squashed a g ai ns t       the

fence an d were             very distressed.                They    looked    in trouble         but at     this

stage     I did not think                 anyone was being           killed.,

At     this    time       the gate at         the    front    of Pen 5 was        locked and Pen 5

itself        very quic kl y filled               up wit h    people     either      climbing      or being

pulled out           of Pen 4.

We were        in Pen 5 for about                 five minutes        a lt og et he r    until    the gate at

the     front       was    opened.          I do not know by whom.               Whe n the gate was

o pe n ed we        left the Pen as even this one was                        becoming      very    crowded,.

W he n we      came out          of the      pen a policeman d ir ec t ed us to sit on the

running        track       behind        the a dv e rt i si n g    hoarding     to the     left    of the     goal,

towards        the N or th stand.

H ow ev er     w it hi n a matter            of seconds       the number        of fans      coming    out    of

the     pens    onto       the    pitch was         such that we were           forced onto the           pitch

within        the    goal       area,.

The m a t ch was           then a b a n d o ne d and the           players    left the       pitch.

At about 3 . 1 5           pm              and    I had been forced           into the      centre of the

goal     area.        In front           of us towards        the goal       on the      edge of the

e i gh t ee n yar d        box was a man            laid out on the          pitch with a black             leather

jacket        over    his       face,      I could      see a lot of other              bodies    laid out     on

the     pitch ma in ly           in front        of Pen 3.

A p o li ce m an then            called               and    1 to help him with this man,

an d    I went       over       to him wit h the         policeman and          I lifted up the           coat and

looked        at the mans          face.

The man was             stocky,       about      3 5 — 40 years     of age,       he had dark hair,             clean

shaven.           He was we 11 bui 11 but                not f at




The mans          face was       purple and he            looked d e a d ,

Together         w i t h _______ and the            policeman       I got       this man onto a b i l l b o a r d

as we were          joined by some more                  lads about my age*                There were about

five     or six of u s ' a l t o g t h e r          .   We all      then       carried      this man over         to

the    side       of the N o r t h S t a n d onto          the     roadway*           The ambu l a n c e s   came

through.           We    left the man on the               billboard.            There were           not many other

bodies       there at          the    time,      but    there was a continual                  flow behind us*

To g e t h e r   wit h the P o l i c e m a n and                    : then       ran back to the area of

the    pitch       in front          of    the L e p p i n g s Lane Terrace*              When we got        back       to

the same          area as before             there was a young             lad a l r e a d y     placed onto        a

billboard*          He was about             fift e e n years       of age,       very short          fair hair,

his face was             covered and           I had a quick            glance at        it,    but    realised     he

was a l r e a d y dead*              I cannot       remember what          he was wearing.

The P o l i c e m a n     had gone          to someone       else       by this       time,, then               and

about       eight       other    people       and      I carried        this    lad over        to the same area.

We a g a i n      left him       in this area and                returned       to the Leppings Lane              end.

W h e n we got          back    on the third o c c asion we met                   one of our friends              who

      had    lost at the             pub, _____________            He    then    came with us to the area

betw e e n the halfway                line and e i g h t e e n yard            box.

There       we    found a m a n who a p p e a r e d          to be still          alive        but badly

injured.           There were             people trying          to help the man but              not   very

s u c c essfully.                         s a member       of the T e r r i t o r i a l        Army and trained

in first         aid*      I used         to be     in the T.A an d know the                   basics   of first

aid.                     hen took         over    giving m o u t h to m o u t h         res u c i t a t i o n to the

ma n and         I took his          pulse,      w h i c h was   very feint*

                    is also          in the T.A and he was                on the far side of the man
                                                                                                    P AG E


from me*           We    both k n e e l e d down and            was a 1s o taki ng his       p u 1s e *

We kept          everyone     else    back    from the man and                   continued t o gi v e

ntout h to m o u t h *




                    the man a p p e a r e d to be       coming       round,    though his    pulse        did

not    get -any stronger*

A fter                                      , his    pulse    became    e x t r e m e l y weak and then

s t o p p e d altogether*                    ]c o ntinued to give m o u t h to mouth

r e s u c i t a t i o n for about      two minutes with             no response whats o e v e r     and      it

was    obvious          he had died*

We    then got the man onto a bill                    board and were          helped by other        people

to    carry       the man to the same              corner as the other          two   people*      We   then

left     the man         in this area and started to                 return to the far end

of the       pitch*

I w ould describe             this man as about 4 0 - 5 0 years               of age,    fat with a

beer     belly,         a full    head of dark        hair,    clean shaven*          I cannot     remember

what     he was weari n g .

I cannot          remember w h i c h       paper    it was,    but    in one    of the    papers

there were          photographs        of    the    deceased*        I believe    I saw a

p h o t o g r a p h of this man whose              surname    I believe       to have been KELLY,

Whe n we         returned on this           third o c c asion             1       and I met

             on the       pitch who said that                                  was missing

We    then spent a b o u t         fifteen minutes           looking    for _______ but     could.

not find him.              We had all        had tickets       for    the L e p pings Lane      end.

We then went             to the    corner where we had taken the dead                    people to

see    if                 had been taken there.               However whe n we got there            there

was a       line of about          fiftee n    policemen stopping anyone                from going

t h ro u g h .

We e x p l a i n e d     that we     had    lost!             but    they w o u ldn't?

Vie spoke       to a p o l i c e w o m a n who was         very supp o r t i v e a n d           nice and

explained        to us that        they      c o u l d n ’t let us thro u g h because                   there were

so m any       people who w a n t e d        to get       in to    look       for    people*       By this          time

________ ho     is very       close    to his brother was                very

distressed,         but   then the        p o licemen       in the       line were          very off          hand and

told     us to go away,          they just d i d n ’t care               or    certainly gave that

 impression*

We then went           back    onto    the    pitch and e v e n t u a l l y found                             sat    on

the    pitch after about              five minutes*

After     we found                    we met a few          people       from       the    local    area and

spoke     to them on the           pitch*       By this          time    it was       chaos       on the       pitch

and there were            people      running       everywhere.

T here    then     came an a n n o u n c e m e n t    over       the    loud speaker             that    the game

had been a b a n d o n e d and we            left    via the       right       hand       corner    of the

Leppings        Lane Terrace as you              look towards            it from          the    pitch*        We    then

 retur n e d to the        van.

The m a i n     reasons       for the     deaths and            injuries were             the    lack of       control

by the       police     outside       the ground*           At    the time          I ente r e d the ground

there     were    no    problems,       but the       police       I saw were             not    in enough

numbers        to control       if there       had been a problem which there was                               later..

Once w i t h i n the ground there were                     no stewards          or    police       directing

people       to the empty        spaces      wi t h i n    the terraces,             as    in Pen       6,   Pens 3

and 4 should have              been    closed off.

Once     inside     the stands         the way the          pens were made                p r e vented       people

from moving         to the      sides     to ease         the    crush.        I saw nothing             at all

thro u g h     the whole      day that        I consider          to be a criminal                offence*

Once     the    game    had been stop p e d there were at                      least       one hundred          police

in a cordon across              the    pitch to stop             people       fighting,          to prevent         the

rival     fans meeting,            This w ould        not have          happened          once    people       realised

what     had happened*
                                                                                                                         PAGE

           These      police officers              sho uld have         been helping           the     fans.    There    were a

           lot of Police             officers        getting         stuck    in and helping,            but

           far      too man y did nothing at all.

           I did not         see any         s t e wards       helping       on the pitch at all.

           I cannot        say what          time     it was we        left the ground            but   it     was after

           about 4.1 5         pm.

           1 think        fol l o w i n g H i l l s b o r o u g h    that all       football      grounds       should be all

           seated,        this     is speaking as              someone who          has always         stood on the

           terraces        at football            matc h e s    before.

           1 also        believe      that     perimeter            fences    are    nec e s s a r y   because    of the

           problems        caused by a m i n o r i t y              of football       fans.

           On the        15th of April            3.989 I was wearing a dark                   blue T-shirt,         a pair

           jeans      and black         training        shoes.         The T-shirt          had    'JOE BLOGGS*         written

           d i a g o n a l l y across        it    in white lettering.

                      was M/earing           a brand new pair            of jeans w h i c h got          ripped      during

           the day and a T-shirt,                    I think         it was white.           He wa also wear ing

           t r a ining     shoes.

             Saturday         15th April        1989    <150489)       I went to H i l l s b o r o u g h football

             ground.          I t r a v e l l e d on an o r g a n i s e d    coach trip w ith Home James Travel,

             H i g h St,      Wavertree,        trave l l i n g    on coach number         six.     This    being

e n t e r e d the    coach and made a search.                    I was       on the       upper    deck       of the

coach,     the fans         downstairs       were    singing          football          songs and we

u p s t a i r s were      just   laughing at them downstairs.                           Nothing    occurred

u,ihich was      out      of the o r d i n a r y or alarming.                We a r r i v e d    in the

vicinity       of the       ground at approx 2.15                pm    (1415).           We a p p r o a c h e d from

the L e p p i n g s Ln end.          In the v i c i n i t y of the entrance                     I saw

approximately             six N o t t i n g h a m Forest    fans w a l k i n g          along L e p pings Ln -

one    of them had the wor d F O R E S T             shaved       into       the    back of his hair..

The    coach was          parked a p p r o x i m a t e l y a mile       from the          ground.        We

a l i g h t e d on a m a i n     road a n d not a coach p a r k „                  We    then made       our way

back    to the       ground,      unescorted        by the       police.           I saw on the way             back

various       fans     standing      outside      d i fferent         pubs w h i c h were all            shut

drink i n g    cans       of beer.        I d i d n ’t- see anyone           drunk       or behaving          badly.

I did see a group of appro x 4 Po l i c e Officers                              standing         looking at

fans.      The      officers were          telling      people        that    had       cans that       they

c o u l d n ’t be took a n y further.               Howe v e r    I did see fans                beyond with

cans.      I a r r i v e d at     the     c o u rtyard to the entrance                   of L e p p i n g s Ln at

approx 2 , 3 0       pm    (1430).       There was       no orde r l y q u e ueing              taking    place,

fans were        just      g a t hered    into the      courtyard.            There was          crushing       taking

place,        I saw a boy of app rox 9 yrs                  be taken awa y               because     of being

crushed.         Fans      from the front         shouted        'push b a c k ’ so we all               pushed

back.     A    lot of the fans were               saying        to the Police             sort    it out,       I

only seen a few officers,                   two m o u n t e d    officers and one standing                      on a

high wall        by the West         stand.       There was           general       confusion,          the

of f icers     didn't appear             to know what       to do.           I just       f o l lowed the       crowd

and fina l l y       into a turnstile at a p p r o x i m a t e l y 2 . 4 0                pm    (1420).        I had

trouble       getting       to the t u r nstile         because        of    pushing from behind.                   My

leather       jacket       had been forced up towards my face.                             I realised that               I

had    lost my wallet,            my ticket       for    the     coach and the game.                    The wallet

without          p r esenting a ticket.                    This was       because       of the volume       of the

crush behind.,             On the other               side -        inside    the   ground there was a

P o l i c e m a n who a l l o w e d me           into      the back of the ground.                  I told him my

ticket was m i s s i n g - he said,                        "In other words          you haven't          got one,"

and said          I may as well             go,       I said that          it w o u l d be     impossible      to

w ork my wa y           back    thro u g h the volume                of fans.       He was       then taking me

parts      of a ticket,           he ripped the s e c t i o n to be                     retained off and gave

me the other             half.        A     6    standing       ticket       serial      number 4913LL3

now got a ticket,                so       I was      then a l l o w e d into the ground            by the

P o l i c e Officer.            I wouldn't            recognise        the officer          of the steward

again.           I d i d n ’t see any fans                 scalling       over    the    perimeter       walls.      I

just     follo w e d      the    crowd          into the       ground.        There was        no apparent

signs,      however        I had          visi t e d the gr o u n d last            year     so I had a good

idea where             to go.     I       ente r e d a tunnel             leading       to the terraces

di r e c t l y    behind       the goal          posts.        As    far as      I was aware        this was       the

only     route        to take.            There were          no Police O f f i c e r s      or Stewa r d s    inside

the gr o u n d on the terraces.                         The    crowd M;as g e n e r a l l y good humoured,

singing,          etc - I didn't                see anyone          drinking.       I ente r e d the terracing

at a point             I estimate          to be on the a t t a c h e d           grid reference L2.               The

time was a p p r o x i m a t e l y 2.45               pm    (1445).        Ideally       I wa n t e d   to be at the

back or          just    in front          of a barrier,            but there was           in the      region of two

people      behind me.            The       crowd was          in high spirits wit h fans jumping                        up

and down.             I expected           they w ould settle              doM^n.       In the    next    ten minutes

had    t r avelled      in the flo*A> of the                  crowd towards           a point     I estimate         to

be M7 on the a t t a c h e d grid.                  There was             only one     person     in front of me

prior     to the      last       barrier       before         the    perimeter        fence.      It was     noM.1

approx 2 minu t e s             to kick off.             The       players were warm i n g         up.     _______

          was a l r e a d y u n d e r n e a t h the           barrier a n d he told me             to get      under

it.     I tried but someone                  beat me          to    it.     So    I was   right    next to the

barrier w i t h       it    resting        into the base of my stomach.                         Then u n t o t a l l y

unexpected         there was an            i ncredable             surge    from behind.          I never      have

e x p e r i e n c e d a force       in a crowd like                 it.     I was able       to raise my s e l f

a p p r o x i m a t e l y six    inches      off     the ground.             I remained        in this

su s p e n d e d state      for a p p r o x i m a t e l y 20 minutes.                Fans M^ere shouting             for

help and       crying       in pain.           There was a white                  15 years approx         old boy

close     to me on my            left,     he was        saying       in a pitiful         voice,     ’Help m e , ’

’help m e ,' his head was                  hanging        in front of him.                I pulled his head

back    but as       I let       it go his head just                  fell       forwards*      His   eyes were

shut all       this time.             T her e was        no    response whatsoever,               he just-

flop p e d back       forward,           he had     reddish          c o l oured hair cut       in a flat         top

hair    style.        In front           of the     perimeter             fence   there M;as a line of

Polic e m e n ,      They M^ere a p p a r e n t l y           just    standing        there.      I couldn't         see

any gate       to escape          in my section.                   I heard fans say get their                bodies

out,    h e ’s dead.            I helped u.'ith one                person,        I c o u l d n ’t believe     that

people were          dead.        I only helped by s t r e t c h i n g my arms as best for

what    I could do.              I don't       know what            the bodies were          like,       I d i d n ’t

see any      blood or anything.                    A man by me told me to hold on for a bit

longer      because        fans were         now entering             the    pitch.       He finally helped

me under       the    barrier.           1 then m a n a g e d to help a young                   boy on my       right

M^ho I know escaped               not    too     badly hurt.               I made my M>ay across           to a

point     I estimate            to be grid         reference R8.                 I helped for a while,

helping      fans     over       the a d j o i n i n g   fence       into    pen 5,       A police officer

put his knee          thro u g h the fence,              he    indicated          to me to     climb over         the

fence      by    placing my foot             on his      knee    to scale        the fence.          It took a

while      to find my s t r e n g t h to manage,                 eventually         I escaped        into     pen

5,    I believe          it was     two      police      officers who           took me onto the track

by the N o r t h stand.              I     was    left sitting         for a while.             I had lost all

feelings         in my    legs and          I was s u ffering          pain     in my hips.           A woman

game was         badly    organised,            the    nature of the         co u r t y a r d d o e s n ’t a l l o w

proper      queueing       to take          place,      there was       inadequate Police O f f i c e r s

outside         to supervise        queueing.            The FA should have o r g a n i s e d the

match      better,       L e p p i n g s Ln M;as not suitable              for Liverpoool            fans.       To

clarify         the   statement          I would       like to make        clear     the following           points

1) The      reference        to    'various*           fans drinking         outside       pubs,     I only saw

30 or 40 fans            drinking         from tins,

2)   The    reference       to     'crushing'           on   page    (2)   on    line 33 - this           crush        I

didn't      consider       to be         life    threatening.

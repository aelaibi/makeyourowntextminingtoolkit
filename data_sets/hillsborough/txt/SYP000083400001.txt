heavy      traffic         on this      road and the             pavements      were    still        crowded with

fans     and other          pedestrians.

On    reaching           the ground      I. saw a body of              p o I i c e off 1 c e r s f o rrni n g a 1 i n

these      I believe         there were            two or three m o u n t e d officers.                    They all
                                                                                    --
had their           backs    to the      ground and were               facing    a large          crowd of fans,

some     were       trying     to    pass     to    reach the       ground whilst               others     further

attended           to by either        friends           or   police    officers.

I looked           further    towards        the     tunnel      leading       into the stand,              and    it

appeared           to be    in .chaos.         I could hear            shouts     of   'get, in there,             that

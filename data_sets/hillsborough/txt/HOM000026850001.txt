       Introduction

1.1   This document has been compiled f o r the purpose of providing
       general advice t o o f f i c e r s given the r e s p o n s i b i l i t y of arranging
       operational p o lic e planning for sporting occasions.                      The level
       and degree of advance planning must n e c e s s a r i l y depend to a large
       ex tent on the p a r t i c u l a r f i x t u r e and the amount of tro u b le t h a t
       may reasonably be expected as a r e s u l t of i n t e l l i g e n c e gathered
       by the p o l i c e .

       Intelligence

1.2   I n t e l l i g e n c e concerning the lik elih o o d of crowd disturbance or
       hooliganism occurring will n e c e s sa r ily be obtained from a v a r ie ty
       of sources and should be i n t e r p r e t e d through experience and
       common sense.                   I t i s recognised t h a t th e degree of advance
       planning f o r a p a r t i c u l a r game depends upon both the i n t e r e s t in
       the f i x t u r e and the amount of t r o u b le a n t i c i p a t e d , based upon
       i n t e l l i g e n c e a v a i l a b l e to the p o l i c e . Aside from the importance
       of the f i x t u r e in terms of league p o sitio n or 'cup' p rospects,
       fo o tb all matches are often used by hooligans t o c e le b r a te
       previous encounters with p a r t i c u l a r s e t s of fans.                     I t is
       t h e r e f o r e p a r t i c u l a r l y important to be aware of the h i s t o r y of
       that fix tu re.

1.3   The prime source of fo o tb all i n t e l l i g e n c e i s the Police National
      I n t e l l i g e n c e System which i s based on the network of P olice
      Liaison O f fic e r s (see paragraphs 2.1 to 2.11 e t .                   seq.).
      Summaries completed by po lice o f f i c e r s of th e home club Force are
      forwarded to the v i s i t i n g c l u b 's l i a i s o n o f f i c e r , making
      av a ila b le i n t e l l i g e n c e about fans behaviour at both home and away
       f i x t u r e s . This information will be c o l l a t e d and made a v a i l a b l e
      f o r fu tu re matches involving t h a t club.

1.4   The summary includes d e t a i l s of those a r r e s t e d , charged or
      e je c t e d and complaints of misbehaviour both in s id e and outside
      the ground, including public houses, railway/coach s t a t i o n s and
      other places where f o o tb a ll supporters gather.                    This allows fo r
       regular offenders t o be i d e n t i f i e d and t a r g e t e d , r e s u l t i n g in a
      systematic build-up of i n t e l l i g e n c e .         To ensure the maximum
      b e n e f it of such i n t e l l i g e n c e i t i s e s s e n t i a l t h a t the match
      summary i s       completed accurately              and comprehensively, and
      forwarded promptly t o the Police Force concerned.

      national i n t e l l i g e n c e system operated by t h a t Force.                  This

1.6   Sources of i n t e l l i g e n c e may be summarised as f o llo w s:-
      (a)        Match summaries compiled by the 'home' club will provide
                 a record of the same f i x t u r e on previous occasions.

      (b)        I n t e l l i g e n c e from the l i a i s o n o f f i c e r a s s o c ia te d with the
                 v i s i t i n g club.

      (c)       Analysis of C.C.T.V. coverage to i d e n t i f y group leaders
                 and observe the ' t a c t i c s ' of the hooligans.

      (d)        ' S p o t t e r s ' supplied by the         police a s s o c ia te d with the
                 v i s i t i n g club.

      (e)       The fo o tb a ll clubs (home and away).

      (f)       Travel agents, coach o p e r a t o rs , B r i t i s h Transport              P o lice,
                 s u p p o rte rs' c lu b s .

      (g)       The development of i n t e l l i g e n c e will take                i n t o account
                 the h i s t o r y of the f i x t u r e , the a n t i c i p a t e d siz e of the
                 crowd, importance of r e s u l t to e i t h e r club, stre n g th of
                 'away' follow ing, absence of other games in the a r e a ,
                 whether or not a 'derby' f i x t u r e , press coverage.

     Pre-Match Planning

7    Depending on the f i x t u r e fo o tb a ll matches will involve th e use of
     various branches of                  the Force (the mounted, t r a f f i c , special
     c o nsta bu la ry , e t c . ) .         I t is    important t h a t the o f f i c e r
     r e sp o n sible f o r p o licin g the match determines the pre-match
     planning in the l i g h t of the i n t e l l i g e n c e a t hand. In many cases
     an o f f i c e r will be              delegated the planning ta sk and i t           is
     recommended t h a t as a ro u tin e the planning o f f i c e r , i n t e l l i g e n c e
     o f f i c e r and th e o f f i c e r in charge of p olicin g the match con fer to
     analyse ' i n t e l l i g e n c e ' and determine t a c t i c s .

     Use o f 'Away' O fficers (Sp otters)

8    The use of ' s p o t t e r s ' from the Force area from which fans are
     t r a v e l l i n g to 'away'              games may be of b e n e f i t , but t h e r e are
     d i f f i c u l t i e s , p a r t i c u l a r l y i f the o f f i c e r s tr a v e l with the
     su p p o r te r s .      A d i s t i n c t i o n has to be drawn between, on the one
     hand, ro u tin e ' s p o t t e r s ' who seek to provide r e g u l a r i n t e l l i g e n c e
     to the 'home' Force and, on the o t h e r , c o v e r t i n t e l l i g e n c e
     g a th ering .

9    In the former case i t i s recommended t h a t arrangements be made
      beforehand with the 'home' p o l i c e ;                 t h a t the o f f i c e r s do not
      t rav el with the v i s i t i n g sup p o rters as p o lic e o f f i c e r s ; t h a t they
      r e p o r t to and l i a i s e with the 'home' p o lice to a s s i s t with
      intelligence.          Whenever p o s s i b l e t h e i r r o l e should be s o l e ly to
      provide i n t e l l i g e n c e and not to be d i r e c t l y involved in the
      policing.

10   In the l a t t e r case ( co v ert o p e ratio n s) i t i s important t h a t a
     means of c o n t a c t be e s t a b l i s h e d p r i o r to the game and t h a t the
      o f f i c e r s handling the communications, and the o f f i c e r in charge
      of the game, know e x a c tly what arrangements have been made.
      Briefing
11   O fficers should receive a f u l l b r i e f i n g p r i o r t o ta k in g up t h e i r
      d uties which should include a f t e r match arrangements and c l e a r
      i n s t r u c t i o n s as t o booking o f f . Where p r a c t i c a b l e such b r i e fi n g s
      should be c a r r i e d out on s i t e .       In large sc a le p o lice operations
      the operational commander should b r i e f a l l o f f i c e r s not below the
      rank of I n sp ec to r, and Inspectors should be responsible for
      b r i e f i n g o f f i c e r s of the rank of Sergeant and Constable.

12   In accordance with the 'Popplewell' recommendations the b r i e fi n g
      must        include            evacuation   procedures and the     d u tie s      and
      r e s p o n s i b i l i t i e s of stewards should be brought to the a t t e n t i o n
      of police o f f i c e r s (see Duties of Stewards - paragraph 3.1 e t .
      seq.).

13   B riefin g cards may prove advantageous, p a r t i c u l a r l y when o f f i c e r s
     are u n fam ilia r with the routin es of po licin g f o o t b a l l .        Where
     o f f i c e r s are u n fam iliar they should be provided with a map of the

     s e ctio n s of the ground and the numbers or l e t t e r s used by the
     club, so t h a t they can answer questions for su pporters.

     common p r a c t i c e s of disturbance should be c a r e f u l l y o u tlin e d .
     Supervisors in p a r t i c u l a r need to know the ground commanders
     'p u b l i c order s t r a t e g y ' .

15   Copies of evacuation procedures and any b r i e f i n g cards or other
     information passed out in documentary form during b r i e f i n g should
     be a v a i l a b l e within the ' p o l i c e co n tro l* .

        Away Supporters

1.17    I n t e l l i g e n c e o f f i c e r s should provide c l e a r i n s t r u c t i o n s to coach
        operators as to routes and parking f a c i l i t i e s .                        Car and coach
        parks should be c l e a r l y signed and a p o lice presence maintained
        to ensure s e c u r i t y and prevent i n t e r f e r e n c e .             The presence of
        p olice a t such l o c a t i o n s may a lso enable the e a r l y g athering of
        i n t e l l i g e n c e on the numbers and behaviour of v i s i t i n g su p p o r te r s.

1.18   I t may be prudent f o r po lice to e s c o r t supporters from coach
       parks to the s p o r t s stadium in o rder to ensure t h a t they do not
       become the s u b j e c t o f , nor engage i n , hooliganism.        S i m i l a rl y ,
       railway s t a t i o n s should be monitored by p o lic e and supporters
       escorted to the stadium where the match i s to be played. Close
       l i a i s o n with B r i t i s h Transport Police i s recommended. Most fans
       are f a m i l i a r with e s c o r t arrangements and where p o ss ib le police
       should s t i c k to ro u t in e s which become f a m i l i a r .

1.19   A f te r a match coaches leaving the area may req u ire                             a po lic e
       e s c o r t u n t i l they are away from t r o u b l e .

       Flashpoints

1.20   Special a t t e n t i o n should be given to any p u b lic house or o th e r
       u n o f f i c i a l assembly p o i n t , and to the routes taken in general by
       supporters where c o n fro n ta tio n between r i v a l fans may occur.
       Also a t t e n t i o n should be given to waste ground and d e r e l i c t
       property along any such routes where m i s s i l e s or o ffen sive
       weapons may be gathered by h ooligans.                Bridges have often been
       used by hooligans and should be monitored.

       Stadi urn Searches

1.21   Before s p e c t a t o r s are admitted i n t o the stadium a physical search
       should be made of the ground and t e r r a c e s by the o f f i c e r in
       charge of p o lic in g the game to ensure t h a t a l l fences and gates
       are s u f f i c i e n t l y secure and t h a t no o b je c ts which may be used as
       o f fe nsiv e weapons or m i s s i l e s are to hand.          There should be an
       arrangement with the club f o r an o f f i c i a l to be a v a i l a b l e when
       the in sp ectio n i s c a r r i e d out to put r i g h t anything which i s
       amiss.

       Entry Into the Ground

1.22   Approaches to the ground are themselves f l a s h p o i n t s and need to
       be well monitored.                   Careful planning to c o - o rd in a te as f a r as
       p o ss ib le the routes taken by d i f f e r e n t groups of supporters to
       r e l e v a n t t u r n s t i l e s may reduce the opportunity of c o n f l i c t .
1.23   Clear marking of          t u r n s t i l e s i s e s s e n t i a l and a l l o f f i c e r s on
        fo o tb all d u tie s     should be b r i e f e d as to the segregation
        arrangements.

1.24   The searching of s p e c t a t o r s depends on circumstances. The terms
        of the Police and Criminal Evidence Act a ffo rd a r i g h t of search
        only where t h e r e are grounds to suspect an offence i s being
        committed, and the suspicion must r e l a t e d i r e c t l y to the person
        searched.             The Codes of P r a c t i c e , however, exempt the need to
       make customary records i f in the circumstances i t i s not
        p r a c t i c a b l e to do so.     Ground r e g u l a t i o n s reserve the r i g h t of
        the club to d eclin e admission to any person who refu s es to be
        searched by a p o lic e o f f i c e r , and t h i s may allow f o r ro u tin e
        searching on e n tr y to grounds, but p o lic e o f f i c e r s need to know
        the l i m i t s of t h i s p r o v isio n . Refusal to be searched may e n t a i l
       a refu sal to allow e n t r y .

1.25   Within the l i m i t a t i o n s o f f i c e r s should seek to prevent supporters
       e n te r in g the ground with weapons, m i s s i l e s , f l a g poles e t c .

1.26   Drunkenness i s recognised as a major cause of hooliganism and
       supporters may attempt to e n t e r sp o r ts grounds w h i l s t in a
       drunken co n ditio n or car ry in g alco h ol.   Where the c on d itio ns of
       the Sporting Events' (Control of Alcohol E tc .) Act, 1985, apply
       the provisions should be enforced.           The main c onditions are as

       persons a r r e s t e d fo r any offence which might r e s u l t in the
       imposition of an order should be photographed a t the time of
       charging.     Photographs taken a t t h i s time are l i k e l y to be of
       more value f o r subsequent i d e n t i f i c a t i o n purposes than those
       taken a t o r following a c o u r t appearance.

1.30   Photographs which should conform to the following s p e c i f i c a t i o n s
        should be a f f i x e d to each p o lic e copy of an exclusion order

        (a)      Standard p assp o rt s i z e 2" x 2".

1.31   Photographs held f o r the purpose of enforcing exclusion orders
       are f o r p o lic e o f f i c e r s only and must not be c i r c u l a t e d to any
       o th er person.

1.32   Wherever an order i s made, co p ies,         to g eth er with photographs

1.33   C i r c u l a t i o n of information r e l a t i n g to Exclusion Orders                       is
       incorporated i n t o the fo o tb all match i n t e l l i g e n c e system.

1.34   Football Liaison O f fic e r s will maintain schedules, to g e th e r with
       photographs of those s u b j e c t to orders who are known to support
       t h e i r clu b .   P r i o r to each match, complete schedules should be
       forwarded to the away team l i a i s o n o f f i c e r . Schedules should be
       retu rn ed a f t e r each match, to g e th e r with the completed foo tb all
       match summary form.

1.35   These schedules and photographs w ill be of p a r t i c u l a r importance
       to those o f f i c e r s operating C.C.T.V. equipment.      When scanning
       crowds during the course of the game or when viewing videos of
       d is o r d e r a f t e r the event, op erators will be able to check the
       crowd a g a i n s t the photographs.

1.36   Where weight of numbers of those s u b j e c t to orders makes the
       supplying of f u l l schedules im p ra c tic a b le , c i r c u l a t i o n should be
       r e s t r i c t e d to t a r g e t t e d hard core o f fe n d e r s .

1.37   Liaison o f f i c e r s will need to maintain several schedules                                of
       orders to c a t e r f o r midweek games, l a t e r e t u r n s , e t c . ,

1.38   Where an in dividual f i r s t came to n o tic e a f t e r 31.12.80, as
       i n d ic a te d by his C.R.O. number, s u f f i x information r e l a t i n g to
       exclusion orders will be maintained on the P.N.C. within the
       su b je c ts co n v ictio n s f i l e .

1.39   In c e r t a i n circumstan ces, offences which might lead to the
        imposition of exclusion orders are not re p o rt a b l e to the N.I.B.
        Therefore, where an indiv id ual has no P.N.C. record, or f i r s t
        came to n o tic e p r i o r to 1.1.81 or where th e re i s any o th er reason

          check should be made with h is home Force.

          N.B.     Where an order has been in force fo r a period of 12
                   months, a p p l i c a t i o n can be made to the c o u rt for the

1.42     I t i s emphasised t h a t e f f e c t i v e t u r n s t i l e p o lic in g i s the key to

         encouraged to t a l k to those waiting to e n t e r in order to i d e n t i f y
         non-local a c c e n ts , drunks, e t c .

1.43     Queues forming a t t u r n s t i l e s should be c l o s e l y monitored by

1.50   Home and v i s i t i n g supporters should be segregated i n s i d e the
       stadium by means of segregation fencing and/or s t e r i l e zones, and
       ste p s should be taken to impose segregation before they e n t e r and

          Contingency Planning

 1.61   Pre-determined plans should be a v a i l a b l e to                  control such
         contingencies as se rio u s d i s o r d e r , p itc h incursion and locked out
         s p e c t a t o r s . Because of the g r e a t divergence in ground and crowd
         f a c t o r s these plans must be ground s p e c i f i c .         However, these
         plans           must    take    into    co n s id e ra tio n the        'Popplewell'
         recommendations with regard to the transm iss ion of coded messages

         Emergency Evacuation

1.62    Stewards must be f a m i l i a r with the actio n to be taken in the
         event of an evacuation of the whole or p a r t of the stadium.
         Police should a s s i s t in the rapid evacuation of a stadium in such
        circumstances. Stadia should have a universal locking system and
        a l l stewards should be in possession of keys f o r the e x i t gates.
        They should wear a d i s t i n c t i v e tabard or o th er means of easy
         identification.          It  must be made          c l e a r to both the club
        management and to the individual stewards t h a t they must not
        leave t h e i r p o st without being r e l i e v e d .     I t is essential th at
        e x i t gates can be opened without delay in the event of an
        emergency.       Simulated emergency evacuation ex erc ises f o r the
        s t a f f employed by the club must be             held a t l e a s t twice each
        season to t e s t the emergency evacuation procedure.                  The crowd
        will not be involved but depending upon circumstances i t could be
        an advantage to explain to the crowd t h a t an emergency evacuation
        ex e rcise i s taking place.       Experience has rev ealed t h a t in an
        actual evacuation i t i s e s s e n t i a l to monitor e x i t doors when the
        crowd has l e f t the stadium to prevent them wandering back i n to
        the stadium before the reason f o r the evacuation has been
        completed.

         Retention o f V isitin g Supporters

1*63    In some circumstances the o f f i c e r in charge may decide to hold
         the v i s i t i n g supporters in the ground u n t i l he considers i t

Introduction

The use of C.C.T.V. and s t i l l photography as an aid to the
e f f e c t i v e p o lic in g of fo o tb a ll i s a r e c e n t development. At the
p resen t time, a l l F i r s t and Second Division fo o tb all grounds are
provided with s t a t i c video cameras and                      recording f a c i l i t i e s ,
which enable the p o lic e to monitor crowd behaviour within and in
the immediate v i c i n i t y of s t a d i a .             I t is anticipated th a t
videoing f a c i l i t i e s will be extended to a l l Third and Fourth
Divsion grounds in the near f u t u r e but not n e c e s s a r i l y of the
same type as in the two higher D ivisio n s.

The q u a l i t y of the equipment and re-production of image p r e se n tly
a v a i l a b l e in f o o tb a ll grounds i s now always compatible with i t s
adequate p r e s e n t a t i o n before the c o u r t s , and i t s use has r e s u l t e d
in some confusion between i t s function in r e l a t i o n to 'command
and c o n t r o l ' and to evidence g ath erin g .              Experience to date
i n d i c a t e s the g r e a t e s t value l i e s in developing a system f o r the
use of C.C.T.V. and s t i l l photography within s t a d i a f o r the
purposes of i n t e l l i g e n c e and evidence g a th ering .

All systems a t p r e s e n t in use a t fo o tb a ll grounds are capable of
being enhanced and developed.            When these changes a re made i t
should be ensured t h a t the replacement equipment i s of s u f f i c i e n t
standard t h a t the q u a l i t y of      recording i s such as to be
acceptable f o r use as evidence in c o u r t .

Accepting the need f o r i d e n t i f i c a t i o n and evidence gathering f o r
prosecution to be the primary function of the system,                          the
following p o in ts are worthy of co n s id e ra tio n in the use of
development of e x i s t i n g and a n t i c i p a t e d f a c i l i t i e s .

Technical Considerations

(a)      At the time of i n s t a l l a t i o n , co n s id e ra tio n should be given
         to the s i t i n g of cameras and cables so as to prevent
         i n t e r f e r e n c e o r damage.

(b)      As good video recording r e q u i r e s good l i g h t and as most
         f o o tb a ll f i x t u r e s are played during winter months, the
         need f o r adequate l i g h t i n g within and around foo tb all
         s t a d i a i s e s s e n t i a l to e li m i n a t e areas of darkness which
         may be used as cover f o r d is o r d e r l y behaviour. Fans are
         i n c r e a s i n g l y aware t h a t such behaviour i s monitored by
         C.C.T.V. and they will attem pt to evade d e te c tio n by
         seeking whatever cover i s a v a i l a b l e .                      I t i s th e r e f o r e
         important t h a t cameras are s i t e d in such a way as to
         minimise b lin d spots and t h a t f a c i l i t i e s are provided to
         in c r e a se l i g h t i n g i n t e n s i t i e s in st a n d s , e t c . The s i t i n g
         of video cameras should take account of sloping r o o f s , to
               enable recording a t the r e a r of sta n d s. This problem can
               be         overcome    by  the      use    of       hand-held   cameras.
               Consideration must be given to a l l foreseeable problems
               t h a t may a f f e c t the performance of video equipment.            A
               good example t h a t i s e a s i l y overlooked i s the path of the
               s e t t i n g sun. A video camera would be i n e f f e c t i v e i f the
               sun was shining d i r e c t l y i n t o the l e n s .
        (c)    Police Control Rooms contain valuable equipment and are
               o ften v u ln erab le. Consideration should be given to taking
               p r o t e c t i v e measures to inc rease s e c u r i t y .
        (d)    Control Rooms should be placed in a p o s i t i o n which
               commands a good a l l round view of the ground and
               c o n s id e ra tio n should be given to p lacin g the video
               monitors in such a p o s itio n t h a t the op erato r i s not
               d i s t r a c t e d by a c t i v i t i e s within the ground.
        (e)    Careful c o n s id e ra tio n to the type of l i g h t i n g and the
               p rovision of glass p a r t i t i o n s should be given to prevent
               r e f l e c t i o n or d i s t o r t i o n . The Control Room should have
               adequate background heating to p r o t e c t the e l e c t r i c a l
               equipment and f o r the comfort of personnel employed within
               the room.           Heating should remain switched on 24 hours a
               day during cold weather.
       (f)    The use of f la s h equipment in the v i c i n i t y of s e n s i t i v e
              video cameras may damage the tube i f discharged facing the
              camera.          Even i f t h i s damage i s not permanent, the video
              camera would be unable to function f o r some time.              As a
              general r u le f l a s h equipment should not be used in the
              v i c i n i t y of o perating video cameras.

       (9 )   Police Control Rooms must be provided with m u lti-reco rd in g
              f a c i l i t i e s in order t h a t the opportu nity e x i s t s to capture
              a l l in c i d e n t s which may occur in d i f f e r e n t areas within
              the stadium.

              Operational Considerations
4.11   (a)    I t i s important t h a t police o f f i c e r s are made aware t h a t
              t h e i r a c t i o n s in dealing with d is o r d e r l y behaviour within
              the stadium will a l s o be recorded on C.C.T.V.
       (b)    Consideration should be given to the p r ep ara tio n of a
              ground s p e c i f i c video, to be used in b r i e f i n g o f f i c e r s who
              may not be f a m i l i a r with the stadium.
       (c)    I t i s important whenever p o ss ib le to use the                       same
              personnel in p o lic e ground control room o p e r a t i o n s .         They
              will more r e a d i l y i d e n t i f y r e g u l a r troublemakers       and
              , t a r g e t them with in the ground.           Over a period of        time
              they will develop s i m i l a r a b i l i t i e s in r e l a t i o n       to
              v i s i t i n g su p p o r te r s .
       (d)    Inmediately following a f i x t u r e where a r r e s t s          fo r
              misconduct have occurred, a r r e s t i n g o f f i c e r s should be
              allowed an opportunity to view any recording of the
             in c i d e n t s concerned to e s t a b l i s h (1) the evidence fo r
             t h e i r a r r e s t and (2) whether the offender has committed
             any f u r t h e r a c t s not witnessed by the a r r e s t i n g o f f i c e r .

             In te llig e n c e Gathering

4.12   (a)   Away fans a r r i v i n g a t grounds may be videoed as they come
             through t u r n s t i l e s , get o f f buses or leave railway
             stations.    This helps with i d e n t i f i c a t i o n and the t r a c i n g
             of those r e spo n sib le f o r causing t r o u b l e .    I t a lso makes
             the fans aware t h a t they are on record.

             When grounds are f u l l , the crowd may be filmed a l l round,
             so t h a t i f tro u b le s t a r t s ,        i d e n t i f i c a t i o n will be
             a s s i s t e d . I t will a ls o make the crowd aware t h a t they are
             on record. To a s s i s t t h i s procedure, i t i s always useful
             to have i d e n t i f i c a t i o n marks around the ground so t h a t the
             f a n s' l o c a tio n within the stadium can be p in -p o in te d with
             accuracy.

       (b)   Some clubs have followings from areas of the country many
             miles from t h e i r home         base.      Therefore, when i t i s
             necessary to i d e n t i f y persons from the crowd, photographs
             and video recordings should be c i r c u l a t e d to Forces who
             have supporters!! clubs of t h a t p a r t i c u l a r foo tb all club in
             th e ir area.

       (c)   Each Force should compile s e t s of photographs and/or
             videos of i t s own clubs hooligans and e i t h e r ( i ) forward
             on such compilation to each Force t h a t i s l i k e l y to host
             the club during the forthcoming season, or ( i i ) one such
             compilation be taken to each away game by o f f i c e r s
             t r a v e l l i n g with the c l u b ' s su p p o r te r s.

             Each host Force should supply the v i s i t i n g team's home
             Force with photographs and video recordings                             of the
             v i s i t i n g team s su p p o r te r s , i f t h e i r conduct i s such as to
             warrant t h i s .      This will keep Forces aware of how t h e i r
             own c l u b ' s supporters behave away from home.
       (d)   Some clubs have a se c t i o n of supporters who ar e notorious
             f o r hooligan behaviour.                      I t would a s s i s t in f u tu re
             i n v e s t i g a t i o n s i n t o se rio u s d iso rd e r a t o th e r grounds i f
             the h o st Forces of these clubs prepared video recordings
             and photographs of t h e i r hooligan element and e s t a b l i s h e d
             the i d e n t i t y of those involved.                    Then by comparing t h i s
             recording and the photographs with those of the i n c i d e n t
             under i n v e s t i g a t i o n , i d e n t i f i c a t i o n should be     greatly
             assisted.

             Known hooligans should be t a r g e t t e d and followed in video.
             This r e q u ire s local o f f i c e r s o perating the video who can
             be a s s i s t e d by o f f i c e r s from the v i s i t i n g team's home
             Force.

       (f)   Identified        fans     displaying  consistently             aggressive
             behaviour, not amounting to a chargeable offence on a
             s i n g l e occasio n, bu t who can be i d e n t i f i e d on o th e r video
           recordings d isplaying s i m i la r conduct,                should be tra c e d
           and charged on t h i s evidence of system.

 (g)      The video recording of a f o o tb a ll f i x t u r e i s a valuable
           source of i n t e l l i g e n c e which i s often overlooked in the
          absence             of   id en tified disorder.      It    is     stro n g ly
          recommended t h a t a l l video recordings be viewed f o r
          i n t e l l i g e n c e purposes, and t h a t tapes be r e ta in e d u n til
          the corresponding f i x t u r e in the following season has been
          played.

 Id e n tific a tio n

In the event of l a r g e - s c a l e and se rio u s d iso rd e r a t a sp o rtin g
f i x t u r e , th ere will be a need to develop a s t r a t e g y to i d e n t i f y
and a r r e s t o ffe n d e rs, using the evidence obtained by video
recording and s t i l l photography.           P ra c tic a l guidance in t h i s
process i s as fo llo w s:-

(a)      Photographs or s t i l l s from video recordings should be
          displayed fo r public view and i d e n t i f i c a t i o n wherever
          possible,   e.g.   T.V.,     newspapers, match programmes,
          posters, etc.

(b)      A viewing stu d io should be c r e a te d not only f o r the use of
          p o lic e o f f i c e r s , but f o r the public as well as such
          o r g a n is a tio n s as s u p p o r te r s' c lu b s , stewards, r e s i d e n t s '
          a s s o c i a t i o n s , social workers, probation o f f i c e r s , e t c .

(c)      Immediately a f t e r the i n c i d e n t , a l l press photographs and
          oth er media evidence should be obtained and statements
          taken from those re sp o n s ib le f o r taking the photographs,
          video reco rding s, e t c .     Attempts should a ls o be made to
          ob tain a l l amateur videos and photographs, and the
          a p p ro p ria te statem ents taken. All t h i s m a t e r i a l , to g e th e r
          with p o lic e photographs and video recording s, should then
          form p a r t of the viewing stu d io e x h i b i t s .

(d)      O ffic e r s from the h ost Force should v i s i t the v i s i t i n g
         team's area and o th er areas containing s u p p o r te r s' clubs
         of     the     visiting  team,   where they should e x h i b i t
         photographs and video          recordings  for     iden tifiatio n
         purposes as a t (b) above.

(e)      The s iz e of the p o lic e team working on i d e n t i f i c a t i o n i s
         c r i t i c a l . There should be s u f f i c i e n t to do the work, but
         i t should be kept small enough to be cohesive.

(f)      The task of viewing video recordings and photographs many
         times i s te d io u s , th e r e f o r e i t i s recommended t h a t s t a f f
         should be s e l e c te d who are i n t e r e s t e d in the s p o r t
         involved.

(g)      Once i d e n t i f i e d and tr a c e d , offenders should be i n v i t e d to
         view the video recordings and i f they are a b l e , to
         identify          themselves         w hilst    in   non   c o n tro v e rs ia l
         circumstances before being questioned about a lle g e d
         offences on video recordings and photographs.
        (h)      Where people i d e n t i f y themselves in photographs, they
                 should be i n v it e d to i n d i c a te t h i s on the reverse of the
                 photograph over t h e i r s i g n a tu r e .

        (i)      Consideration should be given to videoing suspects w h il s t
                 they are watching the recording of the i n c i d e n t . Facial
                 e x p ress io n s, bodily movements and verbal exchanges may
                 form v i t a l supporting evidence.

    Football hooliganism is probably unique in the way that it involves different Police
    Forces dealing with offenders who are from other Police districts. The key technique
    of hooliganism is the trouble that occurs in relation to visiting supporters; they
    nay be of course the target of attack from home supporters or marauding hooliaans
    themselves.

    The nature of the conflict is no longer sinple if it ever was. We now find gangs
    organised about football clubs vdio will go out of their way to attack groups of
    supporters simply passing through their "territory". Hooligan gangs transfer their
    allegience according to the event and are primarily involved in disturbances when
    their Home Club has no fixture and on other than match days.

    We have achieved a great deal to contain disorder and the regular conduct in the
    mainstream of football attendances.

    Whilst at most games the opportunity to make trouble is restricted, the atmosphere
    retains unpleasant and the potential for disorder fairly obvious. At the       time,
    outside the net of police control, football hooligans succeed in violent encounters.

W   Based upon the limited intelligence we have developed and particularly in
    contemplation of the key work done by covert teams it seems fairly clear that the
    worst of the problem relates to persistent hooligan gangs sane of which are well
    organised and who plan a strategy of violence.

    The strategy has got to be based upon the identification of persistent hooligans and
    gangs with a view to targetting Police efforts on then.

    The existing football liaison system is concerned with natch information (numbers of
    travelling fans, modes of transport, train times etc.) rather than intelligence as
    such. Intelligence can be more properly defined as information as to the identity
    and background of persistent hooligans and hooligan gangs and their known strategies
    and future plans. (The general purpose of a National Football Intelligence Unit is
    to receive, evaluate and disseminate football intelligence of this kind and to
    promote the development of intelligence in participant Forces.)
    LOCMTCN
    It is proposed that the National Football Intelligence Unit (N.F.I.U.) be located in
    London. The reasons for this are as follows:

      (i) The major international football stadium is located at Wembley, within London.

     (ii)   London has the largest concentration of Football League Clubs of any city in
            the United Kingdom.

    (iii) London is the major nodal point for football fans travelling to and fran
           matches.

     (iv)   The British Transport Police Headquarters is situated within London. They
            have responsibility for both travelling fans and house the United Kingdom
            Permanent Correspondent in the TREVI organisation.

      (v) The offices of the Football Association are in London.

    (vi)    Other important liaison bodies are also located here, e.g. D.O.T., Interpol,
            British Rail, etc.

    The intelligence role of the N.F.I.U. would comprise three major elements.

    (a)    Intelligence concerning known hooligans and hooligan       gangs.

    (b)    General information concerning the hooligan problem.

    (c)    Liaison between police covert operations and other intelligence sources.

    (a)    Intelligence Concerning Known HonUggns

           A nunber of publications and complementary indices will require maintenance to
           catalogue and order information in order that intelligence may be disseminated
           to those responsible for policing; as follows:

              (i)   Index of target/main hooligans.

             (ii)   Index of known hooligan gangs.

            (iii)   National team hooligan index.
             (iv) Rogue coach operators/vehicle index.

              (v) Register of Exclusion Orders.

             (vi)   Criminal names index on P.N.C. to be flagged for interest of N.F.I.U.

            (vii)   Publication of intelligence bulletins.

    (b)    General Information OaaoaamlntT the HoMigan Problem

              (i)   Information regarding the travel movements of kncwn hooligans to
                    include their routes, Forces affected, mode of travel, numbers,
                    flashpoints, previous listing and current plans.

            (ii)    Known hoiligan gang strategies including methods of ambush, weapons
                    used, methods of secreting prohibited articles.

^          (iii) A public 'phone-in' facility for citizens having information for the
                  Police.

             (iv) Monitoring of international fan movements.

              (v)   Monitoring of media reports.

            (vi) Maintenance of record of notable incidents, patterns, trends,
                 anniversaries etc.

           (vii)    Index of Coach Operators.

    (c)    Tiiaiaon Fractions

              (i) Liaison with B.T.P./TREVI (includes contact with EuropeanPolice
                  Forces).

            (ii)    Knowledge of current and past covert operations and intelligence
                    support to them.

           (iii)    Liaiscai with Regional Criminal Intelligence Offices.
                                               - 4 -

              (iv)   To receive local intelligence reports.

               (v) Liaision with National Membership Scheme.

                     In light of the provisions of the Data Protection Act, it would be
                     advisable if a condition of membership of the scheme was agreement that
                     the members' details would be made available on request by Police for
                     the purposes of crime prevention or the investigation of crime.

              (vi)   Index of local football intelligence officers/officers or contact
                     points within United Kingdom Police Forces.
   STAFFING

   It is proposed that the Police staff be seconded from their heme Forces to the Home
   Office for duty in the N.F.I.U.

   A provisional structure might be as follows:

  Superintendent
o,-     Officer in Charge of the Unit. In the early years of this Unit he will be
W       responsible for ensuring that the Unit is soundly structured and financed. He
         will have an important role visiting and liaising with other Police Forces to
         establish a national football intelligence network.

            It may be possible eventually for this post to be shared part time with other
            Heme Office funded posts based at New Scotland Yard.
   Chief Inspector
          Responsible for the day to day running of the office.

   Inspector
          Monitoring and liaison functions.     Deputy to the Chief Inspector.

   Detective Sergeants (3)
          Intelligence Officers.

   Intelligence Clerks (3)
          Assistants to the Intelligence Officers/Conpiter Operators.

   Aflnrinistration Support
            Typist

   Hours of duty in this office may need to take into account the pattern and timing of
   football matches. Seme shiftwork would be inevitable. A suggested format would be:
   MONDAY            8.00 a.m. - 4.00 p.m.      One Officer (should be an Officer who
                                                performed duty on the preceeding Saturday).

   TUESDAY           9.00 a.m. - 5.00 p.m.
                     3.00 p.m. - 11.00 p.m.
                                                Duties as required taking account of
                                                midweek matches.
   WEDNESDAY         9.00 a.m. - 5.00 p.m.
                     3.00 p.m. -11.00 p.m.

   THURSDAY          8.00 a.m. - 4.00 p.m.      Updating of intelligence, preparation of

  FRIDAY          8.00 a.m. - 12 midnight    Officers on duty to include a Supervisor.
                                             Anticipated collation of covertly gathered
                                             intelligence.
  SATURDAY        9.00 a.m. - 5.00 p.m.
                  3.00 p.m. - 11.00 p.m.

  SUNDAY          Duties as directed for occasional Sunday games otherwise this is
                  normally a rest day for the full office.

  DOCDManaincN

  It is essential that nationally recognised and standardised formats are adopted for
  the recording of all information and intelligence of interest to the N.F.I.U.

  This will enable the local Force football intelligence systems to mirror the national
  requirement and allow for efficient information exchange.

  The systems adopted should also be such that they may be readily transposed onto
  computer, since it is clear that computerisation of the information will greatly
       ice the evaluative process
  The manual documentation system will require some wider consultation before agreement
  to ensure that indices are complementary and meet the necessary requirements.

  Some draft forms for this documentation are included at Appendix 'A'.

  TBCagCKL AIDS

  Clearly, a computer with automatic cross indexing and random search facilities is
  highly desirable for the National Unit. Such a configuration already exists at
  S.0.11 Branch of the Metropolitan Police. Initial enquiries have indicated that the
  computer has ample capacity to absorb the workload and that the existing fields of
  search are largely compatible with the identified need.

  A decision to pursue this course would undoubtedly speed the process of
  inplementation.

  At a local Force level, it is unlikely that computerised intelligence systems would
,~be necessary, except in the case of those Forces responsible for a large number of
--^football clubs.

  Enquiry will need to be made with the Metropolitan Police regarding reimbursement for
  the use of the facility but any such cost would be only a fraction of that incurred
  through purchase of a new system.

  In addition to the computer, the provision of a FAX facility would clearly be
  beneficial for the accurate and quick transmission of information. It is
  particularly valuable in relation to receipt of information from abroad where
  language difficulties can create opportunity for mistakes and misinterpretation.

  FINANCE

  A recent meeting at the Heme Office suggested that funding could be made available
  from central government to finance this unit.

  No total cost may be placed on the unit at this stage, however, a Metropolitan Police
  Finance Branch Ready Reckoner of costs is attached for guidance and an initial
  estimate follows:

BEHAVIOURAL THRESHOLDS AT FOOTBALL GROUNDS
 INTRODUCTION


               The    end       of        season     p la y - o ff s    and     more     starkly         the       gross

misconduct of English so - c a lle d fo o tb a ll fans in Europe, have once again

t h r u s t "football hooliganism" cen tre sta g e . Whilst media coverage no doubt

plays ap a r t in a d re n a lisin g the hooligans                     i t is nonetheless unmistakeable

t h a t regard less of police endeavour and the range                                  of i n i t i a t i v e s     from

Government and          the     fo otb all         institu tio n s,       the        ranks    of     the       s p o r t 's

miscreants remain undiminished and t h e i r brazen aggression undaunted.



              I t i s t r u e t h a t the game i t s e l f has heavy                   r e s p o n s i b i l i t i e s and

must do     more to close i t s doors to un d esirab les.                              Much has y e t to be

discussed     and t e s t e d        to      examine     vrvs      to make           exclusion         (of      either

hooligans     in     particular              or     'awe\y    supp ort'         in     general)         effective.

Certainly     the problems                are     co nsid erab le;       how do         the     adm in istrato rs

determine     genuine       id e n t i t y ? ; does     any      scheme        for    exclusion         begin          by

including     and a u th e n tic a tin g exactly a l l those who ev en tu ally should be

excluded;     how i s       i d e n t it y      determined        at     the     turn stiles          where        many

thousands w ill crush to gain admission, a t say up to 90 gateways? what is

to be the ru lin g on m ultiple membership?, what about 'derby games' and

will segregation be affec te d ? These are j u s t a few of the many questions

to be answered.          C ertainly the attempts to l e g i s l a t e fo r exclusion to

d ate, the exclusion orders under Section 30, Public Order Act, 1986, have

proved a dismal f a i l u r e .            Courts have sometimes been r e l u c t a n t to impose

bans and,     where they have, the bans have been of                                    so s h o r t a duration as to

make them i r r e l e v a n t . This i s an issu e which c l e a r l y needs addressing - a

complex legal power, on the face of i t the utmost legal sanction a g a in s t

the fo o tb a ll hooligan, t h a t in some cases f o r example r e s u l t s in banning

him from games f o r three months from the l a s t game of the season (there
 are several examples) is little short of laughable.


                Aside from these issues i t i s also c l e a r t h a t hooliganism in

 football      is    not as separable         and d i s t i n c t   as   is   so often made out.

 Aggressive m asculinity, i f not channelled elsewhere, i s r e g r e t ta b l y more

evident as criminal rowdyism and a s s a u l t in our daily li v e s than c e r t a i n l y

 i t ought to be.         Whatever the reasons, ill-mannered, aggressive, v io l e n t

group behaviour, wholly outside the expectations of reasonable people is

now commonplace.          Football i s not the only sta g e, a l b e i t one of the most

convenient, for t h i s kind of d iso rd e r.            There i s i t seems a common dynamic

which policeman have recognised fo r a long time and which i t seems the

r e s t of society i s coming to r e a l i s e - simply the desire for violence and

an unbridled contempt fo r decent standards and law enforcement.



               Consequently a s p e c if i c s tr a t e g y a g a in s t foo tball hooliganism,

w h ils t wholly ap p ro p riate, i s not s u f f i c i e n t .      To the general public t h i s

t i d e of e ru p tiv e s t r e e t mauling i s f a r more alarming and d e s t r u c t iv e of a

sense of well-being than minor property crime. When and wherever i t occurs

it    has to        be recognised as       a priority          by Police        and Courts       alike.

I r o n ic a l l y d iso rd er as such does not r e g i s t e r in national crime s t a t i s t i c s

and t r a d i t i o n a l l y , perhaps because of the way evidence has been presented

(it    is     notoriously       d ifficu lt     in    verbal        testimony    to r e c r e a te   the

circumstances of d i s o r d e r ) , the co u rts have a l l too often d e a l t with the

v i o le n t and the troublesome with             leniency,         seemingly content t h a t the

tro uble i s p a s t .



               Recent events in Germany have i l l u s t r a t e d to both public and

indeed the a f f r a y e r s themselves the sheer e x t e n t of d isru p tio n of which

they a re      capable.       What i s p a r t i c u l a r l y ominous i s the concerted and
 planned nature of t h e i r debauch.              Trouble i s   n e i th e r spontaneous nor

 sporadic, i t i s organised and d e f ia n t .



               Whatever longer term measures in r e sp e c t of the regu latio n of

football      become    ap prop riate     (and    of   course    they    are     under     a c tiv e

con sideration ) a s tr a te g y of law enforcement which gives a real sense of

p r i o r i t y has got to be p ro fe s s io n a lly determined and resolved upon.          I t is

surely timely to question whether, with a l l the considerable resources we

already deploy, we cannot make them more d i r e c t l y e f f e c ti v e so t h a t those

who challenge the r u le of law can s t a t e t h e i r case in the c o u r ts .



PROGRESS TO DATE



              During     the    last    th re e   years,   the    ACPO Sub-Committee            on

Hooliganism in Sport has developed a comprehensive guidance document on

the p o licin g of f o o t b a l l ; CCTV systems have been introduced u n i v e r s a l l y ;

a national     in t e l l i g e n c e system has been developed; conferences are now

organised annually fo r Match Commanders and t h e i r i n t e l l i g e n c e o f f i c e r s ;

l i a i s o n with the F .A ., the League, Government departments, the T ra f fic

Commissioners, and other agencies i s now well s tr u c t u r e d .            A g r e a t deal of

co-ordination and co-operation has been achieved but to be c r i t i c a l ,                    in

two areas a t l e a s t , we have not achieved as much as may be p o s s ib le .             CCTV

systems were introduced with necessary haste and we have paid the p r i c e .

Generally they are not te c h n i c a l l y capable of e f f e c t i v e evidence gathering

and in most cases the operators are un train ed                  in technique and t h e i r

e f f o r t s unco-ordinated.     I n t e l lig e n c e g a thering, w h ils t now standard in

form, provides an e x c e l le n t match information system, as to t r a v e l l i n g ,

numbers, mode of t r a n s p o r t , t r a i n times, coach operators and so on.                 It

does not provide much by way of " i n t e l l i g e n c e " .
                 There are probably two possib le overall s t r a t e g i e s fo r dealing

  with foo tb all hooliganism which in a sense are complementary.                    The f i r s t

  is    'containment* and the second 'e x c l u s i o n '. The idea of containment i s

  preventive      and pre-emptive.          It   is   larg ely   embodied in   the    document

 r e f e r r e d to above and e n t a i l s the supervision of crowds a t every turn,

 from t h e i r po in t of departure, through the t r a n s i t system, to the match

 and on to t h e i r r e t u r n . I t involves a c tiv e police supervision, segregation

 of opposing fans and absolute control a t f o o tb a ll grounds. I t i s f a i r to

 say t h a t we have la rg e ly achieved t h i s although in e v ita b ly on occasions

 the l i n e i s breached.         Exclusion involves e i t h e r reg ulato ry methods of

 dissuading t r a v e l l i n g   support and keeping malefactors out of foo tball

 grounds, or the a c tiv e prosecution of criminal                behaviour to the ex ten t

 t h a t i t i s brought under reasonable c o n tr o l .         Regulatory methods remain

 something of an enigma and may a t b est be only p a r t of the answer.

A ssertive enforcment i s an option which we have begun to explore by way of

cov ert operations but i s capable of considerable extension in a v a r ie ty of
t a c t i c a l responses.



                In sh o rt we have achieved containment, i t s e l f a considerable

f e a t , but the c o s t i s a re g u la r and massive p o lic e presence to keep the

still    o v e rtly b e l l i g e r e n t mobs in check.   Current understanding of the

d e l ib e r a t e and criminal asp ects of hooliganism suggests t h a t we can do

much more to t a r g e t hooligan gangs and enforce the law a g a in s t them.


BEHAVIOURAL THRESHOLDS



               Paradoxically, because they are p ro tected by the P o lice, one of

the consequences of containment i s t h a t r iv a l groups tend to be c o r r a l l e d
togeth er so t h a t they can demonstrate t h e i r alle g ie n c e and aggression

towards each other without r e s t r a i n t . Equally and r e g r e t t a b ly we have come

to accept and condone very low standards of behaviour p a r t i c u l a r l y in the

obscene chantings and r i t u a l tau ntin g of hooligan groups.



                Also, w h ils t i t i s often argued t h a t since the intro du ctio n of

CCTV most of the violence i s ou tside the ground, the tro u b le which occurs

in the t r a n s p o r t system or City Centres often stems d i r e c t l y                      from the

a lle g ie n c e demonstrated on the t e r r a c e s .



                Aside from the issu e of t a r g e t t i n g hooligan groups th ere i s a

need to r a i s e the thresho ld s o f acceptable behaviour a t foo tb all grounds

in   general      terms.     We cannot           expect        anything   oth er    than    tro u b le   if

contained supporters are allowed to scream h o s t i l i t i e s a t each oth er week

in and week out with impugnity.



INTELLIGENCE



                As   we     have    said     th e r e     is     a    distinction     between      'match

information' and ' i n t e l l i g e n c e ' .     The match information system i s based

upon    local     Football        Liaison    officers           who   have    a    responsibility        for

individual clubs.           Match r e p o rt s on every game are re ta in e d l o c a l l y and

c i r c u l a t e d to the away Force, who in turn build up a record of t h e i r

c l u b 's supporters away from home. Football Liaison O fficers are ab le to

f o r e c a s t f a i r l y accu rately general match information as to crowd numbers,

modes     of     trav el    and     the     general        demeanour         of    fans    and    so     on.

I n t e l l ig e n c e , more p a r t i c u l a r l y , may be defined as the i d e n t i f i c a t i o n of

foo tb all     hooligans,     t h e i r a s s o c ia t i o n s and s t r a t e g i e s and knowledge of

t h e i r immediate plans.
                  At the p resent time the e x i s t i n g Football Liaison O fficers are

 n e ith e r equipped nor tra in e d to develop t h i s l a t t e r kind of i n t e l l i g e n c e

 to any s i g n i f i c a n t degree.          Put in sta rk terms, and d e s p ite the great

 number of po lice o f f i c e r s re g u la rly deployed to f o o tb a ll grounds, we have

 to ask the following q u e s tio n s .:



                 Are the vociferous groups r e a d ily i d e n t i f i a b l e on the te r r a c e s
re g u la rly made up of the same people?



                 Do they assemble in the same place each week?



                 Do we know t h e i r i d e n t i t i e s ?



                 Do we rou tin e ly i d e n t i f y t h e i r presence and movements?



                Are they involved in tro u b le a t away games together?



                Where e l s e do they a s s o c i a t e and what e l s e are they involved in
as a group?



                Are they the same people who fo r example waylay o th er fans

outside City Centre S ta tio n s l a t e r in the night?



                 In most cases, the answer to a l l               these      questions i s t h a t we

simply do not know.               I r o n i c a l l y , on the basis of the kind of i n t e l l i g e n c e

which has come from covert operations a l l over                          the country, i t i s c l e a r

t h a t almost c e r t a i n l y organised gangs assemble ro u tin e ly to carry forward

 th ere   is   a strong case             for    the    appointment of          I n te llig e n c e     officers

 complementing the Football Liaison o f f i c e r s scheme (for smaller 'Clubs' i t

may of course be the same person as the Football Liaison O f f ic e r ) , who

 should be tra in e d in          'Anacapa'        techniques.           Their ro le should be to

develop a p o r t f o l i o    of known hooligans and gangs,                      and to co-ordinate

operational a c t i v i t i e s so as to enhance i n t e l l i g e n c e gathering.



               Covert operations are the most e f f e c t i v e means o f i n t e l l i g e n c e

gathering but c l e a r l y the most risk y and expensive.                           A wide v a r ie ty of

other o p p o r tu n itie s   exist       however:       covert passive         o peration s;           planned

i n f i l t r a t i o n , observation by " s p o t t e r s " ; questioning of a r r e s t e d persons;

a n aly sis of CCTV recordings; e n q u irie s pursuant of t a r g e t t i n g and a r r e s t

and so on.        Once a genuine i n t e l l i g e n c e operation i s in place with the

support and commitment of se nio r management, the means of i n t e l l i g e n c e

A STRATEGY FOR INTELLIGENCE AMD CCTV



               The   p o te n tia l     fo r    gathering        evidence      and     intelligence             by

op tical means i s enormous and l a r g e ly untapped.                      During the l a s t twelve

months, under the auspices of ACPO, we have developed a t r a i n i n g course

for operations which i s                now n a t io n a l ly    available.      Whilst t r a i n i n g         in

technique i s v i t a l , i t i s however not s u f f i c i e n t .            Match Commanders need

to develop a complete s tr a t e g y with a suggested th re e o b je c tiv e s in mind:



(i)            the development of i n t e l l i g e n c e about home and away groups;
  (li)              the t a r g e t t i n g o f known hooligan gangs and the development of
 evidence a g a in s t them;



  (iii)            the     general       raising        of behavioural               th resh olds    by a s s e r t i v e
 enforcement a g a in s t unacceptable behaviour.



                   A comprehensive s t r a te g y would involve the following sta g es.



                  The appointment                of    an    I n te ll ig e n c e    O fficer     rsponsible        for

 directing         the      o ptical       evidence           gathering             team    and     co -ordinating
 i n t e l l i g e n c e m atters.



                  0n     match        days,      the        appointment         of     a   "Director"         to     be

responsible          for     the      o ptical        evidence      gathering         team and s p e c i f i c a l l y
d i r e c t i n g them when and where to film.



(c)                        development           and    enhancement           of     equipment      fo r    optical

evidence gathering.                  Existing fixed CCTV systems need to be brought up to

t h e i r o r ig in a l s p e c i f i c a ti o n s and the f a r more e f f e c t i v e p ortab le systems

used in support.             Likewise, s t i l l photography should also be considered as

complementary to o th er systems.                           (Conscious of the deficien ces in the

e x i s t i n g CCTV systems, a Technical Committee by ACPO has been s e t up to

advise on a l l fu tu re expenditure of monies from the Football T rust and a

member of SRDB has been made a v a il a b le fo r twelve months to a c t as an

advisor to the Committee and to Forces on t h e i r e x i s t i n g i n s t a l l a t i o n s ) .



(d)              An a r r e s t s t r a t e g y needs to be determined and designated a r r e s t

teams deployed i f ap p ro p ria te .                  For example, i f a dozen youths are filmed

chanting obscenely fo r long periods and perhaps a t several games, they
 should be i d e n t i f i e d to the a r r e s t team and th e re should be a plan to

 apprehend them by say ' f i l t e r cordon' a t the end of the game.



 (s)           The I n te llig e n c e O fficer should r o u tin e ly s c r u t i n i s e a l l video

and film        records     after       the   game,   reg ard less        of    the     outcome,   and   if

necessary develop follow-up e n q u ir ie s .



(f)            A follow-up        enquiry       team to       i d e n ti f y   target    hooligans and

c o l l a t e additional information should be p a r t of the s tr a t e g y .



                The tr a i n i n g courses held          to    date       have been evaluated and

re-designed, and the G.M.P. have taken on the r e s p o n s i b i l i t y of making

places a v a ila b le for both operators and i n t e l l i g e n c e o f f i c e r s throughout

England and Wales.           This i s l i k e l y to be an ongoing commitment.



                DEVELOPMENT IN CCTV



(a)            BACKGROUND



               The Football Trust i s a n o n - p ro f it making o rg anisation which i s

represented by Trustees from a l l areas of foo tball as well as from the

P o lice, local Government and the Football Pools companies.                               The Trust i s

t o t a l l y financed by annual c o n tr ib u tio n s from the Pools companies.



                In 1981 the T rust funded the purchase and i n s t a l l a t i o n of the

f i r s t p u rp o se-b u ilt ( f o o t b a l l ) closed c i r c u i t t e l e v i s i o n system(CCTV) a t

the ground of Aston V illa F.C. in Birmingham.



               The success         of    that    system prompted CCTV p i l o t schemes a t
  fo otball grounds in Manchester, Birmingham and Edinburgh.



               Following these p i l o t schemes the Trust undertook a prograrmte

 which was u ltim a te ly aimed a t i n s t a l l i n g CCTV systems a t every Football
 League ground in England and Scotland.



               To date the Football T rust has committed two m illion pounds to

 t h a t programme.   CCTV systems are now in operation a t every ground in the

 leading two d iv isio n s of the Football League and in the S co ttish Premier

 Division.      Progress i s being made in the remaining d iv is io n s where 81
 systems are now operating.



 (b)           PROBLEMS



               Unfortunately        these     systems    were    introduced     before    any

e f f e c t i v e evaluation could be undertaken, la r g e ly because of the p r i o r i t y

which      government afforded the s u b je c t of         footb all   hooliganism.      Some

experience was a t hand based on the prototype schemes in Birmingham,

Manchester and Edinburgh, and a f t e r c o n s u l ta t io n , a paper o f f e r in g general

advice as to the requirement was c i r c u l a t d d .      SRDB did l i a i s e with members

of the       ACPO Sub-Committee, but a t t h a t time they were not prepared to

endorse anything o th er        than    monochrome       systems.      The Service    wanted
colour.



              Based upon      the     views    of   match commanders     obtained a t     the

national annual conferences, organised by ACPO, the observatons of the

many o f f i c e r s who have been through the t r a i n i n g courses and ev aluatio n by

the members of the ACPO Working Party on CCTV and s t i l l photography, the

following d e f i c i e n c ie s are general across a l l systems:-
 (a)           The requirement was never                          fully     laid       down and was usually

 ambiguous.       No c l e a r    distinction               was made between the                   "evidence and

 i n t e l l i g e n c e gathering role" on the one hand and the "command and con trol"
 function on the o th er.



 (b)           The configuration of e x i s t i n g systems r e f l e c t s t h i s ambiguity.

The    compromise      usually      entails           that        n e i th e r       function     is   adequately
 fulfilled.



 (c)           The evidence and i n t e l l i g e n c e gathering r o le                    should have c le a r
p r i o r i t y whereas i t i s often secondary.



(d)            The technical            e f f ic ie n c y    of     the       systems,          particularly     in

r e l a t i o n to the e f fe c tiv e n e s s of remote control systems i s poor.



(e)            Almost the e n t i r e investment i s in fixed CCTV systems whereas

c u r re n t information suggests t h a t complementary CCTV/portable TV. s t i l l

photography systems are l i k e l y to be the most e f f e c t i v e .



(f)           Aside from those who have b e n e f itte d from experimental t r a i n i n g

courses conducted by the 6.M.P. fo r Forces in the North of England, few

operators     have received much tr a i n i n g                   of a technical            nature o r ,       more
im portantly, in technique.



(g)           Few Forces         have     evolved           any     s tr a t e g y     in   relation     to     the

development of i n t e l l i g e n c e or a r r e s t s , or in the post-match a n a ly s is of

films and the p o te n tia l of the system remains u n realised .
 I t i s a sobering thought, t h a t d e s p ite the in j e c ti o n of two m illion pounds

 by the Football Trust in to CCTV systems throughout the Football                                                     League

 l i t t l e has been achieved.                     As in d icated fundamental e r r o r s have been made

 either        in the equipment purchased,                            its     s i g h tin g ,    i t s maintenance,        its

 operational use, the r o le t h a t was being required of the equipment or a

 combination of several or a l l of these problem areas.



                       I t has been argued t h a t the very ex iste n ce o f CCTV systems in

grounds provides a d e t e r r e n t e f f e c t                       to     hooliganism.            Whilst tr u e     that

e f f e c t i s only l ik e ly to continue i f p o s i t i v e r e s u l t s are seen to come

from the use of these                         systems.          If    the equipment i s               not used,       or    is

o p e r a tio n a lly i n e f f e c t i v e i t s l i m i t a t i o n s will eventually become known and

the preventive aspect will quickly fade.



(c)                    TECHNICAL COMMITTEE



                       As a r e s u l t of the above problems,                              the Football        T rust has

e s ta b l i s h e d     a Technical           Committee to              advise        it       on the     technical       and

operational               aspects        of        all     a p p li c a tio n s     fo r     new      systems    and       the

enhancement of e x i s ti n g systems.



                       I t i s a n t i c i p a t e d t h a t the Technical                  Committee will        meet to

examine a number of a p p lic a tio n s a t a time and may well be able to resolve

some a p p l ic a tio n s on t h i s b a s i s .                In oth er c a s e s, i t would be b e n e fic ia l

fo r    ground           visits     to        be    made       to    give         advice        and   to   ev alu ate      the

performance of c o n tr a c to rs .                      I d e a l ly , these v i s i t s should include someone

with the e x p e r ti s e of Mr.Ford.



                       Andrew Ford from the S.R.D.B. has played a s i g n i f i c a n t r o le in
 reviewing the e x i s tin g CCTV systems i n s t a l l e d in foo tball grounds, and has

 been      instrumental          in    determining       the   most    app ro priate     options       and

 p o s s i b i l i t i e s fo r the f u tu re .    Because o f his considerable investment in

 th is    programme he now has                    a complete   knolwedge     of p r a c tic a l    p o lice

 requirements.            I t is      larg ely because o f his in s is t e n c e upon examining

 alternative         systems t h a t we are now recommending much g r e a te r use of

 po rtab le cameras as the primary evidence gathering source.



                   The new procedure a ls o o f f e r s a system of a c c o u n ta b ility which
 i s c u r re n tly lacking.



                   This revised procedure has been endorsed by both the Football

Trust and the ACPO Sub-Committee on Hooliganism a t Sporting Events and

Chief Constables a re to be asked to nominate a l i a i s o n o f f i c e r .



                 FUTURE DEVELOPMENTS.



                 As to the f u tu re , the most demanding issue i s the sheer growth

which can be a n tic ip a te d in the use of a l l kinds of photographic means fo r
i n te l li g e n c e and evidence gathering.



                Aside from the s u b s ta n tia l fo o tb a ll programme th e re i s now a

major extension of photographic usage in s i t u a t i o n s of public d iso rd e r.

Equally,      in     p o lic in g major demonstrations           and c o n fro n ta tio n s ,     and in

s u r v e i l l i n g areas of high crime th e re i s a marked uptake.                 Experience in

the cou rts has been dram atically p o s i t i v e .            Confronted with t h i s kind of

evidence defendants have been f a r more l i k e l y to plead g u i l t y ; f a r more

l i k e l y to be convicted and f a r more li k e l y to be s u f f i c i e n t l y sentenced.
             With        all    these       things    in mind,         the ACPO SubâCommittee on

Hooliganism         at        Sporting        Events      extended         its      work        in    football

videoing      and        a    Working       Party      was     set up      to examine            the legal,

technical,        professional          and practical            issues       and    to develop codes

of best practice               and advice on usage.                  This report           is now almost

complete      and recommends             a wide        and     general usage of photographic

means in all aspects of police work.




             It     seems      inevitable that ever greater demands will be made

to evaluate new equipment and examine or modify kit for specialist

purposes.           This       is     particularly        so as      the      state of          the art     is

changing,     such that             there    is now much         greater versatility both in

terms of equipment and techniques.



PRIORITY




             On     a        weekly    basis for most           of      the year,          thousands of

policemen     perform          sometimes       hazardous        duty    throughout England and

Wales.        Only some 30% of the cost of police                       manpower is recoverable

and the       realburden            in terms         of lost    opportunity for other kinds

of policing is immense.                 The Service has achieved an enormous amount

and     in   most       cases       successfully         contains       these        public           sporting

occasions,        but    it has        to be    said that almost always there remains

a sinister potential                for savage         crowd violence.               A great deal is

being    done       to       develop        intelligence         and    attack          the     organising

elements,     but        we     can never be           satisfied         so      long      as        routinely

offensive     and        belligerent          behaviour        on the terraces                is manifest

and blatent.            The    effective use           of CCTV taken far beyond what we

have achieved           to date,       allows for         the possibility of the conduct

being    eliminated.            For     these reasons,           support       in all respects for

the   programme          deserves       a    high      priority.         If,     admittedly over a

period of some years, a sea-change can be
e f f e c te d in crowd behaviour the savings f o r the Police Service would be

enormous.             I f we do not make f u l l use o f t h i s oppotunity i t is l i k e l y we

w ill spend the next decade assembling ever l a r g e r numbers of men to stand

on guard between an assembly of troublesome hordes.

CONCLUSIONS



                     I t is not enough to develop i n t e l l i g e n c e .         There must be some

means of making e f f e c t i v e use of i t .             Equally, a s s e r t i v e enforcement t h a t

is not t a r g e t t e d on the main gangs w ill miss the mark.                     There i s a need to

bring to gether in t e l l i g e n c e and enforcement t a c t i c s .



                     The use of o p tic a l evidence gathering teams i s c e n tra l to both

these is s u e s .        Such equipment i s capable of producing compelling evidence

in     the      Courts     and    it    w ill   be   the    life   blood       of   most     i n te l li g e n c e

o p eratio n s.        T arg ettin g the hard core gangs has got to be c e n tr a l to our

purposes.            Equally, e f f e c t i v e use of CCTV o f f e r s the means to do something

about general th resholds of behaviour and enforce b e t t e r standards on the

te r r a c i n g .



                     Containment       is   preventive      but    co stly .        At     the    worst        it

maintains the peace w h il s t paradox ically providing the very environment in

which hooligan gangs prosper.                   We are dealing with organised c r i m in a l ity

which i s ongoing, not sin g le ev en ts, a l b e i t of unpleasant frequency and a

real      s tr a te g y of enforcement, based on i n t e l l i g e n c e and backed by the

professional use o f technical evidence gathering means,                                 i s the logical

Safety Evacuation

The need for the annual inspection of grounds covered by safety certificates
had been strongly recommended by the Sub-Committee, this had been endorsed by
Mr. Justice Popplewell in his final report. There was also a need for an
"expert" in each force who was fully aware of the provisions of the Home
Office Guide to Safety at Sports Grounds,(Green Guide) to advise during the
certification process. Mr. Phillips strongly recommended annual inspection
both as to grounds and stewarding.

Blackburn

Gates have fallen considerably. Early arrivals had caused some difficulties
but the main problem encountered had been with the all ticket rule for Leeds.
It had been necessary to allow entry to ground to 350 unticketed fans at
selected turnstiles.

Mr. Phillips said that the difficulties had been previously identified by the
Sub-Committee and it was hoped that the message had now got through that all
ticket matches were only practicable where capacity crowds were anticipated.
Brighton

Questions were asked about the policy of full pitch perimeter fencing.
Mr. Phillips summarised the ACPO view and pointed out where there was good
crowd behaviour perimeter fencing was not mandatory.

Crystal Palace

Ground sharing meant a minimum of 50 matches per season at the club doubled
the commitment of local Police. An encouraging factor was that club favours
were beginning to be worn again. Derby matches where there was ground
sharing were particularly difficult as each set of supporters considered
themselves to be at home.        There were also stewarding problems and
conflicting arrangements between the Clubs.

Safety Evacuation

The need for the annual inspection of grounds covered by safety certificates
had been strongly recommended by the Sub-Committee, this had been endorsed by
Mr. Justice Popplewell in his final report. There was also a need for an
"expert" in each force who was fully aware of the provisions of the Home
Office Guide to Safety at Sports Grounds (Green Guide) to advise during the
certification process. Mr. Phillips strongly recommended annual inspection
both as to grounds and stewarding.

British Transport Police

3)    The problem of evacuation was discussed. It was accepted that under
most circumstances the police would take control. Mr. Phillips referred the
meeting to the Green Guide Code and evacuation plans and the standard message
for evacuation at sporting events.

                       after considering             the ground conditions and the experience of
              fan behaviour.   However, it was generally agreed that pitch
              invasions should be stopped as they have the potential to
              degenerate to major disorder.

      f)     Evacuation - evacuation exercises were practiced at some
              grounds (Manchester United, Everton, Liverpool) where public
              announcements are made, emergency bells checked and all
              evacuation doors opened and checked by police. This does not
              involve the actual evacuation of the ground, but tests the
              mechanical parts of the system. At most grounds certain police
              officers are issued with universal lock keys.         Leicester
              reported on the electrically operated exit gate system and
              exercises which are practiced there with the fire and ambulance
              services to test call-out times.

      h)     Miscellaneous - many representatives reported pressure from
              clubs to reduce manpower levels. Mr. Phillips pointed out that
              it was a condition of the General Safety Certificate that the
              responsibility to decide on manpower levels was the Chief
             Constable's.

              At one club (Arsenal) ticket sales were allowed immediately
              after a game, this was not recommended as both sets of fans
              mingled whilst trying to purchase these tickets with obvious
              disorder potential.

Safety of Sports Grounds

Mr. Phillips stated that ground commanders should inspect details of the
certificate annually and submit recommendations for work perhaps to be
carried out incrementally so that it doesn't overawe the club.    Safety
requirements varied in accordance with changing patterns of use.

ChiefSuperintendent   Bruce, (Cleveland) stated that they had prepared a
maintenance and good practice schedule which he was willing to supply to
other forces.   The meeting approved of the booklet and found it to be a
useful reference.

Closure of Public Houses

It was suggested that where trouble is anticipated at certain venues,
consideration should be given to liaising with breweries upon the closure of
public houses in the immediate vicinity of football grounds.       Licensing
magistrates in York had at the request of the police ordered the closure of
certain public houses where trouble had ensued in the past.

  .   Bans Imposed by the Football Association and League

      Chief Superintendent Stainton (Cumbria) posed the difficulties in
      policing football grounds and fixtures which involve a visiting club
      whose supporters have been banned and arrive on mass. In order to
                              - 4 -


maintain ACPO'S policy of keeping out banned visiting supporters, the
cost of police resources were high. The repercussions from setting up
road blocks and keeping out banned spectators upon unsuspecting
neighbouring police areas, together with allowing the spectators into
the ground were discussed at length. It was acknowledged there was no
easy solution to this problem but unless excluded supporters were
confronted they would continue to travel. It was necessary to have a
plan to deter and contain them.

All Ticket Fixtures Imposed by FA/League

Chief Inspector Richardson (Durham) related experiences of difficulty
in policing football matches that had been declared 'all ticket' by the
FA/League without consulting the relevant police force as to whether
such a restriction could be enforced successfully. Small clubs do not
apply these restrictions rigidly because of their financial position.
Therefore he requested that ACPO consult with the authorities on this
subject.

      The meeting was chaired by K.Evans Esq., A ssistant Chief Constable,
West Midlands Police, J .D .P h illip s Es<^., A ssistant Chief Constable,
Greater Manchester Police, acted as Secretary.

      Attendance was        in accordance with the l i s t c ir c u la te d a t the

meeting by welcoming rep re s e n ta tiv e s and outlin in g the h istory and purpose
of the Conference.

ITEMS FROM SECOND DIVISION CONFERENCE

      Mr. P h illip s appraised the Conference of the main points discussed
at the Second Division Conference held at Hendon on 28/29th May 1986.

In te llig e n c e

        This to p ic had generated much discussion.             The Football Match
Summary had been well accepted and th e re was s a t is f a c ti o n with th e format.
Regrettably th e re wasgreat d is p a r it y in         the standard of information
supplied. There had also been a suggestion for a Central Clearing House
for in t e ll ig e n c e and Mr. P h ill ip s sought the views of the Conference on
t h i s m atter.       The Conference was against t h i s suggestion.     There was a
danger t h a t a bureaucracy could be created to c o l le c t information which
would be quickly out of d ate.                  The need for up to d ate, precise
information was recognised and i t was f e l t th a t the current system was the
best method.
C.C.T.V

          There had been general agreement t h a t the use of CCTV had proved
be n e fic ia l in reducing le v e ls of d is o r d e r .        Superintendent George
Gallaghan from Huddersfield had given a p resentation h ig hlig hting the
p o te n tia l wide use of CCTV for i n te lli g e n c e r o le a t the Second Division
Conference and Mr. P h illip s indicated t h a t under th e auspices of the
Sub-Committee guidance was being e s ta b lis h e d for eventual c i r c u l a t i o n .

T ravelling sp otters
           There had been much disc u ssio n on th e use of t r a v e l l i n g s p o tte r s
which had been pioneered by Portsmouth and i t was apparent t h a t the use of
s p o tte r s was becoming widespread. The views of the Conference on the use
of s p o t te r s was sought and th e r e was general support for t h e i r use. The
problem of c o sts was recognised although i t was suggested t h a t the
e f f e c ti v e use of s p o tte r s could reduce overall c o s ts in th e long term. It
becane apparent t h a t th e re were several versions of the scheme and th e re
was some concern properly expressed as t o whether s p o t te r s t r a v e l l i n g as
policemen with away fans or simply t r a v e l l i n g to l i a i s e with the Home
O ffice.         The B r itis h Transport Police were unhappy with th e prospect of
police o f f i c e r s o ther than t h e i r own f u l f i l l i n g a p olice r o le on the
railway system.             Equally th e dangers of o f f i c e r s being recognised and
I so la te d by hooligan groups was a dangerous p o s s i b i l i t y .        Mr. P h illip s
Indicated t h a t these Issues would be addressed as the e x is tin g guidance 1n
 the Public Order Manual on Football Hooliganism was being up-dated.
 ACPO BUSINESS                ;

       Mr. P h illip s then reviewed the business of the ACPO Sub-Committee on
 Hooliganism a t Sporting Events.

 Alcohol Act

             Overall the e f f e c ts of the le g i s l a ti o n had been b e n e f ic i a l. The
 l e g i s l a ti o n had been rushed through so th ere were d efic ie n c e s . Amendments
 t o the Act in the Public Order Bill will widen I t s scope to cover priv ate
 h ir e mini coaches and were welcomed.                 Representatives discussed t h e i r
 reactio n s to the l e g i s l a ti o n and Clubs which were dry and those which were
 co n tro lle d sta te d th a t th ere had been an improvement.           There was s t i l l
 some differen ces of opinon as to banning of alcohol but i t was so
 acknowledged th a t the l e g i s l a ti o n allowed for whatever level of control
 was considered most appro p riate.

 C.C.T.V.

         The use of C.C.T.V. had been pioneered through experiments c a rrie d
 out a t Edinburgh, Manchester and Birmingham.                    As a r e s u l t of these '
E xperim ents the Sub-Committee had been able t o advise both the Football-yy
^Tfust and the Department of the Environment regarding i t s i n s t a l l a t i o n and â
 u se.    There was no standard package as i t was recognised, th a t system s......
 needed t o be ground s p e c i f i c . Mr. P h ill ip s indicated t h a t w h ilst we have
 achieved i n s t a l l a t i o n we have properly not yet le a r n t how to make the best
 use of the equipment. He intended to approach the Chairman (Mr. Attderton) ...

members had been involved in working groups and meetings with numerous

encouraged.               Mr. Ju s tic e Popplewell had come to t h i s view 1n h is f in a l
report.

       There were several reasons why t o t a l sqhemes had been seen as
unworkable but the main d i f f i c u l t y from the Police point of view was the
problem of Â£ltember c e r t i f i c a t i o n and th e c o n f i d e n t i a l i t y of (K ^ jc e %

       The issue depended in p art of the outcome of Harris v Sheffield
 United Football Club which had gone to appeal.
 Safety Evacuation

              The need for the annual inspection of grounds covered by safety
 c e r t i f i c a t e s had been strongly recommended by the Sub-Committee, t h i s had
 been endorsed by Mr. Ju stice Popplewell in his final r e p o rt.             There was
 also a need for an "expert" in each force who was f u lly aware of the
 provisions of the Home Office Guide to Safety a t Sports Ground (Green
 Guide) to advise during the c e r t i f i c a t i o n process. Mr. P h illip s strongly
 recommended annual inspection both as to grounds and stewarding.

 REVIEW OF CROWD BEHAVIOUR


          Mr. P h ill ip s appraised the Conference of the a r r e s t figures which
showed a decrease of about 50%. I t was acknowledged t h a t a r r e s t fig u res
were not an accurate gauge of d iso rd er and the Conference were asked for
t h e i r views. There was a general opinion t h a t post Heysel th ere had been
a down turn in tro u b le but th a t by the end of the season there were the
beginnings of the old h o s t i l i t i e s . Mr. Evans f e l t th a t the Police would
need to continue 1n a very firm approach to policing before we can be
confident th e r e was any 'sea change'.

Behaviour Inside around.

             I t was generally f e l t t h a t the improvement Inside the ground was
a t t r i b u t a b l e to the Alcohol l e g i s l a ti o n and the widespread use of
C.C.T.V.and the general mood following the trag ed ies of the previous
season.              Although the Newcastle re p re s e n ta tiv e pointed out t h a t the
alcohol l e g i s l a ti o n had played no p a r t 1n the improvement 1n the lev e ls of
behaviour in sid e S t. James's Park as th e Ground had been t o t a l l y 'd r y ' for
some y e a r s . They saw the reduction 1n a r r e s t s as d i r e c t l y a t t r i b u t a b l e to
a large reduction 1n the numbers of v i s i t i n g supp o rters.                                  The
re p re s e n ta tiv e from Manchester City spoke of the use of a 'No Mans' land
which they had been able to operate a t the ground. This had the e f f e c t of
maintaining a gap of a t le a s t 35 yards between home and away supporters
and had played a s i g n i f i c a n t ro le 1n th e reduction of d isorder although 1t
was recognised t h a t such a t a c t i c could only be used when crowds were less
than cap acity .


Behaviour outside grounds and away from stadium.


             I t was f e l t t h a t the standard of behaviour outside stadiums had
improved 1n lin e with t h a t in sid e th e r e was an increasing awareness of
tro u b le away from the ground with in cid en ts such as ambushing v i s i t i n g

  Powers o f search

              Mr. P h il li p s opened discussion on t h i s item by o utlinin g the ACPO
  view. There was an urgent need for a s ta tu t o r y power t o search both a t
  and away from grounds.                  The Sub-Committee had c o n s iste n tly pressed fo r ;
  t h i s and had been strongly sMPPorted by Mr. J u s t ic e Popplewell in his
  fin a l r e p o r t. On the question of searching under the ground r e g u la tio n s - --
  Mr. P h i lli p s added t h a t t h i s 'power' was extremely tenuous and th a t legal

HOOLIGANISM ON PUBLIC TRANSPORT.

           Ian McGregor, A ssistant Chief Constable, Operations, B.T.P. gave
video presentation on the BTP in re la tio n to football outlining t h e i r
in t e lli g e n c e role both n a tio n a lly and for games played abroad.        He
emphasized th a t B ritish Rail was a commercial organisation whose main aim
was to operate at a p r o f i t .      The co-ordinating ro le of B ritish Transport
Police and t h e i r willingness to provide what have proved to be excellent
in te ll ig e n c e was outlined in some d e t a i l . Mr. Evans thanked the B ritish
Transport Police for t h e i r a s sista n c e to Forces and encouraged greater
exchange of information a t a local le v e l.

RETROSPECTIVE ARRESTS.

        The Conference then reviewed a presentation      on the incidents a t
Birmingham and Heysal from Deteclve Inspector Ross, West Midlands Police
and Detective Chief Inspector Wright, Merseyside Police, o utlining the
methods used to detect offenders a t the two in c id e n ts . It was apparent
t h a t video evidence had been used to good e f f e c t and had resu lted in
numerous convictions in the use a t the Birmingham in c id e n t. The Heysal
Inquiry was not yet complete.

           There were several points of good p ra c tic e which come to notice as a
r e s u l t of the en q u iries.

       Mr. P h illip s indicated th a t the lessons le a r n t by the Merseyside and
West Midlands Police         would be beneficial to a ll and t h a t they wouldbe
consulted by the Working Group previously r e fe rre d to when a package was
put to g e th e r.

SPORTING EVENTS (CONTROL OF ALCOHOL) ACT

           The l e g i s l a ti o n had been I d e n t if ie d e a r l i e r as having a beneficial
e f f e c t on lev e ls of d is o r d e r . Members views were sought on p rac tic e s 1n
r e la t io n to the Act.            Some members f e l t very strongly th a t there should
be a t o t a l ban even to the extent t h a t agreement should be sought of
r e t a i l o u t l e t s outside grounds not to supply alcohol on matchday.                    The
m ajority however favoured c o n tr o l. I t was pointed out t h a t i f alcohol is
banned Inside the ground people drink outside and do not go into the
ground u n t i l the l a s t minute. Where th e re i s no alcohol in the v i c i n i t y
of the ground fans will go away from the ground even to the extent in
c e r ta in circumstances of drinking 1n another Force area and so becoming a
po ten tial problem for a Force who has no r e s p o n s i b ilit y for policing the
footb all match. Mr. P h il lip s said t h a t i t was fo r p r e c ise ly these reasons
th a t the ACPO had favoured control as opposed to bans. He also pointed
out t h a t th e r e was no evidence based on a r r e s t fig u res t h a t a to t a l ban
was more beneficial than c o n tr o l.

LUTON TOWN MEMBERS SCHEME

       Chief Superintendent Spalding of the Bedfordshire Police outlined
th e proposed Members Plan to be introduced a t Luton Town f o r the season
1986/87. The scheme i s designed to ban away support and has the backing
of the Bedfordshire P olice.   The system 1s to be computerised and will
allow members only to attend tog eth er g1th a lim ited number of accredited
g u ests. To f a c i l i t a t e the system the capacity had been reduced to 14,000
and crowd segregation was impossible. The catchment area for membership
ap plication had been c le a r ly defined and any applicant from outside th at
area would have to provide proof th a t he was a supporter of Luton Town.
In addition any members who did not attend on a regular basis would be
i d e n t i f ie d by the computer and membership would be withdrawn.

      I t was an ticip ated t h a t the club would have approximately 30,000
members by the s t a r t of the season.    The Club were determined th a t the
scheme would succeed to the extent th a t they were w illing to play all F.A.
Cup games in the future away from home.         The as sista n c e of all Liaison
Officers was requested in g ettin g the message across to o th er Clubs and
supporters clubs t h a t they would not gain admission a t Luton.

       Mr. Evans thanked Mr. Spalding for his presentation and said th at
all p a r ti e s would watch the experiment with great i n t e r e s t .

ANY OTHER BUSINESS

P o litic a l a c tiv ity in football
           PC Connor of the A8 Branch Metropolitan Police addressed the
Conference on t h i s to p ic . Following the trag edies of the previous season
the media had attempted to connect various p o l i t i c a l fa c tio n s with
diso rd er a t Football Matches. His en quiries with the relevant department
in his force revealed th a t th ere was no evidence of National Front or
B r itis h Movement involvement in F ootball.      Members concurred with th i s
view. There may be members of various p o l i t i c a l organisations who attend
fo o tb all matches but th ere had been no orchestrated e f f o r t to cause
d is o r d e r .

Transport B ill
         Mr. P h i ll ip s spoke on the e f f e c t s of the Transport Bill the
provisions of which will come in to e f f e c t in October 1986.                 The
Metropolitan Forces would be a ffe c te d and the in d ications are th a t
fo o tb a ll sp e c ia ls would cease to operate because they are not cost
effec tiv e .     The problems t h i s could cause are obvious and in Greater
Manchester th e r e were urgent ta l k s going on in an e f f o r t to preserve some
type of s e rv ic e .

Mr. Evans closed the meeting and thanked delegates for t h e i r attendance.

On behalf of a l l who had attended Mr. P h illip s thanked Mr. Evans and the
West Midlands Police for t h e i r h o s p i t a l i t y .

   NOTES OF THE CONFERENCE OF THE SECOND DIVISION FOOTBALL LEAGUE POLICE
     COMMANDERS AND LIAISON OFFICERS CONFERENCE HELD AT THE PEEL CENTRE
               HENDON, ON WEDNESDAY 28th MAY and 29th MAY 1986



      The meeting was chaired by J.S.E vans,E sq., Deputy Chief Constable,
Surrey Constabulary, J .D .P h illip s Esq., A ssistant Chief Constable,
Operations, Greater Manchester Police acted as Secretary and was a s s is te d
by Chief Superintendent Harrison, Hampshire Constabulary.

      Attendance was in accordance with the l i s t c ir c u la te d at                         the
meeting, the only club not represented, being West Bromwich Albion.                             Mr.
Evans opened the meeting with a welcome to a ll rep resen tativ es                              and
reviewed the tim etable.

CLUB REPORTS.
      The evening session was confined to input by Divisional Commanders
and Liaison Officers in respect of the individual c lu b s :-

BARNSLEY
No problems, th ere had been reduced attendances,                               re s u ltin g    in
reduced a r r e s t s and e je c ti o n s . This was a t t r i b u te d to CCTV
and no alcohol, the ground being "dry".

SHEFFIELD UNITED
Problems were encountered when police advice on routes for coaches for
away support was not followed. It was considered t h a t a c lo s e r lia is o n was
required with T raffic Commissioners in respect of routes and timing and a
p ossible prohib itio n of attendance at th e ground p r io r to one hour before
k ic k - o ff . I t was suggested t h a t the Commissioners be asked to consider
the inclusion of a clause in a licence for the n o t i f i c a t i o n of any
conveyance of supporter to football league matches.
(Mr. P h il lip s on behalf of the Sub-Committee on Hooliganism undertook to
consider t h i s issue but in l ig h t of the Transport Act f e l t there was
l i t t l e t h a t could now be done)
BLACKBURN

Gates have fa lle n considerably.             Early a r r i v a l s had caused some
d i f f i c u l t i e s but the main problem encountered had been with the a ll
t i c k e t ru le fo r Leeds.It had been necessary to allow entry to ground
to 350 unticketed fans a t selected t u r n s t i l e s .

            Mr. P h illip s said t h a t the d i f f i c u l t i e s had been previously
i d e n t i f ie d by the Sub-Committee and i t was hoped t h a t the message had now
got through t h a t a l l t i c k e t matches were only p r a c tic a b le where capacity
crowds were a n tic ip a te d .
BRADFORD

Problems had arise n fo r Bradford with no home ground and having to play a t
Leeds and Huddersfield which re s u lte d 1n additional problems fo r the
police with th r e e se ts of supp o rters. They are now a t OrdsalT, Bradford
u n til 1988, when       it   is   hoped    th a t   Valley   Parade    will    have    been
re -f u rb i shed.

Another issue of i n t e r e s t raised was the p osition when the local authority
were the issuing a u th o rity and c e r t i f i c a t e holder.

BRIGHTON

A 'S p o tte r Squad' which was introduced l a s t season appears to
have reduced problems both at home and away games.

Comment was made on the standard of behaviour by players and o f f i c i a l s of
c lu b s, and i t was suggested th a t cautioning of players by the Police for
bad behaviour be introduced as a policy. It was recognised th a t problems
may a r i s e a r is e i f the Police prosecute. Examples were quoted of v i s i t i n g
bench being cautioned th re e times in one match. This topic was extended
to cover match o f f i c i a l s and concern was expressed at the major v ariatio n s
in a t t i t u d e s to d i s c i p l i n e .

Questions'were asked about the policy of fu ll pitch perimeter fencing.
Mr. P h i l l i p s summarised the ACPO view and pointed out where th ere                       was good
crowd behaviour perimeter fencing was not mandatory.

CARLISLE

A problem had occurred when young programme s e l l e r s had been
robbed when outside the ground.    I t was recommended t h a t programmes be
sold only within the confines of the ground.

 Sponsorship under the emblem of the 'Sun Wheelers' (B ritis h National
Party) a t Hull had been received which allowed a d v ertisin g in the Club
programme before the connection was discovered.

Racist chanting appeared to be general amongst v i s i t i n g supporters.
I n te l lig e n c e rep o rts had not suggested th e r e was any r a c i s t a c t i v i t y
(although press comment d id ) .        I f th ere wasr a c i s t chanting i t should be
commented on in the In te llig e n c e Report.

Obscene chanting was s t i l l a problem and i t was suggested t h a t CCTV and
the âS potter System' could a s s i s t in i d e n t i f i c a t i o n .

CHARLTON ATHLETIC

CRYSTAL PALACE

Ground sharing meant a minimum of 50 matches per season a t the club and
doubled th e commitment of local P olice. An encouraging f a c to r was th a t
club favours were beginning to be worn again. Derby matches where th ere
was ground sharing were p a r t i c u l a r l y d i f f i c u l t as each se t of supporters
considered themselves to be a t home. There were a ls o stewarding problems
and c o n f l ic tin g arrangements between the Clubs.

I t was accepted th e r e was a need for discussions with th e FA on ground
sharing schemes, both present and proposed.

Mr. P h i l l i p s recommended a âre-cert1f1cat1on* o f grounds,              current    or
contemplating ground sharing schemes, to c l a r i f y usage.
An additional problem raised in discussion was 't h i r d force' elements, BTP
and local forces required d e ta ile d in te llig e n c e concerning i d e n ti f ia b le
groups (ostensibly not of e i t h e r club) v i s i t i n g games.

MILLMALL

There is a c u ltu re of violence associated with the Club.               They have a
measure of organisation with t h e i r own p rinted v i s i t i n g cards and revel in
an unholy reputation.

Troublemakers attempt to ambush coaches, or travel in vehicles alongside
and cause damage. One fan boarded a v i s i t i n g coach, threw bricks along
the c o rrid o rs inju rin g passengers.              Ambushes were well planned and
constant escorting is necessary.                  Recently at a match with a gate of
5,000, 450 police o f fic e r s were deployed and th ere were s t i l l problems. A
new ploy to draw police o f f ic e r s in , is mock f ig h ts and the lig h tin g of
f i r e s . Police o f f ic e r s th e re fo re are never in le s s than p a irs and remain^
in lin e of e ig h t.                                                                      *
 In discussion BTP commended the package deal fo r r a i l , bus and match
t i c k e t d i s t r i b u t i o n , which in the case of Millwall appears to reduce
aggravation.
FULHAM

No problems.
WIMBLEDON

No problems.

DERBY
DLF - DERBY LUNATIC FRINGE had caused some problems and the clubs s t i l l
enjoyed good su p p o rt..     Some problems had been encountered with special
t r a i n s , and esco rting fans to and from the ground due t o the distance
between the s ta tio n and the ground.                                         f

GRIMSBY

No major problems.

HUOOERSFIELP
No problems, A rrests had been considerably reduced.                   There    had   been
extensive use of CCTV for in te l lig e n c e purposes.

HULL
There had been noticeably le s s problems in Division Two than in Division
Three. The use of sp o tte rs and CCTV was advocated.

IPSWICH
Gates and a r r e s t s were down. Problems had only been encountered on a 'one
o f f 1 game with 200 away fans.

A proposal was made th a t J u s tic e s of the Peace be taken t o the games to
                                             - 3 -
  see the problems at f i r s t hand.
 MIDOLESBOROUGH

 Now relegated to the Third Division. In te llig e n c e has id e n tif ie d 200
 tro u b le makers, instances have occurred where they have tr a v e lle d to
 ground two weeks prio r to games to obtain t i c k e t s for the opposing
 e n d osures.
 NORWICH

 Ground is completely dry.      Problems have occurred in seated areas where
 fans have avoided segregation. Another area of concern were matches on
 Bank Holiday week-ends, when fans were inclined to stay overnight. The
 'S p o tter System' was used and recommended.
 OLDHAH

 No major problems.       All t i c k e t arrangements with Leeds had not been
 su c cessfu l. Also "Away fans" had avoided segregation by getting in seated
 a re a s.

 PLYMOUTH

 Newly Promoted - There was a problem in id en tify in g coach operators who
 carry supporters to away matches because of the extremely wide catchment
 a rea.

 PORTSMOUTH

The Conference discussed the in te rc e p t t a c t i c s used when Mi 11 wall played
a t Portsmouth.        Vi stin g supporters had been stopped from approaching
Portsmouth by in terc e p tin g them on the M3. No Millwall fans had gained
access.     These t a c t i c s require good lia is o n with B.T.P. Both Mr. Evans
and Mr. P h illip s had some reservations on t h i s as a general stra te g y which
might c re a te displacement of the problem when turning back large numbers.
There would need t o be special circumstances.
READING

No problems.

SHREWSBURY

The use of CCTV was advocated. Video evidence had been used su c cessfully
to obtain con victions. Good lia is o n with Middlesborough,had produced 30
plus a r r e s t s on video. On conviction the M agistrates had imposed fin es of
Â£2,000 p lu s.         There was a "no e je c tio n s p o licy ", a ll offenders being
a r r e s te d . Mr. Evans pointed out t h a t i f detained persons were subsequently
not charged t h i s d if fe r e d l i t t l e from e je c ti o n .
STOKE

Both crowds and a r r e s t s were reported to be well down.                   CCTV had been
p a r t i c u l a r l y s u c c e ss fu l. The Conference was then informed of the
'Matchmates System' which had been operating a t Stoke for several y e a r s .
The idea was t o encourage young people and fam ilie s to attend matches by
involving them in pre-match a c t i v i t y .         I t was a n tic ip a te d t h a t e f f o r t s

                                                  -4-
would be made to widen the scope of the system to other clubs.
 SUNDERLAND

Spotters had been used for s p e c ific games and had been successfu l. Sane
alcohol had been available a t the grounds and had not caused a problem.
The need for a s ta tu to ry power of search on entry was raised .

WEST BROMWICH ALBION

No input.

The meeting was adjourned u n til 9.00 am. Thursday 29th May 1986.


Mr. P h i lli p s opened the second meeting on Thursday 29th May 1986, with
a review of the business of the        ACPO Sub-Committee on Hooliganism at/fi
Sporting Events.

The main issues discussed were

ALCOHOL ACT

Overall the e f f e c t s of the Sporting Events (Control of Alcohol) Act 1985
appear t o have been b e n e f ic i a l. Amendments to the Act contained in the
Public Order Bill which widen i t s scope to cover p riv a te h ir e mini-coahces
were welcomed and should be on th e s t a t u t e books for the s t a r t of the new
season.

I t should also be noted t h a t , as f a r as a r r e s t s in d ic a te d , control              of
alcohol a t grounds had produced the same r e s u lt s as to t a l bans.


CCTV
The use of CCTV had been pioneered through experiments a t Edinburgh,
Manchester and Birmingham and as a r e s u l t the Sub-Committee had had a ^ i
major input by way of advice to both the Department of the Environment a n d ^ r
the Football Trust regarding i t s i n s t a l l a t i o n and use. There was no
standard package as i t was recognised t h a t each ground had i t s own special
fe a tu res and each system had to be ground s p e c if i c .

The 'Hoolivan1 had produced lim ited r e s u l t s and the                   lack of speed in pan
and t i l t r e s t r i c t e d I t s value. Whilst i t may have            had some preventative
e f f e c t I n i t i a l l y i t was f e l t t h a t t h i s had quickly     diminished.      I t was
accepted t h a t i t was not designed fo r football and                     t h a t i t s best use in
r e l a tio n to football was probably a t s t a t i c points               such as bus and r a il
sta tio n s.

IDENTIFICATION CARDS AND SCHEMES

Members of the Sub-Committee had taken p a r t In a Football League Working
Group on Membership schemes which had concluded t h a t t o t a l membership
schemes were f e a s i b l e . This had confirmed the previously held ACPO view.
I t had a ls o been noted t h a t although In h is Interim rep ort Mr. J u s tic e
Popplewell had recommended such schemes th e f i n a l report recommended 'some
form1 of membership schemes. This f e l l Into l in e with th e ACPO view t h a t
in c lu siv e or family club schemes should be encouraged.

There were several reasons why to t a l schemes had been seen as unworkable
but the most serious d i f f i c u l t y had been the problem of member
v e r i f i c a t i o n . Only the Police were in a p ositio n to verify the bona-fides
of a p p lican ts and determine who, because of convictions say, should be
excluded, but c le a r ly such information was held c o n f id e n tia lly .
It was noted t h a t Luton Town are to introduce a t o ta l scheme for the
1986/87 season and t h i s would be watched with i n t e r e s t .

SEARCHING
The Sub-Committee had frequently and c o n s iste n tly voiced t h e i r d isq u ie t a t
the lack of a sta tu to r y power to search. They had been supported in t h e i r
stance by Mr. J u s tic e Popplewell in his final report although the
Government had as yet taken no action in respect of t h i s recommendation.
Whilst the Football League had included searching as a condition of entry
in i t s Ground Regulations legal opinion was t h a t Ground Regulations would
give l i t t l e protection in law to the o f f i c e r s . .
 In addition to problems a t grounds the lack of a power to search fans in
t r a n s i t or a t Railway Stations also caused d i f f i c u l t i e s .

POLICE CHARGES
This m atter is cu rrently the subject of a review by the Sub-Committee as a
need had been id e n ti f ie d for a move towards a common approach in respect
of charges.           I t had been recognised t h a t Football Clubs do t a l k to each
other and in times of financial hardship were looking a t a l l ways of
c u ttin g c o s ts .
The issue depended in part on the outcome of Harris -v- Sheffield United
F.C. which had gone to appeal.

SAFETY EVACUATION
The need for the annual inspection of grounds covered by safety
c e r t i f i c a t e s had been strongly recommended by the Sub-Committee, t h i s had
been endorsed by Mr. J u s tic e Popplewell in his final r e p o rt. There was
also a need f o r an âexpert" in each force who was f u lly aware of the
provisions of the Home Office Guide t o Safety a t Sports Grounds (Green
Guide) to advise during the c e r t i f i c a t i o n process. Mr. P h il li p s strongly
recommended annual inspection both as to grounds and stewarding.

A video film of the Bradford f i r e was shown a t t h i s sta g e . At the
conclusion Mr. Evans expressed the condolences of a l l the o f f i c e r s
p r e s e n t.
USE OF CCTV
Superintendent Callaghan gave an update on the use of CCTV in West
Yorkshire in d ic a tin g t h a t th e re had been noticeably fewer problems during
the season.                  Troublemakers had been banned as a r e s u l t of video
i d e n t i f i c a t i o n and many troublemakers had been id e n ti f ie d a t away grounds.
He then made several suggestions as p o ints of good p r a c tic e in the use of
CCTV.

l)Crowds should be filmed even i f th e re i s no tro u b le .
This helps to form a p a tt e r n .




                                              -6-
2)For evidential purposes record a ll cameras simultaneously.

3)Take s t i l l photographs inside the ground.

4 ) Id e n tific a tio n marks in grounds a s s i s t with exact locations.

5)Disguise is now being used to avoid detection by video including
fancy d re ss , face painting and m u lti-clo th es swapping.

6)The lack of a retro s p e c tiv e power of a r r e s t fo r Section 5 Public
Order Act was a d i f f i c u l t y . The Sub Committee had pressed for t h i s to be
included in the Public Order Bill and were supported by Popplewell but
without success.
7)Consider showing a r r e s tin g o f f ic e r the tape before he completes
his evidence.
8)Lighting at the rear of stands with fla sh f a c i l i t y , controlled
by the o f f i c e r in charge in the Police Control Box can be put
on, and a t times stops crowd reaction or d iso rd e r.


Mr. Callaghan also said t h a t research was required on tape cleaning for
inciden tal purposes th ere was a need fo r a tape exchange system.

Mr. P h illip s said the amended section in the ACPO guidelines would include
guidance and CCTV and hoped t o get tog eth er the best information on
ev id en tial use of film .

SEARCHING TACTICS
Chief Superintendent Bruce, Cleveland Constabulary spoke on police
t a c t i c s , re searching.             The system in Cleveland r e l i e s on accurate
in te l li g e n c e to i n s t i t u t e stop check points to search for weapons in
vehicles e t c . , There was an urgent need fo r a s ta tu to r y power to search
awayfrom grounds. Mr. Bruce then appraised the conference of the P u b lic ^ *
Order In te llig e n c e Unit in Cleveland developed during the Miners' dispute,^ s^
of one Inspector, two Sergeants and six Constables.                 Much use has been
made of graphic d isp lay s.
SCHEDULING OF FIXTURES

Chief Inspector Fitzsimmons, West Yorkshire, introduced the to p ic of
scheduling of f i x t u r e s .   Re-scheduling of f i x tu r e s a t short notice had
caused problems.         Some c e r t i f i c a t e s did not include the provision of at
l e a s t 28 days n o tice as per the following.
(i)    âAt le a s t 28 days before a Specified A ctivity takes place(or
       such s h o r te r time as the Chief Constable may require) the
       Holder shall       n o tify the Chief Constable of  the Specified
       A c tiv ity ;"
(ii)   The holder shall make anagreement on his behalf and             on behalf
       of the occupier of th e premises under S15 Police Act 1964 to
       secure th e attendance a t the Specified A ctivity of such number
       of p olice o f f ic e r s as i s In t h e opinion of th e Chief Constable
       s u f f i c i e n t t o ensure decent and orderly behaviour a t the
       Specified A c tiv ity .


                                               7
          Mr. P h illip s said t h a t sim ilar provisions had been included
       in        G.M.P.         certificates       and     it   was recommended th a t a ll
       c e r t i f i c a t e s pay a tte n tio n to t h i s point.

GROUND REGULATIONS
Superintendent Dawes, Hampshire Constabulary addressed the conferences on
sta n d a rd isatio n of ground r e g u la tio n s . It would be beneficial i f ground
regulations could be standardised allowing t h e p o s s i b i l i t y of eje c tin g for
any infringement.          Home fans appear to accept control but v i s i t i n g
supporters objected t o th e local ground r u le s .          If th e regulations were
standardised a ll would know what to expect.
Mr. Evans said t h a t common ru les for the League had been achieved the
problem had been t h a t th e re was no uniformity of enforcement, mere was
often a case for e je c tin g people who had contravened ground regulations
but whose behaviour had f a lle n short of an actual offence. Such action
could often prevent the spread of tr o u b le . He recommended o f fic e r s be made
aware of ground regulations through b r ie fin g s .

INTELLIGENCE FORM - CENTRAL CLEARING HOUSE

Superintendent S tu a r t, South Yorkshire, then spoke on the
form and the p o s s i b i l i t y of a cen tral clearing house. The ACPO form was
e f f e c t i v e i f properly c o m p l e t e d , b u t h o n e s t y w a s needed wltn
interchange of information a t lia is o n o f f i c e r l e v e l . If the in);Â® !V jence
was inaccurate the r e s u l t was e i t h e r a waste or a shortage of manpower.

He then i d e n t i f ie d the problems of "crossroads", sp e c ia lly '
Yorkshire a r e a , where the t r a v e l l i n g fans meet a t service and other areas,
r e s u lti n g in d iso rd er.
A general discussion ensued on the in te llig e n c e system.

A member r e fe r r e d to the use of CS gas sprays which he had discovered by
chance and which a c le a rin g house would have i d e n t i f i e d . Mr. P h ill ip s
said the idea of a Central Clearing House had been looked a t but b asic a lly
i t was only the receiving Force who required day to day in te llig e n c e ( i . e .
numbers modes of t r a v e l ) .    The ACPO requirement i s f o r such unusual
in cid en ts to be reported t o the Sub-Committee, for discussion and
dlsemralnation by them t o a ll in t e r e s te d p a r t i e s .

 Concern was expressed a t long delays in the despatch of post match
 sumnaries. The need fo r prompt completion and ^ s p a t c h was; hi f l i g h t e d .
 I t was emphasized t h a t the q u a lity of pre-match i n d u l g e n c e o f t e n
 dependant on accurate recent post match i n t e l l i g e n c e .  There was also a
 need fo r close co-operation between lia i s o n o f f i c e r s .

 USE OF SPOTTERS
 Chief Superintendent Harrison, Hampshire updated th e ^ e t i n 9                    ^
  'S o o tte r s System as used a t Portsmouth. Travelling Spotters had been used
 a t 13 of th e 24 away matches played by Portsmouth and they                        *J1*

        on the question of t r a v e l l i n g by sp o tte rs in uniform.              He was of the

1. Opening Address




          Mr. Evans opened th e meeting and welcomed a l l            p resen t.      He asked

representatives,           when making t h e i r   seasonal    reports,     to     include the

f o i l owing



          (a)     membership schemes

        (d)          s p o tte r s



        (e)          problems



        (f)          any changes t o be recommended



2. Liaison O fficer Reports



        Contributions were made on behalf of a l l clubs on the 1986/7 season,

th e main p oints of i n t e r e s t being as follows



      (a)Membership Schemes - progress achieved in the required preparation

        of membership schemes varied from a f u ll                         scheme in force a l l l a s t

        season (Luton) t o no s t a r t made (Tottenham,                        Coventry and Arsenal).



        Luton,             who have a no away supporters p o lic y ,                      and a 100% home

        membership scheme,                  reported being able to reduce manpower le v e ls

        a t games four times during th e season to an eventual fig u re of 41

         (in s id e and outside th e ground).                      However,           membership cards did

        fall      in to th e wrong hands and i t was agreed t h a t photographs were

        e s s e n t ia l     on      such   cards     to     assist   in      th is     problem.Some    clubs

        had s e t up schemes which complied with League guidelines(Manchester

         United,            Everton,          L e ic e ste r) w hilst others were           in n eg otiatio n

        with      th e       âAppeals        Group'        s e t up by th e     Football League        (Aston

         Vi 11 a ,      Li verpool).



(b)      In te llig e n c e - i t was g e n e ra lly agreed t h a t in t e l l i g e n c e      fell   in to

         two d i s t i n c t types



                                                           - 2 -
       (i)     match information,              such as the number of coaches and

       sp e c ta to rs expected to tra v e l and, th e histo ry and

       importance of the f i x t u r e .



       ( i i ) i n te lli g e n c e about known tro u b le causers and,            th eir

       plans and methods.



       In a l l cases match information was found to be e x cellen t but many

       r e p re s e n ta tiv e s found the l a t t e r type of i n te l li g e n c e to be

       in su fficien t      (Norwich,          West Ham,     Derby,       Nottingham F o re st,

       S h e ffie ld Wednesday,           Coventry,     Aston V il la ) .      Because the police

       had become more e f f e c t i v e in policin g within grounds,                  i t was f e l t

       t h a t some of th e problems had been displaced and were occurring

       away from grounds w hilst 'f a n s ' were in t r a n s i t .               I t was generally

       agreed t h a t t h i s area of i n t e l l i g e n c e a lso required increased

       atten tio n .



(c )   C.C.T.V. - generally agreed to have had a p o sitiv e e f f e c t on

       reducing crowd d iso rd er within grounds.                   However, problems with

       th e systems i n s t a l l e d in grounds were i d e n t i f i e d - not enough for

       i d e n t i f i c a t i o n s (Newcastle),   cameras wear out quickly (Oxford),

       only black and white (Tottenham,                    Nottingham F o re s t) .     I t was

       suggested t h a t i n s t a l l e d systems could be supplemented by the

       âEvidence Gathering Cameras' (Southampton),                         or hand held video

       camera and s t i l l cameras (Arsenal,                Tottenham).         One club

       ( L e ic e s te r) used t h e c i t y c e n tre cameras, i n s t a l l e d f o r monitoring

       traffic      flows,         in      connection       with   th e     movement    of    fo o tb a ll

       supporters        through        th e   city .       This    had     received    much      local

       p u b l i c i t y and was accepted.          Another club (Nottingham F orest) had

                                                    - 3 -
sought t o use t h i s f a c i l i t y ,     but had been refused permission.



S po tters - th e use of s p o t t e r s ,       both overt and co v e rt,     was

welcomed by almost a ll r e p r e s e n t a tiv e s .        I t was agreed t h a t

s p o t te r s should not be sent without th e a u th o rity of th e ground

commander of th e host club,               but increased use was seen as having

a p o s itiv e e f f e c t on p o licin g d is o r d e r .   'P lease send me your

sp o tters,     I would love to accommodate them' (Arsenal).                    'Covert

operations have re s u lte d in a 100% manning reduction a t matches'

(West Ham).



P itch Invasions - seen as a problem by some clubs (Coventry,

Charlton, Q.P.R.)             and not by o th ers (Arsenal, Watford, West Ham)

who do not have any p itch perimeter fencing.                      After d isc u ssio n , i t

was agreed t h a t whether perimeter fencing should or should not be

i n s t a l l e d was a local decision to be made a f t e r considering the

ground conditions and th e experience of fan behaviour.                         However,

i t was g e n erally agreed t h a t p itc h invasions should be stopped as

they has th e p o te n tia l to degenerate to major d is o r d e r .



Evacuation - evacuation e x e rcises were p ra c tic e d a t some grounds

(Manchester United, Everton, Liverpool) where public announcements

are made,       emergency b e l l s checked and a l l evacuation doors opened

and checked by p o lic e .          This does not involve the actual evacuation

of th e ground,         but t e s t s th e mechanical p a r t s of th e system.           At

most grounds c e r ta in p o lic e o f f i c e r s are issued with universal lock

keys.       L eicester reported on th e e l e c t r i c a l l y operated e x i t gate

system and e x e rcises which a re p r a c tic e d th e r e with th e f i r e and

ambulance se rv ic e s t o t e s t c a l l - o u t tim es.
(g)   F ixture Problems - one ground (Aston V illa) was se le c te d to host a

      cup semi-final when t h i s was inappro p riate because of extended

      roadworks,         but t h e r e was no c o n s u lta tio n with th e police p r io r to

      th e d e c is io n .    Mr. P h i l l i p s explained t h a t the League had agreed

      to consult th e p o lice on a l l m atters a f f e c ti n g them.          If th e League

      were not complying with t h i s agreement then he should be informed

      of th e circumstances and he would take up the matter with them.                             A

      number of clubs had postponed games a t short n o tic e ,                  leaving the

      p o lice with th e problem of o f f i c e r s working r e s t days u n necessarily.

      I t was f e l t t h a t costs r e s u l t i n g from sho rt n o tice ca n c e lla tio n s

(h)   M iscellaneous - many r e p re s e n ta tiv e s reported pressure from clubs

      to reduce manpower l e v e l s .        Mr. P h il li p s pointed out t h a t i t was a

      condition of the General Safety C e r t i f i c a t e t h a t th e r e s p o n s i b i lity

      to decide on manpower le v e ls was the Chief C onstable's.



      Although searching was undertaken by o f f i c e r s a t every game (Q.P.R.)

      th e fans were becoming more devious in hiding weapons on t h e i r

      person.        Some clubs use metal d e te c to r s (Chelsea,           West Ham) and

      weapons have been found dumped o u tsid e th e grounds.



      At one club (Arsenal) t i c k e t sa les were allowed immediately a f t e r a

      game,     t h i s was not recommended as both s e t s of fans mingled w h ilst

      tr y in g t o purchase th e s e t i c k e t s with obvious d iso rd er p o t e n t i a l .

             Mr. P h i l l i p s suggested th a t th e past season appeared t o have been a

b e t t e r season than we had experienced for some time.                                     However,           i t was

d i f f i c u l t to judge and a r r e s t s t a t i s t i c s were not t o be regarded as an index

of      the problem             -   they may merely                 reflect        a change         in     the    acceptable

behaviour th r e s h o ld .                Policing       fo o tb all         is    becoming more e f f e c tiv e as

C.C.T.V. and b e t t e r i n t e ll ig e n c e s t a r t t o pay o f f .                   Organised football

game and developing s t r a t e g i e s t o out-manoevre th e p o li c e .                                 Atmosphere was

th e c r i t i c a l     factor      and perhaps th e               next     stage was              to     stop    concerted

o ffen siv e chanting and posturing and break up th e hooligan groups.                                                     The

problem of fo o tb a ll i s fundamentally a criminal problem and th e r e fo r e one

for th e p o lic e .


 (a)            Finance -           Mr. P h i l l i p s described t h i s as an "iceberg" issue as the

                enormous cost continued t o r i s e - p a r t i c u l a r l y in Regulation 26 and

                27 overtime.             Whatever the circumstances only a small p art would be

                recovered from clubs and then ,                          in most f o rc e s ,       t h i s did not

                t r a n s l a t e d i r e c t l y in to funds a v a ila b le to be spent on overtime.



                The f in a n c ia l iss u e was of growing concern t o P o lice,                             Police

                A u th o ritie s and no doubt a u d it o r s .                 There was l i t t l e p olice control

                over f i x t u r e s and programmes and we were being asked t o p olice

                f o o tb a ll       to   higher     le v e ls        out      of     e x is tin g        resources.        The

                opportunity cost of not doing ro u tin e p olicin g and depleted night

                       s h i f t s was becoming unsupportable.



 (b)          In te llig e n c e - Mr. P h i l l i p s pointed out t h a t a t th e Second

              Division Conference             th e re p re s e n ta tiv e s held strong views about th e

                                                                -    6   -
importance of increasing the level and content of i n t e l l i g e n c e .              He

agreed t h a t th e r e were two lev e ls of in te ll ig e n c e and t h a t the

second level was an area in need of considerable expansion.                        The

problems had spread from th e grounds,              sometimes in to c i t y centres

many miles from the clubs involved,              and often police commanders

were unaware of th e problems t h e i r team's supporters were c re atin g

w h ilst away from home.           There were strong arguments for a National

Football In te llig e n c e Cell as th e footb all hooligan i s involved in

much more than j u s t football d is o r d e r .



Spotters - There had been a very e n th u s ia s ti c              response from the

Second Division Conference for th e use of s p o t t e r s .              However,        as

they were of more use to th e host Force, he f e l t t h a t r e c ip ro c ity

was only f a i r .        The p r a c tic e was discussed in l i n e with document

"Policing F ootball".



C.C.T.V.- Mr. P h i ll ip s argued t h a t the primary use of C.C.T.V.

in s id e grounds was f o r evidence and in t e l l i g e n c e g ath e rin g .    In

t h i s regard i t was b e t t e r to cover the c r i t i c a l 25Â°/0 of th e ground

e f f e c ti v e ly than t o t r y t o cover a l l the ground and f i n i s h up with

poor     q u a li ty    recordings,         in su fficien t     for    evidence         and

in t e l l i g e n c e purposes.   He pointed out t h a t th e Football Trust may

have money a v a ila b le f o r th e enhancement of e x is ti n g systems and

t h a t he would w rite in t h i s r e s p e c t.     The use of video recording

was t o be extended to             Third and Fourth Division Clubs.                     All

re p re s e n ta tiv e s from both conferences found t h a t C.C.T.V. had had a

marked impact on crowd behaviour.
  Police Costs - A synopsis of methods of costin g had been c ir c u la te d

  t o a l l Forces.         This m atter was being f u r t h e r discussed by

  A.C.P.O..             Such problems as cancelled             fixtures,        sh o rt notice

  games and p la y -o ffs were d iscussed.



  Documents - two recent documents had been c i r c u l a t e d : -



(i)      "Directory of Coach Operators",                which will sh o r tly be updated.

         P ro p rietors had been made aware of th e reg ulatio n s and i f

        o p erators were not adhering t o them,               evidence of t h i s should

        be forwarded t o Mr. P h i l l i p s when he would take the m atter up

        with th e T ra ffic Commissioners.



(ii)      "Policing F o o tb all", (guidance on p o lic in g ) was c i r c u l a t e d and

        will       be included      in th e    "mini"     Public Order Manual          in due

        course.

        I t will be subjected t o annual review and views on th e document

        were requested.



Power o f Search - Mr. P h i l l i p s explained t h a t t h e r e were no routine

powers under P.A.C.E. and t h a t th e legal opinion he had obtained was

t h a t th e widely accepted 'power' under th e Ground Regulations would

give l i t t l e p r o te c tio n in law.        He explained t h a t th e Home Office

had been pressed on th e point but suggested t h a t i f t h e r e was a

problem in t h i s resp ect t h e p o lic e should provide evidence of i t .

In e f f e c t ,    u n til our p r a c t i c e was s u c c e s s fu lly challenged,   nothing

f u r t h e r could be done.
(h)       Permanent Correspondents - Each country in th e E.E.C. had now

          appointed a "permanent correspondent" to advise the appropriate

          p o lice contact of any club in his country involved overseas.




4. Exclusion Orders


          Inspector Harrison,         Greater Manchester P o lic e ,       gave d e t a i l s of the

l e g i s l a t i o n and procedure to be adopted in recording and r e t r i e v i n g current

exclusion orders and th e process of term ination of such o r d e rs .                      D etails

of t h i s procedure will be c i r c u l a t e d .




5. C.C.T.V.


          At l a s t y e a r 's Football Conference,        Mr. P h i l l i p s in d icated t h a t he

would approach Mr. Anderton (Chairman of th e Hooliganism a t Sporting Events

Sub-Committee),            with a view t o e s t a b l i s h i n g a Working Party i n t o the

Police Use of Video Evidence.               Members of t h a t Working Party were p resent

to    answer any questions           from those p r e s e n t ,   they a lso showed a video

explaining t h e i r work and produced a w r itte n                sectio n    in th e A.C.P.O.

Document ' P o l i c i n g ' .


          Detective Inspector Ross, West Midlands P o lic e ,               gave a p re se n ta tio n

of h is enquiry in to th e public d iso rd e r during th e Birmingham -v - Leeds

match on th e 11th, may, 1985.




                                                     - 9-
          Mr. James Aldridge (S.R.D.B.) asked fo r feedback on th e C.C.T.V.

systems i n s t a l l e d in the various grounds to help him a s c e r ta in a standard

t o compare other systems w ith.                         The early advice offered by S.R.D.B.,

although supported on technical grounds by Mr. Aldridge, was not considered

practical          by ground commanders.                   He also asked fo r th e impressions of

those p resent of the hoolivan.                        The reaction was almost t o t a l l y negative

and several (West Midlands,                  Metropolitan, Greater Manchester) advised Mr.

Aldridge t h a t they had forwarded evaluation re p o rts t o th e S.R.D.B. about

th e hoolivan.




6 . Membership Schemes



           Mr.    Phillips          highlighted         some   of    th e    problems       connected     with

membership        schemes       -    th e    casual       sup p o rter;       c lo s e ly   located     teams;

checking a p p lic a n ts ;          m u ltip le memberships;             m u ltip le ap p lic a tio n s using

d i f f e r e n t names;      tu rn stile      checking;         derby games.               The Police had

expressed concern as to th e v i a b i l i t y of the 100Â°/o schemes in many areas

and th e 50Â°/ 0 scheme had now been agreed.                          This may not be without merit

and i f th e clubs take up th e s p i r i t of th e scheme i t could help t o c re a te a

b e t t e r atmosphere in grounds.                     Whether i t works or n o t,           i s out of the

hands of the p o l i c e ,          but i t should be given every support.                      The present

scheme does not apply t o away support (a management consultancy firm i s

examining such a scheme a t th e moment)                            and so in       12 months th e whole

system may have t o be re v is e d .               Mr. P h i l l i p s pointed out t h a t 14 points of

guidance f o r membership schemes had been c i r c u l a t e d t o Forces from Greater

Manchester P o lic e ,          but because of th e general lack of knowledge of t h i s

d isp laye d by th e r e p r e s e n t a t i v e s ,     f u r t h e r copies were d i s t r i b u t e d a t the

meeting.          Mr. P h i l l i p s argued t h a t photographs on t h e membership cards



                                                          - 10 -
were e s s e n t i a l    and i f      Forces were finding t h a t membership schemes were

being     se t    up without           photographs          or c ontrary to       the    other   points    of

guidance then he would w rite to the Department of the Environment pointing

out t h a t the system needed tig h te n in g up.



           Mr. A.Norbury (F.8 Division, Home Office)                          suggested t h a t the po lice

should be aware of the p o s s i b i l i t y of the Football                         League using t h e i r

response,        i f too negative,              as an excuse for not complying with membership

schemes.




           He a lso           warned    that      Home Office         legal    opinion     was   that     some

c on ditions in General Safety C e r t i f i c a t e s were ' u l t r a v i r e s ' and t h a t such

co n d ition s should be d i r e c t l y r e la te d t o s a fe ty .




7. In te llig e n c e Gathering


           Chief Inspector Hoskins and Sergeant Hobbs (Metropolitan) explained

t h e i r system of i n t e l l i g e n c e gathering through covert teams attached t o th e

various London fo o tb all                clubs        ('Own G o a l').       They claimed considerable

success       both       in    r e tro s p e c tiv e    arrests    for    offences      committed   and f o r

a n t i c i p a t i n g and preventing d i s o r d e r .


            D etective Sergeant Layton (West Midlands) explained a s i m i l a r system

 used in h is Force and again was a b le t o claim a g rea t success in both

 areas.


            These inputs were received with much enthusiasm by th e conference


                                                             - 11 -
and t h e r e was a good deal of i n t e r e s t and d iscu ssion .



8. T rav ellin g Fans


         Inspector Temporal, B r i t i s h Transport P o lic e ,                       gave a synopsis of

the season,       s t r e s s i n g the increasing use of video recording a t railway

s t a t i o n s and showed a video tape to s t r e s s the p o in t.




9. Conclusions


         Mr. Evans summarised th e main points which had emerged during the

         conference.



         (a)     Most ground commanders agreed t h a t th e information

                 about,         and i d e n t i f i c a t i o n o f ,   t r a v e l l i n g hooligans

                 supplied by away s p o t t e r s ,               provided an invaluable

                 aid t o th e p o licin g of matches.                      Many examples were

                 quoted of s p o t t e r s being able to i d e n t i f y t h e i r own

                 c l u b 's hooligan element r e s u l t i n g in e i t h e r a r r e s t s

                 f o r offences already committed or p rev e n tativ e police

                 a c tio n .        I t was agreed t h a t the following points were

                 important



                 (i)           increased use of s p o t t e r s ;



                  (ii)         as t h e use o f s p o t t e r s i s p rim a rily of value t o

                               spotters)         t h e r e i s a need f o r r e c i p r o c i t y i f th e


                                                          - 12 -
                     system i s to succeed;



          (iii)      ground commanders of the host force must be

                       informed p r i o r to the match and consent to the

                     attendance of away s p o t t e r s .




    (b)   There are two lev e ls of i n t e l l i g e n c e : -



          (i)        match information such as numbers a tten d in g ,

                     v ehicles to be used e t c . ,             and



          (ii)       hooligan i n t e l l i g e n c e ,     known tr o u b le makers

                     a tte n d in g ,     weapons c a r r i e d ,     f la s h poin ts in

                     tran sit,          plans for violence e t c .



          I t was agreed t h a t th e provision of ( i ) was e x c e l l e n t ,

          but ( i i ) was i n s u f f i c i e n t .       Because of th e displacement

          e f f e c t of th e more e f f e c t i v e p o licin g of grounds,           th e r e

          was a tendency fo r tr o u b le t o be caused by fans in t r a n s i t ,

          often in towns or areas f a r from th e natural route between

          t h e two clubs.              To c o l l a t e , evaluate and disseminate t h i s

          nationwide i n t e l l i g e n c e i t was generally suggested t h a t a

          National I n te llig e n c e Cell was required.                    I t may a ls o ac t

          as a c lea rin g house fo r exclusion o rd ers.

            (c)     The increase in use of covert teams throughout the country

                    has produced a corresponding increase in the amount of level

                     ( ii) intelligence.               Such operations are the only co n s iste n t

                    source of t h i s i n t e l l i g e n c e ,      but without a central clearing

                    i n t e l l i g e n c e may be l o s t or u n d e r u t i l is e d .




            (d)     Most C.C.T.V. o perators a t fo o tb all grounds had only the

                    s k i l l s obtained by frequent use of the equipment.                            They did

                    not have the s k i l l s or knowledge necessary to obtain good

                    e v id e n tia l coverage i f disord er should occur.                        A training

                    course was required t o r e d i r e c t the a t t e n t i o n of these

                    operators away from overall p i c t u r e s of crowds towards

                    o b je c tiv e i n t e l l i g e n c e gathering in normal circumstances

                    and evidence gathering and i d e n t i f i c a t i o n s in circumstances

                    of public d is o r d e r .

1.    Opening Address

           Mr. P h i l l i p s opened th e meeting and welcomed a l l p re sen t.                        He asked

2.    Liaison O fficer Reports

           A ll Club Liaison O fficers present reported on th e ir experiences of
the 1986/7 season, the main points o f in te r e s t being as fo llo w s:-


(a)        P o lic e Charges -            the methods of fix in g               p o lic e charges were as
           various as the number o f P o lice Forces Involved.                              Some clubs use a
           season ally agreed formula (Grimsby), a p erio d ica lly agreed manpower
           le v e l (Stoke) or an attendance fig u re ra tio (West Bromwich A lbion).
           A number of others ca teg o rise matches dependent on the opposition
           and charge accordingly.                   One club (Derby) has I t s p olicin g b i l l s
           payed by the lo c a l authority and another (M Ulwall) a lso receiv es
      c o n sid erab le     f i n a n c ia l    assistance        from i t s      own a u t h o r i t y .     Two
      clubs ( S h e f f i e l d United and Portsmouth) have declined to pay f o r
      p o lic e d u tie s f o r some time, but in the former case the High Court
      have found them l i a b l e .


      No m a tte r what system of c a l c u l a t i n g the charges was adopted i t was
      g e n e ra lly agreed t h a t th ese charges went nowhere near to r e f l e c t i n g
      the actu al c o s ts of the p o lic e presence a t f o o tb a ll matches, and
      ( b earin g       in mind          the parlous f in a n c ia l       state        of    some fo o tb all
      clu bs)     a move towards                a more accurate charging                 system should be
      in itiated .


(b)   In te llig e n c e -       Chief         In sp e cto r    Hoskins      (M etropolitan)          made     the
      p o in t   that     th e re        are two l e v e l s       of f o o t b a l l   intelligence,          (i)
      number of coach es/su p p orters atten d in g from v i s i t i n g club and ( i i )
      a n t i c i p a t i o n of tr o u b le in t r a n s i t , c i t y c e n t r e s , p a r t i c u l a r public
      houses, e t c .        I t was g en e ra lly agreed t h a t th e co n te n t and accuracy
      of ( i ) above was very good except in the in stan c e o f s p e c i f i c and
      known       clubs      (Leeds,           Portsmouth,        Mi 11w all)       where      the     hooligan
      element refu se to conform to agreed ro u tes and coach p r o p r i e t o r s .
      These 'f a n s ' u su a lly tra v e l by t r a n s i t vans, ' r e b e l ' coaches or by
      r a i l , e n te r in g o r leaving the t r a i n some d is ta n c e from where they
      would be monitored by p o lic e .                        The a c tio n s of t h i s element f a l l
      in to      (ii)     above          and i t      i s in     this     a rea    that      the     a v a ila b le
      i n t e l l i g e n c e was not considered to be of s u f f i c i e n t q u a n tity and
      quality.


(c)   S p o t t e r s - both o v e r t and c o v e r t systems receiv ed a very p o s itiv e
      response from a l l             those p r e s e n t .       Many examples were c i t e d where
      o v e r t s p o t t e r s had quietened an unruly v i s i t i n g group of fans j u s t
      by t h e i r observed presence, and s i m i l a r l y many examples of tr o u b le
      prevented by inform ation sup p lied by c o v e r t s p o t t e r s were given.
      I t was n o t an uncommon experience f o r Forces using c o v e rt s p o t t e r s
      to be a b le to reduce manpower a t matches as they were already aware
      o f th e p o s s i b i l i t y of d is o r d e r and where i t was l i k e l y to occur.


(d)   C.C.T.V. - almost a l l l i a i s o n o f f i c e r s comnented favourably on th e

       grounds.          Many instan c es of a r r e s t s supported by video evidence
      were given, but the most s t r i k i n g e f f e c t s on crowd behaviour were
      seen      at     those        grounds         where     C.C.T.V.      had     most       re c e n tly    been
      in stalled             (Ipswich,        Bradford,         Blackburn,         Plymouth,           Grimsby),
      indicating             a p o ss ib le     'honeymoon'         e ffec t.        A number of              clubs
      (M illw all,           Derby,      Huddersfield,          Leeds,       Oldham          and   Birmingham)
      forward video recordings of t h e i r own known hooligans to clubs they
      are v i s i t i n g .      This was seen as e s p e c i a l l y h e lp f u l.


      In c o n t r a s t , th e 'h o o liv a n ' received a negative response, except as
      a visible          deterrent          in a reas         known f o r d is o r d e r ,    such      as c i t y
      centres.


(e)   P lqr-offs -            the o f f i c e r s    r e p re se n tin g clubs involved in the new
      p l a y - o f f system of promotion and r e l e g a t i o n had found the games
      r eq u ire d sp e cial         p o lic in g because of the emotive im p licatio ns of
      th e r e s u l t s .     All the games had              to be t r e a t e d as top grade f i x t u r e s
      with the consequent p o lic e manpower and f i n a n c ia l                             im p lic a tio n s.
      Mr. P h i l l i p s pointed o u t t h a t t h i s system of p la y - o ff s had been
      organised w ithout any c o n s u lta tio n                    with     the     p o lic e and as           the
      Football League received 50i of the g ate r e c e i p t s , i t may be t h a t
      th e f u l l c o s t s of p o licin g these f i x t u r e s should be borne by the
      League.


      Two clubs              (Crystal     Palace,       Birmingham)         had experienced f u r t h e r
      problems with th e p l a y - o f f s .                Neither club was d i r e c t l y involved,
      but both t h e i r grounds had been s e l e c t e d f o r the ' f i n a l s ' .                            At
      Crystal Palace no c o n s u l ta t io n s had taken pla ce with the p o l i c e and
      th e game had been arranged f o r a Friday n i g h t , a nig h t t h a t i s
      never used f o r games because of j o i n t c a r parking arrangements with
      a local supermarket.                 At Birmingham th e t i c k e t a l l o c a t i o n was s p l i t
      50:50,       giving 12,500 to both                       Leeds and Charlton             fan s,   although
      Leeds alone req uested 30,000.


(f)   All ticket Batches - th e s t i p u l a t i o n of an a l l                      t i c k e t match does
      not help p o l i c i n g u n less a c a p acity crowd a t t e n d s .                    Often t i c k e t s
      a r e obtained by one team 's fans f o r a r e a s reserv ed f o r the o th e r
      team 's fans with the consequent p o l i c i n g problems.                              To reduce t h i s
      problem i t i s e s s e n t i a l to p o lic e the t i c k e t sa le s a t both o u t l e t s .
      For the f i r s t game of the season, 2/3,000 Leeds supporters a r riv e d
      a t the Blackburn ground w ithout t i c k e t s and because of the public
      d is o r d e r p o te n tia l      were allowed i n .                This s e t the tone f o r the
      season f o r these fans and they fre q u en tly a r r i v e d a t away grounds
      in l a r g e numbers without money o r t i c k e t s in an attem pt to force
      the p o lic e ground commander i n t o allowing them admittance.                                           The
      meeting agreed t h a t t h i s was a d i f f i c u l t s i t u a t i o n to re so lv e , but
      felt      t h a t a firm stand should be taken and e n try                                 re fu s e d ,   the
      consequent problems                    o u tsid e    the      ground being resolved by p r i o r
      planning.              The p o lic e must be seen to 'win' in these s i t u a t i o n s .


(g)   Late k i c k - o f f s - another s i t u a t i o n where su p po rters were seen to be
      fo rc in g       the       p o lic e    into        takin g     actio n    against        th eir      better
      judgement.              I t has become in c r e a s in g ly apparent t h a t la rg e numbers
      o f s p e c t a t o r s are a r r i v i n g extremely l a t e a t the groud, t h i s may be
      related         to the r e s t r i c t e d access to alcohol                      in grounds        and the
      p r o h i b it i o n     on    taking       alcohol i n t o       grounds.           Because          of the
      p o t e n t i a l f o r d iso r d e r amongst those waiting e n t r y , p o lic e ground
      couraanders             have     o c c a s io n a lly      requested      th at     the     kick-off        be
      delayed.               I t was the opinion of the meeting t h a t t h i s pressure
      should        not be acceded                to      in   future,     the p o lic e        should not be
      d i c t a t e d to by su p p o rte rs.


(h)   T u rn stile searching - th e r e was no p a t t e r n adopted by Forces in
      searching          at      tu rn stiles,         some did       it   r o u t in e l y a t every match,
      w h i l s t o th e r s did i t a t s p e c i f i c matches and y e t o th e r s hardly a t
      all.       There was some confusion as to what powers the p o l i c e had f o r
      conducting such searches and Mr. P h i l l i p s explained t h a t th e re were
      none under P.A.C.E. and t h a t in h is opinion, th e widely accepted
      'power* under the Ground Regulations would give l i t t l e                                    p ro te c tio n
      in law.          He explained t h a t th e Home O ffice had been pressed f o r a
      r u l i n g but refused to be drawn,                          suggesting t h a t 1f th e r e was a
      problem 1n t h i s r e s p e c t th e p o l i c e should provide evidence of i t .

Association had agreed t o change I t s                             ru le s      regarding th e a l l o c a t i o n of
t i c k e t s f o r F.A. Cup t i e s .              Until th e schemes had been produced and had
been seen 1n use next season, l i t t l e more could be s a i d , but t h e s i t u a t i o n
required carefu l monitoring to avoid unenforceable schemes being f o i s t e d on

7.    Travelling Fans

                Inspector Temporal, B r i t i s h Transport P o lic e , gave a synopsis of
the season,           stressing      the      in reasin g use of            video      recording a t       railway
s t a t i o n s , and showing a video tape to s t r e s s the p o in t.


8.    In te llig e n c e Gathering

                S uperintendent McCrone and Chief Inspector Hoskins (Metropolitan)
explained          th eir   system of             intelligence      gath erin g      through   c o v ert     teams
a tta c h e d to th e various London fo o tb a ll clubs ('Own Goal1).                             They claimed
co n siderable success both in r e t r o s p e c t i v e a r r e s t s f o r offences committed
and fo r a n t i c i p a t i n g and preventing d is o rd e r.


                Chief In sp e cto r G a r r e t t , West Midlands P o lic e , explained a s i m i l a r
system used in h is Force and again was able to claim g r e a t success in both
areas.

                Throughout the meeting th e use of s p o t t e r s (o v e rt and covert) was
i d e n t i f i e d as an area of c on siderab le b e n e f i t , and an area of expansion in
most Forces.             For example, a t Leeds the use of c o v e r t s p o t t e r s , to g e th e r
with C.C.T.V.            re c o rd in g s , had r e s u l t e d in 19 persons being a r r e s t e d f o r
c o n s p ira c ie s and woundings.                At Ipswich, th e same combination r e s u l t e d in
24 persons being charged with unlawful assembly.


9.     Conclusions

                Mr.   P h illips   explained t h a t the use of p a r t i c i p a t i n g           informants
( c o v e rt     spotters)     was      in        order   as    long    as    they      plugged    in to     crime
o p eratio n s takin g p lace and were not involved in c r e a t i n g such o p e ra tio n s.
He agreed t h a t t h e r e were two l e v e l s o f i n t e l l i g e n c e and i t was th e second
lev el,         t h a t o f crim inal      activity        related     to    group membership based on
f o o tb a ll     c l u b s , which r e q u ire d expanding.             This i n t e l l i g e n c e was mainly
concerned with hooligans                     in    t r a n s i t between c l u b s ,    not usu ally       a t th e
grounds.          To re c o rd , dissem inate and process t h i s na tio n al i n t e l l i g e n c e , he
f e l t th e r e was a strong argument f o r a national c e n tr e .                            There was strong
agreement from the meeting f o r t h i s suggestion.


             Since        the         in ceptio n           of      P.A.C.E., Mr.          P hillips       suggested,
i n t e r r o g a t i o n evidence had to be replaced by 'caught in the a c t ' evidence,
which was i d e a l l y s u i t e d to C.C.T.V.                     He accepted the d i s t i n c t i o n between
reco g nitio n       (picking          out somebody you already                    know)     and i d e n t i f i c a t i o n
(picking out somebody only p reviously seen once and f o r a s h o r t tim e ), and
agreed t h a t we should co n cen tra te on r ec o g n itio n s from video recordings of
d iso r d e r a t f o o t b a l l .


             There was a stro n g ly i d e n t f i e d need from members of the meeting f o r
t r a i n i n g of C.C.T.V.            o p e r a to rs .      Mr.    P h illip s   thought t h a t the Working
Party might look a t t h i s area and come up with a t r a i n i n g package.


             Mr. P h i l l i p s asked the                 meeting whether they had found i t useful and
whether i t should be continued.                            There was a strong p o s i t i v e r e a c t i o n to
both e n q u i r i e s , th e only c r i t i c i s m being t h a t t h e i r own inputs had taken
too long.


             Mr. P h i l l i p s closed the meeting and thanked a l l those p r e s e n t for
t h e i r a tten d ance and p a r t i c i p a t i o n .

                            HELD AT R.A.F. CARDINGTON, BEDFORDSHIRE
                            ON WEDNESDAY/THURSDAY 1ST/2ND JUNE, 1988


The   meeting    was    chaired    by    J.S.    Evans   Esq.,    Deputy       Chief    Constable,    Surrey
Constabulary     and    Assistant       Chief   Constable      J.D.    Phillips,       Greater    Manchester
Police, performed the duties of Secretary.


The   only    club    not   represented    was    West   Ham     United.        Watford,    Portmouth     and
Chelsea      (relegated from Division 1).            However,      Middlesbrough,        Aston Villa and
Millwall (promoted to Division 1) had representatives at the meeting.


1.     Opening Address


        Mr. Evans opened the meeting,              welcomed all present and introduced Chief
        Constable A. Dyer, Bedfordshire Constabulary.


        Mr.    Dyer welcomed everyone           to the meeting.           He emphasised       the need     to
        critically examine         the current method of policing football matches                        and
        expressed his disappointment in the lack of support and evidence given to
        the Luton Scheme which had been successful in diminishing the hooliganism
        element in the ground and in the town on match days at Luton,                              and asked
        for officers        at   the meeting      to carefully         consider whether          the present
        method       of policing    football      matches   was       right.     He    conveyed    his   good
        wishes and hoped it would be a good meeting.


        Mr. Evans thanked Mr. Dyer for his warm welcome.                       He stated that the past
        season had been uncontraversial apart from the play-offs at the end of the
        season and the result of the trials of the covert operations in London.
        This presented a need for the police to address the way the hooliganism
        problem associated with football was policed,                     and gave an outline of the
        programme agenda which appeared to answer this point.


2.     Update of the A.C.P.O. Sub-Committee Meetings on Hooliganism at
        Sporting Events


        Mr. Phillips related to the minutes of the last meeting.                           The first point
        concerned an examination of the membership scheme and alternatives like
        the Luton scheme.
He referred to John Williams of the research group at Leicester University
studying these methods and pointed out the merits and disadvantages of the
alternatives to the present system.                      He pointed out that the problems of
football hooliganism did not only relate                          to this country,            but to other
European countries and even in China and Russia.


Mr.    Phillips       then expanded upon the options to policing football,                              i.e.,
continued containment and its cost; a far greater level of enforcement and
attacking target hooligans and gangs through intelligence methods, rather
than accept and condone the present standard of belligerance;                                       the Luton
Scheme with exclusion of away supporters.                         Other points being considered
by the Sub-Committee were               the membership schemes;                 reciprocal membership
schemes;       and covert operations discussed in more detail later on in the
meeting.       Mr. Phillips stated the Sub-Committee was                         preparing a document
on best practice in covert operations                      and the introduction of a National
Football Intelligence Unit which was presented later on in the meeting.
Mr.    Phillips       briefly    outlined         the    progress     of    the        working      party   on
C.C.T.V.,       hand-held       video      and    still     photography          and    highlighted         the
practical legal issues.               Photographic evidence gave dramatic results in
court    and    this was an         area    to be studied.           He mentioned policing                  the
European        Championships         and        B.T.P.'s       involvement            as     the     British
correspondent to the TREVI organisation; the Sir Norman Chester Centre for
football       research     which    was    largely       funded    by     the    Football          Trust had
circulated       a    questionnaire        which    was    supported       by      the       A.C.P.O.    Sub-
Committee,      concerning a membership                 scheme.     Mr.    Phillips          then expanded
upon    the    work of     the Football          Trust    and     in particular             in relation     to
transport problems in which the Trust were willing to help the police.                                      He
asked that Chief Officers should write to him if they had problems in this
respect.


Coach Operators


Inspector Provoost (G.M.P.) gave a brief overview of the structure of the
Traffic Commissioners and a resume of a sequence of events that led to the
publication          of   the   A.C.P.O.         conditions,       circulated           by    the     Traffic
Commissioners as a guideline to coach                      operators andlater questioned the
effectiveness of the guidelines.
He stressed the importance of co-ordinating the responses from football
commanders on the problems of causing coach operators to comply with the
guidelines, in order that a concerted effort could be made to bring this
to    the   attention     of   the      Traffic    Commissioners        who   may    then   provide
effective enforcement against rogue coach operators.


Match Information and Intelligence


Mr.   Phillips outlined the problems associated with football hooliganism
which related to "gang tactics" and "strategies" and questioned how well
the   police      knew   unruly    elements       that   attended       football    matches      on   a
regular basis.         He emphasised the need to form an intelligence system and
identify    the hooligans.           This could be done by using C.C.T.V.                   systems
effectively with trained operators, and surveillance teams.                         He questioned
whether it was sufficient to rely solely on a match information officer
and stated that the hooligans needed to be photographed and identified.
Intelligence was about knowing the structure plans,                      tactics, and identity
of the organised gangs who were creating a serious problem.


The point was raised that the problem does not often occur with the home
team supporters on their own ground or town, but whilst at away venues and
enroute to and from these venues.


The   use    of    spotters       was    mentioned       but    Mr.     Phillips     queried      the
effectiveness of this if an intelligence system was not fully established.


Covert Policing


Inspector      Exton     (G.M.P.),       highlighted          the     problems     and   pressures
associated with covert policing and stressed                        the necessity of properly
trained officers for covert work.                 Also how essential a welfare oriented
programme was throughout the operation, and especially after the operation
before the officer returned to routine police work.


He related the hooligans perception of the police and how they obtained
operational information from police officers at numerous football matches,
and   how   they    assessed      the    weaknesses      of    police    operations      under    the
protection of relative annonymity.
Inspector Exton also emphasised the number of crimes committed by football
hooligans which were not related to football by the police because the
time and location of the crime was outside match times.                                 Some incidents
exposed the vulnerability of police officers,                        poor communications and a
lack of interest of individual officers.


A video presentation showed an incident of a pre-arranged battle between
Manchester United and City factions some distance away from the football
match at half-time, which confirmed the organisation of hooligan gangs to
promote violence.


Constable Lloyd then gave a slide presentation on a hooligan gang who had
recorded     their   acts of     violence       and other       crimes      with    photographs         and
newspaper     cuttings      which    had   been      siezed    by    the    police.        The    slides
depicted the gang engaged in "battle",                      photographing their victims,                and
mixing with police officers.               He     also showed illustrations of how the
hooligans     concealed        their    weapons        emphasising         the    vigilance       to     be
undertaken     by    police      officers       conducting          searches,      particularly          at
turnstiles.


Mr. Evans summarised on the importance of good match briefings with visual
aids and hard core intelligence.               The merits of using police officers of a
particular standard for football matches and of using where possible, the
same officers in specific posts and areas of football grounds.


Superintendent Martin (Metropolitan), apprised the meeting on the position
of   the   recent    covert     operations      in     the    Metropolitan         Police       area    and
reassured the meeting that covert operations would continue.


C.C.T.V. Operator's Training Course


Chief Inspector Ross (West Midlands), gave a brief outline of the course
curriculum and explained the evidence gathering techniques taught on the
C.C.T.V.    and hand-held video operator's course and the area of conflict
that is likely to occur when the ground commanders require the cameras for
purposes    other    than    evidence      gathering.          He    pointed      out    that    trained
camera     operators    were    to     focus    upon    a    certain       area    until    they       were
satisfied they had recorded sufficient evidence.                           Ground commanders must
appreciate    that     incidents       could   not     be    captured      in    every part of          the
ground at any one        time and that it was better                    to record at least one
incident with good evidence.                    If the evidence was good, but insufficient
for an immediate arrest,                  then a strategy should be set out to record a
sequence of incidents committed by the same people on different occasions
in order to substantiate an arrest and be in a position to present the
evidence before the court.


Chief Inspector Ross then presented a video recording which illustrated a
comparison of video                recording by untrained and trained operators which
illustrated the benefit of training.                          Another video presentation showed
how the action of certain people in the ground could be monitored and used
as evidence, also identifying targets at close range with a portable video
camera    which        could    either     be    hand-held      or    mounted      on     a    tripod        in    a
selected part          of    the    football     ground.        He    stressed      the       importance          of
training officers to analyse video tapes and photographs after each match
to detect various incidents and to establish                              the identification of the
perpetrators.


Quality and Assessment of C.C.T.V. Systems


Mr.    Ford     gave    a    video    presentation        which      illustrated         the        faults    and
deficiencies of C.C.T.V.              installations at 55 football grounds in England
and Wales.        This was a result of a questionnaire sent to each respective
police    force        at    the    request     of     A.C.P.O.      in    order    to        ascertain       the
effectiveness of C.C.T.V. systems at each football ground.


The faults included interference                     from radio transmission,                 damaged film,
worn    film,    dirty       lens,    poor      maintenance,         inadequate      lens.           Only     one
recording was suitable for evidence gathering purposes.                                  69%    were barely
adequate for command and control purposes and in most cases they were of
little value.


Mr. Ford suggested a number of ways to improve the existing systems.                                          The
most   important        thing       was   to    have    the    cameras      properly          and    regularly
serviced.       A number of cameras needed to be remounted and resited and the
majority required bigger lens.                   He emphasised the importance of the care
of video tapes, correct storage and a limit on maximum usage.                                        He stated
that an answer to the problem, would be to use the portable video camera
on     display,        for     evidence     gathering      purposes        and     outlined         the   added
advantages of the camera.
C.C.T.V. Operational Systems


Mr.    Phillips gave a brief resume of the history of the installation of
C.C.T.V. and the inadequacies of the present fixed systems outlining                                               the
dangers of adding to these systems without expert technical advice.                                                He
recommended        the   portable video                 camera equipment            which was         on view and
stated it would accomplish the pictures required                                     for evidence          that the
fixed systems failed to produce.                             The portable camera would not replace
the fixed systems but complement them.


He    explained     that        the       A.C.P.O.          Sub-Committee          were   in    the      process   of
recommending to the Football Trust the formation of a technical committee
which      would    give    advice          on        the    best    practical        methods       of    enhancing
existing      C.C.T.V.      systems          efficiently            and    economically.            Mr.    Phillips
stated that it wasn't enough to rely upon improved video equipment and
trained operators.              He suggested a strategy should be adopted by ground
commanders in setting roles and training staff.                                     He emphasised the need
for    a     C.C.T.V.      team       with        a    director,          (where    possible        the    football
intelligence       officer)           a    camera       operator       and    a     photographer          for   still
pictures.       The team should be used in conjunction with an arrest strategy
by deploying an arrest team and a follow-up enquiry team for post match
analysis.       The arrest strategy would be dependent upon the video evidence
and other related matters.


Mr.    Phillips     added       it    was necessary             to    sustain       a reasonable          level    of
successful prosecution from video evidence to prevent the credibility of
C.C.T.V. diminishing.


Membership Scheme and Peat Marwick Report


Mr. Phillips gave a brief resumS of the membership scheme and of the Peat
Marwick Report of which the main recommendations in the report had been
circulated.        He stated the main difficulty was the configuration of the
football grounds and also that reciprocal schemes meant that grounds had
to be divided into segments which each required toilets, refreshment bars
and other facilities which were not always available.


An    open    discussion        on        this    subject       then       took     place      on   the    problems
encountered by various ground commanders.                              The points discussed were lack
of     consistency         in        the         schemes;       financial           implications;           minimum
requirement;        computerised      turnstiles;    logistical problems,         suspension of
 the scheme for major games; no interest from the clubs; the Luton Scheme;
introduction legislative measures and cost effectiveness.


Referees' Guidelines Violence On The Field


Mr. Phillips gave a brief summary upon the circulated paper containing the
guidelines which have subsequently been ratified by the A.C.P.O. Council.
The guidelines were produced as a result of a meeting with representatives
from the Football Association,             Professional Footballers'            Association and
the Referees and Linesmen Association in which concern was expressed as to
the different practices and standards adopted by various ground commanders
and    that    police      officers     needed      to   be   cognizant    of     the   Football
Association's disciplinary system.                Mr. Phillips said he had pointed out
to the Football Association that the police would not allow any other body
to have the right to decide to investigate criminal matters at football
grounds in England and Wales.


The guidelines were welcomed as a measure of uniformity of police action.


Issues Relating to A.C.P.O. Document 'Policing Football1


Mr.     Evans invited members at the meeting for their comments upon any of
the     items in the Policing Football booklet and added that there would be
an    update   on    the   C.C.T.V.     section     incorporating    the    availability     of
training courses.


Photographs


The question as to the authority for the police to take photographs of
persons ejected from football grounds was raised.                   It was suggested that
such authority could be incorporated in the club's ground regulations.


Spotters


Mr.     Evans stated there was a mixed response to this aspect and advised
that they      should only be used with the ground commanders approval.                      He
believed the system had merit.
Briefing


Mr. Evans stated that there was a need to remind officers of their common
courtesies     as complaints     are made     about    the attitude of some officers.
Suggested that a plan of the ground and immediate vicinity should be made
available.     Perhaps a laminated card with a plan of the ground on one side
and the ground regulations on the other.


Exclusion Orders


Problems were occurring, particularly in London where photographs were not
a requirement on the Court order.             It was suggested that where possible,
photographs     should   be    taken   at   arrest    centres   which   would obviate   the
requirement at court.


A recommendation be made for a minimum of 6 copies of the photograph to be
taken for distribution.


The meeting agreed that the exclusion orders should be for a minimum of
one season for them to be effective.


Derbyshire and West Midlands stated they had meetings with the magistrates
and Crown Prosecuting Solicitors reminding them of their powers under the
Act.


Debriefings


Mr.    Evans   pointed   out    that   debriefings      with    supervisors   was   vitally
important in order to improve upon policing operations.


Coach Operators


Chief Inspector Jordan,         (Metropolitan - Millwall), suggested the role of
the Traffic Commissioners should be included.
       Safety of Sports Grounds


      Mr. Phillips stated that ground commanders should inspect details of the
      certificate       annually and submit         recommendations      for work perhaps         to be
      carried out incrementally so that it doesn't overawe the club.                             Safety
      requirements varied in accordance with changing patterns of use.


      Chief Superintendent Bruce,            (Cleveland)    stated that they had prepared a
      maintenance and good practice schedule which he was willing to supply to
      other forces.        The meeting approved of the booklet and found it to be a
      useful reference.


12.   The Football Supporters' Associations Suggestions


      Inspector    Hammond      (Greater      Manchester)     informed     the   meeting     of     the
      suggestions the Football Supporters'               Association had referred to concern
      about the policing of travelling supporters in respect of retention of the
      away supporters after a match, and how it affected those who had to make
      their own way unescorted back to cars and vans parked away from a ground.
      Also a method of providing a liaison with the local police at the football
      ground.    These points were left for an open discussion.                  It was concluded
      that travellers should write to the clubs for identified parking places
      near to the ground and for the association to appoint a liaison officer
      and identify that person with a tabard or armband.


13.   Open Forum


      Discussions took place on the problems of the membership schemes and the
      Luton    Scheme    and   also   the    cost   of   policing   football     matches     and    the
      charges made to football clubs.


      Difficulties in respect of charges to football clubs were related by Chief
      Superintendent      Holford     (Nottinghamshire), who        were    aware    of   some    clubs
      seeking legal advice concerning the levels of policing at matches.                           West
      Midlands stated they were to impose increased charges to each of the six
      clubs in the force area.              Chief Superintendent Newlands           (Metropolitan -
      Arsenal), stated they had reduced costs as a result of ground improvements
      which reflected on a reduction in manpower to police the ground.                           Also a
      vast    increase    in   the number of stewards        would replace policing at              the
      ground,    whilst    a   police   contingent       remained   on     standby.       Derbyshire
explained      their    membership    scheme    and    the positive          effect    on    reducing
manpower.      Mr. Phillips concluded that he would appreciate any ideas which
could be suggested to football clubs for them to take the initiative in
reducing hooliganism at the grounds.


Intercept


Inspector      Payne,    Northamptonshire,      explained       the     'Intercept'         operation
they    had    introduced      at   the   Motorway    Service        areas    and     the   motorway
junctions throughout Northamptonshire in response to the trouble they had
experienced with        football     supporters      enroute   to other destinations               and
advised other      forces      of   the information     they required and also of the
benefits that could be reciprocated (telephone P.C. Spriggs 700700).


Mr.    Evans   suggested    the operation       should be      included        in   the     'Policing
Football' booklet.


European Championships


Inspector Temporal,         (B.T.P.),     gave an update on the current position of
the championships and the policing operations.


Mr.    Evans   closed    the    meeting    by   conveying      his    appreciation          to   those
present for their attendance and participation and looked forward to the
meeting next year.

                         ON WEDNESDAY/THURSDAY 8TH/9TH JUNE. 1988.




     The     meeting       was        Chaired     by    J.D.     Phillips       Esq.,    Assistant           Chief
     Constable,           Greater         Manchester           Police     and      Inspector           Hammond,
     Greater        Manchester           Police        performed        the     duties     of        Secretary.


     All     the     football          clubs     in     the     second    division       for     the        forthÂ­
     coming season were represented.




1.   OPENING ADDRESS


     Mr. Phillips opened the meeting and welcomed all present.                                 Copies of the
     following papers were distributed and later referred to in the meeting:
     Recommendations             of     the     Peat        Marwick     Report;    Police        Involvement
     concerning Player Behaviour; CCTV Operators/Intelligence Officers Course
     Curriculum;         Requirement          for a National Football            Intelligence Unit            and
     A.C.P.O. Public Order Guide Policing Football.


2.   UPDATE OF THE A.C.P.O. SUB-COMMITTEE MEETINGS ON HOOLIGANISM AT SPORTING
     EVENTS


     Mr.   Phillips related to the minutes of the last meeting in which the
     membership scheme and various alternatives such as the Luton scheme had
     been researched by John Williams at Leicester University.                                       He pointed
     out   the problems          of     football       hooliganism did not         only occur in             this
     country, but also in other European countries, China and Russia.


     Mr. Phillips stated the Sub-Committee was preparing a document on best
     practice       in    covert        operations       and     the    introduction      of     a     National
     Football       Intelligence         Unit.         He     outlined    the    progress       of    the    CCTV
     Operations          and     Intelligence          Officers        Course    and     highlighted          the
     practical legal issues.                   Photographic evidence gave dramatic results in
     court    and    this      was     an area     to be expanded.              The Sir Norman Chester


                                                                 - 1 -
     Centre for football research which was largely funded by the Football
     Trust had circulated a questionnaire which was supported by the A.C.P.O.
     Sub-Committee,            concerning             the     membership         scheme.           Mr.    Phillips          then
     expanded       upon       the    work       of     the    Football         Trust,       and     in particular            in
     relation       to     the       transportation            of     fans,      with        which       the    Trust       were
     willing to help the police.                         He asked that Chief Officers should write
     to him if they had problems in this respect.


3-   COACH OPERATORS


     Inspector Provoost                (Greater Manchester)                 gave a brief overview of                        the
     structure of the Traffic Commissioners                                and a resume of a sequence of
     events       that        led     to    the       publication           of     the       A.C.P.O.           conditions,
     circulated          by    the        Traffic        Commissioners            as     a     guideline          to    coach
     operators and later questioned the effectiveness of the guidelines.


     He stressed the importance of co-ordinating the responses from football
     commanders on the problems of causing coach operators to comply with the
     guidelines, in order that a concerted effort could be made to bring this
     to    the    attention          of    the    Traffic        Commissioners               who   may     then    provide
     effective enforcement against rogue coach operators.


4.   MATCH       INFORMATION AND INTELLIGENCE


     Mr.   Phillips outlined the distinction between                                   'match information'                  and
     'intelligence'.                The    match        information        had     reached         a     good    standard.
     This was based on match reports and liaison officers ability to forecast
     crowd       numbers,        modes       of       travel        and    the     demeanour             of     fans    etc.
     Intelligence             was      relatively             poor,        it     should           focus        upon        the
     identification of football hooligans, their associations, strategies and
     plans.       Mr. Phillips pointed out the problems associated with football
     hooliganism         which        related          to     "gang       tactics"       and       "strategies"             and
     questioned       how       well       the    police        knew      unruly       elements          that     attended
     football matches on a regular basis.                             He emphasised the need to form an
     intelligence system and identify the hooligans.                                     This could be done by
     using CCTV systems effectively with trained operators, and surveillance
     teams.       He questioned whether it was sufficient to rely solely upon a
     football      liaison          officer       and    stated that            the hooligans             needed       to    be




                                                                       - 2 -
     photographed and identified.                         Problems with hooligans                   seldom occurred
     with the home team supporters in the home ground, but in the vicinity of
     the ground and at away venues and also enroute to and from away venues.


5-   CCTV OPERATORS AND INTELLIGENCE OFFICERS COURSE


     Chief Inspector Ross (West Midlands) expounded on the course curriculum
     and     the development of               the course,         explaining           the evidence          gathering
     techniques         to    be     learned       using    the    hand     held       video    camera       and   CCTV
     systems.           He    commented       on    the    likely        areas    of    conflict        between      the
     ground commanders requirements in respect of deployment and that of the
     intelligence officer in respect of evidence gathering.                                         Chief Inspector
     Ross pointed out that operators were                           trained to focus upon a certain
     area until         they were satisfied they had recorded sufficient evidence.
     Ground commanders must appreciate that incidents could not be captured
     in every part of the ground at any one time and that it was better to
     record at least one incident with good evidence.                                    If the evidence was
     good, but insufficient for an immediate arrest,                                   then a strategy should
     be    set    out    to    record       a sequence of          incidents           committed       by    the   same
     people on different occasions in order to substantiate an arrest and be
     in a position to present the evidence before the court.


     Chief Inspector Ross then presented a video recording which illustrated
     a comparison of video recording by untrained and trained operators which
     emphasised the benefit of training.                           Another video presentation showed
     how the action of certain people in the ground could be monitored and
     used    as       evidence,       also     identifying         targets        at     close       range    with    a
     portable video camera which could either be hand held or mounted on a
     tripod      in     a selected         part    of     the    football    ground.            He    stressed     the
     importance of training officers to analyse video tapes and photographs
     after       each    match       to    detect    various       incidents           and     to    establish     the
     identification of the perpetrators.


6.   COVERT POLICING


     Mr. Phillips apprised the meeting on the position of the recent covert
     operations         in     the        Metropolitan          Police     area    and         stated       that   the
     Metropolitan were determined to continue with covert operations despite
     recent set-backs.




                                                                    - 3 -
      Inspector    Exton      (Greater     Manchester)     highlighted    the     problems       and
      pressures associated with covert policing and stressed the necessity of
      properly trained officers for covert work.               Also how essential welfare
     counselling       was    throughout    the   operation,   and    especially      afterwards
     before the officer returned to routine police work and the rigours of
     discipline.


     Inspector Exton conveyed the hooligans perception of the police and how
     they obtained operational information from police officers at numerous
     football matches and how they assessed the weakness of police operations
     under the protection and guise of relative annoymity.


     Inspector Exton remarked on the number of crimes committed by football
     hooligans which the police failed to relate to football, because of the
     time and location of the incident occurring outside the stadiums                            and
     often    before    and    after     match    times.    Some     incidents    exposed        the
     vulnerability      of    police    officers,   poor   communications       and   a   lack    of
     interest of individual officers.


     A video presentation showed an incident of a pre-arranged battle between
     Manchester United and City factions some distance away from the football
     match at half-time,        which confirmed the organisation of hooligan gangs
     to promote violence.


7-   QUALITY AND ASSESSMENT OF CCTV SYSTEMS


     Mr.   Ford   (S.R.D.B.)     gave    a video    presentation     which   illustrated         the
     faults and deficiencies of CCTV installations at 55 football grounds in
     England and Wales.         This was a result of a questionnaire sent to each
     respective police force at the request of A.C.P.O. in order to ascertain
     the effectiveness of CCTV systems at each football ground.                       The faults
     included interference from radio transmission, damaged film, worn film,
     dirty lens, poor maintenance,           and inadequate lens.        Only one recording
     was suitable for evidence gathering purposes.                 69% were barely adequate
     for command and control purposes and in most cases they were of little
     value.


     Mr.   Ford suggested a number of ways             to improve the existing systems.
     The most important thing was to have the cameras properly and regularly
     serviced.    A number of cameras needed to be remounted and resited and
     the majority required larger lens.    He emphasised the importance of the
     care of video tapes, correct storage and a limit on maximum usage.       He
     stated that an answer to the problem, would be to use the portable video
     camera on display, for evidence gathering purposes and outlined the
     added advantages of the camera.


     Mr. Phillips gave a brief resume of the history of the installation of
     CCTV and the reasons for the inadequacies of the present fixed systems
     for evidence gathering purposes and the Football Trust's disappointment
     in the systems being used for command and control.    He pointed out the
     dangers of adding to these systems without expert technical advice,
     despite many claims that police forces were satisfied with what they
     had.   He recommended the portable video camea equipment which was on
     view and stated it would accomplish the pictures required for evidence
     that the fixed systems were incapable of producing.          However the
     portable camera would not replace the CCTV installation, but complement
     them.


     Mr. Phillips informed the conference that the A.C.P.O. Sub-Committee
     were in the process of recommending to the Football Trust the formation
     of a technical committee which would give expert advice on the best
     practical methods of enhancing existing CCTV systems efficiently and
     economically at individual grounds and also the equipment required at
     grounds where CCTV systems had not been installed.


8.   REFEREES GUIDELINES VIOLENCE ON THE FIF.IX)


     Mr. Phillips gave a brief summary of the document 'Police Involvement
     with Regard to Player Behaviour on the Field of Play'          which has
     subsequently been ratified by the A.C.P.O. Council.   The guidelines were
     produced as a result of a meeting with representatives from the Football
     Association,   the Professional Footballers Association,    the Football
     League and the Association of Football League Referees and Linesmen in
     which concern was expressed as to the different practices and standards
     adopted by various ground commanders and that police officers needed to
     be cognizant of the Football Association's disciplinary system.      Mr.
     Phillips said he had pointed out to the Football Association that the
     police would not allow any other body to have the right to decide to
     investigate criminal matters at football grounds in England and Wales.



                                             -5 -
9-   C.C.T.V OPERATIONAL SYSTEMS


     Mr. Phillips reiterated the importance of using trained operators for
     gathering evidence and identifying target hooligans.     However it wasn't
     enough to rely upon improved video equipment and trained operators.    He
     suggested a strategy should be adopted by ground commanders in setting
     roles and training staff.      He emphasised the need for a C.C.T.V team
     with a director, where possible the football intelligence officer, a
     camera operator and a photographer for still pictures.    The team should
     be used in conjunction with an arrest strategy by developing an arrest
     team and a follow up enquiry team for post match analysis.     The arrest
     strategy would be dependent upon the video evidence and other related
     matters.     Mr. Phillips related to a video film depicting belligerant
     behaviour and offensive language where a female and a girl left the
     ground because of the intollerable behaviour of nearby supporters. This
     kind of evidence could be recorded on video and taken to court.    It was
     no longer necessary     for us   to accept a higher threshold of bad
     behaviour.     If we set standards, we can arrange a suitable arrest
     strategy.     Post match analysis was the key to tackling the growing
     problem of unacceptable behaviour.


     Mr. Phillips concluded it was necessary to sustain a reasonable level of
     successful prosecution from video evidence to prevent the credibility of
     CCTV deminishing.


     Members of the Working Party answered questions appertaining to the use
     of CCTV and portable video cameras for evidence gathering.
     Mr. Phillips informed the conference of the working party preparing a
     report into the police use of CCTV and still photography in which the
     Director of Public Prosecutions had been consulted in respect of the
     presentation of best evidence.


     Mr. Phillips also informed the meeting of the functions of the proposed
     Technical Committee of the Football Trust and stated that          future
     applications for CCTV enhancement should be made by the police on behalf
     of the clubs through the Technical Committee who will give advice and if
     necessary visit the grounds.




                                             - 6 -
      It     was    suggested         that   the    Football      Summary       reports      include         whether
      arrests involved the use of CCTV in order to assess the effectiveness of
      CCTV.


      Problems were being encountered in the reciprocation of video recordings
      for    the     police      of    the visiting        football       club.       The    introduction          of
      intelligence officers would probably alleviate this problem.


      Video        recordings          and   video        printer       photographs         to        assist     with
      identification             of    targets     and     incidents       at     railway        stations        were
      available from the British Transport Police.


      Mr. Ford suggested monochrome cameras were more effective in low light
      level video recordings.                The Kodakchrome B 3200 film was good for covert
      photography in low light.


      The    conference          was    made     aware     of    the    vulnerability            of    the     camera
      operators          when the hooligans          realised they were being                filmed.            Where
      this was the case, it was suggested that the recommended portable video
      camera kit could be mounted on a tripod in a safe area of the ground.
      The kit was capable of presenting sufficient pictures for identification
      of any part of a football                  ground if positioned in the centre line area.
      If necessary negotiations                  should be made with football clubs to provide
      a platform in one of the                   stands where the camera kit could be set up.
      In many cases hard wiring                    could be laid from this point to the police
      control room.


      Mr. Phillips informed the conference that the Crown Prosecution Service
      advised officers to look at a video recording a number of times before
      writing notes in their pocketbook if this was practicable.


10.   OPERATION âRED CARDâ


      Chief Superintendent Mills                 (West Midlands) gave a brief account of the
      reason       for establishing a covert policing operation.                             He pointed out
      that     there       was    no    evidence      to     identify      any       particular         political
      affiliation.           Operation         'Red Card'        was   staffed       with   C.I.D.       officers
      because       of    the    intelligence        on    the    crime    that      was    identified          with
      football       hooliganism.            The    operation          began    in    January,          1987,    and
      concluded in October,              1987.     when 183 officers were engaged in arrests


                                                                  -7 -
and search of premises.      The offences consisted of conspiracy to commit
affrays, public order offences and woundings.       He stated lessons were
learned and two similar operations had been conducted since 'Red Card'.
Incidents had occurred at football matches in the City of Birmingham
that did not involve Birmingham City Football Club but did however have
a historical    link which resulted in the Birmingham fans becoming
involved in a planned operation to attack the other clubs supporters
where serious wounding occurred.        As a result of the intelligence
system, in one particular      case,an arrest was made within 24 hours of
the incident and a youthrelated to the        'Red Card' operation was now
serving a term of life in youth custody.


Detective Sergeant Layton      (WestMidlands) gave a commentary on a video
film which was an extract     of the evidenceused for Operation 'Red Card'.
He concurred the necessity of having trained camera operators and
pointed out a member of the Birmingham 'Zulu Warriors' using a camera
during an incident in the City Centre, when Watford played Tottenham at
Villa Park.    He also explained how the gang organised and planned the
event.    Also a scene depicted the hooligan element in the football
ground stagingâa mock fight to draw an officer into an ambush.


Mr. Layton stated that tKe media were made aware of the 'Red Card'
operation and full coverage was given resulting in a lot of publicity
which unfortunately boosted the morale of the 'warriors'.     Consequently
the media were embargoed for the Wolverhampton operation, with the
result of the Wolves hooligans being extremely disappointed in not
getting the same publicity.


Constable Lloyd (Greater Manchester) gave a slide presentation on a
hooligan gang who had recorded their acts of violence and other crimes
with photographs and newspaper cuttings which had been siezed by the
police.   The slides depicted the gang engaged in battle, photographing
their victims and also their members mixing with police officers during
football match operations.     There were also slides illustrating how the
hooligans conceal their weapons, particularly with the knowledge that
most officers use gloves when conducting searches at turnstiles.

      Mr. Phillips added that this particular gang lived in Greater Manchester
      and   affilliated      themselves       to    Leeds      Football   Club        in    particular      and
      visited     other    clubs   as   well       and   conducted      many     incidents       in   places
      unconnected     with    football    events         and    subjected       the    public    to   street
      terror.


11.   THE FOOTBALL SUPPORTERS' ASSOCIATION SUGGESTIONS


      Inspector     Hammond    (Greater       Manchester)         informed       the       meeting    of    the
      suggestions     the     Football    Supporters'            Association           had    referred       to
      concerning the policing of travelling supporters in respect of retention
      of away supporters after a match, and how it affected those who had to
      make their own way unescorted back to cars and vans parked away from a
      ground.     Also a method of providing a liaison system with the police at
      the football ground.         These points were left for an open discussion.                            It
      was concluded that travellers should write to the clubs for identified
      parking places near to the ground and for the association to appoint a
      liaison officer, identifying that person with a tabard or armband.                                    The
      club should be made aware of the supporters suggestions and that extra
      stewards be on hand to deal with enquiries and the liaison officer.                                    It
      was also acknowledged that police officers                       should be properly briefed
      and familiar with the vicinity of the club.


12.   MISCELLANEOUS ISSUES


      Superintendent Jolly         (Suffolk)       related an incident concerning policing
      the Ipswich    -v- Millwall game where public                    service vehicles           and mini
      buses were stopped and searched on the A12 and A^5 in pursuance of the
      Sporting    Events     (Control    of    Alcohol)         Act    1985 .         Difficulties         were
      experienced concerning the interpretation of the Act in respect of the
      adaption of    transit vans        carrying 8 or more passengers.                         There were
      inconsistencies in various Magistrates decisions.


      Superintendent Stuart (South Yorkshire) related a similar case in which
      the Crown Prosecution Service withdrew the case.                           Two doubtful         issues
      arose.     Whether the vehicle was carrying passengers for hire or reward,
      and the interpretation implied with regard to adaption.                                It was agreed
      that the Director of Public Prosecutions should be consulted.

       Motorway       Interception.               Chief    Inspector        Hogg     (Northamptonshire)
       explained the 'intercept' operation they had introduced at the Motorway
      Service areas          and junctions throughout              the county in response               to the
      trouble they had experienced with                     football      supporters    enroute         to    and
       from other venues and asked other forces to forward information on coach
      and private transport routes.                  He enlightened the conference upon the
      benefits that could be reciprocated from this operation each match day.

13.   MEMBERSHIP SCHEMES/PEAT MARWICK REPORT


      Mr.    Phillips gave a brief resume upon the situation of the Membership
      Scheme by referring to the Luton Scheme,                       the conclusion of a research
      study conducted by John Williams at Leicester University and the present
      membership schemes.          He stated the main difficulty was the configuration
      of     the   football    grounds       and    also    the     reciprocal      scheme    meant          that
      grounds had to be divided into segments                        which each required toilets,
      refreshment bars         amongst many other             facilities      which were not            always
      available.


      An    open   discussion      on      this   subject     then   took    place     on   the    problems
      encountered by various               ground   commanders.           The points    discussed were
      lack    of   consistency        in    the    schemes;      financial    implications;          minimum
      requirement; computerised turnstiles; logistical problems; suspension of
      the    scheme    for    major     games;      no    interest    from    the    clubs;       the    Luton
      Scheme; introduction            of legislative measures and cost effectiveness.


14.   OPEN FORUM


      Exclusion Orders


      The    Conference      was   in      agreement      that    Exclusion    Orders       issued      for    3
      months were relatively ineffective.


      Difficulty had been experienced in obtaining photographs.                              Mr. Phillips
      stated that he would approach the Football League with a request for the
      provision of photographing persons ejected from the football grounds to
      be included in the football clubs ground rules.




                                                                 - 10 -
Play-Offs


Concern was expressed at the minimal amount of notice given to police
forces concerning match play-offs.


Assistant Chief Constable Elliott                  (West Midlands)      stated problems had
occurred in policing the play-offs matches                     at Walsall    and asked that
this subject should be broached at the A.C.P.O. Sub-Committee meeting in
September.


Closure of Public Houses


It was suggested that where trouble is anticipated at certain venues,
consideration         should    be   given    to    liaising    with    breweries      upon   the
closure of public houses in the immediate vicinity of football grounds.
Licensing magistrates in York had at the request of the police ordered
the closure of certain public houses where trouble had ensued in the
past.


Mr. Phillips very briefly reiterated the main points of the conference.


Mr.   Elliott   remarked on the conference being very stimulating and of
enormous    value      and     conveyed   his      appreciation    on    behalf   of    all    in
attendance      for    a     successful      meeting.     Mr.     Phillips   expressed        his
appreciation to all those in attendance and for their participation, and
closed the conference.

OPENINGADDRESS

Mr.    Phillips opened the meeting by welcoming all present to the first
seminar to be held for Football Commanders and Liaison Officers of 3rd
and 4th Division Football Clubs.                      He gave a brief account of the purpose
of the conferences and outlined the format for the seminar.                                        Copies of
the    following        papers       were     distributed         and     later     referred      to   in   the
meeting.        Recommendations of the Peat Marwick Report, Police Involvement
concerning         Player       Behaviour;        CCTV       Operators'/Intelligence               Officers'
Course Curriculum; Requirement for a National Football Intelligence Unit
and A.C.P.O. Public Order Guide 'Policing Football'.
 UPDATEOFME A.C.P.O. SOB-COMHTEE MEETINGS ONHOOLIGANISMAT SPORTING


Mr.    Phillips informed the meeting of the current situation concerning
 the   Membership    Scheme,       the   Luton    Scheme    and         the   area     of    research
undertaken by John Williams at Leicester University.


He stated that the Sub-Committee had been commissioned with preparing a
document on best practice in covert operations and the introduction of a
National Football Intelligence Unit.                 He briefly explained the reason
for the development of a C.C.T.V.                Operators and Intelligence Officers
Course and of the future courses to be held in Manchester.                           Mr. Phillips
informed the meeting of the Football Trust's function and of the areas
in which they were willing to assist the police.


COACHOPERATORS

Inspector Provoost        (Greater Manchester)         gave      a brief overview                of   the
structure of the Traffic Commissioners and a resume of a sequence of
events    that    led     to     the   publication     of     the       A.C.P.O.       conditions,
circulated   by     the    Traffic       Commissioners      as      a     guideline         to     coach
operators and later, questioned the effectiveness of the guidelines.


He stressed the importance of co-ordinating the responses from football
commanders on     the problems and features            of coach operators                   to comply
with the guidelines,           in order that a concerted effort could be made to
bring this to the attention of the Traffic Commissioners,                            who may then
provide effective enforcement against rogue coach operators.


COVERTPOLICING

Mr. Phillips apprised the meeting on the position of the recent covert
operations   in     the    Metropolitan       Police     area       and       stated        that      the
Metropolitan were determined to continue with covert operations despite
recent setbacks.
     Detective Sergeant Layton             (West Midlands)       gave a brief account of the
     reason   for   establishing       a     covert   policing    operation.        There       was    no
     evidence    to identify any particular affiliation.                      He enlightened the
     conference on the problems and pressures associated with covert policing
     and stressed that it was essential to use properly trained officers.                              It
     was also necessary to monitor the welfare of the officers throughout an
     operation,     and for welfare counselling after the operation before the
     officers returned to police work and the rigours of discipline.


     He related the hooligans perception of the police and how they obtained
     operational        information    from     police    officers       at    numerous     football
     matches, and how they assessed the weaknesses of police operations under
     the protection of relative annonymity.


     Sergeant Layton emphasised the number of crimes committed by football
     hooligans which in the past have not been related to football by the
     police, because          the time and location of the crime was outside match
     times.      Some    incidents     and    tactics    at   football    grounds    exposed          the
     vulnerability of the police and poor communications.                     In some instances,
     a distinct lack of interest by individual officers was evident.


     Sergeant Layton gave an example of the value of having a good football
     intelligence system and how essential                it was      for it to link up          to a
     national network.       He also gave a brief account of operation 'Red Card'
     together with a video presentation of the operation and an extract of
     the video evidence which           emphasised the importance of having trained
     camera operators.


s.   FOOTBALLBELATED INCIDfflTS

     Constable    Lloyd     (Greater    Manchester)       gave    a   commentary     on     a    slide
     presentation concerning a hooligan gang in the Greater Manchester area
     who affiliate themselves mainly to Leeds United and to a lesser extent
     Liverpool and other clubs in the Football League.                        Some of the crimes
     were unrelated to football.             The majority of slides had been reproduced




                                              - 3 -
      from photographs and newspaper cuttings siezed from the premises of a
     member     of   the    gang.        The     gang         had    recorded        on    photograph       acts       of
     violence,       victims       and       their    injuries,                members     mixing    with        police
     officers during football match operations.                                 Constable Lloyd also showed
     examples of concealment of weapons on the body which were undetectable
     when police officers executed body searches wearing gloves, particularly
     at turnstiles.


6.   HATCHINFORMATIONANDINTELLIGENCE

     Mr.    Phillips outlined the distinction between                               'match information'               and
     'intelligence'.             The   match     information              had     reached    a good        standard.
     This was based on match reports and liaison officers ability to forecast
     crowd     numbers,       modes      of      travel         and        the demeanour            of     fans etc.
     Intelligence          was     relatively             poor,           it     should      focus       upon         the
     identification of football hooligans, their "associations", "strategies"
     and    plans.      Mr.      Phillips        pointed        out        the problems           associated with
     football hooliganism which                  related to "gang tactics"                   and     "strategies"
     and questioned how well the police knew unruly elements that attended
     football matches on a regular basis.                           He emphasised the need to form an
     intelligence system and identify the hooligans.                                     This could be done by
     using CCTV systems effectively with trained operators, and surveillance
     teams.     He questioned whether it was sufficient to rely solely upon a
     football    liaison         officer       and     stressed            the    hooligans       needed         to    be
     photographed and identified.                     Problems with hooligans seldom occurred
     with    the home      team    supporters         in       the home          ground,    but     often    in       the
     vicinity of the ground and at away venues and also en route to and from
     away venues.       An intelligence officer could be trained to analyse video
     recordings,     identify          targets    and         administer follow up                enquiries. The
     officer    could      develop       a    port    folio          of    known     hooligans       and    collate
     information     from passive             observers         on    surveillance          at    home     and    away
     matches and prepare a professional match briefing programme.

 7.    CCTVOPERATORSANDINTELLIGENCE OFFICERS COURSE

      Chief Inspector Ross (West Midlands) expounded on the C.C.T.V operators
      and intelligence officers course curriculum and the development of the
      course, explaining the evidence gathering techniques to be learned using
      the hand held video camera and C.C.T.V.                     systems.         He commented on the
      likely areas of conflict between the ground commanders requirements in
      respect of deployment and those of the intelligence officer in respect
      of evidence gathering.                Chief Inspector Ross pointed out that operators
      were trained to focus upon a certain area until they were satisfied they
      had     recorded sufficient            evidence.     Ground       commanders        must   appreciate
      that incidents could not be captured in every part of the ground at any
      one time and that it was better to record at least one incident with
      good    evidence.         If    the    evidence    was    good,     but    insufficient       for     an
      immediate arrest, then a strategy should be set out to record a sequence
      of    incidents    committed by          the same    people       on different         occasions      in
      order to substantiate             an arrest    and be in a position                 to present       the
      evidence before the court.


      Chief Inspector Ross then presented a video recording which illustrated
      a comparison of video recording by untrained and trained operators which
      emphasised the benefit of training.                  Another video presentation showed
      how the action of certain people in the ground could be monitored and
      used    as    evidence,        also    identifying       targets    at    close       range   with    a
      portable video camera which could either be hand held or mounted on a
      tripod in       a selected       part of     the   football        ground.       He    stressed     the
      importance of training officers to analyse video tapes and photographs
      after    each    match    to     detect    various       incidents       and   to     establish     the
      identification of the perpetrators.


s.    QUALITYAM) ASSESSMENTOFCCTVSYSTEMS

      Mr.    Ford   (S.R.D.B.)        gave    a video    presentation          which   illustrated        the
      faults and deficiencies of CCTV installations at 55 football grounds in
      England and Wales.             This was a result of a questionnaire sent to each




                                                 -5 -
     respective police force at the request of A.C.P.O. in order to ascertain
     the effectiveness of CCTV systems at each football ground.                        The faults
     included interference from radio transmission, damaged film, worn film,
     dirty lens, poor maintenance,                 and inadequate lens.       Only one recording
     was suitable for evidence gathering purposes.                     69% were barely adequate
     for command        and control        purposes which would        complement    the existing
     system and in most cases they were of little value.


     Mr.     Ford suggested a number of ways                to improve    the existing systems.
     The most important thing was to have the cameras properly and regularly
     serviced.        A number of cameras needed to be remounted and resited and
     the majority required larger lens.                   He emphasised the importance of the
     care of video tapes, correct storage and a limit on maximum usage.                           He
     stated that an answer to the problem, would be to use the portable video
     camera     on     display,      for     evidence      gathering     purposes    which     would
     complement the existing system and outlined the added advantages of the
     camera.


9.   CCTVOPERATIONAL SYSTEM

     Mr. Phillips gave a brief resume of the history of the installation of
     CCTV and the reasons for the inadequacies of the present fixed systems
     for evidence gathering purposes and the Football Trust's disappointment
     in the systems being used for command and control.                       He pointed out the
     dangers    of     adding   to   these    systems      without   expert   technical      advice,
     despite many claims          that police        forces were satisfied with what            they
     had.     He recommended the portable video camera equipment which was on
     view and stated it would accomplish the pictures required for evidence
     that     the    fixed    systems      were    incapable   of    producing.      However     the
     portable camera would not replace the CCTV installation, but complement
     them.


     Mr.    Phillips    informed     the    conference      that    the A.C.P.O.    Sub-Committee
     were in the process of recommending to the Football Trust the formation
     of a     technical      committee which would give expert             advice on      the best




                                                  - 6 -
      practical     methods     of   enhancing existing CCTV         systems    efficiently       and
      economically at individual grounds and also the equipment required at
      grounds where CCTV systems had not been installed.


      Mr.   Phillips reiterated        the importance of using trained operators                  for
      gathering evidence and identifying target hooligans.                     It wasn't enough
      to    rely   upon     improved   video     equipment    and   trained     operators.         He
      suggested a strategy should be adopted by ground commanders in setting
      roles and training staff.            He emphasised the need for a C.C.T.V team
      with a director,         (where possible the football intelligence officer)                   a
      camera operator and a photographer for still pictures.                    The team should
      be used in conjunction with an arrest strategy by deploying an arrest
      team and a follow up enquiry team for post match analysis.                     The arrest
      strategy would be dependent upon the video evidence and other related
      matters.      Mr.     Phillips   related    to a video    film depicting belligerant
      behaviour and offensive          language where        a female    and a girl    left       the
      ground because of the intollerable behaviour of nearby supporters.                      This
      kind of evidence could be recorded on video and taken to court.                      It was
      no longer necessary for the police to accept a higher threshold of bad
      behaviour.      Post     match analysis was         the key   to   tackling the growing
      problem of unacceptable behaviour.


      Mr. Phillips concluded it was necessary to sustain a reasonable level of
      successful prosecution from video evidence to prevent the credibility of
      CCTV deminishing.


10.   REFEREESGUIDELINESVHMCE ONTOEFIELD

      Mr. Phillips gave a brief summary upon the circulated paper containing
      the guidelines which have           subsequently been         ratified by    the A.C.P.O.
      Council.      The guidelines were produced as a result of a meeting with
      representatives from the Football Association, Professional Footballers'
      Association and the Referees and Linesmen Association in which concern
      was expressed as         to the different practices           and standards    adopted by
      various      ground    commanders    and     that    police    officers     needed     to    be




                                               - 7 -
      cognisant       of   the    Football       Association's        disciplinary          system.         Mr.
      Phillips said he had pointed out to the Football Association that the
      police would not allow any other body to have the right                                to decide       to
      investigate criminal matters at football grounds in England and Wales.


11.   MEMBERSHIP SCHEMEANDPEATMARWICKREPORT

      Mr.    Phillips gave a brief resume of the membership scheme and of                                   the
      Peat Marwick Report of which the main recommendations in the report had
      been circulated.           He stated the main difficulty was the configuration of
      the football grounds and also the reciprocal schemes meant that grounds
      had to be divided into segments which each required toilets, refreshment
      bars amongst many other facilities which were not always available.


      An    open    discussion     on     this   subject      then    took    place    on    the    problems
      encountered by various              ground    commanders.         The points      discussed were
      lack    of    consistency      in    the   schemes;      financial       implications;          minimum
      requirement; computerised turnstiles; logistical problems, suspension of
      the    scheme    for   major      games;     no    interest      from   the     clubs;       the   Luton
      Scheme; introduction of legislative measures and cost effectiveness.


12.   T.R.E.V.I.

      Superintendent King           (BTP)    explained        the    composition      and    functions       of
      T.R.E.V.I. of which Assistant Chief Constable W.I. McGregor (BTP) is the
      British correspondent.              He gave a brief overview of the information and
      intelligence collated and disseminated by British Transport Police and
      gave an update on the European Championships.


      He    urged    intelligence       officers        and   liaison    officers      to    be     aware    of
      travelling fans and targets in relation to international matches as they
      were more difficult to identify, when in the main they attend matches in
      London and other countries.                He then gave a video presentation on the
      T.R.E.V.I. organisation and B.T.P. involvement.

i3.   EXCLUSIONOFMY SUPPORTERS

      Chief Superintendent Moore               (Devon and Cornwall)           related the experience
      of     the   exclusion       of    away     supporters         at   Torquay     United     and    the
      effectiveness and reason for this.                     The exclusion of supporters was an
      agreement reached with the club in exchange for reduced policing costs.
      Although     there    were    a    few    weaknesses      in    the   system     for    membership,
      overall, the scheme was a success and suggested similar agreements could
      be reached with other clubs.


w.    BANSIMPOSEDBYTHEFOOTBALLASSOCIATIONANDLEAGUE

      Chief    Superintendent           Stainton       (Cumbria)      posed    the    difficulties       in
      policing     football      grounds    and    fixtures      which involve        a visiting club
      whose    supporters        have been banned         and    arrive on mass.             In order    to
      maintain A.C.P.O.'s policy of keeping out banned visiting supporters,
      the cost of police resources were high.                    The repercussions from setting
      up   road    blocks    and    keeping      out    banned       spectators      upon    unsuspecting
      neighbouring police areas,               together with allowing the spectators                   into
      the ground were discussed at length.                    It was acknowledged there was no
      easy    solution      to    this   problem       but    unless      excluded    supporters       were
      confronted they would continue to travel.                        It was necessary to have a
      plan to deter and contain them.


is.   ALL TICKET FUMES IMPOSEDBYFA/LEAGUE

      Chief Inspector Richardson (Durham) related experiences of difficulty in
      policing football matches             that had been declared              'all ticket'      by    the
      FA/League without consulting the                  relevant police         force as      to whether
      such a restriction could be enforced successfully.                          Small clubs do not
      apply these restrictions rigidly because of their financial position.
      Therefore he requested             that A.C.P.O.        consult with        the authorities        on
      this subject.

is.   MEMBERSHIP SCHEME- ACOfflQS POLICY

      A discussion took place on the effectiveness of the membership schemes
      which have been undertaken by the clubs.                   It was generally acknowledged
      that many of the schemes created more problems than they solved.


17.   INTERCEPT

      Superintendent        Finch      (Northamptonshire)           explained       the       motorway
      'intercept'     operations      introduced      at   the    Motorway      Service    areas    and
      junctions     throughout      the county    in response        to   the    trouble      they had
      experienced with football supporters en route to and from other venues
      and   asked   other   forces     to   forward    information        on    coach   and    private
      transport and enlightened the conference upon the benefits that could be
      reciprocated from the operation each match day.                     Information should be
      forwarded to PC Spriggs 700700.


is.   IHHOOCHROUTESOFTRAVELLINGSUPPORTERS

      Superintendent     McGinn      related     similar     problems      with     football       fans
      stopping off in unsuspecting villages and towns,                    in a force area that
      had no involvement with football, being subjected to hooliganism.                              He
      requested other forces to notify one another of routes fans are likely
      to take when travelling to away fixtures in the form of a pre-warning
      system.     Prior warning would allow for police resources to be deployed
      effectively.       It was suggested that covert teams                    could help in this
      respect and also whenever the National Unit was in being.


19-   Mr. Phillips in closing the conference asked if those in attendance had
      felt the conference was of benefit.




                                            - 10 -
It was concluded that the conference was a success.                However,    it was
acknowledged that it would be of greater benefit if separate conferences
could be arranged for the two divisions as there was a lot of business
to   discuss   and   to   which   more   depth   could   have   been   given   if   the
conference had been extended another day.

                                   FOOTBALL SPECTATORS BILL


       I w r ite in my capacity as Chairman of the ACPO Sub-Committee on
Hooliganism a t Sporting Events.           You w ill a p p reciate t h a t w h ils t we have
had s ig h t of the r e p o rt of the M in i s te r 's Working Party f o r some l i t t l e
time, the t e x t of the Bill i t s e l f has only j u s t been made a v a i la b l e . I
thought i t r i g h t th e re fo re to convene an urgent and special meeting of the
Sub-Committee so t h a t you could be informed of the view within ACPO. This
has been done.

         The comments I make here are s t i l l based upon lim ited c o n s u lta tio n
and I am, th e r e f o r e , copying t h i s l e t t e r to my colleag ues. I f th e re are
o th er m atters t h a t they feel you should be made aware of I w ill w r ite to
you again.        For the p r e s e n t, however, you may consider i t expedient to
consider our d e lib e r a tio n s .

       Comments on the Bill have been sub-divided so as to d istin g u is h the
general from the p a r t i c u l a r and to r e f l e c t the c l e a r d i s t i n c t i o n in the
B ill between Part I and I I .


IN GENERAL


        The success of the proposals w ill eventually be judged a t two le v e l s .

        F i r s t , th ere i s the question as to whether t h i s l e g i s l a t i o n w i l l : -


        (a) p ro g ressiv ely remove hooligans from the fo o tb all grounds and

      (b) d e te r the a lle g ia n c e of those who are involved in tro u b le and
violence but do not n e c e s s a rily atten d matches.

           Second, and in a sense more fundamentally, the question remains
whether or not the simple mechanics of processing membership cards through
t u r n s t i l e s can a c t u a l ly be achieved.
        The Police view over a long period of time has been _ t h a t these
provisions a r e , to a g re a t e x te n t, marginal to the Problem, i f fo r no <other
reason than they cannot exclude the p o s s i b i l i t y of fraud by People who are ,
by d e f i n i t io n , h ellb en t upon defeatin g the system, and because i t w ill t Â« e
a very long time before a s i g n i f i c a n t number of p o ten tial hooligans are
excluded by the scheme. There are some co un tervailing advantages.

        (i)      the d e te rre n t e f f e c t may be considerable;

        (ii)    the Club d i s c ip lin a r y system may well be able to take strong
                actio n on the evidence of C.C.T.V. alone;

        (iii)     the game w ill         be able       to exclude many of the very worst
                 offenders.
      Nonetheless, the Police view i s t h a t many                         the measures t h a t we
have already taken, which are summarised in the attached Appendix A, are
having a s i g n i f i c a n t e f f e c t and a re f a r more c r i t i c a l to the problem of
hooliganism.
           The q uestion, however, which most concerns Police off1J e "
the e ffic a c y of the technology. The B ill n a tu r a lly does not detailI how 1
w ill work or what i s required of i t b u t, i t is c l e a r t h a t , unless r t
robust and v i r t u a l l y t r o u b le - f r e e , i t w ill b e c o u n te r -p r o d u c tiv e . In the
worst case i t could be massively counter-productive.                                At the l e a s t eacn
t u r n s t i l e must have access to a national database and must be able t
survey t h a t database almost in stan ta n eo u sly .                The machine i t s e l f must De
durable a g a in s t sabotage ( f o r example, a l l machines with a groove to read
magnetic tape could be e a s il y defeated by using chewing gum o r a>
substance) and must work without p e r s i s t e n t f a u l t .                   Aston V illa has, i
b e lie v e , over 150 t u r n s t i l e s .         Halifax Town may have but few b u t . I t s
arrangements a r e , to say th e l e a s t , b a s ic . Inevitably the system has to be
universal.
        All our experience to date has been t h a t computer salesmen have
 offered much and d elivered l i t t l e .       The Police ^ e l 1*ey g s a j s H e d CRal
 in thP s p e c if ic a tio n fo r any technology and would need t o o e s a t i s f i e d tnat
 I t works before support cou'ld be glvefi to t h i s scheme , Ine consequences uT
 repeated f a i l u r e , h o s t i l e queues, interminaDle delays and the r e s t ,
 unthinkable.
            The second level a t which the technology causes concern r e l a t e s to
 nrocedures following a "red li g h t " a t the t u r n s t i l e s .             P olicing a t
 t u r n s t i l e s a t p resen t i s very s e l e c t iv e and the Police          c0â auick
 countenance providing th e s o r t of cover which would a1low f o r a quick
 resDonse to each t u r n s t i l e in the event of a problem.                The only powers
 conferred in the B ill are on the Police and on th e face of i t every
 to e n t e r which a c t i v a te s a "red l ig h t " suggests an offence Is be g
 committed.             At Manchester United f o r example 30,000 peapie w i l l Pa s |
 through the t u r n s t i l e s in j u s t over 20 m           i   n  u    t  .   J    J  J
  about a hundred t u r n s t i l e s and the prospects of p o licin g t h i s system are
  ab s o lu te ly daunting.
       Many of these issues were, of course, ra is e d within the Working Party
 but they were s e t a g a in s t the blandishments t h a t the physical a r r a ?9eJ*|[**
 could be delivered. The Police view i s t h a t the scheme may work i f these
 SSJslcSl co n d ition s can be d eliv ered b ut 1 t needs to be demonstrated f i r s t .
PART I


            P art I of the Act i s enabling l e g i s l a t i o n and to a g r e a t e x te n t many
of the issues which w ill be c ru cial to the Police ro le in the scheme will
be m atters o f d e ta il which the "adm inistrator" of the schemes w ill have a
r e s p o n s i b i li t y to draw up. So important are the working d e t a i l s t h a t the
Police feel there must be an opportunity fo r the Service to be f u lly
consulted. I t may be ap p rop riate fo r Section 4 Sub-Section (1) to req uire
the adhvfnistrator to co n su lt the Police and Sub-Section (2) of the same
Section to allow fo r the Secretary of S ta te to take in to account any
observations made by the P o lice.             A sim ila r caveat might apply to any
a l t e r a t i o n of the scheme.

           Section 5 Sub-Section (5)             c r e a te s an offence which e n t a i l s a
reasonable degree of in v e s tig a tio n and i t could be t h a t many a p p lic a tio n s
w ill in some r e s p e c t be suspect or a t l e a s t req u ire c l a r i f i c a t i o n . The
Police view i s t h a t the "adm inistrator" of the scheme should have a
r e s p o n s i b i li t y fo r determining such f a c t s as i t is p o ssib le fo r him to
e s t a b li s h and t h a t i t should be open to the "adm inistrator" to lay
informations in r e sp e c t of offences d isc lo sed .

           Whilst i t i s recognised t h a t the "Relevant Evidence" Schedule i s
c o n s i s t e n t with the provisions of the Exclusion Orders Scheme i t i s
considered t h a t t h i s schedule might a p p ro p ria te ly include offences under
Section 91 Criminal J u s ti c e Act 1967.

         Section 8 of the Bill r e f e r s to conditions which will a tta c h to a
licence to admit s p e c ta to r s . Sub-Section 10 of the same Section makes i t an
offence fo r a "responsible person" to contravene any of the co n d itio n s. As
th e re i s a p o s s i b i l i t y t h a t p o lic e o f f i c e r s may, in accordance with the
Working Party Report, allow the scheme to be suspended in the i n t e r e s t s of
s a fe ty and o rd er, they may stand in d i f f i c u l t y in r e sp e c t of t h i s
Sub-Section. I t i s th e r e fo r e suggested t h a t the recommendations in the
Working Party Report v iz: Chapter 4 paragraph 27 of the Working Party
Report (regarding allowance f o r breakdown of machinery and o th er sh o r t term
emergencies beyond the Club's c o n t r o l ) , be included in the B i l l .


PART II


       I t has to be said t h a t the proposals in P art II of the B ill were
never discussed by the Working Party and are only loosely r e l a t e d to the
arrangements fo r c o n t r o l lin g sp e c ta to rs envisaged in Part I of th e B i l l .
The B ill r e f e r s only to "re p o rtin g ag en cies' f u n c tio n s" ; more po intedly the
somewhat bland question and answer note from the Department of the
Environment suggests t h a t th e Police may be a candidate f o r t h i s r o l e , y e t
the d e t a i l of the Bill seems to envisage t h a t the Police will play a major
p art.
            There are two arguments which need to be put with some stre n g th .
F i r s t l y , to take on the r e s p o n s i b i l i t i e s of being a r e p o rtin g agency in the
terms o u tlin e d in the B ill w ill be a very considerable task with an
on-going ad m in istra tiv e commitment and the p o te n tia l fo r considerable
i n v e s ti g a tiv e e n q u irie s.     The Police have always taken the view t h a t any
p rovisions must be considered in the context t h a t the Police commitment to
p o licin g fo otball is already very considerable and cannot be increased
without lo ss to the q u a lity of se rv ice elsewhere. I t has also to be noted
t h a t none of these provisions in any way b e n e f its the p o lic in g in the areas
fo r which Chief Constables have a r e s p o n s i b i l i t y .                       I f th e re are to be
b e n e f i t s , they r e l a t e on the one hand to our national r e p u ta tio n , which is
not a m atter fo r local p o lic e , and on the o ther fo r the p o licin g of towns
in foreign lands.                 Our f i r s t p o s itio n i s th e re fo re t h a t the Service r e g re ts
i t cannot support any Police involvement as the 'R eporting Agency" or the
deployment o? resources undertaken as a r e s u l t of the agency's

resp o n sib ilities.
            Regardless of the Police r o le the Reporting Agency seems to have been
conceived from the o u ts e t with only the Police in mind. ^ The notions t h a t
r e p o rtin g w ill be a local r e s p o n s i b i li t y and t h a t passing information to
rep o rtees w ill be a local r e s p o n s i b i l i t y i n f e r t h a t p o lic e s t a ti o n s w ill be
the p o in t of referen ce. We are bound to ask, "What o th er i n s t i t u t i o n w ill
be open a t m aterial tim es, a v a ila b le in every l o c a l i t y and capable of
r e g i s t e r i n g convicted crim inals?"

         There are many p r a c ti c a l d i f f i c u l t i e s :

(1)      The numbers of people who may be su b je c t to an order of t h i s kind
         could a t l e a s t equate with those who are excluded under the scheme
         and th e re fo re p o t e n t i a l l y could be thousands;


(2)      Reportees       would      be     distrib u ted       randomly     throughout        the    United
         Ki ngdom;

(3)      Some Reporting Agencies might have no more than one or two persons to
         c a t e r fo r but would have to r e t a i n some s o r t o f ad m in istratio n and
         s t a f f p reparation to f u l f i l t h e i r r e s p o n s i b i l i t i e s ;


 (4)     Conversely, in o ther a r e a s , th e re may be a number of c l e a r l y
         undesirable people, who w ill have to r e g i s t e r and r e p o rt a t one time;


 (5)     How w ill proof of se rv ic e be e s ta b lis h e d in r e sp e c t of n o t i f i c a t i o n
         of designated games?

 (6)     What s o r t of en q u iries would be necessary to determine d e lib e r a te
         f a i l u r e to comply?

 (7)     What level of enquiry would th e re be to prove offences ag a in s t people
         who did not comply?
(8)    In the event of English Clubs regaining entry to European competition
       th e re could be up to t h i r t y designated matches per season.


            On the face of i t , i t would seem f a r more se n sib le fo r th e re to be Â£
cen tral agency who would receive a record of a l l r e s t r i c t i o n o rd e rs . There
does not seem to be any m erit or purpose in the su b je ct having to r e p o rt to
a local agency and r e g i s t e r any change of address lo c a l l y .                 A cen tral
r e g i s t r y could, by use of word p ro cesso rs, immediately d i s t r i b u t e , by p o st,
n o t i f i c a t i o n s and s t a t e the lo catio n of the agency to whom the sub ject
should r e p o r t. Equally a ce n tra l r e g i s t r y could send n o t i f i c a t i o n to the
"agency" who would in due course re tu rn a record of re p o rtin g or
non-reporting. Further enquiry could be by immediate summons. For t h i s to
work the onus of providing a c u r r e n t address to the r e g i s t r y and of
receiv in g documentation would have to l i e with the su b je ct.

      In s h o r t, i f   th e r e i s to be such a system               i t would   be much b e t t e r run
centrally.      I t is    r e g r e t t a b l e t h a t t h i s issu e   was not     discussed properly
before the Bi l l         was d rafted so t h a t t h i s                argument     might have been
considered, but i t       i s hopefully not too l a t e to               consider    amendment.

Dear Colleague

                                FOOTBALL SPECTATORS B IL L

You will be aware that the Football Spectators Bill which
contains  provisions   relating  to membership schemes is
currently being progressed through Parliament.

At   a  special   meeting  of  the   ACPO  General  Purposes
Sub-Committee on Hooliganism at Sporting Events, it was
agreed that I write a letter to Mr. Angel at the Home Office
indicating the views of the Committee in response to the key
elements of the Bill.

A copy of that letter is enclosed for your information.

Should there be any comment or observations you wish to make
on either the letter or the provisions of the Bill itself, I
would appreciate an early response.




                                Chief Constable

Dear Mr. Goddard

                               FOOTBALL SPECTATORS BILL

      I w rite In my capacity as Chairman o f the ACPO Sub-Committee on
Hooliganism a t Sporting even ts.

        Further to my discussion with Lord Ferrers and In pursuance o f
d iscu ssion s I know you have had with David P h illip s I an now In a p osition
to w rite to you further about the "agency" r o le .

        We have taken Into account that the provisions o f Part II were In
part a t the In stigation o f ACPO (I had personal discussion s with Graham
Angel and suggested that the B ill should Include some provision to deal
with the problems o f hooliganism abroad).             We recognise too that the
p rovisions can only be e f fe c tiv e I f they are backed by the sanction o f
criminal l i a b i l i t y and that th erefore, those In breach of the system w ill
u ltim ately be subject o f p o lice enquiry.

         As a        general rule Chief Constables are relu ctan t to accept new
p o licin g r e s p o n s ib ilitie s without additional resources and t h is was a
matter o f          concern. Equally however we are not convinced that the
a lte r n a tiv e s to p o lic e re sp o n sib ility In th is area are a ttr a c tiv e . On
balance therefore I am prepared to give guarded support to the notion o f
the P olice          service accepting the "agency" ro le with certain substantial
provisos*
       In the f i r s t ca se, as I know you are well aware, I t I s e sse n tia l th at
the arrangements for reg istra tio n and n o tific a tio n are d ealt with c en tra lly
and not a t local P olice S ta tio n s. I t i s considered that the a d iln lstr a tio n
system should be so geared that the only r esp o n sib ility a t local P olice
Stations would be to check-in reportees and forward a record o f th e ir
attendance a t material tim es. I t may a lso be that Chief Constables should
be in a p o sition to Instruct the Central Agency as to which P olice Stations
w ill be av ailab le as "reporting" s ta tio n s .     In short the Central Agency
would receive Information In respect o f those subject to "orders* d ir e c t
from the Courts; the reportee would be responsible for n otifyin g to them
any change o f address; the Central Reporting Agency would maintain an Index
and n o tify reportees o f "designated matches"; and the reportee would be
required to present n o tific a tio n documents to a P olice Station where
p articu lars would be recorded and returned to the Central Agency.
       Clearly the funding and organisation o f the Central Agency w h ilst i t
would be some kind of P olice r e sp o n sib ility has y e t to be determined and If
I t Is to be a part o f the proposed "National Football In tellig en ce Unit"
additional budgettlng w ill be required In due course.

          I am conscious that these n atters are o f sone urgency and you w ill
r e a lis e I have not had the opportunity to con sult ny colleagues widely
although the n atter has been before the Sub-Com lttee. Nonetheless In the
circumstances I f e e l I t appropriate to w rite In these terns and tr u st you
w ill recognise that we have cone some way to neetlng the requirements of
the B i l l .

     I hope you r e a lis e that t h is compromise would very much depend upon
goodwill In ensuring that the conditions to which I have referred can be
accomodated.




                                 Yours/isl ncerely

 SECT ION ONE - FOOTBALL. HUOLlGA.-ilSM

 1. 1 Tne policingof profess tonal football         matches lias
 been a major poiiee commitment over many years.          Ay the
game was become more and more Che target of hooiigaua
 tne re nay been a     progressive increase in the manpower
and    general   resource      of  tne   service    required   to
maintain    order.       EquaLIy     as   Police   tactics   and
precautions nave specialised to deal with the problem,
so perversely tne 'tactics' of the hooligans have
varied to find ways round those controls.          'inis uas lad
tne effect of spreading the problem such that in some
matches policing begins as the fans depart tiieir nome
town and continue       u n t U they return.    The planning of
such games is extensive and wide-ranging,seeding              to
anticipate the problems that saay arise with supporters
who use a variety 0 1 routes and forms of transport and
who may be m transit lor most ol the day.               In tnese
circumstances the duration of the garae at tne ground
Lcseif i.s just one aspect of the entire operation.


 i.2   The distribution of     league sides means tnat
policing football is a problem which hits the Police
Service somewhat disproportionately.      rootoali Clubs
i.end to be concentrated in tne larger connuroat Lons
wnich are anyway nard pressed by Higher rates of crime
and simply the scale of demand for everyday police
sewices.    Policing football is at least a nine monthly
commitment * hence for some forces tne demands made by
foocbail   materially  aLfect    tue  generaL   Level of
policing.

l.J    It is of course not the policing of football
crowds but the hooligans amongst tnem which are the
main problem and whilsc pevhaps obvious it should be
stated tnat it is hooliganism insport not crowds at
sporting events wiiiCii takes up police time in such
large measure.

I.-*.  Hooliganism  itself  is  not   too  difficult to
characterize although Lcs causes tnay be complex and
much more difficult to analyse.  Suffice it to say that
Che Police deal in realities andfor the Police tne
task, is fairly clear cut - to maintain order and crowd
safety by reducing the potential      for conflict and
confrontation.

1.5. Some aspects of the phenomenon of hooliganism
however warrant discussion because their recognition
has  consequences   for  policing   tactics.    Of most
significance is that the overt acts of violence and
displays of druniien aggression, the obscene chanting
and gesturing by way of challenge to the opposition all
or which we recognise as football hooLiganisra, are
transgressions   committed   by   young   maLes  loosely
organised but in common purpose and sheltered by the
cover of a large crowd.
1â¢       It i . chi.? re la 11ve anonymity afforded cue
nooligau by being part or a large crowd, many oi wnom
may iiave no wisa to cause crouble, which is both tae
problem rot' cue Police and the opportunity cor cite
or fender.

1.7    Ic .should aino be said CaaC wichin the larger
crowd of supporters there are groups, often formed
casually buc some wit.i detinite membership and existing
a.i 'unofficial supporters' ciubs', wiio clearly are bene
on croubie and have little interest in cne game.Tnis
has been seen in die way ciiey deliberaceiy gee inco cue
'wrong end',     or buy stand seats      co avoid police
supervision and after tae game commences create an
incident.   The important poinc is that caese groups are
noc casual nooii^ans out pran and organise Co creacc
trouble.

aas        sp illed        over         the         barriers       in      recent      matches

Cae      opportunity            for         con flict        and    in     p ositive       terms

1.'J  Lastly by way of opening remarks it is proper to
make tiie poinc Ciiat crowd croubie and crowd safety are
not issues tnal can be separated.    Whiist tne terrible
consequences oi trie Bradford tire are at Che rrout of
our minds the fatal casualties of the 1tleyse I Stadium
disaster1 were tne victims oi crowd disorder.        The
segregation of supporters may be necessary in the
interests oi crowd control buc terrace violence Lirce
fire can cause panic which in a crowd can be so
dangerous.   The proper balance between policing and tne
need to be able      to evacuate large numbers in an
emergency nas to be our objective.


SECTION TWO           - CURRENT           PRACTICE         IN    THE     POLICING OF
FOOTBALL_

2. 1  Although eacii Chief Constable has an individual
operational responsibility and whilst a variety of
local considerations may allow for variation there is
nonetheless  a   good   deal of   common practice  and
co-operatiou nationally in the Policing of football.

2.2    Mucn o f the current practice is based on guidance

P re ->tacch Planning

2.7    For every match an otficer is delegated tue
responsibility ot co-ordinating a planned approach. It
will be his responsibility to Liaise with die home
intelligence officer and with other departments sucn as
tne   Mounted   Section.  the    Specials, tne  Traffic
Department. Britisn Transport Police and so on.   T.c is
usually tue case that tne Division on winch die ground
is located undertakes this task.

Use or âAway' Officers

2.5.  Some forces employ officers from tne 'away team'
area who may be familiar with likely offenders in trie
away   supporters  and  can   help  local  police   in
identifying trouble makers in a crowd. This is an
option open to the Police and its use depends upon
circurnscanees.
BiTxc a.

2.'->  EopiidJi..- a. . given in the ACPO guidance to the
importance      of   good    briefing.   [t  is  generally
advantageous       to use tne same officers regularly    in
tne sa duties. Aside Â£ rota their familiarity witn Cno
ground and large crowds ic allows         for briefing to
concentrate on tne critical, and topical issues.


Away Supporters

2. 1UThe Police       generally sign and monitor car and
coaca   parks intended for the use    oi away supporters.
This   gives    early   intelligence   and reduces    the
possibility of conflicts suould home supporters seek, to
damage cars and coaches.    The Police generally maintain
a presence throughout.


2. 11    Soiae groups   of supporters are escorted to and
from   the    stadium   to   limit   tne   opportunities   to
misbehave    and    to  protect    them   from rival   fans.
Arrangements      of thiskind are    almost always    made in
respect of train loads.

Flash Points

2.12       Experience of policing football       allows the
officer   in   charge   to identii'ytf lash  points   where
confrontation between rival fans may occur.         EqualLy
tiie    Police   have to   examine routes      followed by
supporters and give attention to any derelict sites
from which      missiles or offensive    weapons     can oe
gathered by hooligans.

Stadium Searches

2.13    Whilst it isa responsibility of tiie Club and its
stewards to ensure the ground isin good snape before a
game it is common practice for tfte Police also to make
an   inspection   paying   particular  attention to any
damaged   fencing   or   litter  which can   be used as
missiles.

Offensive Weapons

2.14     This  report will consider later the vexed
question of police searcnes of footbaLl supporters.
Regardless it is always a matter of concern for the
Police that hooligans may be armed with offensive
weapons and the instances of stabbing and slashing
particularly Dy tne use of Stanley knives and modelling
knives, has increased disturbingly in the last year.
Entry into the Ground

2.15 The Police seek, to ensure c'aat turnstiles clearly
indicate vnicii group oi s u p p o r t e r - 5 t i i e y are intended t o
accommodate.    Turnstiles for tne popular parts of the
ground are often supervised b y tne Police in an effort
to ensure    segregation and to provide                     some  filter
against unruly elements.            Depending upon resources
available   and   tne  lay out of              tiie ground mounted
ofricens are otten used in ensuring orderly queueing.

2.16  It is a point worthy of note that in the Light of
new legislation the policing of turnstiles will oe
even more criticaL.

Team O fficials

2.17      The ACPO  recommendation is that all match
officials s.iouia be made aware of emergency poLicing
arrangements in tne event of pitch invasion or other
eme rgency.


Crowd Distribution - Segregation and Ground Policing

2.13    Safety certificates under the Safety or Sports
Ground Act 1975 impose limits on each section of tue
ground.It     is    a   Club    responsibility     to   monitor
turnstiLe totalisors       and crowd     movement around    the
ground to maintain these limits and customary for the
Police to ensure they are adhered to.          In co-operation
with   the Clubs      tne Police nave      sought    to ensure
facilities allow for the immediate segregation of rival
supporters    as    they   enter   thestadium.      This     is
generally by way of barriers and it is important that
eacn section of tiie ground has its own refreshment
facilities, toilets, entrance and exits.         Pitch barrier
fencing    is    general   but     notuniversal.       Current
experience indicates that it may be desirable at most
grounds and it remains a matter for Police forces to
determine in conjunction with others under the terms of
the Safety of Spores Grounds Act.

2.19  Ic i.s common practice for the Police to supervise
gangways,bars, refreshment areas and toiLets.

2.20    Some officers   aredeployed in and   around  the
ground foe the duration ox tneir tour of duty and tiiey
are generally charged to the Club.     During tne course
of the game tne number of officers inside tne ground is
increased by those on traffic points and other duties
outside.   Tney generally become a reserve to the ground
commander but their availability is not constant.
 Contingency P lanning

2.21   p re-decermined planning saouid     be available     to
cuntroi tne following contingencies:

      a.)          u'naut.ior ised movement ol supporters
             between segregated parts oi cae ground.

      b)     Serious disorder occurring in sections of
             the ground.

      c)     Pitch invasion

      d)     Where capacity has   been reacted or against
             no ticket holders.

     e)      Emergency evacuation.


2.2 1   Present advice is that Police siiouid ue familiar
witii emergency evacuation procedures as should seawards
and should be in a position to assist rapid evacuation
oi a stadium if necessary.

Post Match Escort

/.23    In some circumstances and depending upon saiety
con.side rat ions tne Police Commander may decide to hold
'away supporters' in tne ground until some of tne home
support is clear. Equally arrangements are usually made
to escort certain sections of tne crowd to Railway
Stations and Coach Parks.     If there are .several coaches
or even large numbers ot coaches it is cotaroon practice
to   assemble     them  as  a   convoy  and   escort   them
tarough traffic ensuring free flow so tiiey do not
oecoiae a target.

Traffic Arrangements

2.24    For each raatcn there is usually a fairly detailed
traffic plan, .seeking to ''.cep :5oae emergency route clear
and facilitating ready clearance of traffic.           Police
ability to manage the traffic problem may be .severely
limited by the geographical layout about the ground.
Many f o o t b a l l grounds were built many years ago in the
midst      of a cotaplex of narrow streets and terraced
housing.
SECTION THREE -RECENT DEVELOPMENTS

3.1.    Recent events marked by tragedy and disorder have
resulted in much public and political concern         and
debate.   Government has urged aii those involved with
football and its problems to examine new initiatives
and has itself taken urgent legislative steps.    Many of
the suggestions tiiat have oeen examined are matters
about    which tne aCPO and tae Police Service       have
already developed views in tiie light of experience.
 Alcohol

3.2 Tae most strongly argued issue or all has been the
assertion   that  aiucn   of   tiie  worst  behaviour   is
associated witn drunkenness.     The ACPO does not depart
from this general view aitnoug.i there are a number of
reservations about how tiie problem is best dealt with.

3.3   Firstly tiie popular reaction that alcohol at tiie
ground should be barred andpublic         houses in tne
vicinity closed is not considered eicher helpful or
equitable.     The problem ot drunkenness at Football
Stadia is not as a result of aicohoi consumed at tiie
ground but drinking en route.    The worst problems have
aiways been witn 'away' support and particularly those
who have travelled a long way.   Before alcoholic drinks
were   stopped    on  Football   Special   trains  quite
definitely the worst examples were from that source.

3.4    Alcohol consumed at tiie grounds has generally not
been tiie cause ot the    problem if forno other reason
tlian it is simply not possible to purchase sufficient
to get drunk in the time available.         It should be
pointed out that it has aiways been common practice to
close bars wnllst play is in progress and never to open
tiiein after the match.    PuoLic bars adjacent to open
seating and terracing are in all cases out of view of
tiie pitch.

3.5    The Association has argued that closing bars in
grounds can be counter productive in tnat it wiii
discourage   some away supporters     from entering the
ground until the Last      minute in  an attempt to find
alconoi elsewhere.   It has long been a police strategy
by arrangements witti Coach Operators and British Rail
for away supporters to     arrive at the ground one hour
before kicii off to ensure that the away supporters are
in the ground before the bulk of the home support
arrives,   thus  reducing  the   ris<t of confrontation
outside tae ground.


3.6 Equally, restricting sales in premises near to the
ground can result in groups of supporters wandering Car
afield   to  find  'open'  public  houses and   tnereby
widening the area of police supervision.      Much can
depend on the circumstances of a particular game and
there are times when licensees are encouraged to close
premises however.

3.7   The Police view is therefore very inucii directed
towards   the  desirability  ot   controls  rather   than
outright bans at grounds.   Tiie main problem relates to
excessive drinking whilst travelling and tuat is where
effort clearly must be concentrated.
       A British Rail ban          oil alcohol consumption on
'Lootoali specials' nas had a market! affect            out its
success has led those elements against whom ic was
directed    to seek, other f o r m s ox transport,    s u c h as
coacne j   and self-drive hire        vans.   This    kind ot
displacement makes policing that much more difficult
with many more away supporters arriving at g r o u n d * mu c h
earlier than .scheduled and in smaller groups,

3.9    The Criminal Justice (Scotland) Act 19tfu. which
was trained to tackle similar problems is considered to
have had a good measure orsuccess and its terms, under
most conditions, b a n alcohol to supporters on public
transport and at grounds.        Tne customs and ground
j-acilities in Scotland are however somewnat different
to tuose    ol tne English Football League anda simple
extension ot the Act throughout tiie U.K.       was not
considered appropriate by tne ACPO.

3. LO    Tne Sporting Events (Control ot Alcohol etc..)
Bill picks up most o l the relevant pro vis Ions o t the
Scottish Acc extending the       ban on alcohol consumed by
supporters to trains carrying supporters to and from
designated sporting events. (Sen drive Hire vans nave
noc been included.) There are similar restrictions at
grounds as to drunkenness; possession oi 'control Led
containers'; and possession oi aicohoL, but exemption
is allowed under strict conditions.        The ACPO support
tiiese provisions and the powers of enforcement but
there    is   some   reservation    aoout   tae  extent   of
restriction ot sale at grounds.      Private Members boxes,
an    important    source   oi    revenue   to  Clubs    and
trouble!ree .are the only parts oi the grounds currently
licensed which will be excluded from exemption.         This
however is more a difficulty tor the Football Ciubs as
the   Police   who   would   oniy   be affected    Ll t.iese
conditions result in lost revenue to tne ciubs many of
waoru already struggle to meet the eosc of policing.

3.11     In short excessive drinking is considered a
contributory   factor   to  H ooliganism   and Cne  new
provisions should assist tae Police in control ling the
problem.   The detail of tue Bill however is questioaed
and no doubt such difficulties reflect the speed with
which the legislation has been progressed.

Membership C a rd Schemes

3. 12   A good deal of consideration has been given by
the ACPO Sub-Committee on Hooliganism in Sport to the
question   of    'membership  cards'   and   'membership
schemes'.   in simple terms the theory is tnat entry to
the Football Ground would be restricted to 'uoua-fide
supporters who would iiave to apply for membership and
who would lose it if guilty of misbehaviour.
r.ioi'j aa., been a go o d deal of interest tium computer
ba:>ed technology companies wno ar,-jue that suou schemes
are technically viable.

3.13 T.ie ACPO nave no objection.', to cae principle:-:
involved    buc nave   raised a number oi     fundamental
question.; as co cae wording ot .such schemes which would
.iave 1.0 be answered before they were ^eea as aa answer
co hooliganism.

3.14    Ine purpose ol any scheme muse be Co exclude
chose wao become identified as uoofigans either at the
emoiaent    sla^e  or  because  01   Cheir  subsequent
behaviour.

3.15     Taose reponsible for controlling the membership
scneme nave tuereirorc Co oe in a position co establish
Cne    oona-fides    of applicants (otherwise there would
i^e noca.Ltig Co stop tae wron^ people obtaining several,
membership cards or cards in false particulars), also
ciiey aave to obtain sufficient information to cancel
tue   tneinoer.snip of  people   wao siiould properly  be
excluded.

3.16 At Che present cime guidance to tiie Police Service
-Li'om trieHome Office on the disclosure ot confidential
information would certainly prevent tne police from
being tiie intelligence source ox any such scheme run by
a private commercial interest.     Â£t is difficult to say
wnat other source of information would be available to
the operators.

     There are a lot of other questions :-

    a)     Would cancellation apply to those guilty
           of acts of hooliganism outside the ground?

    b)     Would cancellation relate to people charged
           with criminal orfences or only after a
           conviction?

    c)     Would there be a sy.stem of appeal? - in
           which case would police officer.* be calLed
           upon   to   substantiate    tne   cause   for
           exclusion.

    d)     Would cancellation foiiow from breaches of
           club rules? - if 3 0 . how would tne breach
           be estaoLished and information passed to
           the operator?

    e)     Would any system be of value unless it was
           universal? - tne main problem relates to
           away support.
     i)     tluw would sucn a system accommodate those
            attending for the first time? -â¢ any section
            ot tne ground reserved for none card
            iioi.ders would defeat tne purpose of tne
            scneme.

3.17    Having made these observations there does seem
scope however tor cluos to consider membership scnames
for   particular   parts of  the   Ground  e.g.  family
enclosures.

Ail Ticket Matches

3. id   Ail- ticket matches have been canvassed as one
way oi achieving segregation and controlling to .some
extent those attending a game.      Particularly in Cip
competitions when ticket sales are strlcced to voucner
holders or supporters club members the police find all-
ticket matches worthwnile but only wnere a capacity
crowd can    reasonably  be expected.     Otherwise, it
results in open ticket sales on matcn days which
weakens controlled segregation and runs the risk of
rival supporters being mixed together in tiie same
sections of tiie ground.


3.19     All- ticket games impose further problems for
tiie police   in that queues nave to be policed to
maintain    order  and  to   prevent  opposition  fans
infiltrating on the prescribed days for ticket sales.


3.20    It remains the view of tne ACPO that ail- ticket
games are only suitaole for capacity games.

Early Kick- Offs

3.2L     The Football League have considered arranging
matches with an early kick- off (generally li.UOam)
witn   a   view  to  diminishing.  the  opportunity  for
supporters to ootain alcohol.     It has been considered
that a game played at that time would be less likely to
attract hooligans or to develop tne rowdy atmospuere
tnat goes with excessive drinking.

3.22    The proposition seems reasonable and some games
have been played on this basis.   The problem has arisen
chough chat ou some occasions the nooiigan element
having attended tiieir own fixture have then gone to
another game being played in the afternoon with the
sole intention evidently of causing trouble.

3.23     Sucu schemes are therefore supported provided
tiiey are arranged in consultation wich tiie Police to
avoid possible clashes of that kind or other local
considerations
C-luo Initiatives

3.24    A number of ocher ideas have been suggested
particularly   tiie development of family facilities
and/or the idea of football being played before an
exclusively nome crowd.

3.25 Ail efforts to improve tne environment and the
atmosphere at a football ground are to be encouraged.
If   the  club   provider  good   facilities  and    makes
professional use of the public address system and other
entertainment  a contribution    can   be  made   to   t.ie
atmosphere at a game.       The development of family
enclosures is equally to be supported.

3.26. The 'ail home fixture' however, wuiist probably
desiraole in principle, raises difficulties.       Suca a
fixture    may   provide  a   challenge   for  the   'away
supporters'    and prove   difficult   to Police.     This
initiative however, if It were to be supported by the
League, would have to be carefully considered and each
rnatcn being assessed in the context of other games
wnicn rnignt be affected.

CCTV

3.27   Most of the foregoing issues relate one way or
another to ways in whicn access to a football ground
can be limited or controlled.  The development of CCTV
has as its primary purpose control of behaviour once
people are inside the stadium, and as they enter or
leave.

3.28   A good deal of careful consideration iias already
been given to this question and in 1964 the Football
Trust    funded   experimental   schemes   in    Greater
Manchester, the 'West Midlands, and Edinburgh.     These
schemes are still in tne process of being evaluated and
mucn   has  been  learnt.     In addition  the use of
individual video cameras at some matches such as tiie
fixture between huddersfieid Town and Leeds United has
shown that excellent evidence capable of persuasive use
in the Courts can be obtained.

3.29 The ACPO Sub-Coiamitcee on Hooliganism in Sport has
been monitoring these developments and as a matter of
policy has taken tiie view that the development of CCTV
for both management information and evidence gathering
is beneficial and should be pursued.

3.30 The ACPO's Suo-Committee representative to the
Footuail Trust    has attended a number of meetings
concerning the funding oi such schemes and at present a
Working Party has taken on the job of developing a
specification as a matter of urgency.
      lae Scientific Research and Development Srancn at
 J. j L
 the ilome Office are pace/ Co these discussions a ad use
 oc a vehicle for observing crowd behaviour which has
 been developed by S.R.D.3. is also being evaluated.


 SECTION FOUR - INTELLIGENCE

4.1    MoiiC of Cue foregoing coaraent relaces co issues
 tnat have oeen specifically raised by Governraenc and
oucside agencies.    Prior Co die racent troubles wiiicii
nave focused attention, die ACPO Sub-Committee o;i 'ti:e
initiative of the Chairman had sougnt Co re-examine the
Police InCelf igence network for dealing with football
aooiigani.su.   A  scruccure  based   on  local  liaison
officers is already in being and nas proved of greac
value over tae years but Che Sub Committee felt taaC
the informaCion being fed Co cliem needed to be improved
and Cue sysCein oi intelligence gaChering made more
comprehensive.

4.2 â  Since that time ail Police Forces have been
consulted and the framework, for a new Intelligence
system based on the cotap re nensive documentation of
crowd beiiaviour at eacn match aas been drawn up.   It i.s
anticipated tnaC Che new intelligence syscern will be
operating from Che commencement ot the coming season.

SECTION FIVE - POLICE POWERS

5.1    Tactically Che Police have a number of opcion.s
open co taea when dealing with disorderly behaviour ac
football maCches.   One opCion is Co ejecc individuals
whose conduce may have fallen short of taac which
constitutes a criminal offence buc is nonetneless in
breach of ground rules and regulations.

5.2    Generally speaking however where there i.s evidence
ot   a    substantive   offence,    offenders       are charged.
Offences of      'assault1 ( ' w o u n d i n g s ' actual bodily
aarm', 'Police Assault'),         'possession of offensive
weapons' and 'criminal damage' are well established in
the criminal law and subjecc co che quÂ«ality of evidence
Police powers co deal wich chese circuniscanees are not
irt question.     There are however some difficulties of
enforcement in respect of Public Order offences and
recent decisions of tne Courts have made Sec cion 5 of
tae Public Order Act 1936 more difficult to prove.            It
is recognised that the old common law offences are
unwieldy although the preventive power.* available to
Cne Police for breaches of che peace are valuable in
some circumscances.     However, in Che lignt of the Whice
Paper - âThe Review of Public Order Law" - chere is no
greac meric in arguing currenc legal incerprecacion of
public order offences.       By and large che ACPO gives
supporc Co che new proposals for offences of RioC;
Violent Disorder and Affray.          Some of these offences
have a clear relevance to the prooiera of hooliganism.
Tue   WiUte  Paper   al;>o refers to  an   offence  ol
'Disorderly Conduct' wnicu as yet i.-> not clearly
worded.     The ACPO wiil Look for wider discussion on
tnis point.

3. J     The powers conferred on the Police ia the new
Sporting Events (Control ot Alcohol etc. ) bilx nave
been briefly referred to.   They allow for the search of
puoiie transport used by fans In transit where there
are grounds to suspect ctiere may oe offences; powers to
search for alcohol and 'controlled containers' sucii as
bottles,    cans etc., and  to dealwith people who are
drunk, at sporting events.

5.4      It is lively tuat the turnstiles wii.1 be tiie
testing ground for the effectiveness of a gooJ part of
tills legislation in tiie couing season.  The Policing of
turnstiles is always      important and the power:* and
offences   under the    new Bill will allow for effective
policing.      If chere  isa constraint it is of course
Cnat these provisions will require more police officers
to make them eirective.      The problem ot resource and
finance is dealc with elsewhere (Paragraph 7.i).

5.5.   Customarily  supporters have    been searched  by
police for of tensive weaponsor missiles as taey have
thought necessary   betore they enter Cue ground.     In
aliuost all cases this has been with consenc and has
been largely unchallenged.      however the Police and
Criminal   Evidence Acc   1984 has   laid down precise
guidelines regarding police searches which in essence
require an ofticer to have       reasonable grounds  for
suspecting thac he wiil find stolen or prohibited
articles before iie carries out a search and in all
cases a written record of tiie search must be made and
handed to the individual concerned.

5.6     It  is tne >fiew of     the ACPO    that routine,
preventive  searches of football supporters      are not
adequately catered for in tiie PACE Act nocwi.cnstanding
tne proviso in the Act's Codes of Practice wnicn
seemingly exeapts from     its   provisions searches   at
Sports Grounds witn consent or as a condition of entry.
The ACPO take the view that an 'authorisation' to
search on this basis cannot be recommended because it
enjoins a   police power too    closely to che football
clubs   and  could   therefore   place   in   jeopardy  a
constable's  position in     Law shouid nis action be
challenged.

5.7    As to the enforcement of 'Public Order L,aw' at
major sporting events tne Police Commander at Che scene
iias always co be aware ot practical considerations.
Every arrest takes one or more officers from the line
and arrests made at tiie wrong time may worsen the
situation.
iuKietiie i < s i     ic     is     die   scrong    view    oi  die       ACPO c h a c

SECTION SIX - SAFETY OF SPORTS GROUNDS ACT 1975

Safecy Cercificaces

6. 1   Since che Safecy of Spores Grounds Acc 1975 came

Cina Ace has applied Coall First and Second Division
Football League grounds and will soon be extended C o

foocbaii season.     Tiie Government has said tnat it
intends also to extend its provisions to Kugby League
Club grounds sometime in the near future.

o.i   A h issuing local authority is required to consult
with che Cnief Conscabie oi che area in whieu ciie

Aichough tnere is no limic or restriction on tne
conditions whicn a local auciioricy may impose on a

       (i) It is coasidered essential ciiac a separate
           police office, clearly signposted, shouid
           be available ac che ground. The office
           should provide adequate accommodation for
           enquiries and reporting. and ciie processing
           of prisoners.   There should oe a secure
           decencion room for che shore cerm
           accommodacion of prisoners. The office
           s.iould be siced so ciiac there is adequate
           vehicular access for ciie unobtrusive removal
           of prisoners.

I                It wouij be desirable ii either
                 a pose office tu Lepaone line or a direct Line
                 co tiie nearest police station were available.

I       (ii)     It is essential that a control room is
                 provided to oversee police operations in tue
                 ground. Provision should he made lor a base
I                station to control tne Li.H.F. police radio.
                 It shouid be possible to nave a direct access
                 to the ground public address system and a
                 telephone Line co tiie local poLice station.
I
        (iii)    Before tiie stadium is used on any occasion for
                 a specific activity the certificate holder
I                consult wich the local police concerning
                 the attendance ot sufficient number of
                 police officers for the purpose of
                 maintaining lawrui. and orderly behaviour
I                among persons attending tiie stadium.


I       (iv)     The holder shall agree with tne Chief
                 Constable 14 days before each occasion when
                  the specified activity takes place on the
                 method of admission (ail- ticket) and the
I                 methods to be used tor tne segregation oL
                  home and away supporters.

I       (v)      All containers for the sale of drinkssnail be
                 of plastic or paper material.

        (vi)     The holder in co-operation
I                witn Police is to take reasonable steps to
                 ensure no person enters or remains in tiie
                 stadium witn auy glass, bottle or can.
I
        (vii)    No accumulation of rubbish, bricks, stones or
                 other materials which in the opinion of the
                 Chief Officer of Police are capable of use as
1                missiles shall be permitted to remain in any
                 part of the stadium to whicn spectators have
                 access.
I
        (viii)   Portable television cameras and equipment
                 shall be placed in such a position as may
I                be agreed between the holder and cue Cnief
                 Constable.

I
        ( ix)    No vehicles other than emergency (police,
                 fire, ambulance) shall be parked in any
I                part of the stadium except as shown on any
                 plan or as agreed with the Chief Constable
                 or tiie senior police oificer.

i
I   (x)       The Chief Constable or his
               representative r.iust be informed as soon as
i             possible of any re-arranged football fixture.

    (xi)      When, owing to the condition of the ground, a
              cauceLLation .of the match is lively, a police
i              representative should be present when the
              ground is inspected.


i   Stewards

    6.5   Whilst the police have no direct control over the
i   employment of stewards at football grounds, they can
    exert indirect control by means of conditions inserted
    in safety certificates issued under the Safety of
I   Sports Grounds Act, 1975. It is most important tuat
    stewards are sufficient in number, suitably deployed,
    weil trained and capable mentally and physically of
I   carrying out their routine and emergency functions.
    Again there is substantial ACPO guidance as follows :-

           Tiie number of stewards employed by tiie management
â¢          of tiie ground should be determined in consultation
           with   tiie police and shouid be based on tiie
           requirement dictated by the structural properties
I          of the ground in relation to an average crowd for
           a particular fixture.

           One method of indirect control is provided by the
I          Sarety of Sports Grounds Act 1975 at tnose grounds
           which are required to be certified.      The Local
           Authority, before issuing a Safety Certificate, is
           required to consult the Chief Officer of Police
1          regarding the terms and conditions to be included
           in the Certificate.

I          Persons employed as stewards at footaall grounds
           should be clearly identifiable by armbands, coat
           or other distinguishing feature.    They should, at
           all   times,  be   under  the  direct   control  of
I          supervisors whose identities should be made known
           to the police officers on duty at the ground.

           Stewards   snould be distributed   throughout  tiie
           ground in accordance witn a detailed pre-arranged
           schedule, agreed between tne police and management
I          of the ground.

           Tneir   duties   may   be   divided   into   four   main
           categories:-
I

i

I
(a)    c o n t r o l l i n g o r d i r e c t i n g members or th e p u b l i c
       who a r e e n t e r i n g o r l e a v i n g t h e f o o t b a l l g r o u n d .

(b)    patroLILng the ground to deal with any emergencLes
       e.g. raising alarms, extinguishing tires etc.,

(c)    manning e n t r a n c e s , e x i t s and o t h e r s t r a t e g i c
       p o i n t s , p a r t i c u l a r l y e x i t d o o r s , g a t e s and r o l L e r
       s h u t t e r s which are not c o n t i n u o u s l y open w h i l s t
       the ground Is in use;


(d)    undertaking s p e c if ic d u tie s             relatin g      to   emergency
       and e v a c u a t i o n p r o c e d u r e s .

In particular they may have to undertake the following
duties:-

(a)    man any final exit door or gate which is locked
       during the game and ensure that at Least one
       steward manning any gate has the key to the gate
       continuously on his person during that time.

( b)   open th ese doors or g a te s to perm it e v a c u a tio n                     in
       an em ergency, o r , in o rd er to c l e a r tne ground                        at
       L u ll tim e , a t a time p r e - a r r a n g e d betw een tne
       p o l i c e and the management o t the ground.

(c)    ensure that aiL means of entry and exit are kept
       free from obstacles;

(d)    ensure that mobile sales staff do not position
       equipment so as to obstruct exit routes.

Stewards play a vitaL part in tiie maintenance of public
safety standards at football ground and accordingly
must be physically and mentally fit to assume this
responsibility.   Tiiey should receive training in first
aid and fire fighting and suould aLso be rehearsed in
emergency procedures.


The importance of the provision of formaL emergency
procedures at each gro.und cannot be over emphasized.
Joint consultation in this respect should take pLace
between police, the management of the ground, fire,
ambulance and otiier services.      It is essential tiiat
stewards and their supervisors are fully cognisant of
tiie part that tiiey have to play in the plans which are
produced.   The management: of the ground should ensure
that written instructions concerning the action to be
taken in the event of an emergency are made readily
available to all staff and stewards and, in particular,
that   all   the   staff  and  stewards should    receive
practical instruction and training appropriate to their
responsibilities     in  the  event   of an    emecgency.
axetc ises for che ^Caii ana stewa-ds should oe carried

     (c)   name of tne person giving the instructions

     (d)   names ol tne persons receiving tiie
           in.st rue cions

     (e)   nature of instruction or exercise

After initiai practice instruction all members ot staff
and stewards should receive verbal instruction, given
by a coape tent person, at ..east once in every period ol:
three  months   at   regular  intervals.    Consideration
shouid be given to providing brie ting cards to stewards
relevant to particular points

Stewards who patrol the ground in order to deal wich
emergencies may be cLassiied cis âEmergency Stewards'.

If an emergency arises in any section ot tne ground it
saould be the responsibility of the Emergency Steward
co   immediately  notify  tnc  police   ground  control
operator and tne section supervisor where appropriate.
It the emergency is a tire or suspicion oi a tire tiie
Emergency Steward snouid also operate tae nearest Fire
Alarm Control Point and tackle the lire using tne
nearest available correct tire extinguisher.      Other
stewards in the same section snouid render ail possiDie
assistance.

Il tiiere is a possiDility of tne need to evacuate any
section(o) of the ground, a suitable message should be
broadcast over the public address system, subject to
tne discretion oC the senior police officer present.
On hearing this broadcast tae Emergency Stewards and
their supervisors who are on duty in tiie sectioa(s)
concerned should proceed to the Emergency Assembly
Poinc (wnich wiLi have been designated in the written
instruction) and await directions.      Other stewards
should remain at tiieir positions.    It the emergency
passes without there being a need to evacuate, a
suitable message wiii oe broadcast and ail stewards
snouid resume normal duties.
Ii it Lo necessary Co evacuaCe any sec clones) ot Cue
grounds, an appropriate inscruccion should be given co
cue Emergency Steward or his supervisor by the senior
police officer and to stewards employed on exits by a
suitable   mecnod   or  meCuods.    On   receiving C;iLs

of foocbaii grounds in ciie efficient and ei'iective use
of stewards. 'Although their employment is not directly
controlled by police, indirect control is facilitated,
in many cases, by means of condicions inserted in
Safety CertificaCes.


6.6 Whiisc ACPO guidance is coinprenensive perhaps one
issue needs co be addressed. There      is ac presenc no
general system of inspection of scewarding and it is
considered chac a condicion shouid be wriccen inco
Safecy Cercificaces requiring Police inspeccion.

SECTION SEVEN -THE COST OF POLICING

7.1 The cose of policing foocbaii is perhaps one of cue
most imporcant issues for che ACPO. Ic can be argued
tuac che spore itself should fooc che bill buc this is
simply noc a praccical answer.      A good deal of che
policing of foocbaii calces pLace away from che ground
and   chere is no basis     for making charges.     The
financial scacus of most football clubs themselves is
such anyway that any major increase in policing costs
would make them insolvent.     In stark reality if the
Police were to insist upon far greater levels of
policing at gaines(or indeed charge the clubs for ail
che officers chat now accend) che whole struccure of
che professional spore would have Co change.
I

t   â â¢L    In fact Cue Police generally charge tne Club for
    chose oil:leers desi^naced Co ground duties ror the full
    taatcn.     It is usual practice for tiie officers on
I   outride duties to return to the ground during t.ie game
    where they form a substantial reserve - these officers
    are not generally charged for.

I   7.4 The legal oÂ£>libation to maintain a proper level of
    policing is clear and if football clubs sougat to
    continue with fixtures witiiout policing the power under
    Section 10 of Safety at Sports Grounds Act could be
Â«   invoked to prevenc tae game taking place.

    7.5 Whilst both the Police and Clubs are making every
    effort to deal with their financial difficulties the
I   problem remains.

    7.6    Perhaps the greater financial problem for the
I   Service is the sheer cost or policing football which
    cannot be offset against football clubs. As stated
    earlier in chis report (paragraph 1.2) the burden falls
    unevenly - Appendix A snows distriDution of ciuba as
I   against nose police forces.     It inouLd also be 3aid
    that if tue Police are to take new initiatives and seek
    for powerful enforcement of new legislation this v/ill
K   in its turn translate into policing coscs.

    There are presently two possibilities :

I   eitner policing football is specially provided for in
    Police budgets particularly by way of      an increased
    provision for overtime; or football ij policed oy
I   reducing the Levels of policing elaewhere.

    7.7   It is tiie view ot the a CPO tnat this problem is
    not satisfactorily resolved and tiiat Forces having a
I   considerable   commitment  to   football  need  special
    provision.

I   SECTION EIGHT - GUIDANCE TO CHIEF POLICE OFFICERS

    6. 1   The Association of Chief Police Officers througn
    its system of Committees is      involved in examining
I   critical issues of Policing policy where there is a
    need for common standards or where tiie problems cross

I   geographical    boundaries.        Whilstoperational
    responsibility is entirely in tiie hands of the local
    Chief Constable guidance formulated by the Association
    is generally acaieved by consensus and forms the Dasis
    of much common practice.

 SECTION NINE - CONCLUSIONS Ai\D RECO MME XPAX IONS

9.1    Section One - Football hooliganism

       (i)       Hooliganism i.s violent group behaviour
                 using tae cover ol: iarge crowd.* to avoid
                 individual rasponsioiiity.    Police
                 ..nitLative to counter tae Hooligan are
                 aj.med at masting the individual accountable
                 (inte1Ligence and CCTV) and at controlling
                 group misbehaviour (segregation, planning,
                 ground controia).

       (ii)     'Safety and emergency procedures' and
                crowd control' are complementary and tne
                rigiit balance between concai.iment fencing
                and emergency exit facilities lias to be
                fo u nd.




9.2    Section Two - Current Practice in Policing
                    FootbalL.

      (i)      Current advice by the ACPO to Chief
               Officers in respect of football is
               conprenensive. well tried and .sound.
                It is presently being reviewed in the
                light oi new legislation and new
                initiatives.

      (ii)      Publication of guidance i.s in tne process
                or being prepared for wider circulation
                within the Service.

).3   Section Three - Recent Developments

      (i)      Drunkenness is a material factor in
               hooliganism and the problem largely relates
               to consumption by 'away support' whilst
               en route and not alcohoi consumed ac tne
               ground.

      (ii)     The new âSill' is generally supported by
               the ACPO and provides powers to deal with
               many aspects of tiie problem.
      (j-J--L)    Tne ACPO are however concerned at some
                  issues and observe that tiie speed of
                  enactment has not aiLowed lor detailed
                  consultation.
                  (Particularly the need to include private
                  nire mini buses in the restrictions; and
                  to widen tne exemption to include private
                  viewing boxes.)

     (iv)         Membership card schemes are not .seen as
                  an answer to hooliganism because of the
                  practical and legal Â«lifficulties of making
                  a scheme effective.  There may be some
                  benefit however in tnc development of
                  family enclosures within grounds.

     (v)          'Aii- ticket fixturesâ are only suitable
                  for 'capacity games' and require close
                  supervision oi: ticket sales.

     (vi)        "Early kick- offs" probably attract less
                 problems but must not be arranged without
                 considering the possibility of the rowdy
                 element attending otner fixtures
                 af terwa rds.

     (vii)       The ACFO recognise tnat the hone CLub can
                 do a good deal Dy providing amenities to
                 promote a friendly atmosphere and tiie
                 Police are keen to co-operate where
                 appropriate.


     (viii) The ACPO strongly supports the development
            ox CCTV for evidence gathering and
            providing management information.
            Evaluation of early schemes has led to
            modifications and the ACPO is in
            consultation with tiie home Office 'SPJ)B'
            and the Football Trust to develop a
            specification and extend usage.


9.4 Section Four - Intelligence

     (i)         Intelligence gathering   aas been reviewed
                  and refined and a far   more comp re tiens Lve
                  and systematic scheme   ha.j been designed
                  and will be operative   next season.

9.5 Section Five â¢â¢ Police Powers

     (i)         It is generally Police practice to
                  prefer charges wiiere there is evidence of
                  a substantive offence although 'ejection'
                  may be appropriate in some instances sucii
                  as breach of ground rules.
I
         (ii)    Pi'oposaij for changes in cue Public Order
1                uaw may be of advantage for policing
                 hooliganism.    The Power under die Sporting
                 Events (Control of Alcohol) Bill wiLL
                 allow for inorc effective policing
I                pare icular ly ac turnstile.; but tnare will
                 be resource implications.

I        (iii)   Police powers of search remain a difficulty
                 and che ACPO i s not convinced that cite


f                terms of tae guidance Co cne Codes under
                 Che Police and Criminal Evidence Act 1964
                 resolve t h i s issue.           Police powers oased
                 on a c o n d i t i o n o f e n t r y a r e not c o n s i d e r e d

t        (iv)
                 as appropriace.

                 The ACPO look for .support in Che positive
                 policing of hooliganism in cne coming
                 season and emphasise Che need Co curb Che
I                rowdy and intimidating behaviour from
                 which the vioLence springs.   It is
                 anticipated that developments in CCTV and
I                Intelligence will make a signiLicant
                 contribution.


I   9.6 Section Six - Safety of Sports Grounds Acc 1975.

         (i)     ACPO guidance on Safety Certificates
                 and Stewards is comprehensive and
I                up to date. The Act provides for
                 local conditions in Certificates a.s
                 necessary, but tiie ACPO taxe tne
I                view tnat routine police inspection of
                 stewarding should be a condition.

    9.7 Section Seven - The Cost of Poficiug.
I
         (i)     The cost of.policing which is chargeable to

I                Football Ciuâ
                             os is only a pare of the total
                 cost. A number of Football Clubs are
                 finding great difficulty in paying the
                 Police although it i.s noted that tnese
                 charges cnanot be avoided and tne Police
I                would have the power to seek tiie closure of
                 a ground if it was not adequately policed.

I        (ii)    The burden of policing football falls
                 heavily on certain forces, particularly
                 those in large connuraations where other
                 pressures are ai.so great.  In times of
I                budgetary constraint -special provision is
                 necessary.

V   9.3 Section Eight - ACPO Guidance to Chief Police
                       Officers

                 ACPO guidance is comprenensive and subject
I                of current review.

 a)     Any comments on the Interim r e p o rt , with p a r t i c u l a r reference to the
        Provisional Recommendations


 RECOMMENDATION 1 .            Evacuation procedures should be a matter of po li ce
                               t r a i n i n g and form p a r t of the b r ie fin g by Police
                               o f f i c e r s before every match.


                               This has been agreed and now forms p a r t of the
                               Policy of the ACPO.

 RECOMMENDATION 2.             The local a u th o r it y team responsible for issuing
                               sa fety c e r t i f i c a t e s in respect of designated
                               grounds   should as             her etofore include po li ce
                               officers.


                               Supported by th e ACPO.

RECOMMENDATION 3.              Early a t t e n t i o n should be given to the Home Office
                               D irecto rate of Telecommunications to consider the
                               p r a c t i c a l i t y of producing a more s u i t a b l e personal
                               radio for the p o lic e .


                              For some time the ACPO Technical and Research
                              Committee has been exploring the p o s s i b i l i t y of
                              improving radio communications in public disorder
                              s i t u a t i o n s where ambient noise i s a problem.       The
                              rep o rts so f a r received are less than encouraging
                              and have prompted th e explanation of a l t e r n a t i v e
                              measures to improve the standard of communication
                              a t sporting events, including an improvement in the
                              number and q u a li t y of d i r e c t , la n d - l i n e links
                              within grounds.

                                     the    meantime     the         D ir ecto rate of
                              Telecommunications remain f u l l y aware of th e needs
                              of the Police and i s continuing to monitor the
                              development of experimental p r o j e c t s .

RECOMMENDATION 4 .            The Green Guide should be amended to include in
                              paragraph 11 a provision t h a t wherever p r a c t ic a b le
                              roads within a q u a r te r mile of sp o rts grounds
                              should be l e f t e n t i r e l y f re e of parked v eh icles .


                             As most football league grounds are located in
                             densely populated urban areas with l i t t l e provision
                             for o f f s t r e e t parking t h i s recommendation would
                             prove extremely d i f f i c u l t f o r th e police to
                             enforce. Obviously emergency access routes need to
                             be maintained a t a l l times but to enforce a
                             complete      ban     on    parking     would  present   a
                             cons iderable drain on po lice resources.
                     Paragraph 11.3 of th e Green Guide reads: wherever
                     p ossib le access roads should provide for the
                     parking of emergency vehicles so t h a t e x i t routes
                     used by crowds are not se rio u s ly obstructed.

                     NOTE: Popplewel1 Report para 3.35 acknowledges t h a t
                     parked vehicles did not hinder emergency vehicles
                     a t the Bradford d i s a s t e r and accepts t h a t the
                     implementation of such measures in London and other
                     major c i t i e s may prove impossible because of the
                     lo cation of the ground.
RECOMMENDATION 5.    Consideration should be given to making i t a
                     criminal offence in England and Wales to have a
                     smoke bomb or s i m i l a r device a t sp orts grounds.


                     I t i s important to cover in the criminal law a l l
                     devices which "may do no actual damage but the
                     panic which they are l i k e l y to engender among
                     sp e ctato rs i s very great" and to al so cover all
                     crowds in which panic can cause death and serious
                     in ju r y . Such an offence should t h e r e f o r e include:-

                     (a)   possession a t , in or while attempting to gain
                           entry t o ;

                     (b)   any sporting event, public entertainment,
                           public meeting or procession  or public
                           gathering;

                    (c)    or at such a place, a c t i v a t e s or attempts to
                           ac t i vate;

                    (d)    any smoke bomb, pyrotechnic device                  ( e .g .
                           th u n d e r -f l a s h , or explosive firework),   flare
                           or any s i m i la r a r t i c l e ;

                    (e)    without lawful au t h o r i t y or reasonable excuse.

                    The qualifyin g phrase (e) excludes people in such a
                    place who have l e g itim a te reasons f o r possessing
                    such a r t i c l e s ( e .g . where fireworks are p art of the
                    entertain m ent). The wider d e f i n i t io n of pro hib ited
                    a r t i c l e s seeks to include a l l those which can cause
                    panic through f e a r of a f i r e or explosion.           The
                    provision covering " a c t iv a ti n g or attempting to
                    a c t i v a t e " covers such cases as th ose where a person
                    l i g h t s a device held by someone e l s e or is seen to
                    l i g h t a device but "possession" cannot be proved.

                    Such an offence would require a s p e c i f i c power to
                    search, se ize and a r r e s t ; se iz u re may be a useful
                    a l t e r n a t i v e to a r r e s t in minor cases where a
                    j u v e n i l e or o th er person commits th e offence
                    through inadvertence r a t h e r than c u l p a b i l i t y .

RECOMMENDATION 6.    Those managing sp orts grounds not covered by sa fe ty
                     c e r t i f i c a t e s should give serious co nsidera tion,
                     with the a s s i s t a n c e of f i r e a u t h o r i t i e s to the
                     presence in a ground of s u i t a b l e f i r e - f i g h t i n g
                     equipment.


                     This item is d ir e c t e d a t Sports Grounds Management
                     and the Fire Service.
RECOMMENDATION 7.    Stewards a t a l l sports grounds should be tr a i n e d in
                     f i r e f i g h ti n g .


                    This recommendation                  i s supported by th e ACPO,
                    however, i t r a i s e s an          important question concerning
                    whose r e s p o n s i b i l i t y   i t ought to be to t r a i n and
                    inspect stewards (See                comments on page 11)
RECOMMENDATION 8.   In designated grounds i t should be a term of the
                    s a fety c e r t i f i c a t e s t h a t an adequate f i r s t aid room
                    should be provided.


                    This i s a matter which receives the fu l l support of
                    the ACPO.
RECOMMENDATION 9.   There should be urgent consultatio n between the
                    Health        and Safety  Executive    and the    Fire
                    Au th orities and Local A uthorities as to how best to
                    co- ordinate and communicate t h e i r inspection and
                    r e p o rts .


                    The f i r s t point to be made 1- t h a t a safety
                    c e r t i f i c a t e i s issued by the Local Authority for an
                    " i n d e f i n i t e period".    Thereafter , th e Green Guide
                    recommends t h a t "a d e t a i l e d inspection of the
                    ground, including a l l components and i n s t a l l a t i o n s
                    should be c a r r i e d out annually to ensure compliance
                    with the guidelines in t h i s Code." (para 4 . 1 ) .

                    NOTE: The Green Guide i s a voluntary code without
                    legal face.

                    Recorranendations made by th e annual inspection team
                    may be                 incorporated into   existing      s a fety
                    c e r t i f i c a t e s , " i f i t appears appropriate to the
                    Local Authority so to do." (para 4 . 1 ) .

                    I t i s important t h a t those involved in the
                    c e r t i f i c a t i o n process should also come t og ether to
                    carry out annual inspect ions and t h a t the findings
                    of each team member be communicated to th e r e s t in
                    the          form of w ritte n r e p o r t s .    Any        general

                    r e s p o n s i b i l i t i e s must also be brought to t h e i r


                             -   3 -
                     immediate a t t e n t i o n for whatever action i s deemed
                     app ro pria te .

                     Police should comment upon matters such as crowd
                     capacity ,     stewarding          standards   and t r a i n i n g ,
                     conduct of bars and refreshment a reas, t u r n s t i l e
                     procedures, egress and ingress and any other
                     matters a f f e c ti n g s a fe ty and crowd c o n tr o l.

                     The ACPO recommendation i s t h a t th e annual
                     inspection                 be   reinforced by   a  system   of
                     r e - c e r t i f i c a t i o n when the Local Authority would
                     consider written r e p o r t s .
RECOMMENDATION 10.   Stewards in a l l grounds should not only be tr a in e d
                     in f i r e precautions and f i r e f ig h tin g but should
                     also be t r a i n e d in how best to help the police in
                     evacuation.


                     Agreed. The general standards of stewards should
                     be a matter reported on annually by the Police (see
                     comment in previous recommendations).
RECOMMENDATION 11.   Paragraph 6.14.6 of the Green Guide should be
                     amended to read "All e x i t gates should be manned at
                     a l l times while the ground is used by the public
                     and be capable of being opened immediately from
                     in sid e by anyone in an emergency."


                     Agreed. The present wording of para 6.14.6 reads
                     "All e x i t gates should be manned a t a l l times while
                     the ground i s used by th e public so t h a t they can
                     be opened imrsdiately in an emergency."
RECOMMENDATION 12.   The Green Guide should be amended to contain                                a
                     s p e c i f i c provision in r e l a t i o n to stewards;

                     i)      t h a t they should be tr a i n e d and i n s t r u c t e d t o

                            evacuation;

                     ii)     t h a t they            should    be   given   w ritte n
                            i n s t r u c t i o n s about the action to be taken in
                            cases of emergency;

                     iii)    t h a t they            should           receive     p r a c t ic a l
                            i n s t r u c t i o n and t r a i n i n g appr opriate t o t h e i r
                            responsibility;

                     iv)      t h a t no-one should be employed as a steward
                            unless they have been so in s tr u c te d and
                            t r a i n e d ; and

                     v)      t h a t they should be adequate in number,
                            physically and mentally capable of performing
                            their        duties,  effectively   deployed,

                            _ 4 -
                              effectively           supervised        and       readily
                              identifiable.


                     Agreed.   The standards and t r a i n i n g of stewards
                     should be sp e cified within sa fe t y c e r t i f i c a t e s .
RECOMMENDATION 13.   Building of new permanent stands of combustiable
                     m a te r ia ls should be prohibited as a general r u l e .


                     Agreed. This i s a matter f o r the football clubs,
                     Local Au tho rities and th e Fire Service.
RECOMMENDATION 14.   Suitable and adequate e x i t s should be provided in
                     a l l sp o rts grounds.


                     Agreed.              The ACPO takes the view t h a t a l l e x i t
                     gates should be stewarded and not l e f t unattended
                     during spor ting events.                Consideration should be
                     given to i n s t a l l i n g standardised locking systems
                     f o r a l l e x i t gates with keys being issued to
                     stewards and to po lice o f f i c e r s on duty. This i s a
                     common p r a c ti c e a t many grounds and works t o the
                     s a t i s f a c t i o n of a l l concerned.
RECOMMENDATION 15.   No smoking should take place in combustible stands,
                     t h a t t h i s should be a condition of entry to the
                     ground and t h a t signs to t h i s e f f e c t should be
                     prominently displayed.

RECOMMENDATION 22.   There should be a s p e c i f i c offence in England and

                     In i t s response to the White Paper Review of Public
                     Order Law (Cmnd 9510), the Association of Chief
                     Police Officers stro ng ly recommended t h a t t h e r e
                     should be a criminal offence of m iss ile throwing

                     d e a l t with as "vio lent behaviour." The example of
                     m iss iles being thrown a t football matches was c i te d

                            as an example of the s o r t of problem we sought to
                            deal with under such a provision.

                            There i s a need for a general law to deal with:

                                 "any person who throws or attempts to
                                 throw a m iss ile of a kind capable of
                                 causing in ju ry with i n t e n t t o cause
                                 in jury or whereby injury i s l i k e l y to
                                 be caused."

                            I t should be noted t h a t such an offence would
                            re quire a power of a r r e s t and should be appli cable
                            in any public place as well as sp orting arenas and
                            places    of public entertainment,                   for m i s s il e
                            throwing has become a se rious problem andpublic
                            disapproval of t h i s dangerous p r a c t ic e should be
                            expressed in s p e c i f i c l e g i s l a t i o n .

RECOMMENDATION 23:          Football Clubs should review t h e i r arrangements f o r
                            entry and the o rgan is atio n of t h e i r t u r n s t i l e s .


                           Agreed.             The number, location and control of
                           t u r n s t i l e s i s an important cons ideration which, i f
                           lacking can lead to a build-up of tension which can
                           manifest i t s e l f in violence.          General guidelines
                           are to be found in th e Green Guide para 5.1
                           "Turnstiles should be of such numbers as to admit
                           a t a r a te whereby no unduly large crowds are

                            Consideration should be given to including a
                            se cti on on t u r n s t i l e q u a l i t y , control and numbers
                            within the terms of s a fe ty c e r t i f i c a t e s .

RECOMMENDATION 24.          Consideration should be given to the design of a
                            standard e f f i c i e n t perimeter fence with proper
                            exits.


                           This receives th e f u l l e s t support of the ACPO.
PROVISIONAL RECOMMENDATIONS:

I)    I am minded t o recommend t h a t in England and Wales the Police should be
      given the u n fettered r i g h t of search before entry t o f o otball grounds
      by S t a t u t e .

     Searching was al s o d e a l t with in the ACPO response to the White Paper
     as a se rious d eficiency in th e criminal law.             There i s a c l e a r
     requirement for a workable power to search fo r offensive weapons and
     other a r t i c l e s intended for causing in jury or alarm in connection with
     any large gathering of people where the police suspect t h a t violence
     may occur, such as gang-fights , f o otb all matches, seaside hooligans,
     demonstrations, e t c .



                                       - 7 -
 The new complaints procedure and a proper in s i s t e n c e on co rrec t
 procedures emphasised by the Police and Criminal Evidence Act have made
 i t imperative t h a t the police be given proper covering legal a u th o r ity
 and do not have to rely on such nebulous concepts as "implied consent"
 or to risk exceeding t h e i r powers.

To enforce a provision r e l a t i n g to offens ive weapons and other
p o t e n t i a l l y dangerous a r t i c l e s requires t h a t the police have the
au t h o r i ty to determine whether an individual has any in his possession.
Some provision has been provided in the Police and Criminal Evidence
Act for a po lice o f f i c e r to search someone for a "prohibited" a r t i c l e ,
but not "unless he has reasonable grounds for suspecting t h a t he will
find stolen or prohib ited a r t i c l e s . "         The Code of P ractice makes i t
c l e a r t h a t "Reasonable su spicion , in c o n t r a s t to mere suspicion must be
founded on f a c t . "

While such a provision may be j u s t adequate to deal with in dividuals or
small groups, i t i s not applicable to large groups of people going to a
demonstration, en tering a football ground, or on t h e i r way to the s i t e
of a proposed gang f i g h t .          I t has been th e p r a c t i c e in th e past for
police to check gangs of youths en route to events where serious public
dis order i s a n t i c i p a t e d . That course of action i s c l e a r l y outlawed by
the Police and Criminal Evidence Act.                The exception provided in the
Code of P ra ctice fo r w r it te n notes does not a f f e c t t h i s i ss u e .      The
proviso in the Notes of Guidance (4A) t h a t "Nothing in t h i s code
a f f e c t s the routin e searching of persons e n tering sports grounds or
oth er premises . . . as a condition of entry" i s of very dubious
legality.        I t would be a fo olis h p olice o f f i c e r who r e l i e d on implied
consent to j u s t i f y a search. Furthermore, such a provision, even i f i t
was l e g a l , does not apply to crowds en route to f o otball grounds or to
National Front demonstrations, seaside gang f i g h ts or v io lent p ick ets .

The ingredients of a power to search need t o be c a r e f u ll y balanced to
provide appr opriate backing for police action with adequate safeguards
f o r the pu blic. Such a provision could be:

       (a)     Where a police o f f i c e r of the rank of Superintendent
               or above has reasonable cause to apprehend se rious
               public d i s o r d e r ;

       (b)     he may au th o r ise a constable or constables to search
               any person a t , going t o , attempting to go t o or in the
               v i c i n i t y of;

       (c)    any sp orting event, public entertainm ent, public
               meeting or procession or public gathering where
               se rious d iso rd er may occur or i s occurring;

       (d)    for any smoke bomb, pyrotechnic device, f l a r e or any
              s i m i l a r a r t i c l e or any of fensive weapon;

       (e)    and se i z e any such a r t i c l e or weapon.

       (f)    Any a u t h o r i ty given under t h i s section sh all           be
              confirmed in w ritin g as soon as p r a c t i c a b l e .

      location and is prepared to make a writte n declaratio n to t h a t e f f e c t .

2)   I am minded t o       recommend t h a t Section 10 of the Fire Precautions Act,
      1971 should be        amended with a view to giving the Fire Authority power
      in cases other       than those which are regarded as wholly exceptional.
      Matter f o r the     Fire Service and Home Office.

3)   Linked to the above I am minded to recommend t h a t consideration should
     be given to introducing l e g i s l a t i o n giving powers fo r the Fire
     Authority to apply to the High Court for an injunction under Section 10
     of the Fire Precautions Act.

     Matter for the Fire Service and the Home Office.

4)   I am minded t o recommend t h a t Section 10 of the Safety at Sports
      Grounds Act should be amended in the manner to Section 10 of the Fire
      Precautions Act and an ap plication t o the High Court for an injunction
     should be an a l t e r n a t i v e remedy.

     This recommendation i s intended t o provide Local Au th orities with
     g r e a t e r ease of access to the Courts than what is provided by Section
     10 of the Safety of Sports Grounds Act under the heading "Emergency
     Procedures."

     Within t h i s se cti on a Local Authority may apply to a Magistrates Court
     to p ro h ib it or r e s t r i c t admission to a ground where i t i s f e l t th e r e i s
     an unacceptable r i s k .

     Access to the High Court might well prove expedient in an emergency.

5)   I am minded to recommend t h a t the Secretary of S ta te should ex ercise
      his powers to designate a l l sp orts grounds, whatever t h e i r s i z e , to
      include indoor as well as outdoor a u t h o r i t i e s .

     This i s a matter for the Department of th e Environment.

6)   I am minded to recommend immediate designation of any ground capable of
      holding over 5,000 sp e ctato rs to cover a l l sports grounds not merely
      f ootb all grounds.

     This i s a matter for the Department of the Environment.

7)   I am minded to recommend t h a t consideration should be given to
      providing the po lice with additional powers of a r r e s t under th e Public
      Order Act, 1936.

     This recommendation r e f e r s s p e c i f i c a l l y to the p r a c tic a l d i f f i c u l t i e s
     facing the po lice in th e advent of CCTV and post-match in v e s tig a tio n s
     of Section 5 Offences highlighted by the cameras. Under the e x is ti n g
     Section 7 of the Public Order Act th e Police are empowered to make
     a r r e s t s where conduct i s th reatenin g or i n s u l t i n g but not once the
     immediacy of the s i t u a t i o n has passed.             The Interim Report r i g h t l y
     notes t h a t po li ce at grounds are unable on many occasions to
     immediately a r r e s t th e i n s t i g a t o r s pf violence fo r a number of reasons
     and consequently these offenders remain f re e from conviction. A video
     recording may well serve to p o s i t i v e l y i d e n t i f y one or more c u l p r i t s
     some considerable time a f t e r the i n c i d e n t s . I t i s t h e r e fo r e necessary



                                              -9 -
      to extend powers of a r r e s t so t h a t these offenders may be subject to
      a r r e s t when p o s i t i v e l y i d e n t i f i e d and charged with th e most appropriate
      offence .        The Association th e r e fo r e strongly supports Provisional
      Recommendation 7 but equally str ongly advocates t h a t i t should
      encompass a l l public order offences and not j u s t Section 5 Public Order
      Act.

8)    I am minded to recommend t h a t consideration should be given to creating
      a s p e c i f i c offence of chanting obscene or r a c i a l i s t abuse at a sports
      ground.

      The r i t u a l of chanting o bsc enities and r a c i a l abuse at football matches
      i s seen as adversely a f f e c ti n g th e environment and a f a c t o r in public
      disorder:

      The ACPO feel t h a t w h i ls t th ere will be d i f f i c u l t i e s of enforcement
      such conduct should be capable of prosecution. I f t h i s can be achieved
      within th e review of Public Order Legislation as a general offence so
      much the b e t t e r .

      I t i s submitted t h a t t h e r e i s a gap in the law which:

                   (a)   prevents the police from being able to
                         take action in many cases where
                         considerable s t r e s s is caused to many
                         people, p a r t i c u l a r l y the e l d e r l y and
                         ethnic m in o ri ti e s ;

                   (b)   f a i l s to provide the po lice with the
                         a b i l i t y to prevent minor disor der
                         e s c a l a t i n g into serious d i s o r d e r , and

                   (c)   leaves many d iso r d e r ly and p o t e n t i a l l y
                         dangerous ac ts outside s t a t u t o r y law.

     What is needed, i s a summary offence which f i t s at the bottom of the
      range in terms of seriousness and punishment f o r public order offence s.
      In terms of sporting events i t needs t o cover such acts in the stadium
     as: running onto the p itch t o stop th e game a t football matches (where
     th e r e i s no evidence of a t h r e a t of unlawful violence t o j u s t i f y
     conviction f o r Section 5 of the Public Order Act), shouting r a c ia l and
     personal abuse a t other s p e c t a t o r s ; linking arms with others and
     jumping down t e r r a c e s , shouting words c a lc u la te d to cause alarm ( e .g .
       f i r e or " i t ' s a bomb"); and outside the stadium as: charging through
     shopping centres and along pavements s c a t t e r i n g pedestrians in the
     process; shouting          r a c i a l , obscene or provocative abuse; rushing
     entrances to the ground, railway platforms, shops and other premises;
     fig htin g or try in g to f ig h t with rival supporters or chasing them
     through th e s t r e e t s with i n t e n t to s t a r t a f i g h t .

     Such v a r i a t i o n s in the types of d i s o r d e r l y behaviour preclude s p e c i f i c
     offences but call             f o r a general provision to cover d iso r d e r ly
     behaviour. A suggested form i s : -

                "Using th r e a t e n i n g , abusive or diso rd erly
                words or behaviour whereby alarm, harassment,
                annoyance or d i s t r e s s i s or is l i k e l y to be
                caused to another person."



                                           - 10 -
 Concern has been expressed t h a t such a provision would bring too much
 by way of high s p i r i t e d behaviour in to th e ambit of the criminal law.
 I t i s the view of the Association of Chief Police Officers t h a t the
 safeguards provided by (a) the independent prosecution se rvice (which
 will r e j e c t charges lacking adequate evidence); (b) the courts (which
 will require evidence of a s i g n i f i c a n t wrong) should ensure t h a t
 s o c i e t y ' s needs for a measure to cope with hooliganism will be balanced
 with the need for people t o l e g i ti m a t e l y display high s p i r i t s .

 Conduct of the type envisaged as f a l l i n g within t h i s provision is often

Police Powers:        i)      Search

                     iv)     Throwing Missiles

We have alreacty addressed in t h i s rep ort the f i r s t five t o p i c s ;
vi)     Running on th e pitch

The ACPO view is t h a t individuals who run onto the pitch do so e i t h e r
because they are propelled by f e a r of violence on t e r r a c i n g or by a
s p i r i t of exhibitionism or v io le n t i n t e n t . The use of d i s c r e t i o n will
in variably d isti n g u i s h between th e two kinds of i n d iv id u a ls. Sometimes
an ac t of encroachment on the pitch can provoke a pitch invasion by
riv al fans i n te n t e i t h e r on attack ing each other or preventing the
match from continuing.             In the event, such behaviour is d ealt with
e i t h e r by e j e c t io n fo r breach of ground rules or by a r r e s t for an
offence of breach of the peace. In Scotland such conduct f a l l s within
the d e f i n i t i o n of a common law breach of the peace which covers a very
wide range of circumstances from a public nuisance to r i o t i n g , and
unlike England, where th e Magistrates can only make a binding over
order, in Scotland the p e n a l ti e s are lim it ed only by the powers of the
Court hearing th e case.

I t is a n t i c i p a t e d , however, t h a t with improved segregation and
perimeter fencing, running on the pitch may not be q u ite the same
problem as before. Nonetheless such behaviour ought not to be t r e a t e d
l i g h t l y in view of the serious consequences which might flow from i t .
Therefore the ACPO f e e l s t h a t should th e r e not be a general offence
which encompasses such behaviour i t should lend support to any
recommendation to make running on the p itch a separate offence.

NOTE:      The Popplewell Report (para 6.65) makes the
           following point when addressing the question
           of pi tc h encroachment, "In Scotland i t may
           c o n s t i t u t e the common law offence of breach of
           th e peace."

           The common law in Scotland has developed
           r a t h e r d i f f e r e n t l y than in England and Wales.
           The common law public order offences in
           Scotland are breach of th e peace and mobbing
           and r i o t i n g .         Breach of the peace covers a
           very wide range of circumstances from a minor
           public           nuisance           offence   to    offences
           approaching r i o t i n g in se rio us ness .

           I t is defined th u s: "Breach of the peace is
           c o n s t i t u t e d by one or more persons conducting
           themselves or themselves in a rioto us or
           d iso r d e r ly manner to the alarm, annoyance or
           disturbance of the l i e g e s . "

           The p e n a l ti e s fo r both breach of th e peace and
           r i o t i n g are lim ited only by the powers of the
           courts.

           S tra th cly de Police rep ort t h a t t h e r e have been
           instances where individuals running onto th e
           pitch have been convicted of a common law
           breach of the peace, but i t is not used very
           often as they p refer to rely upon s t a t u t e law
           wherever p o ss ib le .
                     In England and Wales, common law breach of the
                    peace c a t e r s for a l l manner of nuisances
                    committed in public and p r i v a t e places but
                    t h e r e is no provision for "punishment" save
                    t h a t an offender may be "bound over" to en ter
                    into a recognizance with or without s u r e t i e s .
     (vii)        to ban a p a r t i c u l a r match

     Under Section 10 (Emergency Procedures) of the Safety of Sports Grounds
     Act, 1975, a Chief O fficer of Police i s empowered to recommend to his
     Local Authority i f he f e e l s t h a t the r isk to sp e c ta to rs i s so great
     t h a t u n til steps have been taken to reduce i t to a reasonable level
     t h e i r admission ought to be prohib ited or r e s t r i c t e d .       A Local
     Authority may then apply to the Courts fo r an order p r o h i b it i n g or
     r e s t r i c t i n g admission to the whole or any part of th e ground u n til such
     steps have been taken to reduce th e r isk t o a reasonable l e v e l .

     Existing powers of control might be extended should the Government's
     White Paper, "Review of Public Order Law" reach th e S t a tu te Book.
     Section 5 deals with s t a t i c demonstrations and paragraph 7 reads th a t
     in s u i t a b l e cases the p olice will be enabled to impose conditions
     l i m i t in g the number of sp e c ta to rs atten din g a f ootb all match where they
     apprehend serious public d iso r d e r .

     Existing l e g i s l a t i o n     and l e g i s l a t i v e proposals seem to provide
     s u f f i c i e n t powers to     ban matches i f necessary in the i n t e r e s t s of
     public sa fe ty .

d)   The advantages and disadvantages of placing po lice o f f i c e r s                       among
     s p e c ta to rs on th e t e r r a c e s as a means of crowd c o n t r o l .

     i)      Advantages:

             a)       High v i s i b i l i t y of uniformed o f f i c e r s serves to
                      de te r would-be troublemakers who enjoy the feeling s
                      of anonymity and immunity from the law which t h e i r
                      po sition in th e crowd often a f fo r d s .

             b)       Closer proximity to troublemakers makes for e a s i e r
                      evidence-gathering and i d e n t i f i c a t i o n .

             c)       Able to e f f e c t th e speedy removal of children and
                      "vulnerable" in the event of d isr u p tio n or other
                      emergency.

             d)       Sometimes useful to deploy o f f i c e r s in plain clothes
                      as " s p o t te r s " to i d e n t i f y gang leaders and pass t h i s
                      information to uniformed colleagues.
     ii)     Disadvantages:

             a)       Can i s o l a t e individual o f f i c e r s   within crowds and
                      expose them t o poss ible in j u ry .

             b)       Limits redeployment of o f f i c e r s to other p a r t s of the
                      grounds.

      In the f in a l a n a l y s i s , the r e l a t i v e merits of t a c t i c a l deployment are
      determined on th e day by se nior po li ce o f f i c e r s in the l i g h t of
      i n t e l l i g e n c e and prev ailin g circumstances.

e)   The provision of any a v a i la b l e s t a t i s t i c s about the number of incidents
     of violence at footb all matches.


     At present th e r e are no national s t a t i s t i c s a v a ila b le on in cidents of
     soccer violence although i t is a n t i c i p a t e d t h a t the new i n t e l l i g e n c e
     system will be of a s sista n c e in providing a national p i c t u r e in the
     fu tu re .       However, as Chief Constable of Greater Manchester, I have
     a v a i la b l e a r r e s t s t a t i s t i c s for the eight fo otball league grounds in my
     Force area which between them span the four d ivision s of the football
     league. (See Appendix âA").

f)   The p o te n tia l d i f f i c u l t i e s    for     the   po lice   of   the   introduc tion      of
     membership cards.


     Popplewell Report (para 6.48) recommends t h a t urgent consideration
     should be given to introducing a membership card system so as to
     exclude v i s i t i n g fan s. This is based on the assumption t h a t " i f
     su b s ta n t ia l violence at f o otball matches a r i s e s by reason of the
     conf ro ntati on of riv al fans, then one so lution would be to ensure rival
     fans were not present a t the same game." (para 6.36).

     The ACPO takes the view t h a t unless membership card schemes overcome a
     number of s i g n i f i c a n t p r a c t i c a l d i f f i c u l t i e s the e f fe c ti v e n e ss is
     s e rio u s ly undermined.

     The primary purpose of any membership scheme must be to exclude those
     who become i d e n t i f i e d as hooligans e i t h e r a t th e enrolment stage or
     because of t h e i r subsequent behaviour.                  Those responsible for
     administering the scheme must be in a positio n t h e r e f o r e , to e s t a b l i s h
     the "bona-fides" of ap plicants and members (otherwise t h e r e would be
     nothing t o prevent th e wrong people obtaining several cards or cards
     using f a l s e p a r t i c u l a r s ) .

     The c r i t i c a l question th e r e f o r e , is from which source would they obtain
     the information necessary to administer such a v e ttin g system?                  The
     police are an obvious choice, but they are prohibite d by s t a t u t e from
     d isc lo s in g co n fid en tial information held by them about suspects or
     offender s, viz Data Protection Act, 1985 and th e R e h a b i l it a tio n of
     Offenders Act, 1974. Moreover, ap art from th e police i t is d i f f i c u l t
     t o say what other org an isations would be a v a il a b l e to the o perators.

     To r e s t r i c t admittance to "home" supporters might deprive th e clubs of
     an important source of revenue which could prompt several clubs to get
     round i t by making provision for "casual su pp orters." Any membership
     scheme which provides for casual non-members to be admitted in
     p a r t i c u l a r section s of the ground puts a t r isk any plans t o segregate
     rival supporter s.

     Another important cons ideration is what kinds of behaviour will lead to
     the withdrawal of a membership card?              Once t h i s question has been
     resolved, which is no easy t a s k , the organisers must decide upon the
     t e r r i t o r i a l boundaries of what they have come to define as fo o tb all

t   hooliganism. Will i t include vandalism on public t r a n s p o r t , a t railway
    s t a t i o n s , public houses and thoroughfares leading to f ootball grounds?
    All of which are t a r g e t s f o r the football hooligan.
1   The ACPO feel there i s much to commend a number of a l t e r n a t i v e measures
    which seek to l im it attendance a t football grounds.
1   i)       Several clubs have suc cessfully introduced family
              enclosures which a t t r a c t children in the company
              of parents or guardians to sp e c i a l l y i d e n t i f i e d
I             se cti ons of the grounds.       The scheme at Watford
              Football Club i s a noteworthy example.

    ii)      Limited membership schemes have been introduced at
I             several clubs whereby se cti ons of the ground are
              reserved for club members only.

1   iii)     A recent suggestion made by the Home Office c a l l s
             f o r the intro duction of "football                   exclusion
             orders" whereby f o o t b a l l hooligans convicted by
I            the courts might e f f e c t i v e l y be proh ib ited from
             entering a f o o tb a ll ground for up to two y e a r s .
             On the face of i t , t h i s proposition has some
             merit, and to an e x te n t , overcomes the problem of
1            information      confidentiality          asso ciated       with
             membership card schemes.              Theprecedent i s the
             Licensed Premises (Exclusion of Certain Persons)
             Act, 1980, which applies to persons convicted of
I            violen t behaviour and e f f e c t i v e l y p r o h i b it s a
             person from en tering s p e c ifie d licensed premises
             f o r up to two y e a r s . Whilst d i f f i c u l t to enforce,
1            t h i s kind of court order does tend to have a
             deterrent e ffe c t.

I   iv)      Another p r a c t i c a l measure i s for clubs to make
             c e r t a in s e l e c t i v e matches a l l t i c k e t , ( e .g . where
             capacity crowds are a n t i c i p a t e d ) with no sale s on
             the day of the match.                 Sales to away supporters
I            could be r e s t r i c t e d to members of o f f i c i a l
             supporters club s. This would n e c e s s i t a t e adequate
             co ntrols over t i c k e t s a l e s .       I f a "black market"
I            develops and t i c k e t s a re r e a d ily a v a i l a b l e from
             t o u t s , major problems can a r i s e on the t e r r a c e s .
             The police are faced with d i f f i c u l t i e s in t h i s
             area as t h e r e i s no s p e c i f i c offence to deal with
I            f o otball t o u t s .         I f they are a r r e s te d they are
             frequently charged with obstruction which i s not
             always ap p r o p ria te . Some l o c a l i t i e s have by-laws
I            which o f f e r lim ited p e n a lt i e s and r eq u ire local
             a u t h o r i t i e s to pr osecute.

              We th e r e fo r e recommend t h a t consideration be given
1             to amending th e provisions of Section 3 and
              Schedule 4 of the Local Government (Miscellaneous
              Provisions) Act, 1984 to include areas around
1             footb all grounds to which the public have access
              and to provide a power of a r r e s t i f found
              committing the offence.

I    g)    The use of CCTV, and any d i f f i c u l t i e s with follow-up en q u ir i e s .


           Experiments a t grounds in Greater Manchester, West Yorkshire and West
1          Midlands have shown t h a t CCTV is of value.

           a)    in recording incidents of d i so r d e r , the role played by
I                 individuals in t h a t diso rder and id e n t if y in g of fender s.

           b)    in allowing police commanders to i d e n t i f y areas of
                  p o te n tia l c o n f l i c t and thereby to deploy manpower most
I                 effectively.


t          c)

          d)
                 as a d e t e r r e n t to would-be troublemakers.

                 outside the ground, mobile CCTV (hoolivan) extends the

I                area of evidence gathering coverage before and a f t e r each
                 match.

          The courts have found the evidence produced by video and photographers
          to be of great value in securing the conviction of offenders who
I         otherwise would avoid prosecution.


f         The Football Trust which i s administered independently of the Football
          Grounds Improvements Trust - has made a v a il a b le funds to cover
          expenditure up to Â£25,000 per ground f o r a l l f i r s t and second divisio n
          grounds providing th e equipment i s owned and serviced by p o li c e .
          Equipment has already been i n s t a l l e d a t many grounds, with the
I         remainder only awaiting completion of tendering procedures before work
          commences.

I         So f a r th e p olice have not had a l o t of experience with "follow-up"
          enqu ir ies but th e s t a t e of knowledge has indicated a need f o r new
          s k i l l s in operational and video-searching techniques.                     The ACPO
          however, are o p tim i s ti c t h a t CCTV will be a powerful d e t e r r e n t and will
I         remove the immunity of the v io le n t individual in a large crowd.

    h)     Alcohol, with p a r t i c u l a r refer en ce        to    consumption       in    Directors
I         accommodation or "executive boxes."


          The ACPO has l e n t i t s support to the Governments Sporting Events
I          (Control of Alcohol) Act, 1985, emphasising throughout the proceedings
          t h a t i t favours alcohol control r a t h e r than o u tr ig h t bans a t fo o tb all
          grounds.       We take the view t h a t the main problem is associated with
1         excessive drinking whilst t r a v e l l i n g to foo tb all matches and t h a t i s
          where e f f o r t must be concentrated.

I         I t i s th e r e f o r e , of some concern to th e ACPO t h a t the Act omitted any
          reference to p r i v a t e hire vans in i t s section on p r o h ib itio n of alcohol
          on public serv ic e veh icles.             (The ban) on football " specia ls" - both
          t r a i n and coaches - may r e s u l t in some supporters t r a n s f e r r i n g to

    There are, of course, recognisable d i f f i c u l t i e s with enforcement, but
    i t is also the view of the ACPO t h a t th ese ar e not insurmountable and
    would be outweighed by the d e t e r r e n t value were t h i s loophole
    e f f e c t i v e l y plugged.

    The p a r t i c u l a r question of consumption in "private viewing boxes" is
    covered by Section Two of the Act, which p r o h i b it s the possession of
    alcohol in any area of the ground from which the event may be d i r e c t l y
    viewed. According to the explanatory memorandum accompanying the Act,
    such areas include the stands, t e r r a c e s and the r e s t a u r a n t , sponsor's
    boxes and other rooms which overlook the p i t c h .

    The Act goes on to specify the terms and conditions applying to
    exemption orders granted by local Magistrates to licensees or club
    s e c r e t a r i e s in sid e designated sports grounds, but re-emphasises t h a t
    such orders will not apply to any licensed premises or r e g i s t e r e d club
    premises from which the event may be d i r e c t l y viewed.

    In essence t h e r e f o r e , p r iv a te viewing boxes may well prove to be the
    only p a r t s of football grounds which previously enjoyed drinking
    f a c i l i t i e s now e f f e c t i v e l y barred by v i r t u e of t h e i r d i r e c t viewing
    position.           This seems an anomalous s i t u a t i o n which could prove to be
    another se rious loss of revenue f o r many clubs who have invested
    heavily in t h i s area. The net r e s u l t could well be a c u t t in g back on
    other expenditures which could have an e f f e c t upon the p o l ic e .

    I t i s th e view of the ACPO t h a t the anomaly regarding p r iv a t e viewing
    boxes - h i t h e r t o t r o u b le f r e e - and th e omission of p r i v a t e h ir e vans
    and mini-buses from the P.S.V. alcohol ban deserve re-ap p rais al for
    possible inclusion in f u tu re l e g i s l a t i o n .

    Apart from these r e s e r v a t i o n s , t h i s piece of l e g i s l a t i o n provides the
    p o lice with th e means to take an e f f e c t i v e stand ag ainst excessive
    drinking and a n c i l l a r y behaviour where i t is arguably of most
    importance and t h a t i s a t the t u r n s t i 'l e s .

)   A c t i v i t i e s of the National Front and other extreme r ig h t wing or
    extreme l e f t wing o rganisatio ns a t foo tb all grounds, and the suggestion
    t h a t football matches are used as a vehicle for recruitment and for
    organised violence.


    Police i n t e l l i g e n c e on the a c t i v i t i e s  of extremist       political
    organ isatio ns i s , of course, of a highly con fidential nature. However,
    th e r e i s some evidence a v a i l a b le which suggests t h a t the National Front
    members have been a c t iv e l y involved in in cid en ts of disorder a t c e r t a i n
    football grounds, p a r t i c u l a r l y in London.       Moreover, th e r e has been
    suggestion not e s ta b l is h e d by the p olice t h a t the National Front have
    been involved in organising p a r t i e s of s o - c a l l e d football supporters to
    t r a v e l abroad to matches played by the England team.

    There are many ind iv idu als who ar e seen standing on the te r r a c i n g a t
    football matches draped in or waving Union flag s but i t would be wrong
    to assume t h a t th ese are in any way connected with such organisations
    as th e National Front simply because of t h e i r overt display of the
    National emblem.
     There are many fo otball grounds where National Front teams can be seen
     s e l l i n g t h e i r National Front newspapers to supporters as they queue at
     the t u r n s t i l e s but t h e r e i s l i t t l e evidence to suggest t h a t such
     individ ua ls t r a n s f e r t h e i r overt a d v e r t is in g a c t i v i t i e s onto the
     t e r r a c e s . Equally National Front publica tion s have adve rtised football
     club badges and t h er e i s some loose link which needs to be monitored.

     I t i s intended t h a t the new i n t e l l i g e n c e system introduced a t the s t a r t
     of t h i s f o otb all season will provide a valuable exchange of information
     between a l l forces which will focus a t t e n t i o n not only on ta rgete d
     individuals but on a c t i v i t i e s or organ isations such as the National
     Front whose involvement at fo otball matches i s already being closely
     monitored by p o lic e .

j)   Any observations on how police measures might prevent or minimise a
     r i o t , such as t h a t which occurred a t Birmingham City f o otball ground on
     11th May, 1985.


     Against th e backcloth of events lik e t h a t a t Birmingham which so
     c h a r a c t e r i s e d the end of the 1984/85 fo otball season, policing
     arrangements have been reappraised and in s p e c i f i c areas strengthened
     by new l e g i s l a t i o n .

     Intelligence

     A comprehensive i n t e l l i g e n c e system has been devised by the ACPO
     Sub-Committee on Hooliganism a t Sporting Events which draws upon
     e x i s ti n g s t r u c t u r e s involving fo otb al l l i a i s o n o f f i c e r s and other
     outside agencies such as B r i t i s h R a il, public tr a n s p o r t a u t h o r i t i e s and
     the fo otba ll clubs themselves. The net r e s u l t has been a build-up of
     information about the movements of fo otba ll supporters and the
     i d e n t i f i c a t i o n and t a r g e t i n g of those whose past behaviour singles them
     out as leading troublemakers.

     Even though the season has j u s t begun, already th e r e ar e encouraging
     signs t h a t th e new i n t e l l i g e n c e system i s well on th e way to achieving
     i t s intended o b j e c ti v e s .      At the Oldham v. Huddersfield game on 24th
     August, f o r example, o f f i c e r s on duty a t t u r n s t i l e s were br ief ed on the
     bas is of i n t e l l i g e n c e from Huddersfield t h a t th r ee men, a l l i d e n t i f i e d ,
     were the leading members of a gang of hooligans who t r av el with
     supporters to away matches with the sole purpose of causing tr o u b le .
     Before the match had s t a r t e d a l l th r e e had been recognised and ta r g e te d
     by police who eventually escorted them from th e ground a f t e r the fi n a l
     w h is t le having e f f e c t i v e l y deter red them misbehaving.

     Legal Powers

     Excessive drinking has already been i d e n t i f i e d as a key f a c t o r
     co n t r i b u tin g to f ootball hooliganism.             The ACPO view i s very much
     d ir e c te d towards the d e s i r a b i l i t y of contr ols r a t h e r than o u tr ig h t bans
     a t grounds. New powers contained in th e Sporting Events (Control of
     Alcohol) Act, 1985, though rushed through with some has te, provide the
     p o lice with the means to take an e f f e c t i v e stand in c o n t r o l l in g
     excessive drinking by supporters w h il st t r a v e l l i n g t o , and upon entry
     t o , fo o tb a ll grounds.       I t remains to be seen j u s t what e f f e c t s t h i s
     piece of l e g i s l a t i o n might have in the long term but so f a r th e r e are
c l e a r signs t h a t i t has had a salutory e f f e c t judging by the sobriety
and demeanour of fo otball supp orters.

There i s no doubt t h a t the t u r n s t i l e s will be the t e s t i n g ground for
the e f f e c ti v e n e s s of a good pa rt of t h i s l e g i s l a t i o n and i f t h e r e i s a
c o n s t r a i n t , ap art from t h a t r e l a t i n g to routine searching, i t i s of
course t h a t these provisions re q uir e more police o f f i c e r s to make i t
effective.

New polici ng i n i t i a t i v e s and a purposive enforcement of new l e g i s l a t i o n
in i t s turn t r a n s l a t e s i n to po lici ng costs and, in the case of
" t u r n s t i l e policing" in p a r t i c u l a r , these are co sts which cannot be
o f f s e t a gains t fo otba ll clubs.               Moreover, the financial burden of
polici ng foot bal l matches f a l l s heavily on c e r ta in police forces
p a r t i c u l a r l y those in the large conurbation where other pressures are
al so much g r e a t e r . I t is the view of the ACPO t h a t t h i s problem i s not
satisfactorily             resolved and t h a t forces having a considerable
commitment to fo otbal l need special financial provisions to o f f s e t
overtime expenditure.

The adequacy of e x i s t i n g powers in respect of search, a r r e s t s for
breach of th e peace, pitch encroachment and m iss il e throwing have a l l
been addressed se para tely in t h i s re p o rt, s u f f ic e here to s t a t e t h a t i t
i s hoped t h a t th e Government's review of public order law will remove
some of the anomalies which cu r re n tl y f e t t e r pol ice action as well as
place on the s t a t u t e book ad di tional offences which can more e a s i l y be
proved without engaging in pro tra c t e d proceedings.

Ground Improvements

The extension of the provisions of the Safety of Sports Grounds Act to
a l l f o o tb a ll league grounds has revealed t h a t t h e r e i s much to be done
by many of the smaller clubs to bring t h e i r f a c i l i t i e s up to the
standards demanded.           Indeed many of the bigger clubs are finding
themselves having to carry out sp e c i fi e d ground imrpovements following
j o i n t recommendations made by s p e c ia ll y c o n s titu te d p o l i c e / f i r e / l o c a l
a u th o r it y inspe ction teams.     The net r e s u l t being more e f f e c t i v e
segregation of ri val supporters, more formidable perimeter fencing and
above a ll a s a fe r environment in which spe ctators can enjoy the game of
football.

In ad d it io n , the added f a c i l i t y of CCTV a t a l l f i r s t and second
divisi on f o o tb a ll grounds has provided valuable a s s i s t a n c e to the
p o lic e in id e n t i f y i n g and t a r g e t i n g would be trouble makers in crowds
and enabling p o li c e resources t o be deployed in areas of g r e a t e s t need.

All of which adds up to much more e f f e c t i v e po lice control of
s p e c ta to rs i n s i d e (and outside) fo o tb a l l grounds and more e f f e c t i v e
deployment of p o lice resources, based upon a comprehensive i n t e l l i g e n c e
gathering system.

To what extent the problems r elevan t to fo otball                        are applicable to
other s p o r t s .


Understandably a t t e n t i o n has been focused on the problems of crowd
disorder and s a fe ty at fo otball grounds and y e t we ar e mindful t h a t the
problems a t c r i c k e t grounds, p a r t i c u l a r l y when one day matches are
 played, and rugby league grounds, ar e b a s i c a l l y s im il a r though they may
 vary in degree. Crowds attending rugby league matches f o r example, are
 often in number s im ila r to those attending fo otball league matches in
 the lower d i v i s i o n s . I t i s a l l the more perplexing t h e r e f o r e to
 discover t h a t the hooliganism phenomena only r are ly manifests i t s e l f
 among sp e c ta to rs a t rugby matches who, by and large, are drawn from
 si m il ar catchment areas as those attending foot ba ll league matches.

 I t i s timely, however, t h a t the pol ice are a l e r t to th e p o s s i b i l i t y of
 "football hooliganism" being displaced i n to other spor ts as an
 unintended consequence of t i g h t e r pol ice controls at fo otbal l matches.

I t i s the policy of the ACPO to clos ely monitor crowd behaviour at
other sp o rts in the event t h a t hooliganism manifests i t s e l f in any
disc ernab le p a t t e r n . Should t h a t happen we shall be seeking an
extension of powers c u r re n tly s p e c i f i c to f ootball league club grounds.

The adequacy or otherwise of the police p a r t i c i p a t i o n in Local
Authority teams f o r the purposes of inspection and c e r t i f i c a t i o n under
the Safety of Sports Grounds Act, 1975.


Hither to, po lice involvement in Local Authority inspection teams has
been limited to the c e r t i f i c a t i o n stage only. I t i s the view of the
ACPO j o i n t inspe ction teams, including the police, ought to v i s i t
designated sp or ts grounds on an annual basis to inspect and r e port upon
the adequacy of arrangements and equipment in accordance with the
provisions of th e Act and the Green Guide. R e - c e r t i f i c a t i o n and a f r e e
exchange of information between a l l p a r t i e s involved will serve to
maintain standards and ensure t h a t a l l conditions imposed on sa fety
c e r t i f i c a t e s are complied with.

Unless a formalised system of annual r e - c e r t i f i c a t i o n i s introduced i t
is f e l t t h a t the cu rre nt high standards being introduced will
in ev itab ly s t a r t to de cline as the impetus wanes.

Any suggested amendments to the Home Office Guide to Safety at Sports
Grounds (the Green Guide).


Section 5.2 deals with th e dangers of boundary fences of inadequate
s tren gth and heigh t.             Attention has so f a r been focused upon the
standards of pitc h perimeter fences of metal co ns tru ctio n but i t i s
f e l t t h a t s p e c i f i c guidelines should be made on th e str en gth and
s t r u c t u r e of brick and concrete walls not only surrounding th e playing
pitch but a ls o those which surround th e ground i t s e l f .        Experience
shows t h a t many external walls are in need of r e p a i r or replacement and
in t h e i r present s t a t e not only represent a p o te n tial danger but also
provide a source of ammunition to th e hooligan element among
supporters.

Section 6.14.13 reads "All doors on an e x i t route should be secured in
the f u l l y opened p o sit io n before th e end of play." Such a gu ideline
puts a t serious r is k p o lice arrangements for segregating ri val fans and
rep rese nts a p o te n t ia l f l a s h point f o r crowd d is o r d e r . I t i s th e view
of th e ACPO t h a t on the majority of fo otball grounds the number of e x i t
gates f a r exceeds th e reasonable proportions which could be expected to
be co n tr o ll e d by a p o li ce o f f i c e r , and as a consequence i t i s necessary
 from an operational point of view to allow these gates to be locked and
 stewarded with a universal lock and key system co ntrolled by f i r e and
 sa fe ty stewards. Whilst t h i s aspect i s contrary to the recommendation
 in the Popplewell Interim report th e ACPO take the view t h a t i t i s
 necessary to order.     We are i n t e r e s t e d in the development of f a i l s a f e
 locking devices as used a t Ipswich Town which allow f o r control from a
 cen tr al point but can be opened lo c a lly in the event of power f a i l u r e .
 If these systems can be perfected t e c h n i c a l l y they may provide an
 answer but i t i s recognised t h a t they may be very expensive.

 Section 6.14.7 deals with t u r n s t i l e f a c i l i t i e s .    I t reads, " F a c i l i t i e s
 should be provided to enable people to leave the ground a t any time.
 For t h i s purpose a number of r e v e r s ib le t u r n s t i l e s or doors so operated
 as to l i m it the openings to the passage of one person a t a time might
 be considered."

The ACPO take the view t h a t t h i s section should be amended to exclude
the words " r e v e r s i b l e t u r n s t i l e s , " as by t h e i r very nature they
intim ate a mechanism capable of jamming e i t h e r in the reversing process
or by any physical p r e s s u re .              The mechanisms other than hinges are
discouraged by the guide, and on average the opening width of most
t u r n s t i l e s i s below the minimum e x i t width recommended in the guide.
T u r n s t ile s should be so constructed as to discourage any use as an e x i t
r oute.

Section 8.3 (b) deals with evacuation from stands a t sports grounds and
recommends t h a t evacuation time f o r stands of wooden construction
should be 2.5 minutes. I t i s the view of the ACPO t h a t t h i s evacuation
time be reduced from 2.5 minutes to 2 minutes.

Section 8.4 reads, "Seats and gangways should be so positioned as to
provide ready access to e x i t s . No person in any p a r t of a stand should
have to t r av el more than 30 metres to the near es t e x i t from the st and ."

I t i s the ACPO recommendation t h a t f o r wooden stands the maximum
d istanc e t r a v e l l e d to the near es t e x i t should be no more than 18
metres.       This amendment will allow compliance with the reduced
evacuation time recommended a t Section 8 . 3 ( b ) .

Section 18.4 reads, âClubs should c a r e f u ll y consider t h e i r arrangements
fo r th e sa le of a lc ohol. In any case a l l refreshments should be served
in p l a s t i c c o n ta in e r s . "

The ACPO recommends t h a t t h i s Section should be amended to take account
of th e provisions of th e Sporting Events (Control of Alcohol) Act,
1985, so f a r as i t r e l a t e s to co n tr o ll e d sa le and possession insi de
f o o tb a ll grounds.

expertise    or knowledge in            this       matter.        Its purpose was to examine

issues of national importance.




2.        During       the    life     of    the     Working       Group    it    considered         the

generality      of     policing        football        and        formulated      some      Notes       of

Guidance on policing which related particularly to                               arrangements        for

travelling      supporters,          their    arrival       and departure at grounds                 and

information about            their   movement through the              transit      system.         This

guidance was eventually formulated and made available to officers in

a document called            "The Public Order Guide".                 The Group met on six

occasions    before      it    was allowed to lapse.                 There s t i l l    remained an

arrangement      for    meetings       to    be     held    on an ad hoc            basis    between

interested parties and Mr. Anderton,                       the Chief Constable of Greater

Manchester,     was appointed to              act    as    Liaison        Officer      and to      be    a

depository      for     information          about    special       events       and a      reference

point on d if fic u lt ie s      that might arise.                The Working Group also set

up a system whereby each Police Force hosting a football ground was

asked   to   nominate         a Liaison       Officer        to    pass    information        to     his

counterpart     in other Police              Forces    about travelling             supporters.          A
National Register of Liaison Officers was and is                                   maintained at        New

Scotland Yard and this                system has remained in tact ever since.                            It

has    in     recent      times       been        reorganised            and       its      arrangements

formalised, paragraphs 25 - 28 refer.




3.          At a meeting of           the General          Purposes           Committee on the          3rd

November,       1983,     in    the    face       of    continued            problems       at   football

grounds     and indeed at other               sporting events,                the whole matter was

discussed     again       and   it     was    decided         to   resuscitate             the   football

hooliganism       group but       extend          its   terms      of    reference         so    that   a ll

matters concerned with hooliganism in sport could be considered.                                         To

this end the General Purposes Committee approved the constitution of

a Standing Sub-Committee on "Hooliganism in                                  Sport".       Mr.   Anderton

has   since   that      time acted as             Chairman.        The Terms of Reference of

the Sub-Committee included a requirement to act as a reference point

in respect of special problems relating to sporting fixtures, mainly

in England and Wales but also with an eye to Scotland and to events

in    Europe.       The    early       business          of     the      Sub-Committee           included

consideration of the in it i a l             C.C.T.V.         systems set up in England and

Scotland      and    consideration           of     problems        in       relation       to   alcohol,

particularly on public service vehicles.




4.          The   reconvened          Sub-Committee           on      Hooliganism           at   Sporting

Events met for the f i r s t time on the 13th November,                                  1984 and i t has

met on a total of twelve occasions since.                               Early on i t s       agenda was

the question of guidance offered                        to police        officers.          It   was f e l t

this needed to be reviewed in the                       light      of    then recent         events     and

the    Secretary        was     asked        to     undertake           an     examination        of    the

guidance.         The   new     document          was    prepared            and    approved      by    the
Sub-Committee             on    the   23rd    February,          1987    when i t     was    decided     to

issue i t as a stand-alone document which should be made available to

a ll    officers      with a responsibility                 for     supervising       football games.

The document subsequently received the                             endorsement of          ACPO Council

and     by    October          1987    had    been    circulated          to   a ll    Police       Forces.

THE HOOLIGANISM PROBLEM




5   .        To compass          a    topic    of    this    complexity         completely      and     in

detail       is    clearly not possible within the terms of this                             submission.

Nonetheless a number of points need to be made which relate both to

current strategies and to ways forward.




6   .        First of a ll           i t has to be said that football hooliganism is

almost a worldwide phenomenon                       andhas plagued the game in England                   at

least since the mid-sixties.                         It is d if fic u lt to guage the extent as

no real           index of      the problem exists                (arrests     are    a very    doubtful

indicator).           Nonetheless the police view is                      that by the mid to late

seventies i t was endemic with police officers                               subjected to spitting,

abuse and assault                so often that i t became "normal".                        Indeed by the

turn of the decade police                     officers       were surprised           if   they did not

have to skirmish to preserve                    somekind of control over events.




7.            More        organised      andforceful             policing       checked       the     worst

excesses          and in due course            legislation          and technology have a ll             in

their     turn added to               the plethora of controls which in recent years

have restrained football's belligerents.                                Despite these improvements

policemen           are    in    no    doubt    that        at    many matches         the   balance     of




                                                        -3-
control      is    a    fine     one    and      at    the        margins    hooligan       gangs    s till

venture      on     a       deliberate         course        of    affray.     The      nagging     strain

associated        with       this     violent         fringe       does   much     to    colour     police

perceptions of crowd control.




8   .       It is probably fair to say that traditional policing methods

for handling football were largely consistent with policing methods

for      handling       large       crowds       in    general.           During     the     1960's,      as

problems      with      football        crowds        became       notorious,      policing       methods

became      increasingly            defensive     and a good deal                more      co-ordination

between Police Forces developed.                       Over the last two decades policing

football     has become a specialist                    area and policing strategies have

been based upon a presumption that violence between rival spectators

is probable wherever they have the opportunity to intermingle.




9.          Analysing policing             tactics,          certainly over the earlier part

of      these years,         allows    the contention that                  substantially      what      has

been      developed         is   an     a ll    encompassing           pattern     of      "policing      by

containment".           There are three fundamental aspects to this approach:-




(a)         The development of information concerning crowds                                 in transit

            and plans to intervene and escort at every turn;




(b)         A commitment to segregation of "home" and "away" supporters

            both       in    transit/      through           the    turn-stiles,        whilst      in   the

            ground and at their departure;




(c)         The    construction          of     containment          fencing     within      grounds     to

            control the movement of supporters.




                                                         -   4-
10.        The general            strategy of         "policing             by    containment"        is    near

universal       and routine         to police,             ordinary supporters                and hooligans

alike.      In the great majority of                       cases       it    operates         with    relative

ease     and,    perhaps      paradoxically,               allows      decent        spectators       to     feel

secure     within        their      own     controlled             environment.               It     has     been

successful       over       the    years    for       most    fixtures            in marshalling great

numbers of football               spectators within grounds more or                            less       trouble

free, despite undertones of aggression at the fringes.




11.        On the negative side i t s                  disadvantages are that,                     i t tends to

encourage        an     antagonistic            and    tr ib a list          attitude         between       rival

groups     and to       some degree provides a framework for the "war games"

of determined hooligan gangs.                     Equally, whilst we may have contained

the    problem,        in   reality        we    require      a veritable               army of policemen

every weekend to hold sway between hostile groups apparently bent on

violence.            The sheer      size    of    the police commitment is                      daunting and

has progressively raised the question of how the problem of violence

might be removed rather                   than merely controlled.                       (This observation

has to be set aside the general case that any large crowd needs some

measure         of     direction         and     control          in     the       interests         of    public

 safety).        Hence over the            last       four years,            at    least      at    the     policy

 level,     we       have   been    doing        much more          to       study      the   phenomenon of

 hooliganism and to               try    complementary strategies                    designed to            reduce

 the problem i t s e l f .




 12.        This       more       searching       examination               of    hooliganism         has     been

 based in part upon close                  observation and in part                       upon the work of

 intelligence          operations         which have          done much to               reveal       the    inner

 workings       of     hooligan         gangs.        In    the    event         this    work has          put   in
question a number of basic propositions.                             Policing by containment in

a sense has been policing                      "en-masse".          Faced with         crowds   of    many

thousands            it   has    seemed        impossible to         concentrate        on individual

offenders and police officers have planned to exercise crowd control

over         large    groups     at    "arms length".             This   tends   to    have sustained

the          presumption        that    football      crowds        by   their    very     nature      are

volatile and combustible and that whenever rival groups clash sparks

of violence are inevitable.                     The more we have become involved in the

close analysis of hooliganism the more this presumption has been put

in question.




2   3   t       The alternative thesis of football hooliganism has much more

to          do with concentrating police                attention upon determined criminal

hooligans.            Very      often i t      seems these people have no               other interest

than          violence,      they       are     organised in         gangs       and    carry    through

pre-determined plans to fight and cause damage wherever they can do

so with impunity.                    In reality    few clashes are in fact spontaneous,

they are almost always arranged even i f                            that is      not evident      at    the

time.          The numbers involved vary from 10âs to 100âs.                             They are part

of a culture with a hierarchy of                         command,        a mythology of motives,

and          the   outline      of     national    organisation.            Football      provides      for

    them a magnificent opportunity -                    the nature of            the game is         one of

physical             confrontation;         support     is    often partisan           in the extreme;

    ill       constructed        stadia       provide    an       accommodating        platform;       vast

    crowds provide both the atmosphere and the cover behind which they

    can manoeuvre; and the fixture l i s t                    organises      a calendar         for   their

    criminal encounters.




                                                         -   6-
14.       It    would be wrong           to    describe             these hooligan groups            as    a

"tiny minority" as the football                 industry is want to do.                    Regardless

they are a minority and some explanation of how they can create such

a destructive level of nuisance is                       required.          Equally i t    has   to be

explained why some fixtures,                  indeed the majority of fixtures,                       pass

off   without     any    apparent      trouble.               Football      crowds    can be     broken

down into at least three broad groups.                              Firstly, there are those who

are keen supporters, who attend regularly,                             who will       be represented

within a wide age range and who are in every respect co-operative,

and behave fairly and reasonably.                        Many of these people will               be in

seated    areas,     family         paddocks    and           be    season     ticket   holders.           A

second broad group who f i l l           the popular terraces will be vociferous

in    their    support    of    their    own club,                 acquiescent    towards      the    ill

behaved and indifferent to police                        strategies.          A third broad group

of    largely   young male volatile             supporters will                 be noisy,     actively

involved in demonstrating allegiance                           to   their     own club as well            as

belligerence       towards the opposition.                      Whilst generally passive they

are sufficiently         ill-humoured that                if    the opportunity         for   disorder

is    presented    they    will       join    the        throng.        The determined hooligan

groups    who    represent      a     special       stratum of           this    last   element       can

therefore,      and this       is    really    the point,             rely    upon a good deal of

ta cit support in the event of disorder.




15.       The      hooligan          groups     are             constantly       surveilling          the

environment        for     opportunities                 to        generate      confrontation            in

situations      that will      carry the uncommitted with them.                           In addition

our   present     understanding         leads       to         the view that         they pick    their

fixtures and that the hooligan effort is selectively targetted.

16.          On this alternate thesis i t                     is    not surprising that "policing

by containment" has not                    found an answer to the problem even though

i t has generally held i t                 in check.           The hooligan may be arrested on

occasions        but    the determined nature of his a c tiv ities                              is   likely to

remain undiscovered.                    For these        reasons we have been concentrating

in     recent       times     much         more    on     the       development          of   surveillance,

intelligence and evidence gathering.                               This is      a developing phase and

might       be   termed       "pre-emptive          policing".                Many of     the     in itiatives

described later in this evidence are designed to sharpen and target

the police approach to this aspect of the problem.




17.          A further matter needs                     to be examined here and that is                      the

connection between public safety and hooliganism.                                        These issues        are

often       seemingly       at     variance.         Containment fencing for                      example may

also        prevent         rapid         evacuation.               Equally        however,          lack     of

containment,         will     allow hooligan groups to storm the opposition and

create      a    scenario         within        which    there          are    wild     surges,      panic   and

massively        dangerous              crowd    pressures.              In    short     public      order    is

intrinsically linked with safety.                         Those charged with handling large

crowds      know that         the greatest              danger l ie s          in the     sheer weight of

numbers and that any signs of undue urgency or even panic can create

shock waves in one part of the crowd f e l t with tremendous intensity

at    another.         This       is    clearly     likely         to    be    compounded on terraces

where       there      is     a        deliberate       incline.              Public     disorder      is    the

occurrence most likely                    to generate          frantic         crowd movement.          Herein

lies    an awesome truth.                  Where large crowds are concerned the sheer

irrational momentum of sudden movement can never be wholly guarded

against.         Every step can be taken to provide a safe environment but

if    the    fa c ilitie s        are     misused       there       can       be   no    guarantees.         Put




                                                          -   8-
another way any large crowd in a confined space generates potential

dangers, so long as that crowd is                        reasonably orderly that danger is

minimal but there                can be no absolute protection,                      by engineering or

policing,         if    large numbers in the                 crowd are           determined          to    behave

irresponsibly.




18.         Fortunately             the      great      majority           of     regular           supporters

recognise      the obvious             dangers and are              cautious,       particularly            when

entering      and        leaving       sports      stadia.       The hooligan is                as ever       the

bizarre exception and in this                        category we would have to put those

who    seek       to     enter      an     a ll   ticket      stadium without             tickets.          This

unfortunately            is     not       uncommon      and     as     a    strategy           must       involve

something of a mass attempt to stand any chance of success.




19.         These       paragraphs          are    an    attempt       to       characterise          football

hooliganism at i t s present stage, however the situation is                                         almost by

it s   very       nature        ever      changing.          Overall       there     is       probably       less

hooliganism by volume but where i t                          occurs i t     is often more serious.

Two    aspects          of     control      have     done      much    to       change        the    nature    of

hooliganism.            The legislation which prevented the general                                  supply of

alcohol      to        fans    in   transit       and the universality of                     C.C.T.V.       have

made    a    major           impact.       Taken     together        the        effect    has       been     that

displays      of wild aggression                  from hoardes of drunken supporters are

much less         frequent.            The hooligan           has    moved out           of    the    camera's

range   and       in     a word,         there has been "displacement"                        away from the

terraces to the darker confines                         of    the    stadium or to other venues

such as public houses and the transit system.

20.       The evidence        from our        intelligence              operations         indicates       a

good deal       of    violence     occurs   away from football                    grounds      on other

than     match days      and seemingly having nothing to                          do     with football

other than that allegiance to a football                          team is    the         reason behind

the gang's association.              This may be a consequential development or

i t may simply be that we are only just learning of how these things

occur.      A further        inference      drawn from intelligence                      operations       is

that the hooligans are much more selective                             in their         affairs.       They

do not attend every match with a plan for disorder,                                rather they pick

particular      fixtures      which    represent             in   their     distorted          mythology

special     challenge or consequence.                  On these occasions they may well

contact     beforehand       others    who are          similarly         minded         and   even     the

opposition.




21.         Whilst much of the worst of the problem relates to hooligan

gangs    this    is    not   the     only   phenomenon.                Earlier     in    paragraph       14

reference was made to a "third estate" of supporters who were always

capable of wholesale misbehaviour i f                   circumstances are favourable to

that      end. Containment policing is                 designed to          keep        this     in   check

and is    usually effective           in doing so.                It    should be         said    however

that policing         "big occasions"        is    especially            trying because that is

exactly when the atmosphere is               likely to be so heightened that this

v olatile    section of       the    crowd will         misbehave.           It    is     the sense of

occasion associated with "semi-finals"                        and "finals"             or with end of

season      clashes        which      determine          championships,                 promotion        and

relegations which induces an atmosphere of challenge and expectation

and often drunkenness to boot.                    In these circumstances policing can

be    much more       d iffic u lt   but    usually          achieveable         a ll    other        things

                enquiry        and    the    attention         given     to    the      hooliganism          problem        is

    I           is unquestionably dangerous.                     If    crowds are orderly and responsive

                the only real danger,              providing spectator limits are maintained,                               is

                policing       football       included         the    setting       up of     a national           index of

basis of the intelligence                    system.             It was effective                  to a degree and

provided          information       about         numbers          of        travelling            supporters           and

their    mode of          transport.          It     was consistent with the                              strategy of

"containment policing" in that i t provided the basis for control and

segregation, escorts and the rest.




24.           In 1985 the         sub-committee determined to                                examine and revise

this    intelligence            system recognising                     that       it     lacked      precision          and

formality.          As a result          of       that    examination the                    system of passing

information between liaison officers was standardised and an effort

made     to       make     the    information             available                more      comprehensive.                 A

proforma was           produced        so    that        information               would        be    stored           on   a

common        basis      and     the    system          required              that       a   match         information

summary be prepared at                  the       conclusion of                   each game          to    record       the

details       of    the    match,      v iz .,     number              of    travelling            supporters,          the

accuracy of the information supplied,                              details of coaches and trains,

details       of    arrests,      details          of    any incidents                   etc.        A copy of          the

report       would be       retained         by     the          Force        hosting         the     match           and   a

further        copy       sent    to        the    Force           from           whom       the      away       support

originated.           On this basis over time each liaison officer would have

a file       of    reference      for       a ll encounters during preceding seasons as

well    as    a file       on the performance                     of        his    supporters             at   a ll    away

games.        This       system     works         effectively                 and      match       commanders           and

liaison officers report i t is much more effective than i t used to be.




25.          Whilst these arrangements were being put into effect we were

at     the    same       time    examining more                  closely           the    distinction            between

"match information" and "intelligence".                                     Whilst match information is

in     some       degree     intelligence,              in       real         terms       intelligence                should

relate to the identity, the known associations,                                        the known strategies

and,     if       possible,         the    actual        plans    of     those         involved in         football

violence.            Recognising           that    most     liaison           officers       were        not     in    a

position          to develop much of                this    sort       of     information we have over

the last          two years made additional                      recommendations.                 In particular

we      have        recommended           that     for     each        club       there      is     an     approved

"intelligence              officer"       who     should        seek     to       develop     a portfolio             of

intelligence             in     real       terms.          It     is        recognised,           however,       that

developing           intelligence           involves       a different              approach        to     policing

football          than simply managing each game.                             It is       entirely dependent

upon the progressive development of new s k ills                                       through observation,

surveillance,              undercover            operations,           targetted          use      of     C.C.T.V.,

intelligence           gathering,          active        policies        of       arrest     and the           use    of

travelling           away      "spotters".            Whilst           such       an     approach         has    been

recommended by                the    ACPO Sub-Committee                the        costs    and      professional

d iffic u ltie s have to be taken into account and many Forces have not

fe lt    at       this      stage     that        justification             has     existed         for     such       a

commitment.              Equally       the       development           of     the      s k ills    necessary          to

build up intelligence takes time and,                              whilst we have been involved

in    explanation             and training,           practices             are    not    yet      in    step    with

theory.




National Football Intelligence Unit



26.            In     an      effort       to     give      some        coherence           to      intelligence

gathering and because by i t s                        very nature intelligence of this kind

needs     a       wide     purview,         the     ACPO have           presented           the     case        for    a

nationally           organised            intelligence           unit.         Hooligan           gangs     operate

across        a     wide      area     and      may   of        course       be     involved        in     criminal
escapades in any town between their point of departure and the venue

of the fixture.         Furthermore, in recent times there is                  good evidence

that     they    will    often    plan    criminal       violence      which    has        nothing

whatever to       do with   football.       There        is   a need     to   overview        such

events    to    identify patterns        and recognise what is behind seemingly

unconnected events.




27.       Equally we have argued that              as    there has been         much public

concern about the conduct of English spectators abroad, particularly

those following the national side,                there is      a need for some central

point to retain,        gather and disseminate intelligence concerning fans

who travel      abroad and cause trouble.                At    present   no    local        Police

Force has any real stake in this matter.




28.       For a ll these reasons the development of a National Football

Intelligence Unit is        seen as of      critic a l        importance and at            present

negotiations      with    the    Home Office       are    well    in hand for         it    to be

funded by Common Police Services (Appendix B refers).




Closed Circuit Television




29.       In 1983 in conjunction with the Football Trust,                      who provided

the    finance,   an experiment was undertaken to examine the usefulness

of C.C.T.V.       in dealing with hooliganism.                 Rudimentary systems were

set up in Manchester,           Edinburgh and Birmingham.            One of the problems

which always exists         in developing ACPO ( i . e .          national)      in itia tives

is    the lack of a central staff to evaluate and formulate policy.                             It

was therefore d if f ic u lt      to evaluate properly these experiments but

in 1985 an approach was made to the Trust to extend these f a c i l i t i e s




                                              -   14-
in First and Second Division grounds.                              About this    time as     a result

of    the problems         at    Luton,    Birmingham, Bradford and Heysel the call

for C.C.T.V. became a clamour.                    Very obligingly the               Football       Trust

made considerable              funds    available          and over the last few years some

sort of system has been made available to a ll League clubs.




30.          Because of the considerable expenditure there was an urgent

need    to    be    more precise          in    the whole area of               C.C.T.V.     A review

organised by the sub-committee reported that systems were generally

inadequate         as    far    as their       specifications          went and that        operators

were untrained and operations lacked strategy.                              In short,       simply to

put    in C.C.T.V.         was no answer at                a ll.     We needed to     know what we

expected of the equipment, what the best configuration of                                   equipment

might    be,    operators         needed to be properly trained                    (to     this    end a

whole new area of expertise had to be developed)                                 and i t    had to be

allied   to    an intelligence system.                     Protracted negotiations with the

Home Office took place and eventually a technical committee was set

up staffed by officers                 and support staff with knowledge in this area

from various            Forces    and with       the        permanent     expert    advice        of   Mr.

Andrew Ford,            seconded from the Scientific,                  Research and Development

Branch of the Home Office.                 This committee has worked in conjunction

with the Football Trust and given professional advice to a ll                                     Police

Forces providing C.C.T.V. coverage.                         It has also developed advice on

new equipment and proper specifications.




31.          Over the      last    two years       training courses set up in Greater

Manchester have trained almost 200 operators nationally and training

is    ongoing.          Additionally a training                    and awareness video has been

put together and made available to a ll Police Forces.

32.      Whilst we have made great strides                               in    this     area the present

lack    of    wholehearted          development              on the       intelligence         front      s till

means that          the    real    potential       is        not entirely           f u lfille d .      Equally

there    remains          something of a debate as to the best use of C.C.T.V.

For evidence and intelligence gathering different specifications may

be desirable            than those        for   crowd control and safety.                       Accordingly

the sub-committee has now set up a working party to examine the best

advice on the use of C.C.T.V. for crowd control.                                      On 29th July 1988,

following presentations                 by the     Secretary to                "football       conferences"

and to       the ACPO national conference,                         a paper was circulated by the

Chairman       to       Chief      Constables       outlining             the       related          strategies

recommended by the sub-committee in relation to the use of C.C.T.V.

and intelligence operations.                    These are attached at Appendix C.




Football Conferences




33.      The diffic ulty             of    disseminating national                    policy has         always

been accute.              In the    area of       football          policing there            is     a greater

need for consistent policy and communication with other Forces than

in     almost        any        other      area     of         policing.              The     reasons        are

self-evident.              Almost       uniquely        we         are    always        policing         events

involving      some level of participation with other Police Forces.                                          In

a word we are policing a crowd and hooligans                                    from another Division

or another Police Force.




34.      In         1986    in     an     effort        to     improve         liaison       and       increase

consistency         a     system was       set     up to           provide      a    conference         at   the

season's       end        for     the     match     commanders                and   their      intelligence

officers for each Division of the Football League.

35.            At each of these            conferences              the ACPO guidance on policing

football        is    an agenda        item and commanders                      are   requested            for   any

views      as    to    its    update.        Copies           are     also        issued      to    a ll    people

attending        the    conferences.              The   conferences have provided a forum

for wide-ranging              debate,       the    exchange           of    professional            information

and new ideas and the emergence of concerns for consideration by the

ACPO sub-committee.                A copy of the minutes                     of    those      conferences         is

at Appendix D.




Liaison with other bodies




36.            Over    the    last     four       years       we have           sought     to      improve       and

fa c ilita te     our liaison with other bodies and institutions that have

a role         in dealing with the football problem.                               The Secretary of the

Sub Committee is              in frequent contact with the Football                                Association,

the     Football       League,       the    Professional             Footballers'          Association           and

the     Referees        and    Linesmen       Association.                 On a ll       of     these        fronts

relationships           are    good and generally a high level                             of      co-operation

e x is t s .




37.            As far as the Football Association is                            concerned recent areas

of    co-operation           include       close    attention              to     international            fixtures

(the Football Association in part funded the intelligence operations

undertaken by British                  police      officers           in    West      Germany during the

European         Cup)        and   a       substantial              agreement         over         handling       of

misbehaviour on the fie ld of play.                                               *




                                                          -   17-
38.           There are many matters of mutual concern between the police

and     the        Football       League,        in   particular       problems          concerning      the

scheduling of fixtures.




39.           In    the     general        context      match commanders are               inevitably     in

weekly i f         not daily contact with the secretaries of Football League

clubs     and        in     the    great        majority      of     cases    the    relationship        on

practical matters is                f ir s t    c la s s..   At the level of policy the ACPO

Sub Committee             through i t s         Secretary deals with current                  issues    and

the    Police        Service       has     no     difficulty       in making        known i t s     views.

Whilst there           is    no absolute coincidence of view on every issue,                              in

general there is a spirit of co-operation.




40.           It    should be mentioned too                   that   the     Secretary       of   the   Sub

Committee is           ex-officio          a trustee         of the Football Trust.               Over the

last few years the Trust have endorsed a number of spending schemes

to a ssist policing,               most particularly in the area of closed circuit

television.




PROBLEM AREAS




Old Grounds




41.           Many football grounds are over 100 years                             old and many more

were    built        at     a time when i t            was sensible          for   the    stadium to be

close    at        hand     to    their        support.       Consequently          many    stadia      have

outgrown the site s on which they were built and rise ominously from

the    door-steps           of    terraced housing which presses                    almost up to         the

turn-stiles.              There       is       inadequate       parking        space       and    crowding
problems        are      compounded        by     narrow         streets.         It    is        extremely

d if fic u lt      to        sustain       free      routes        for      emergency             vehicles.

Immediately after a game the ground is                           often isolated for               up to     an

hour by the           sheer volume of people making their way to car parks,

trains, coaches and the rest.                     Whereas much is made of large sums of

money involved in transfer fees,                     most of this money is often no more

than     credit         balances       circulated        within       the     League,          in     effect

exchanging        funds       from the       wealthy       clubs      to    the    poorer          clubs    in

return for better players.                  Either way few clubs have had the money

if    they have had the wish to                   do much to substantially improve the

structural       quality       of grounds.          Many are primitive                 in    the     extreme

often     with     wholly          inadequate      to ile t s     and refreshment             fa cilitie s,

often with uncovered areas of terracing and usually comprising in a

main     stand      a       warren    of    passages       and      rooms     which         are     at   best

inadequate.           Although        some of      the    major      clubs    have          some part      of

their f a c i l i t i e s    at an excellent standard, they a ll retain primitive

enclosures         for       the    less    articulate           members      of       their        support.

Football        stadia have been tinkered with over many years,                                    few were

actually designed to be what they                        are      now.      Radial      and perimeter

barriers        have been imposed on an inadequate                         infrastructure.               Often

the     alignment           between    turn-stiles,             fa cilities    and          terracing       is

completely distorted.                 In short,      crowd supervision within the ground

and outside at turn-stiles usually consists                              in making the best of a

bad job.




42.         A point         that     should be made here is               that on most occasions

the bulk of         the      crowds are home supporters                   and go to          exactly       the

same place in the ground every match.                            They know their way and they




                                                       -19-
know    the      problems.              "Semi-finals"           played      at     neutral      grounds,

however,        are    entirely           made       up    of     away     supporters       where   this

directional sense is               usually wholly absent.                  Thus i t may be that on

these occasions the design failings of old football grounds are most

likely to surface.




Capacities and Safety Certificates




43.        The        safety        certification            process        involves      the    general

presumption that segregated parts of the grounds will be safe for a

given capacity.              If the structure has failings then the capacity is

reduced until          things       are       improved.         There are however d iffic u ltie s

with this       arrangement             particularly        where     the    area    in   question     is

terracing.        If    it    is    a large area but nonetheless sub-divided then

there   can be over-            crowding         in    some parts          balanced    by    spaces    in

others.       Seating of           course would determine distribution on an even

basis, terracing certainly does not.




44.        Onesolution would be to make the                          segregated areas           smaller

so that,      provided turn-stiles,                  fa cilities     and terracing are properly

aligned,      capacities           in    a given       segment      would be        sufficiently      low

that    over-crowding          should          not    be   a problem.            The difficulty     with

this proposal is             that       in the event of            fire    or    structural      collapse

there should be "expansion room" for the crowd to escape.




45.        In    short the disadvantage of wide open terraces i s that the

crowd can concentrate,                  the    advantage is         that    it    provides      expansion

room.     This    is    a fine          balance and probably needs greater research.

Unquestionably however more seating would improve the distribution.

46.          Policing              arrangements           ideally            would        allow       officers

sufficient          access          to     the     crowd         so        that    they     could      act   to

"distribute" overcrowding and/or remove troublemakers.                                          There should

be gangways and access points well enough stewarded to allow passage

and there should be secure corridors as well giving protected access

to    critic a l     areas.          In general however i t                 is    in the very nature of

terracing       that          if    the    crowd      is        large        gangways        are      extremely

d iffic u lt to maintain.




47.          Not to       labour the point,                if    grounds were being constructed

afresh well designed control mechanisms could produce configurations

which would allow a much safer management of the crowd.                                            As has been

indicated          the        alignment          between         queueing          areas,        turn-stiles,

fa cilities        and spectator            areas    is     c r itic a l.         There is      a balance to

be achieved between confining sections of                                   the ground so that            undue

concentration            is    avoided on the one hand,                       and allowing          sufficient

expansion room for                  safety on the          other.            In    reality      few    football

stadia       are      even          moderately        well           designed.            The      containment

arrangements have a ll been disjointedly                               fastened on to            a basically

inadequate structure.




48.          A question that needs to be addressed here is                                      the relevance

of    "all    seater"         stadia.       Historically              it    has been tried with very

disappointing            results.          Coventry was a noteable                       example and to      an

extent       other    clubs         have    greatly        increased             their    seating      capacity

only    to    find       spectators         reluctant           to    use    seats       or worse eager      to

misuse them.             There are a number of considerations                             which are      to be

taken into         account.           Firstly,      if     seating          is    provided the        area has

really to be covered.                     People may stand in the                    rain but they will




                                                           -21-
not     sit   in the     rain.     Secondly,      there        is   a good deal           of    consumer

resistance.        Many spectators simply want to stand in the traditional

way which they associate with "atmosphere".                           Thirdly of course there

is     the question of cost           and,    on some grounds,              the    risk    of    reduced

capacities.




49.       None     of     these       matters     are     fundamental              and    given     the

over-riding importance of safety                  and the obvious benefits                      in terms

of     distributing      spectators      and making the              stadium more manageable

a ll    seater     stadia    should      without         question          be     the    aim.      As    a

practical matter however i t would probably be desirable to develop a

rolling programme requiring club management to progressively                                      reduce

the     capacity    of    standing       areas    and     increase          the    availability         of

seating.       This would        allow       spectators    to       gradually       adjust       and be

more r e a listic       from the      club's     point of       view.           Ibrox is perhaps a

powerful example of what can be achieved.




50.       As a final word on capacities                   the ACPO guidance               includes      a

recommendation that the Police Control Box should have the fa c ilit y

to monitor turn-stile readings.                   This    is    available          in    some grounds

but     not   many and i t       is    probably     timely          that    safety       certificates

require some system of monitoring accessible                           to       the Police       Control

Box.




51.       The issue of Safety Certificates                     is fundamental to the whole

question of ground safety and to Policing.




                                                   -22-
52.        Safety       certificates         are    generally          complex         and    subject       of

detailed     scrutiny.           In    most    cases,         a    Safety    Committee          involving

Police,     Fire        Service,        Local       Authority           and,       sometimes,          Club

Secretary,       work together          to    determine           specifications.            Whilst this

is good practice,          i t s weakness is          that we have no guarantee of                      the

real expertise of those involved.                        After a tragedy, in which so many

young lives have been lo st,                 we really have to ask ourselves whether

the guidance       in the        "Green Code" is              sufficient.         The point is made

again that there is a need for greater research into safety problems

and     greater     investment         in     the    training          of    those      who     make    the

decisions.




53.        Afinal        point    of    concern,         in respect         of    Certification,            is

that     some grounds      are now owned by Local Authorities                            who are also

the Certifying Authority.                This appears to be wrong in principle.




Late Arrivals anfl Banned Spectators




54.        Acommon problem for                 police         concerns      the    late       arrival       of

fans.      If a train is         late or perhaps a motorway blocked,                           it    can be

that    several     hundred       spectators         will      arrive       at    the    ground       after

"kick off"       and,    particularly         if    it    is      a critica l      fixture,         will be

clamorous     to    gain    entry.           There       is    an     argument         that     in    these

circumstances       the    "kick off" might be delayed.                          The problem is             of

course    that     on this       basis       kick    off       times    will       inevitably         slide

further    and     further       back.        To date         there    has       not    really       been    a

convention about this although i t is                     always open to match commanders

to propose a delay to the referee.




                                                     -23-
55.        A further problem relates                      to people who for no good reason

are late to reach the               turn-stiles.            It    was ACPO's fear            that       if    an

absolute ban on alcohol was enforced at grounds, and i f indeed local

hostelries were closed,              the effect would simply be to delay arrival

as fans went further afield to find "watering holes".                                    Guardedly i t

may be said this is generally the case.                            If fans know no alcohol is

available       some are more likely to be late arriving.                               One answer to

this problem lie s in timing critica l fixtures so that alcohol is                                           not

available       anyway,       for    example      morning or            mid-day       kick    offs.           It

remains an open question as to whether the general 3 p.m.                                    "kick-off"

time is really appropriate.




56.        A related         issue    is    the      efficien t         manning of        turn-stiles.

Over many years match commanders have complained about                                       not    enough

turn-stiles       being      open or       not    being          open early       enough.          As    with

stewarding       turn-stile         operatives       are        often    casual       labour    and          not

entirely        reliable.         These     matters             have    been     raised      with        Club

Secretaries and,         certainly for major fixtures,                     should not now occur

too often.        There is however a further problem at turn-stiles about

which less       is   known than           should be.             The   intelligence         operations

referred        to     previously           suggest             that     turn-stile          fraud            is

wide-spread.          This    clearly       is   a    serious          matter    if    borne        out       as

capacities       could       be   exceeded       without          police    or    management being

aware.     Some means of            auditing      turn-stile            operations      is     necessary

and i t    is   proposed to enter discussions with the League to discuss

this issue.




                                                      -   24-
57.          As a sanction against               troublesome         supporters       the    F.A.       have

insisted        that      for    some clubs,      Leeds         United being      the       best    known

example,        away      fixtures       should       be    "all     ticket".         Only    approved

supporters         of    the Leeds       Club with Supporters Club Card are allowed

to    buy    tickets.           This    system has         in    fairness     done      something         to

moderate        the reputation           of    Leeds       but    largely     by transferring the

problem.       ACPO did not support the scheme in principle although they

agreed to       stand by i t .           In fact,     on the day, many match commanders

faced with a mob outside                  the ground and insufficient                     resources       to

Police       in and out,         simply le t them in without tickets.                       This was a

regrettable reality but underlines the d iffic u ltie s                           associated with

"all ticket" fixtures.                  No doubt long term and short term solutions

are    in conflict         here,       and no doubt resolve               in favour of        the       long

term should be best practice,                   but i t     is    only fair to record that on

many occasions match commanders have acceded to the mob at the gate

and le t in fans without tickets.




58.          One     other      group    of    banned      supporters       should be        mentioned

namely those subject to "exclusion orders".                               Suffice i t      to say that

although       many hooligans were excluded under the provisions                                   of    the

Public       Order      Act,     1986    the    Courts          imposed    bans   for       such    short

periods      that       the exclusion         scheme became wholly discredited in the

eyes    of     the      Police    Service.       Short      term exclusion           is     simply       not

enforceable and certainly no deterrent.




Toutg



59.          The ACPO Sub Committee has                    for    sometime registered concern

with     the    Home      Office       about    the     problem       of     ticket       touts.         The




                                                       -25-
d iffic u ltie s     they present are principally two fold: f ir s t ly , because

they will       s e ll   tickets   to    anyone,       they are        likely           to    disturb     the

segregation arrangements              (away supporters               for    example will            be sold

tickets for the home sections of the ground);                              secondly,         because they

guarantee      the availability          of    tickets        on the day,              they effectively

encourage      people      without      tickets        to    attend        a ll    ticket         fixtures.

There     is    no    particular      offence      in        relation       to     ticket         touts   and

commonly the police resort to arresting them either for                                       obstruction

or suspicion of forged tickets.                   Regrettably the ACPO were not able

to produce factual evidence of a problem to satisfy the Home Office

of a need for legislation but the difficulty l ie s in knowing exactly

what    would      constitute      such evidence             other     than        the       judgement      of

police    officers        on the      scene.      There        undoubtedly              remains     a clear

need for       an offence       making    it    ille g a l      to    trade        tickets         for    "all

ticket"    fixtures on match days.                There may need to be some exemption

allowing the club to do so with the approval of the Police.




Communications




60.        The Police Service has              long struggled with the problems                             of

communications           on   major     sporting       occasions,           the        d iffic u ltie s    are

commonplace in the Service.                Principally the problem relates                           to    the

high level of ambient background noise associated with a large crowd

and technical gadgets such as ear pieces have not really compensated

successfully.            In addition,     when large           numbers of men are deployed

there is       often a problem of providing enough channels                                  to   avoid the

system being          overloaded.        Many forces           are     not        in     a position        for

example to provide a dedicated command channel.




                                                   -   26-
61.       Regardless,           good communications are                     of       absolute          importance

and     two    issues          are    probably          of      great       assistance.                Land        line

telephones       at      key points         connecting              to    the     Match Control               are    of

critic a l     importance         and secondly           good C.C.T.V.                 systems will            allow

the   Control       to      survey     problems         themselves              reducing         the    need        for

reports back.




62.       Problems of           communications               are simply technical however and

with a sufficient level of investment should be surmountable.                                                  It is

perhaps       the      case      that       investment              in     this       area       should        be     a

responsibility           of     the    football         club         and    more          clearly       addressed

within Safety Certificates.




63.       One aspect which is                 vital      is         the    siting      and f a c i l i t i e s      of

Control       Posts.        They      should      be     specified              to    give        an    all-round

radio    and telephone           links,      sufficient              room for         liaison          with    other

services,      accommodate maps,              plans          and emergency systems and so on.

Few are       really        adequate     and in         our         view    if       they      fa ll    short       the

global capacity of the ground should be restricted to 10,000.




64.       Communication              with    the       crowd         is     another         issue.            It    is

recommended good practice to have the ability to override the public

address system at any time in the interests of public safety.                                                      This

should be a rehearsed practice understood by both police                                                and those

who   operate         the      system.       It    is        probably        valid        to     recommend the

training       of        the     professional            broadcaster                 to     present           police

messages.       It is         suggested in the Guide to Safety at Sports Grounds




                                                         -   27 -
that portable public                    address          systems           be     at     hand to       speak      to    the

crowd.        Police experience is                      a l i t t l e ambivalent in this area.                          They

can be useful but in serious situations they tend to be ineffective.




Intelligence




65.           Paragraphs           23        -   28     refer        to      developments          in       the    police

intelligence            system          but       under       the          heading       of     "Problems"         it     is

reasonable         to     record some of                 the d iffic u ltie s                police    have       in this

direction.           First      of      a ll      with 43 separate Police Forces in England

and Wales i t           is    always d iffic u lt to obtain consistency of practice.

Equally       up     to      the     present            there       has     been       no     e fficien t     means      of

enhancing          the        system             and     enforcing                standard        practice.             The

development          of       the       National             Football             Intelligence          Unit       should

improve the situation but there                              is      probably a need for                    the Police

Service to make a greater commitment in this area.




Costs




66 .          The cost of policing football is                                    enormous.       Appendix E sets

out some details of what is involved.                                      On balance football               clubs pay

approximately 30% of                    the total            cost      (of which 30% is               subsidised by

the Football Trust).                    It has been recognised of course that much of

the    policing         effort          is       directed       towards            the    crowds on the public

highways       making         their          ways       to   and      from         the      fixture.        By     common

practice       these         officers            form a reserve during the game usually on

duty     in    the      grounds          but        uncharged              for.        The    whole     business         of

charging       football            clubs         has     been       considered            and re-considered              by

Police    Forces          over       the         last    few        years.          There       are     a   number       of




                                                                -   28 -
d if f ic u lt ie s .        There is         some disparity between Police Forces as to

the    rate     at which charges                are made.           The number     of     hours     charged

varies and is bound to both because tours of duty may be longer for

large crowds and major fixtures and/or because officers may have to

travel long distances to                      the grounds.           There is some ambiguity as               to

what constitutes                  "ground duties".            If the physical perimeter of                    the

stadium is          the dividing line then officers engaged in the duties of

turn-stile          supervision (searching and queuing) would not be charged

for.      Police opinion is               that such duties should usually be regarded

as ground duties.




67.           There      is       another      area    of    difference       in   that      some     forces

charge        for    specific          numbers on a match by match basis                      and others

charge according to a formula rating matches as "high",                                      "medium" and

"low" priority, gauged over the season.




68 .          From the club's point of view there is a feeling that police

charges       continue         to      soar    and that        they    have   no   control        over    the

numbers        that      the      Chief       Constables determine are             required.          Whilst

this     is    true      in       reality they probably               do not fare       badly     from        an

equitable           point         of   view but       this    observation takes          no account           of

their      ability           to     pay   or     otherwise.            Clearly     many       clubs      face

recurrent d iffic u ltie s in meeting their creditors.




69.           At a practical level                there is          sometimes a reluctance by the

police locally to police additional fixtures                               even where there              is    a

willingness             to    pay      because    income        from    football        is   usually      not

directly available to the match commander as                                  "overtime".         In short




                                                             -29-
internal budgeting arrangements for Police Forces where private cost

charges     are     involved       sometimes               present        d iffic u ltie s       for     match

commanders.




70.       Whilst i t       is    the case that Police Forces are bound to police

what is there rather than what they would like to police,                                        the burden

of    policing     football       often       fa lls        most    heavily        on    those     that      are

anyway hard pressed and at particularly busy times.                                        If    any broad,

new view is        to be taken about policing football                             some consideration

should be given to              the diffic ulty             Police        Forces    face     in providing

the manpower given that under the present (legal)                                      arrangements only

a relatively small percentage of                       costs        are    recoverable.           Whilst      it

can be argued that crowds in public places are a natural part of the

police    responsibility          it     can     also       be     argued       that    football        crowds

have become a very special problem and that perhaps some other way

of    funding     police    commitments              out     of    football        revenue        should     be

considered.        An alternative               to     present          arrangements         might      be   to

raise a levy on persons attending football grounds                                      akin to        the old

"aviation security levy" at airports.                              If this proposal was properly

evaluated a means           might       be      found of           more    adequately           recompensing

police efforts.




Stewardina




71.       This     seemingly innocuous heading in                           fact    raises one of the

most contentious issues which has probably never been satisfactorily

resolved.       On the      face       of i t    a football             stadium is privately owned

and the proprietors have a responsibility to conduct and manage the

ground    when      spectators          are      present           in     the   interests         of    public




                                                        -   30 -
safety.      Stewards are largely their agents to                           this effect.            In most

circumstances this would be a fairly unequivocable proposition.                                            The

debate however surrounds the role of the police                                  and the police            are

only     there    because        stewards      cannot handle football                    crowds without

the back-up of law enforcement officers.                          An acquiescent crowd could

well    be managed by stewards                alone but       a crowd which has                    time and

again      demonstrated          an    eagerness      to     fight          on      a    mass      scale    if

unsupervised        by   police,         simply      cannot       be    controlled            by    stewards

alone.      Because of this,            whatever the         theory,         the practice           in most

football     grounds       is    that    the police control ingress and egress and

determine what parts of the stadium will be kept clear and where the

divisions       between groups of             spectators       will         lie .       Usually this        is

routine and stewards carry out an ancillary role in accordance with

the police plan.            The question is          therefore raised who is                       in charge

of     crowd      control        and    where     does       responsibility                 lie    for     the

management of fans?




72.         Mr.    Justice       Popplewell's        final    report         at paragraphs 4.13 -

4.19      discussed      this      issue.       Indeed      Mr.        Justice          Popplewell         took

evidence       from the         Chairman and Secretary                 of     the       Sub-Committee on

this    point     and his        observations very much reflect                         th is.     In brief

the    final      report        resolved      that   the     police         presence         is    there     to

a ssist     enforcement          of     law   and    order        but       that        a    primary        and

continuing obligation lay upon the proprietors to manage the crowd.

Mr. Justice Popplewell noted that in the event of emergency, police

inevitably take de facto responsibility for organising the crowd but

added this in no way lessened the obligations of the proprietor.




                                                     -31-
73.          Whilst Mr. Justice Popplewell's remarks are a wise and fair

summary       of    the      situation         current     reflection             does        raise    further

questions.          Whilst         legal        responsibilities              may         lie     with        the

proprietor the "de facto responsibility" which f a lls upon the police

in the event of an emergency is                        conditioned in i t s           effectiveness by

what    has    gone     on before          -    otherwise        the       Service       is     very    much a

"hostage to fortune".




74.          In particular          if     capacity        control         and     packing        is    not     a

police       function,       which commonly (although not entirely)                              it    is   not,

then handling the aftermath is                    a t a ll      order.        Equally i f        the Police

exercise      priority        (which they always do)                  in marshalling segregation

of     the     crowd,        and    through       their         control        post,          C.C.T.V.        and

communications          dominate         the    means      of        crowd    control,          they    cannot

simply       say   it   is    at    bottom       a     matter        for     the    Club.         Most      Club

Secretaries        if     asked      would       simply        say     "the       police        control       the

match".        Whatever       the    legal      niceties         this      often     seems       to    be     the

reality.       Yet because police                control        is    only partial             in the       sense

that     stewards,        turn-stile           staff     and     the       rest    have         considerable

duties, there are grey areas.




75.          The    Safety          Certificate           is         supposed        to        resolve        the

d iffic u ltie s in part by laying down safe tolerances such that in an

emergency the ground and the men that run i t ,                                can cope.          The stark

reality may be however that a good many football grounds are simply

not    safe    enough in an emergency i f                    they are at or near capacity -

given the present nature of football crowds.                                 Of course,         most of the




                                                         -32-
time     "capacities"         are    not        reached           and the       problems          do    not        show.

But,    in the last analysis,                   safety is           always a calculated compromise

and as practical men safety committees ask for what is possible.




76.        It may be that the ambiguous position of the police is part

of the problem - that is                  acknowledging the club's responsibility for

safety on the one hand, whilst routinely assuming a ll those tasks of

stewarding which           the       stewards              cannot       do,     either       because          of     the

truculence         of supporters                or    the limited             talents of          the        stewards

themselves,        on the other.                It has to be said that the                         present          lack

of    clarity      in these         arrangements can lead to                      something of a 'dogs

dinner'.        In some clubs the police actively control the                                      stewards,          in

others     the      stewards          are           quite         independent         and,        despite           some

improvements,       standards             of    stewarding vary                 considerably            with many

being too old or simply unreliable.                                    The Secretary is            normally the

"safety         officer"       but             he         w ill        have      many        other           weighty

responsibilities on match days.




77.        It     may     be     better              to     acknowledge           that       if     trouble           is

anticipated        or    if     crowd           control           is    going     to     test          the    ground

capacities       then,     in the          interests              of public       safety,         police       should

take    control     over       the        stewards           through          their    supervisory             chain.

Stewards would continue to have a v ital role in the strategy but two

issues would follow:             first          if    "packing" and "gangway" control                              were

on     occasion    a     police       responsibility,                   the    police     might         require        a

different         standard           of         performance              from         stewards;              secondly

co-ordination       between          the       organisers              and police        would         have to be

clear and formal.

78.        It     is      necessary          to        re-iterate         some       observations           on

stewarding.        They are at best                 casual workers            (usually working one

day   in    two        weeks),       they    are        probably       not     people        who    have     a

supervisory        role      in    ordinary        life       and are not        always      equipped or

used to giving           directions         or    facing obstruction,                many are       retired

people, and pay is not so attractive as to guarantee commitment.




79.        In the best            circumstances           there      should be a well qualified

Safety     Officer,          someone    other          than    the     Club    Secretary,           a    Chief

Steward,        Sector       Supervisors          and     well    trained,       carefully         selected

Stewards.        All this         is presently recommended.                   To make i t      a reality

i t would need to be a more carefully worded condition of the safety

certificate        with       mandatory          inspection          by   members       of     a    "Safety

Committee"        which       includes       the       police.        The     Chief    Steward          should

report     to    the     Match       Commander          and    maintain       liaison        with       Police

Control     and,        on    occasions          the    Match        Commander       should        have    the

authority to direct the Chief Steward.                            The Safety Committee should

regularly        inspect          stewards        and     any     failings        should       result       in

sanctions.




80.        Regardless          the    police       have       over    the    la st     few    years       been

concerned         to      encourage         clubs         to      improve        the    standards           of

stewarding.        Our guidance includes close liaison with stewards as is

recommended        in    the      "Guide     to    Safety at          Sports Grounds".              We also

recommend        police       take     an    active        role      in     training      stewards         and

recently        the Sub-Committee produced a training video which has been

circulated both to Police Forces and Football Clubs.

81.        Whilst there                is     general    improvement the              situation         is    still

rather patchy.              As stated earlier,                many stewards are too old or more

interested        in        watching           the     game     than       f u lf i lli n g     their        proper

function.        In particular                 stewards       rarely can intervene                   effectively

in the     face       of    troublesome              supporters.          There      has      however        been   a

marked improvement in the conduct and organisation of fire                                              stewards

and the manning of exit doors is probably constant.




Training




82.        As     a        very       practical        business        which        is     routine       to     the

Sub-Division which hosts the ground, policing football as a s k ill is

generally       "picked up" by a ll                    ranks who       are     new to          it.     For many

"specialists"             such as mounted,              motor cy c lists,            support groups,            and

the like i t is a fundamental part of their duties learned within the

context     of       on-going          events.         Recognising         that      support         from other

Divisions       is        often necessary,             good briefing           is    both      essential        and

general.        The ACPO Sub-Committee recently issued a training video to

a ll Forces on "briefing" for football.




83.        Specialist             Training            Courses       for     C.C.T.V.           operators        and

Intelligence Officers are hosted by Greater Manchester Police.




84.        Whilst i t            is    inevitable that much will have to be learned in

the   doing       the        question           of    more      specialist           training         for     match

Commanders           is     an        issue     which     needs      to      be      considered.             Safety

certification,              crowd           movement      and       safety,         communications,             the

intelligence               system,            C.C.T.V.        strategy,             evidence          gathering,




                                                             -35-
membership             schemes        and    the     rest,             are     now   a ll       d iffic u lt     and

specialist             subjects.        Furthermore,                  the    need    for        consistency      of

practice          has been underlined several                          times    in   t h i s , submission        and

training is the most likely vehicle to achieve i t .




85.          The       case    of    a match Commander's training                       course        cannot be

separated from the                  need    for     more         research       and evaluation.                Taken

together          the    possibility          of    a     developing            package         of   operational

practice          is    most        attractive.         The           subject    may       be     ideal    for     a

"Carousel" course at the National Police College.

86 .          Police      views        on    this       matter          have     been       made      reasonably

clear.        Compulsory membership imposes the likelihood of considerable

resource costs to achieve enforcement but holds out some prospect of

greater crowd discipline.                     The ACPO have been more concerned as                               to

the detail than the principle and have sought to emphasise that the

most careful consideration must be given to issues                                      like the capacity

of     the    "agency" to prevent fraud;                         the expertise of the "agency" to

manage the process                  so that    it    is      effective;          and the         robustness       of

the     technology            and the       regime      at       turn-stiles.          The ACPO views             on

these        matters      are       well    set     out          in     the     attached         correspondence

(Appendix F).




87.          It    is    the    resolution of             these         issues which will             determine

the balance of advantage between the amount of police time invested

to make the             scheme viable         as against any noticeable improvement in

crowd behaviour.

CONCLUSIONS




88 .         Over the last             few years the ACPO has done much to highlight

best practice             and co-ordinate a nationally consistent approach.                              It

is     of   course        the    responsibility        of     individual      Chief     Constables       to

interpret       national guidance within their own domain.                              On balance we

have fared well in relation to the development of match information

and liaison between forces and other agencies and we are probably on

the     brink        of    major        improvements          on     the    "intelligence"         front.

National       guidance          is    reasonably sound but probably limited by lack

of     systematic          research         into   crowd     safety        issues -     in    particular

police      concern with hooliganism                    sometimes narrows vision               on safety

matters.            Whilst       there        is   a   conference          system to     spread     best

practice       there       is    probably now a training need for Commanders.                            So

complex and technical                   has    the policing          of    football     become    that     a

rethink        on    the        preparation        ofmatch         Commanders      is    probably    now

imperative          but        must    be    linked    with        more    research     into     managing

crowds.




89.          Two     issues       cast       a shadow over these general                 observations:

the     poor    quality          and    inappropriate          location      of    so   many     football

grounds; and the vexed question of "who's in charge".




90.          Each         of     these       matters    is         intractable.         The    wholesale

relocation of football grounds is                       not possible but some substantial

things         can        be     done       within     the         existing       framework.        Three

opportunities in particular may be pursued:




                                                        -   37 -
(a)         critic a l   fixtures        test     grounds much beyond                    a normal         game,

              special    games        should          only     be     played        at      grounds        with

             excellent        fa cilities        (and the League and F.A.                       may need      to

             identify and improve some key venues);




(b)         the process of certification needs to be placed on an annual

             basis      and    safety       committees            need      more     guidance        on      the

              "whole"    concept       of     safety         in    grounds,        i.e .    not     just     the

             physical tolerances of structures but configuration                                     and the

             relationship        of    space          and    crowd     behaviour           as     a process.

             Overall capacities may well need to be reduced;




(c)         a programme         to    provide         seating,       eventually            to   cover      most

             spectator        sections      of    the       stadium,     needs      to be implemented

             universally.




91.         As to the question of                "responsibility"             the matter of               c iv il

l i a b il it y   should not cause us to resile                     from hard decisions i f                they

are    necessary.        Dual        responsibility            for    safety        is      a    recipe      for

confusion.          The Police are always going to seize the in itia tiv e in a

c r isis;     crowd control is          always going to be inextricably                            linked to

criminal hooliganism;             the Police are never going to accept direction

from      stewards;      stewarding           will       never        (at     least         not     in       the

foreseeable          future)    be     able      to     cope      without     some law enforcement

back-up;          and finally Police do "own" most of                       the means of            control.

In these          circumstances       the Police            must accept        a leading           role    and,

despite       the    requirements        and c iv il         lia b ilitie s    of        football        clubs,
themselves       take     on        supervision       of    the       overall    conduct         of    events

wherever crowd safety is an issue.                         This responsibility i t s e l f                 turns

upon:




(a)       greater       research         to         provide       a    professional           corpus         of

           knowledge;




(b)       the better training of match Commanders;




(c)       through the          safety     certificate            process,       the    improvement           of

           the    means        of    control        particularly         communications,              control

           posts, C.C.T.V., etc.




92.       Despite       a ll    these     things          safety       will     always       be       in    the

balance    if     crowd behaviour              is    unreasonable,            those    who by violent

design disturb the equilibrium of large crowds so as to unleash the

terrible    pressures which great numbers can so precipitately create,

carry an awesome responsibility                       -    as do the Police                and Courts         in

properly bringing them to book!




93.       As a final observation but perhaps of ultimate significance

is    the matter of        compliance.              Whilst       the    Police      Service       has       gone

some way to        establish          a code of best practice                    (which has           focused

primarily       on the     public       disorder           aspects),      safety       matters         remain

largely    localised           in    concept        and     in    application.             The    Guide       to

Safety    at     Sports    Grounds        is    merely        a guide         and     in    no    dimension

mandatory.        Many     "certifying"             authorities          have       just    one       club    to

consider       and no     real       comparative           yardstick.          This    submission            has




                                                          -39-

            several times raised the question of research and training but these

            developments alone are not a guarantee of performance.                           It    is beyond

            the immediate scope of this document to outline the actual structure

            which would establish and empower such a body,                         but i t   is    considered

            that    there      is    a needfor       a Safety       Inspectorate     which would have a

            wide i f       not national         purview, andwould be both             the    repository of

            knowledge and the purveyor of best practice on a ll matters affecting

            ground         safety.     Such      a    body may need       to    be    multi-disciplinary

            (involving         the    Police,        Fire   and Ambulance        Services     as    well    as

            structural engineers and a representative from football).                               It   would

                  this    we    took       up     our    positions           at    the     turnstiles             at a r o u n d        1 1 . 1 5 am.

safety and             security             of     the       persons         working            there          and was         deemed

necessary          because             at    the        corresponding                 match          in    1988 a            robbery        h ad

taken       place.           My attention                    to    the       refreshment                 bar a r e a at          first       t o ok

the    form       of    frequent              checks          with       the       s ta f f ,    then          returning             to my

search       duties,             as    trade, at             the    refreshment                 bar w as         slow.

Persons       began          entering              the       ground          via     the    two a v a i l a b l e             turnstiles

more    or    less          as    soon       as        they       opened.           These        persons            were       s e a r c h e d as

they    entered             in s p i t e          of    the       fact       that     they       had a lr ea dy               been     searched

by    other       officers             outside           the       ground.            The       mood       of    the         people        wh o

arrived       early was                friendly and                 none,          to m y       knowledge,               objected           to

being       Searched.                 I had        occasion             to    remove        property             from         presons         on

entering,          but       the       objects           taken were                made     up o n l y of               one     l a rg e

banner,       two       cans          of    pop a n d a s m all                miniature                 bottle         of    'Bells*

whisky       in the          shape          of     a bell.              These        items       were          appropriately marked

with a       label          and       placed           in the       property            store            - no    one         objected         to

their       property             being        taken          from       them.

From    the       t ime      when          th e    turnstiles                opened        persons             entered         the     ground

at    such a       rate          that       it w a s         possible          to      carry         out a g o o d            search        of

each.        There          was       no    rush        to    get       in a n d      the m o o d a n d a t m o s p h e r e

remained          friendly,                assisted           perhaps          by the           f a ct     t h at       it w a s      a f ine       day.

At    approximately                   1.50        pm,    I cannot             be     sure       of       the    time,         I was

instructed             b y the         Inspector              to    r e m a i n at         the       refreshment               bar     to

ensure       safey and                security           as       outlined          above.               I took         up a     position           in

the    centre          of    the       bar,        on the          outside,           effectively                causing             persons        to

form    two       queues,             one    on        either       side       of me.            Trade          ha d     picked        up

considerably                but       still        no    crowd          developed           waiting             to be         served.

Although          not       many       people           actually             spoke      to me            the    mood         remained

friendly.              No    one       was        abusive          to    the       st*ff        and       no    one      tried        to    obtain

                enclosure          to w h e r e         my       colleagues            were       engaged             cm    searching            duties           and

                entering          at    a -faster               rate,      but    initially              the      crowd         did       not    seem       to     fee

                anything          out       of    the       ordinary           for     such       a m at c h .

                aggressive             in t h e i r         attitude           towards           us.        They       were         complaining             t hat

                the    crush       outside             was       not     only     unbearable                but       dangerous.                There       were

                persons       of       both       sexes          a n d all       ages       who     were         in d a n g e r       of    being

                crushed.           Their          mood          wa s   such      t hat      I feared             t ha t     o ne     of    us    may     he

                assaulted.              It       is    quite           possible        that       this          feeling         amongst          t he    f a ns

                was, b r o u g h t      about          by the           conditions            outside            the       ground and            brought           on

                by    genuine          fear       of    being           crushed.            Several             persons         told       us    this       and

                they    were       assured             that       Police         Officers,             including               mounted          officers

                were    on d u t y          outside             the    ground        deputed           to       control         the       cro wd.        I saw

                several       people             climb          into     the     ground          over       the       w all     above       turnstiles

     A ~ G.            They were          leaning          over       the     fencing          on t op       of    the       w all       and

     seem#d        to    be    passing          their          tickets        d o w n to       persons        in the           crowd

     outside,           who    presumably                could    not       have     had       tickets        of       their       own        but

     Several           persons       who       were       entering          were     saying       t h at      someone             would        be

     seriously           injured          or    crushed          to    death        unless       something              was       done        to

     relieve           the    pressure          outside.              The     turnstiles           could          not       cope       with

     such     a    crush.          The     area          between       the     turnstiles              and    the       rear       of     the

     stand        filled       with       persons          who    made        their      way     towards           the Leppi ng s

     Lane     terrace          and    s ta n d .          It w as      not     possible          for me           to    do a n y t h i n g

     about        the    persons          who       entered       over        the    wall       du e    to the          numbers           wh o

     were     pre s e n t ,        they    simply          jumped       down and           disappeared                 into       the     crowd.

     Many     of       the    people       who       e n t e r e d at       this     time       ha d b e e n       drinking.                  T h is

     in m y       opinion          tended       to       inflame       their        anger       and made           them more

     aggressive              and    I genuinely                feared       t hat    sooner        or    l a ter        one       of     us

     would        be a s s a u l t e d .        The       sheer       number        of    persons        made          it     impossible

     to    consider           arresting             or    ejecting          the     persons       who were              drunk.            My

     impression              was    that       these       persons          had     in the       main arrived                  late       at       the

     ground,           having       been       in    local       licensed           premises           drinking             but    this        by

     no mearts a p p l i e d          to all.              The    mood        had    changed           from       being        go<

     naturid           earlier       to    one       of    hostility,             perhaps        anger        brou^-m,            on     by f e ar

     in |fhe c r o w d         outside.              The       situation          continued and               s^ddeny             th e    lar ge

     crowd        of    people       surged          in t h r o u g h       this     gate       and made           their          way

     towards           the    terracing.                 There    was       noise        coming        from       inside          th e    ground

     as    th e m a t c h a p p a r e n t l y            kicked       off,     followed          shortly           a f t e r w a r d s by a

                  little           effect,       m        a n y at all.             Persons          entering              the    ground were,               on

                  occasions              smuggling            for       breath,          particularly                the     older          ones     amongst

          1 ^ 5   was     obvious          that       something              had    occurred.              The       chants        tha t       greeted           us

                   this       was    not    the       case.         I was          greeted          by a s c e n e          that       I can        only

                  against           the    fencing           and    I could             see    t ha t     a great           many were              struggling

                  about        on    the    pitch          in a     state          of    shock,         many        in tea rs ,          many       were     very

people at           the      back        were       so     c o n c e r n e d at            being       able        to    see       t h at     no-one

Officers          were       making           frantic            signals             for    persons           to    stop        pushing            and

to m o v e       back.           Several        persons              were helped               out       of    gate          no.    2, o n t o       the

tr ac k .        Some       were       injured           but        none        seriously.               The       greatest             problem

was    around          gate        no.    3 and along                    t he    length        of      the     perimeter                fe nce .         1

saw    o ne y o u t h        who       for     some        inexplicable                    r e a s o n wa s        swinging             from a

girder       under          th e    roof       of       the W e s t         Stand.            Some       of    the       persons             on    the

pitch were             aggressive              towards              us,    we        became       the       but t       of    their          anger.

Persons          of all          ages     and       both         sexes          were       brought          from        the     pens         and

laid    on       the    pitch,,           I could              see t h a t           in the       ,CS'        pen       persons          in f r ont

of    the    fence          on     the    terrace              were       piled        on     top      of     one       another,

crushing          the       unfortunate                 o ne s      who     had       fallen        or      been        forced          to    the

ground       by     sheer          weight       of       pressure               from       behind.            Others          were       squashed

up a g a i n s t       the       fence.         As       persons            were       freed        from       the       pen       it    became

clear       tha t      there        had       been a great                  loss       of     life       a l t h o u g h at         this          stage

I thought           it w o u l d         be    in the            region          of 20.

Many    officers             were        trying          to      rescue          persons          trapped and                 my     personal

feelings          were       of     helplessness                    as    I saw        persons           crushed             up a g a i n s t        the

fence       or    under          persons        who        were          trying        to     get      out.         Helplessness

because          in s p i t e       of    being          so      close,          close        enough          to    touch          it wa s

impossible             to    help        them       out        because           of    the      narrow         ga te s .           Persons           wh o

were    only a matter                    of    feet        from          the     gates        were       unable          to     get      out.

The    casualties                were     being          treated            by St.          Johns        ambulance              staff         and

many    persons             came a n d         identified                 themselves              as     doctors             and    nurses.

These       persons          undertook              a    lot        of    first        aid      treatment.                   I brought

3    persons        from         the     terrace           who were              unconscious                amongst           others          whq*

were    able        to wal k ,           although              injured.               All     3 who         required            emergency
traiment        were        dealt       with        by    persons          who    t o l d me       t h at      they       were

trained medical                  staff       and     I returned             to     see    if      I could          help t h e

trapped        persons           still       in th e          terracing.            Recovery            of     the    victims          wa s

now    so    slow,        or     rather        it    Seemed          slow       because        it wa s         hampered           by       the

narrow       exit        gates.         T he      pressure           on    the     fence       began         to    ease     and       it

became       easier         to    recover           casualties             and     it m u s t      be    said,        also       recover

the    dead.          The      rescue        effort           was    helped        by a     senior           officer,         I believe

Chief       Sup t .      Nesbit        who     tried          to    co-ordinate           Police         efforts           by u s i n g       a

megaphone           to    get     us    to w o r k        as a       t e a m as     opposed          tp a g r o u p         of

individuals.                I saw,       initially,                 only    one     ambulance            and       I believe           t ha t

was    one     operated            by St.         J o h n ’s a l t h o u g h a m b u l a n c e s             d i d a t t e n d , as        di d

the F i r e     Brigade            to a s s i s t         in the          operation.           The      need was           for o x y g e n

to    revive        persons        and       to     help those             who     were     unconscious.                   Oxygen

was    in s h o r t       supply and              really           only    arrived        when       f i re       service

personnel           attended           with       rescue           equipment.            Advertising               boards        were       used

as    stretchers            for    the       dead and              injured.         Bodies         lay       on    the     t u rf w i t h

clothing        covering           their          fac es .          The    whole      S/Cene w a s           one     of    absolute

horror,        one       which     no-one           whatever             their/professional                    training          or

persons        at     the      front     must        have          been    tremendous             and    I experienced

great       sorrow        fo r    the    victims.                  All    the     victims       were         finally        removed

from    ’O S ’ pen          but    a great           many          persons        remained         on    the       pitch,        trying

to    find     friends           and    relatives,                 many,    in fact         nearly           all     seemed       unable

to    believe         what       had    happened.                   Many    blamed        the      p olice,          many     blamed

the    ground         and      the m a n n e r       of       ticket       allocation,             many        blamed       both.

Many    were        angry        and were           abusive          towards        me    and my         colleagues.                  To

some    extent           I understand               the       reason       fo r    this.        By      that       I do     not m e a n

returning             to    the    N or th Stand.               It w a s         while       speaking          to a          colleague

there        t h at    I realised              the    enormity             of    the       tragedy.           I learned                that

there        were      74    bodies        l ai d     in the       gymnasium.

Whilst        in the N o r t h S t a n d              I was       able          to    reflect       on w h a t          had

occurred.              What       I have w r i t t e n          before           was       my account          of       the       incident

corresponding               place     on a t e r r a c e .              The       capacity         is    governed          by      local

authority,            fire    regulations              and     police             and    I am     sure        t ha t     the     ground

can    hold more            than    t hi s      figure,        but          it    is k e p t at         the    figure           for

safety        reasons.         I do       not w i s h         to     enter         into       the a r g u m e n t        over      ticket

allocations            but    I am      convinced             that          if    only      these       persons          with

tickets        h ad    gone    to     the       game       then      t his        tragedy would               not      h a ve    occurred.

I cannot        put     a    figure       on h o w m a n y           attended            without         tickets          but      it was

a    l arge    number,        it m u s t        have       been      for         such a       crowd      to    form       outside

th e   ground.          The    crush         outside          was       such       t ha t     persons         who were           entering

were     injured        and    in g e n u i n e        fear        of       their       lives.          X feel         that      if the

pressure        had     not    been       released            then          someone         would       have     been       seriously

injured        or     indeed       k i 1 1 ed    outside           the       ground.           Unfortunately                th e      effect

of     opening        Gate    C allowed             persons          to      enter       at    a fast         rate,       as     opposed

to a     steady        flow    through           the       turnstiles.                  The     crowd     flooded           across

the     enclosure           towards       the       tunnel         in th e         centre        of     the     s t a n d .—     it     is

traditional            that    the      crowd         is at        its m o s t          dense      in the        area       behind

the    goal.          I can    recall,           when        first          making       my way         towards          the     track

that    when        I passed        the      entrance           to      th e      ’S ’ pen       it     looked         full      and

people        were     craning        their         necks       to      see       when      X got       onto     the      track         that

pen,    although            crowded,         wa s     not     full          to    capacity.             The     "CS*      pen      on the

contrary        was     jammed        full.           It     is q u i t e         possible         that       the      surge       of

people        into     the t e r r a c e        via    the     tunnel             put    pressure         on     the      people

already        inside,        who     were       forced         to      sway       forward         putting          pressure            on

the    barrier         and    the     persons          at     the       front.           Perhaps         if    the       terracing

had    not     been     divided         into        p en s    then          the    crowd        could     have         spread         out

more     laterally,           filling spaces                  in     pens         ’S*    and     ''N* w h i c h a l t h o u g h

crowded were            not    full.            Unfortunately                    the    pen    fencing          prevents

lateral        movement.

I also         feel       that     drink          had a       large          p art       to    play.           It      is     traditional

to    "have a          couple          of    drinks"          before          a game           but       s om e     persons          attended

at    the      game,        obviously             the w o r s e         for    drink,           making            it a d a y         out a n d

an    excuse         fo r    a    "boose          up".        These          persons           seemed          intent          on    getting

in,     whatever            the    cost.           They were             not       prepared              to w a i t         and     seemed       to

have      no     regard          for    the       safety          of    their        fellow            supporters.                  Drinks

affect         people        in d i f f e r e n t           ways       but    people           tend       to      become          more

aggressive,               particularly                 when       in    large        groups            or g a n g s ,         more     excited

and agitated and                   less       tolerant             and       more        prepared            to     exercise           their

animal         instincts           to       get    what       they       want        ~    in t h i s         case        entry       to    the.

match       regardless             of       the    safety          of    themselves                 or    others.

As    for      the     police          side,       I feel          that       we     were        confronted                 by a     situation

which       got      out     of    hand and             we    found          ourselves              unable          to      cope     with      the

change         in    conditions              although             perhaps          no     contingency                  plans        could      h av e

allowed          for      what     happened.                 It w o u l d       seem          t ha t     more       people          attended

by    private          transport,             coach          or    by m i n i        bus       so      that       they would              have

more      freedom           than       they       would       if       they    had        travelled               by     train when            they

would       ha ve      been       escorted             to    the       ground        by.police               officers.

From      the       grounds        point          of    view       it    is a s s u m e d           t ha t     all       arrangements

for     the m a t c h        met       with       the a p p r o v a l         of     the       local         authority.                F r o m my

own     experience               I know       t h at        the    club       is     conscious               of     the       needs       of

safety         and     public          order       and would             presume              that       the      ground          complies

with     safety           regulations              -- o t h e r w i s e       it w o u l d          not      have        been       c h o s e n as

a    ven u e .       It     certainly             seemed          to    cope       with        the       corresponding                 match

last     year.

Having         reflected           on       the    whole          incident           there          is not          one       sole     factor

which       can be          blamed.'          Perhaps             it    happened              as a       result          of    several

ingredients               for     disaster             all    coming          together              at    once.             One     thing      that

I do k n o w         is     that       the    seeds          for       the    tragedy wre                 sown         outside         the

turnstiles             at    the       Leppings             Lane       end.        The        deaths         occurred             inside       the

                the H Q      or 3 0 m i n u t e s   p rior    to       kick   off.    If   t hat       conclusion    lays t h e

                blame     at    the   feet    of-' d o m e   of    the    supporters       who     attended     on t hat       day,

               in charge of Sub Sec tor                        9 — Seria ls 20 and SI                      for the Cu p S e m i - F i n a l

              GREENWOOD.                 My serials were a reserve and as such we had no fixed

               duti e s .

              On     14 April            1989     (140489)         I a t t e n d e d a briefing at H i l l s b o r o u g h S t a d ium

              S e r g e a n t s wi th key             r es po ns ib il iti es          also attended.                 T he briefing was

               co m m e n c e d      by C/S up t D U C K E N F I E L D w ho broad ly                 speaking e x p l a i n e d the

              format        of the           briefing and the overall                      a i ms / i n t e n t i o n s   of   the briefing.
                                                                                                     PAGE       2
                                                                                                     S16

In the course             of this he made         reference      to the    conduct and deportment

of    police off icers and the firm but fair ap p r o a c h that                        should be

adopted.         He also       dealt wit h the need to monito r               the    crowd from a

public       disorder and o ve rcr owd ing              point   of view a lt ho ug h       I can not      now

recall       his spe cif ic words or            instructions.

This was all          within        the   same area as       preventing     suppo rt ers      climbing

fences,       pylons        standing      on barriers and the emer ge nc y ev ac ua ti on

procedures.           Gro un d      regulations were also            brought to the notice of

officers,        or at       least    their existence.

The    que sti on of mon it or in g           of the      number of supporters,            while     I can not

remember         now what was         said,    was a matter w h i c h was        not dealt with           in

great     detail      by C/Supt DUCKENFIELD,                because most      of the officers            that

were    there were           e x pe ri en ce d men who      had previ ou sl y per fo rm ed duties at

Hi lls bor oug h.           Th ey were well aware           of the    common problems         pertinent         to

the ground and              indeed of the ex istence            of close    circuit        TV and the

func tio ns       pe rf orm ed      by the Police Box wi t h officers               using    binoculars.

W it hou t    hindsight,         to brief      to cover      every e v e n t ua li ty   concerning        the

way    in wh ic h     the     crowd was       to be m o n i t o r e d may have      been    regarded as an

insult       to the av era ge Police Off ice rs                 common sense and        I am sure C/Supt

D U C K E N F I E L D w o u ld of had that on his mind at the time.                        I have att en de d

many    bri efings          for football       match es     in the    past and the one         by C/Supt

D U C K E N F I E L D was    one of the best            I have attended.       It was a well

structured,         well      o r g a n i s e d event   striki ng    in my opini on e x act ly the

right     balance.

Af ter we had been a d d r es se d by C/Supt DU CK ENFIELD,                      S upt M U R R A Y

co nt inu ed      in more      details wi th the a d dre ss and            I think      it was       in r e g a rd

m a i n l y to    com mun ic at io ns and        logistics.         Whe n he had fin ish ed we were

g ive n some       input      conce rning      intel lig enc e and      I believe       this was       by D /

Sgt C H A R L E S W Q R T H a n d    co nsisted of a number           of h*nri-nut.«^ anrh ^ -h ricf

respective        commanders and            in my case         it was Supt G R E E N W O O D .

W e all    gathere d on the            perimeter        track      in front of the Spi on Kop.                      From

there we mo ved            round the ground as a group and we were all                              in

po ss es si on of the          publi she d      *F* Di v i s i o n Pol ic e Order.               As we went

round we each di sc us se d the general                       problems       that we had e n c o u n t e r e d at

that    particular          part of the ground              pr evi ous ly and the way              in wh ich         it

w o u l d be   dealt with.            At some stage,           I   think      it was when we were on the

S p i o n Kop the que st io n of the mo vement of Li verpool                           s up po rt er s who           had

ga in ed access           to that     end of the ground,             from the Kop to the Leppings

Lane    end    of    the grou nd was mentioned.                    I can      not be certain,            but    I

think     it   was Supt G R E E N W O O D       that    brought      the      matter up and         it was          in

c onn ect ion with what was                laid down        in the order         concerning         the movement

of s u p p o r t e r s.     He wa nt e d    to further         q u ali fy    that    in st ru cti on and add

m e t h o d of ap p r o a c h sh ou l d     its    i m p l e m e nt at io n become      necessary.

In effect        he wan te d       it made      clear      that Live rpo ol         support ers wo ul d be

held    in the d es ig na te d area ad jo ini ng                  the K op     in the No rt h East             corner.

Th ey wo uld        be    retained      in this     loc ation during            the m a t c h and no

m ov em en t   from this area wo ul d take                  place withou t          his express

permission.              This was     to   prevent      the    independent ac ti o n             by officers as

has    hap pen ed        in the    past,    moving      su ppo rte rs       of their own vo lit io n from

off the Kop and             into    the Lep pin gs Lane area thereby                    creating

ov erc ro wd in g        in that area.          It was      d e f i n i t e l y a matter w h i c h was

related to ov er cr ow di ng and th erefore                       crowd safety,        as distinct             to

public     disorder and            it was      related by Supt G R E E N W O O D            to   previous

matches,       where       ov er cr ow di ng    had taken         place,     a lt ho ug h    I can not

specifically             recall    him me nt i o n i n g    the    1981     (000081)        Cup Semi Final

where     some    crushing         took    place.

We were all aware              that    there      is very      little safety m a r g i n           in the

authorised        cap aci ty for the Le pp in gs              Lane    terraces        from our       previous

experience,          co ns eq ue nt ly at an all            ticket    game,      where all         the tickets

                                                                                                          S16

for    that area had been sold,                     it was    not   practical       to consider

introducing a number of su pporters who had earlier gain ed entran ce to

other      parts of the ground.                   Consequently        I co ncurred wi t h the

ins truct ions and when                   I later    briefed my own serials,               I reflected this

in my briefing.                This was         on 15 April     1989      <150489).

The following            day,      15 April       1989   <150489)        there was a mass          briefing at

10 am      <1000)      by C/Supt D U C K E N F I E L D with some            input    from Supt MURRAY,

Insp S E W E L L and D/Sgt C H A R L E S W O R T H .           B r oa d l y speaking C/Supt

D U C K E N F I E L D ad d r e s s e d    the main points       that      he had dealt with          in detail

wit h us the          pre vious          day,   including     the   need for mo ni to ri ng         for    public

disorder and            crowd safety,            a lt ho ug h again      I can riot go      into    details.

The    contents         of these          briefings      plus my own experience             of policing at

the H i l l s b o r o u g h S t a d i u m over a number of years,                  formed the basis for

my briefing           to my officers.

Fo l l o w i n g    this mass        briefing C/Supt          DUCKENFIELD         circul at ed amongst

of fic ers         engage d on the operation,                P C "s to    Inspector    particularly,

di scu ss in g       their     particular         role and asc ert ai ni ng         that they were aware

of their           individual        res pon si bi li ti es as well         as    confirming       that    their

we lfa re      needs were          being met.         In fact       in my opinio n he took a very

high profile            stance and made junior                ranks feel         confident    to discuss any

problems,          voice any         personal       opi nio ns and       should the need arise,             to

act    ind ep en de nt ly and wit h              commonsense without             feeling    in any way

in hibited by senior management.

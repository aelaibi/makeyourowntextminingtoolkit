Lead Department for Accidents in Sports Grounds


1.   As Secretary of the Civil Contingencies Unit I am
responsible for the lead department arrangements, under which the
central Government response to an emergency is managed.
Currently the Home Office have lead department responsibility for
accidents in sports grounds in England and Wales.           (Lead
department arrangements are described in Chapter 6 of the
recently published (by HMSO) booklet entitled 'Dealing with
Disasters'.)
2.   I understand that the Home Office have now transferred much
of their former responsibility for sports ground safety to your
department. It has been suggested that I should see whether it
would be appropriate to change lead department responsibility in
this field too. I would be grateful if I could, as a first step,
discuss the subject with you or someone in your division. If you
agree would you ask your Secretary to contact mine (Sue Chapman
270 0096) to arrange a convenient date/time.

Emergencies Secretariat).

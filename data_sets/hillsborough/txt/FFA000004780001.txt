FA/HILLSBOROUGH



 Attending Julian Gibson-Watt and John Dyson on their
 telephoning when they gave me their suggested amendments to
 the Clark andf         [statements. They also mentioned to
me some points I could raise with^             One in
particular related to the misgivings which the FA had
concerning semi-final ties. There were quite a number of
references in minutes of meetings to the trouble that had
occurred by trying to find a neutral ground, There were
suggestions that they should therefore scrub the idea of a
neutral ground and let the semi-finals be either played at
Wembley or with one team having a home advantage. It might
useful to put in a paragraph about that.           -.Iso said
that it might be useful to put in something about the
petition concerning Wembley, This is because at the meeting
that took olacs between         and the FA earlier in the
week,       [made it clear that he was keen to find common
ground. Reference to the petition might be seen as a good
PR move.

  then went to the FA to go through with;Clark and
"heir statements.                  Herbert Smith was at the
meeting. There was quite a lot of new information which was
then to be incorporated into amended drafts. _____
mentioned to me that he was going to be away until 23 May,
He will than be in the country from 24 to 31 May and from
13 June onwards. It was agreed that I would re-amend the
statements and send them to them so that they could .look at
them tomorrow.

Time spent re-amending the statements and arranging for them
to be faxed to Council
Total time engaged: 9\ hours; of that about 1 hour was
travelling.

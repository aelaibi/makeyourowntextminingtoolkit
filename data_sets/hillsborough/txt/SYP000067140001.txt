think        they        had a         chance.              Last      year       there       were       6 on       horses           and more

police         about         at       the       entrance.             I saw       no    steward^-at                the     entrances.                 In

able     to       hand my             ticket          in to a n y o n e          as    nobody          was    o n the          other       side       of

the     gate        or      turnstiles.                 The       ticket         I now       produce          (Ref,

                  was     about        3.05pm           (1505)          and       the    tearn^ w e r e             still       playing.              I heard

                  bring        him     round.            I remember                one     fellow            in his        late       2 0 ' s,    he       had       his

I went        with          her     in a n a m b u l a n c e           to    the/Royal           Hospital             in S h e f f i e l d .      I

very     busy.              I remember            carW i na r k             halfe     caste          kid       in w h o     had an

injured           leg.         There        w e r e n ’t e n o u g h         chairs        available.

I helped                          i ns i d e ,    we w e r e       shown where              to       sit       and    hospital         staff

were     taking             all     th e    details         of     those       t her e .         A    doctor          carne out        and

informed           us       of w h a t      order        people         would        be    treated.

            was        still        worried about                her        husband,                           I arranged          with

              o                     ring        her    Mother.              I ran g       my wife          and        Mother.          I told

her    where           we    were      and       the     state         of                   injuries.

Next,       I went           back      to                 and Brian ANDERSON                         turned          up.     I sat       with

him and           tried        to    console           him.        A    clergyman           came       over          and    started

talking           to    us.         Brian        told     him      that       hi s    father          had       been       killed      but     the

man,    a     bishop,             w o u l d n ’t s e t t l e       for       that     and made             a    nuisance        of     himself

by s a y i n g         he'd       find      out       if he w a s           dead     or    not,       he       then went        off.

I spent           the       rest     of     the       t i m e at       the    hospital           ringing             people     up w h o s e

relatives              were       here      being       treated.              Later        on                  turned       up a n d     with

            we     left        the     hospital.              The       time       was     between 7pm                (1900)       and    8pm

(2000).            We w a l k e d          towards        th e     station,                          and               were     going        to

catch a train                 home.

En     route                      *>ent to        telephone             h ome.        I can          remember          being       in a      tiny

gar den area.                 Two      girls          came a n d a s k e d           me    if    I was          alright.           I think

t h a t ’s w h e n          it hit         me    and     I broke            down.

Shortly after                 I met         the       blokes       I ’d c o m e       down with.                 They       were     alright.

brandy after                 brandy.             Eventually             I got        back       to L i v e r p o o l        and went         home.

I wasn't           injured           in th e          incident.              It wa s       several             days    later       that      my

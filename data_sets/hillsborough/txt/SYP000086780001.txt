there        was      a    detectable                note    of     concern              in    the       voice       and    during             several

this      time,         the      sounds          of    the       game      inside          the     ground            could          be       clearly

not     consult          my      watch       at       this       sj/aqe . I s a w            an    ambulance                  a r r i v e and        it

turning        to       see      why    the       ambulance             had       been       summoned.,              I saw          a    large

number       of       s u p p o r t e r s y in        the    area       to      the     rear       of        the     turnstiles                   givin

access       to       the     Lepeangs            Ln    t e r r a c e s , some             of     whom        were        very          clearly

distressed             although             not       apparently             injured.             Certain            comments                were    rna

with      reference              to    our       being       needed          inside          the      ground.             I    indicated             to

my    crew     that         we    should          enter          the    Leppings             Ln    terraces,                which            we    did.

On    entry,          1 saw       towards             the    rear       of      the     terraces,               a    number             of

suppo rters            staggering                towards          the      tunnel,           some        of     whom          had       apparent!

suffered          main        injuries            to    limbs          and      one     who       had        blood        on     his         face.       1

assisted          a    number          of    these          into       the      area       between            the        tunnel          giving

access       to       the     terraces            and       the    turnstiles.                  I then          returned                to    the

terraces          where          I saw       a    large          number         of     supporters               milling             around          and

towards        the       f r o n t,     several             prostrate             supporters,                 some        of     whom         were

moving       and       some       who       were       still.          I. c o u l d     also       see        several           Police

Officers          amongst             those       present,             some       of    whom       were         applying

terraces.             Other       Officers             were       carrying             persons           from        the       terraces             and

passing        them         to    other          Officers          on      the       perimeter               track.           I also          saw

which      borders            the      Leppings             Ln    terraces,,            He      had      a    hand        megaphone                and

persons       working          on       the       terraces           to       pass       the        injured          persons             to       other

Officers       instead             of    trying          to     accompany                 them       through             the       gate.

There    were       also       a    number          of       L i v e r ppoI            s u ppor t ers          as s i s t i ng       in       the

removal       of    bodies          and       injured           persons                a nd    several           hoardings               were       torn

from    the    wails          of    the       W    Stand           to be       used       as     stretchers.

I made    my       way    to       the       front       of        the       terraces           and           saw    a   male person                lyin

across    the       terrace             on    top       of    another              mala        person.          The          latter       was

moving    slightly             whilst             the    person              lying       on     top       of    him          was    completely

inert.    I a s s i sted            two       Liverpool              supporters                 to       move       the       uppermost

person    and       then       carry          the       lower        man       to       the     perimeter                gate       where          he    wa

passed    to       other       Officers.                I then           assisted              in    passing             a    further             three

bodies    onto       the       perimeter                track        but       I       cannot        say       whether             any    of       these

persons       were       alive          or    dead.

Whilst    carrying             out       these          dutiers              I became           aware          of    other          L.ive rp oo 1

felt    constrained                to    tell       the       Officers                 closest           to    me    to       arrest          their

working       alongside             the       Liverpool              fans          I noticed              that       there          was       a    very

strong    smell          of    intoxicants                   and     a       large       number           of    them          were       being

abusive       to    Police          Officers.

Whilst    I was          in    the       Leppings             Ln     t e r r a c e,           a Scenes          of       Crime       Officer,

and    jeered       at    by       the       Liverpool             supporters. Police                           Officers

intervened          and       brought             the    photographer                    to     the       perimeter                track.          Almos

immediately          I saw          a    man       wearing               a    * T ’ shirt            bearing             the       Liverpool             FC

0f    the w    St a n d H e             was       immediately                 attacked              by    other          supporters                and       I

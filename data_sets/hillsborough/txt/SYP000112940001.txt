MICHAEL JOHN TORR MILL SAY:




I     am     a Superintendent         in    the     South    Yorkshire      Police        currently
responsible for Training               Department.            In the     event       of    a major
incident       this      Department        is responsible for the organisation of
a Casualty Enquiry Bureau which is situated in the Communications
School on the Top Floor of the Ecclesfield Training Centre Building
in     one    of   the     classrooms.            The    relevant   pages     concerning        the
arrangement regarding this Bureau, which are copied from the Force
Major Incident Manual, are shown at APPENDIX 'A1.


The whole of the South Yorkshire Police Major Incident Manual                                       is
reproduced on the Command and Control Computer, accessible to all
officers at Sub-Divisional                  level and Sections 23 and 24, attached
at APPENDIX           'A', are also accessible on Computer File Reference:
XR358 to XR374, a sample of the computer printout for one of these
paragraphs is attached at APPENDIX 'B'.


The classroom designated as the Bureau is equipped with 8 telephone
lines, in addition to the normal 3 outside lines provided to the
building and also 2 direct links with Force Headquarters.                                   All the
walls in the room have been fitted with 'dry w i p e 1 boards to list
details of the dead and injured received by the Bureau.                          The function
of the Bureau is for 4 of the telephone lines to be dedicated to
the        incident site,     hospitals and mortuary from where information
is     acquired       regarding   dead        and       injured   persons.       A        further    4
telephones are initially designated to receive calls from members
of the public enquiring the whereabouts of friends and relatives.
There   is    an   arrangement    whereby   these   latter   4   lines   can   be
increased, as required, by British Telecom.             The details of dead
and injured are, wherever possible, matched with public enquiries
and appropriate      steps taken to undertake the necessary warnings.
Casualty Cards at APPENDIX 'C' are completed by the telephonists.


Members of Divisional Community Liaison Departments are responsible
for manning the hospitals who will receive patients, and pass the
relevant information to the Bureau.            They take with them to the
hospital     a Hospital Liaison Box containing Casualty Record Forms,
stationery and protective clothing to administer the scheme from
that location.


A callout system is in operation for bureau staffing and details
of available personnel are maintained at Operations Room.                 A copy
of the relevant document is attached at APPENDIX 1D 1.


On Saturday 15 April 1989, at 3.23 pm, I was contacted at home to
the effect that an incident had occurred at Hillsborough Football
Ground which required the activation of the Casualty Bureau.                    I
attended     at Ecclesfield      and together with other officers set up
the Bureau and at 4.23 pm, Force Operations Room were advised that
the Bureau was operating and the appropriate telephone number should
be released to the public via the media.

      At 4.15 pm, arrangements were made for additional telephone lines
      to be provided by British Telecom as indicated in the contingency.
      As a result of this, 4 additional                   lines and 2 Fax Machines were
      installed in the building at approximately 7.00 pm.                   The Fax Machines
      were   linked     to        the   Hallamshire     and    Northern   General    Hospitals.
      At this time there were 15 exchange lines and 2 fax lines to the
      Casualty       Bureau        in   addition   to    the     direct   lines     with   Force
      Headquarters.           Three terminals of the Command and Control Message
      Switch System were linked into the Communications School and these
      were used to send internal messages and requests to other Forces.


      At the commencement of the Bureau at 4.23 pm, Hospital Liaison Staff
      were already in position at hospitals obtaining details of casualties
      in conjunction with the Hospital Admissions Staff.                          At this time
      the Bureau itself consisted of approximately 14 staff and this built
      up over a short period to a figure in excess of 32.


      West Yorkshire Police offered this Force the use of their 'Crisis'
      Portable Casualty Enquiry Computer System.                   Their offer was accepted
      and they attended at approximately 9.40 pm, together with 9 staff
      and 4 additional             South Yorkshire operators           assisted them.       They
      commenced a back record conversion of all of the enquiries received
      by South Yorkshire's Casualty Bureau,                     with   a view to eventually
      placing calls from the public directly onto the VDU screens, when
      their computer records matched those held manually.                         In the event,
the back record conversion was completed Sunday evening at a time
when the telephone calls had receeded considerably and there was
no cause to change from the manual system to use the computer.


The Bureau received details of 95 persons who died and 140 persons
admitted     to    the   Hallamshire   and   Northern    General    Hospitals.
Additionally, it is estimated they received in excess of 1,000 calls
from members of the public, 700 of which were from persons who did
not have injured friends or relatives.         The details of these latter
enquiries were eventually passed to the police forces where the
enquirers resided, for them to confirm the safety of the persons
enquired about.


The telephone operators and Bureau staff worked under considerable
stress     over   the first    24 hours   talking   to   anxious   friends   and
relatives, and I cannot praise their conscientiousness and response

to these calls enough.


Although the number of calls to the Bureau had almost ceased by
early Monday morning,         17 April 1989, it remained open until 4.00

pm that day.

                                       CASUALTY ENQUIRY BUREAU

      GENERAL

      If a Major Incident occurs within the South Yorkshire Police area, or if an incident occurs within        XR358
      another police area and numbers of casualties are received at hospitals within the South
      Yorkshire Police area, it will be the responsibility of the police to trace the relatives or friends of
      persons injured or killed and inform them of their condition and whereabouts. Allied to this
      responsibility is the general police duty to investigate or assist in the investigation of circum­
      stances giving rise to death or injury.

      In order that these duties may be efficiently carried out, the police will set up a Casualty Enquiry
      Bureau to which all enquiries and information relating to persons involved in the incident will be
      directed, in order that collation of this information may be undertaken and, where required,
      passed to relatives etc.

^     The establishment of the Bureau will also mean that many telephone calls will be channelled to
      it which would otherwise be made to Operations Room, hospitals, etc.

      ESTABLISHMENT

      It will be the responsibility of the Duty Officer in charge of the Force Operations Room to XR359
      decide when the Bureau should be activated and each incident must be assessed individually. Con­
      sideration should be given to the potential numbers of casualties, and/or enquiries regarding
      casualties, and it should be borne in mind that a long delay in implementation will cause
      unnecessary pressure upon Operations Room personnel.

      It w ill be the responsibility of the Training Department to make the following arrangements:—

           (a)     Prepare the Bureau for use;
           (b)     Call out the necessary personnel;
           (c)     Inform the Hospital Administrator(s) orother responsible personthat police
                    officers are attending the hospital(s)to actin their capacity asHospital Liaison
                    Officers;
           (d)      Circulate by message switch, a message to all stations setting out the arrange­
                    ments for the Casualty Enquiry Bureau and telephone number to be used by

                    i.   the public, and
                   ii.   the police.

      CONSTITUTION AND FUNCTION OF THE BUREAU

      The Casualty Enquiry Bureau is located within the Force Training Department Communications XR360
      School, Ecclesfield. The staff consists of one inspector (officer in charge), two sergeants (next of
      kin clerks) and ten other personnel who may be police constables or special constables
      (operators). The staffing level o f the Bureau may be modified dependent on circumstances.

      The officer in charge of the Bureau w ill be responsible for the efficient operation of the Bureau
      and its staff. He w ill ensure that all enquiries are correctly dealt with and all necessary records          \
      and documents are completed and maintained.

                                                                                            Page 2


He will also be responsible for the calling out of any relief personnel, bearing in mind the period   XR360
of duty that Bureau personnel may have completed prior to the activation of the Bureau, and the
length of time they may reasonably be expected to operate efficiently. His responsibilities will
also include the liaison between Community Liaison and Crime Prevention staff at the hospitals,
mortuaries and incident site and the Casualty Enquiry Bureau.

He will also be responsible for informing the appropriate administrator(s) that police officers are   xr   361
en route to act in their capacity as Hospital Liaison Officers.

Telephones on both the national and internal lines are provided in the Bureau. The national
number to be used by the public w ill be released by the officer in charge of the Operations Room
to pre-arranged locations, including the media, when he is advised by the officer in charge of the
Bureau that he is ready to receive calls.

External unpublished national exchange lines are also provided into the Bureau for the exclusive
use of hospital, mortuary and incident site liaison staff. These numbers are held within the docu­
mentation which w ill be made available to officers responsible for hospital and mortuary records.
It is imperative that these latter numbers are not made public.

PROCEDURES FOR PASSING INFORMATION TO THE BUREAU

Information regarding persons injured or killed in the incident w ill be passed to the Bureau from    XR 362
three main sources:—

     1      the incident site;
     2      the hospitals;
     3      the Mortuary.

1    The Incident Site

     A casualty record form should be completed in duplicate for all persons treated at the
     scene and allowed to leave without attending the hospital as a patient.

     The Site Commander w ill designate officers to undertake this task at a convenient
     assembly point. The casualty record forms are contained in the Major Incident boxes
     with further supplies available in the Casualty Enquiry Bureau. The information on
     these completed forms should be passed by telephone to the Bureau. The national
     number of the Bureau for police use only is contained within the Major Incident boxes,
     but in the event of difficulty it can be obtained from Operations Room.

2   The Hospitals and Mortuaries                                                                      xr   363
and
3    Inspectors in charge of community liaison departments at divisions and their deputies
    w ill call out staff in accordance with pre-arranged procedures to man the receiving
    hospitals and mortuaries when they are advised by the Casualty Enquiry Bureau that
    the Bureau is being activated and this action is required.

    The full duties of these personnel are set out in Sections 22 and 24, but briefly they

           PROCEDURE FOR RECEIVING ENQUIRIES FROM THE PUBLIC

           Members of the public who telephone the Casualty Enquiry Bureau using the publicised numbers          XR3B4
           w ill be asked to supply information to enable a casualty enquiry form to be completed. This
           information is matched up with the information relating to the casualties provided by officers at
           the various receiving points.
                                                                             4-
           Members of the public who make a personal visit to Force Headquarters or any other police
           station to enquire about a possible casualty should be given the facility to telephone the Bureau.

           If the Bureau is unable to immediately give them the information they require such persons
           should be advised not to wait at police stations, but to return home where they will be told of
           any information which comes to police knowledge.

           It can be anticipated that telephone calls will be received at police stations and Force Operations   XR 365
           Room and such calls should be channelled to the Casualty Enquiry Bureau either by divisional
^          or Operations Room staff, giving the Casualty Enquiry Bureau public emergency telephone num­
           ber to callers. In the event of such callers being unable or unwilling to make an additional call,
           officers should take details and notify the Bureau via message switch.

           It is for the officer in charge of the Casualty Enquiry Bureau to decide whether or not a person
           making an enquiry should be given details of a casualty. Where it has been decided to give details,
           but it appears inappropriate to give them over the telephone, the person enquiring will be asked
           to return to a fixed address, when arrangements w ill be made for the information to be passed by
           telephone or message switch to the police station near to that address in order that personal con­
           tact can be established.

           No details w ill be given out from the Bureau other than by telephone or message switch on the        XR 366
           Command and Control computer, to prevent members of the public congregating at Force
           Headquarters or the Casualty Enquiry Bureau, seeking information.

          Details of persons dead or injured w ill not be issued directly to the media by any member of the
          Bureau. All items for publication will be issued through the Force Press Officer.

          A detailed plan of what initial action is required by the Inspector, Operations Room, to
          commence the Bureau is held by Operations Room. Within this plan is a list of personnel who
          may be called upon to assist him set up the Bureau, and further lists of persons trained to operate
          the system.

          The Superintendent, Training Department, will be responsible for maintaining the lists in              XR367
          Training Department and Operations Room of those personnel who may be called upon to set up
          and arrange the Bureau. He will also be responsible for arranging for the training of personnel in
          the operation of the Bureau system and maintenance of the lists of persons so trained.

           It is anticipated that prior to the Bureau being activated many calls w ill be received at Force
          Operations Room from persons seeking information regarding friends and relatives. Where it is
          known the Bureau w ill eventually be activated, callers should be requested to monitor local/
          national radio and/or BBC and IBA Television, where the appropriate Bureau telephone number
        . w ill be broadcast when the Bureau commences operation. This will assist to clear the 999 tele­
          phone lines and the British Telecom exchange lines into the Headquarters switchboard enabling
          Operations Room to attend to the requirements of the incident. It is emphasised that the
          decision to activate the Casualty Enquiry Bureau must have been taken before persons enquiring
          are given the above instruction.
                                                                                                Page 4


    Prior to the decision to activate the Bureau being taken, enquiries w ill be recorded by Operations   XR368
    Room in accordance with normal procedures, obtaining sufficient details for an enquirer to be
    contacted later if necessary, and arrangements should be made for all this documentation to be
    passed to the officer in charge of the Bureau if it becomes operational.

                                   HOSPITAL LIAISON OFFICERS

  In the event of a Major Incident occurring which justifies the establishment of a Casualty Enquiry       X R 370
  Bureau, arrangements have been made with hospitals in the County that police officers, from
  Divisional Community Liaison and Crime Prevention Departmentss, will go to the Casualty
  Department of the hospital and there report to the person in Charge of casualty documentation.
                                                                    *
  Officers attending w ill take with them the Hospital Liaison box which is kept at their respec­
  tive offices. This box contains casualty record forms and stationery and protective clothing
  required to administer the scheme.

 The box also contains a copy of this Section of the manual and the telephone number of the
 Casualty Enquiry Bureau. Force Operations Room will supply this number in case of any
 difficulty. Although there may be a delay in the call being answered whilst the bureau is being set
 up, the officers need take no further action to establish communications, other than to ring this
 number from time to time. A t some hospitals there may not be a telephone available for police
 use and in these circumstances officers will have to use telephones at adjacent premises.

 A casualty record form will be completed in duplicate for every casualty involved in the incident,        X R 371
 whether the casualty is discharged, detained, moved to another hospital, found to be dead and
 moved to another mortuary etc. The information required to complete the form is largely self
 evident but every effort should be made to obtain as much accurate detail as possible.

 This information will be supplied by the hospital staff although it may be possible for an officer
 to obtain information for himself. The work of the police officers is of a secondary importance
 to that of the hospital and officers must use their discretion so that they obtain information
 without causing disruption to the working of the hospital.

 Particular attention should be paid to the dead and to unconscious persons so that all details
 which may assist in the identification are obtained and preserved. This includes trying to ensure
 that hospital staff do not destroy clothing, property, etc., no matter how insignificant it may
 appear.                                                                                         7

It is also important that details of the whereabouts of the casualty at the time the incident          XR372
occurred be obtained, if possible - ie whether he was the occupant of any vehicle involved, etc.

 Inspectors in charge of divisional community liaison departments are responsible for maintaining
liaison with their respective receiving hospitals, and the maintenance of the boxcontaining the
required documents. They are also responsible for the training of their staff in their respective
roles at receiving hospitals. They may call upon the Force Training Department to assist in this
matter.

The prime task of the hospital liaison officer at the hospital is to obtain and transmit information
from the hospital to the Casualty Enquiry Bureau so that relatives and friends may be enabled to
identify and trace injured persons as soon as possible. The second, but equally important, task is
h l. T 1 3         ° I c° mmunications between the hopsital and Force Operations Room, and
hence to the scene of the incident.

Thwe are vital links in the organisation and under no circumstances will the officers be diverted      XR 373

The hospital liaison officers will retain the casualty record forms for reference purposes after the   XR 373
information has been transmitted to the Casualty Enquiry Bureau. The officers should endeavour
to obtain updated information — eg transfers, deaths, discharges — and it may be that further
information concerning casualties w ill come to hand from other casualties, relatives, etc. This
additional information should be transmitted to the Casualty Enquiry Bureau.

 I am the Superintendent in charge of the South Yorkshire Police Training

 Department.



 In the event of a major incident this Department is responsible for the

 organisation of a Casualty Enquiry Bureau, which is situated in the

 Communications School on the Top Floor of the Ecclesfield Training Centre

 Building in one of the classrooms.




 On Saturday 15 April 1989 I was on weekly leave at my home address of

                                             Sheffield                 when I received a telephone call ,*at

 3.23 pm from Force Control to the effect that an incident had occurred

 at the Hillsborough Football Ground and that the person in charge at

 that location had requested the activation of the Casualty Bureau.

 I immediately attended at the Ecclesfield Training Centre and, together

 with other officers, set up the Bureau.




                                                                    Signature witnessed by..

                      STATEMENT OF WITNESS

Continuation of statement of      Michael John TORR                    2




At 4.23 pm, the same day, Force Operations Room were advised that the

Bureau was operating and the appropriate telephone number should be

released to the public via the media.




The Bureau continued to be manned until 4.00 pm on Monday 17 April 1989

and during that time information was received from hospitals

and mortuaries regarding the dead and injured and enquiries from

relatives satisfied whenever possible.             Enquiries were received

from many sources including the Hillsborough Boys Club, where

an assembly point for relatives and friends of persons believed to be

injured in the disaster were located.             This venue was relocated

in the early hours of the morning of 16 April 1989 to a Church Hall on

Forbes Road and again information was supplied to this location as and

when required.

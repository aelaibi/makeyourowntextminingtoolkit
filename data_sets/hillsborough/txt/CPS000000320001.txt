Dear Mr Manning

Bernard M urray
South Sefton M agistates’ C ourt, 17 July 1998

Thank you for your letter of 6 July 1998 with enclosures. Mr Enzor has asked me to reply
on his behalf as I have had detailed involvement with this matter.

Your letter addressed to the Director of Public Prosecutions has being forwarded to me so
that I can give a more detailed preliminary answer to your representations. I have been
asked to read all the papers and make recommendations concerning the available options open
to the Crown Prosecution Service and to your request that we take over this private
prosecution in order to discontinue it.

In order that I can be sure that I have all the relevant material before me, I would be grateful
if you could let me have a schedule of any documents in your possession that you consider
to be relevant to the prosecution.

The issues raised in your letter can then be fully considered and a detailed reply given to you
as soon as possible.

I regret that I am unable to provide an estimate for the conclusion of this review as there are
a number of factors which are not within my control, however, I can assure you that
consideration of all the representations made to us will be given a high priority.
The solicitors for Mr Duckenfield have informed me of the present position in that the
summonses to the above court are to be withdrawn, and that it is anticipated that informations
will be laid at a court that has jurisdiction to issue process.

Yours sincerely




George R.Croston
Prosecution Team Leader

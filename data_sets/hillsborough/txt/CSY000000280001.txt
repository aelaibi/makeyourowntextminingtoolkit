                              SOUTH YORKSHIRE COUNTY COUNCIL

       JOINT REPORT OF THE CHIEF EXECUTIVE,                    FIRE SERVICE COMMITTEE
       THE CHIEF FIRE OFFICER AND THE CHIEF                    8th SEPTEMBER, 1983
       CONSTABLE

                            SAFETY OF SPORTS GROUNDS ACT, 1975

1.     Background

1.1    The Committee will recall that the CountyCouncil's powers andduties under
        this Act are delegated to this Committee. On 8th.January, 1976, the
        Committee decided that any necessary detailed investigation should be
        undertaken by Officer Working Parties for each of the four Borough Council
        areas. These Officer Working Parties consist of representatives of the
        Fire Service, the Police,>the Building Inspectors of the Borough Council,
        co-ordination being undertaken by the Department of Administration.

1.2    Whilst it is Parliament's intention that all sports grounds which have
       accommodation for more than 10,000 spectators should be subject to the
       provisions of the Act eventually, the only grounds designated by the Secretary
       of State to date as requiring General Safety Certificates from the appropriate
       County Council have been certain "International" grounds and those of clubs
       in the First and Second Divisions of the Football League.

2.     Position in South Yorkshire

2.1 ^ The Hillsborough Stadium of the Sheffield Wednesday Football Club Ltd. was
  -v designated by the Secretary of State as requiring to apply to the County
     Council for a General Safety Certificate by 1st January, 1979. Following
     detailed investigations by the Officer Working Party for the Sheffield
     District, the Certificate was granted on 21st December, 1979, after approval
     by the Committee.

2.2,   The Officer Working Parties for the four Districts have also given informal
       advice on a continuing basis, on request, to the remainder of the football
       league Clubs in South Yorkshire.

2.3    Follioying their promotion to the Second Division of the Football League, tie
       Barnsley Football Club Ltd. and the Rotherham United FootballClub Ltd. were
       designated by the Secretary of State as requiring to apply to the County
       Council for a General Safety Certificate by 1st January, 1982 (asreported to
       the Committee on 3rd September, 1981).

2.4    The two Clubs did so, but have taken rather longer than they anticipated to
       carry out the works required to meet the provisions of the Act in view of
       certain development and re-development proposals which the Clubs had in mind.
       Naturally, the Clubs were reluctant to incur expenditure on their Grounds
       if these proposals were to be put into effect. It should be pointed out that
       the Act does not specify a time limit for consideration of an application
       for a General Safety Certificate once the application has been formally made.

3.     General Safety Certificates

3.1    On 30th November, 1978, the Committee approved a draft General Safety
       Certificate as the basis for the standard certificate to be used throughout
        the County.
The General Safety Certificate granted to the Sheffield Wednesday Football
Club Ltd. on 21st December, 1979, was based on the standard certificate with
additions to meet the particular conditions at the Hillsborough Stadium.   The
Committee decided on 14th January, 1980 not to make any charge for the
Certificate after referring the matter to Policy Advisory Sub-Committees â€™A'
and 'B '.

Experience gained since the granting of the Sheffield Wednesday General
Safety Certificate showed the desirability of incorporating two minor
amendments to the standard certificate and, on 3rd September, 1981, the
Committee agreed to the Standard Certificate being amended so as to
incorporate the two suggested minor amendments.

All of the required works at the Barnsley and Rotherham Grounds have been
carried out or will be completed shortly and drafts of the Certificates in
respect of the Oakwell Ground of the Barnsley Football Club Ltd. and the
Millmoor Ground of the Rotherham United Football Club Ltd. are attached for
the Committee's consideration. The$e are, of course, based on the standard
South Yorkshire General Safety Certificate previously approved by the
Committee.

The Committee is also requested to consider the question of whether a fee
should be charged for the Certificates in view of the earlier decision of
14th January, 1980, that no charge should be made to the Sheffield Wednesday
Football Club Ltd. for the General Safety Certificate in respect of the
Hillsborough Stadium.

Recommendation

(i)    That the General Safety Certificates now submitted in respect of the
       Oakwell Ground, Barnsley, and the Millmoor Ground, Rotherham, be
       approved, and that the Chairman and Vice-Chairman of the Committee
       be authorised to agree any amendments necessary should any of the
       requirements of the Certificates not be able to be complied with by the
       actual date of issue, such amendments not reducing the overall level of
       safety to be required at either ground.
(ii)   That the Committee make a decision as to whether a charge should be
       made to the Barnsley Football Club Ltd. and the Rotherham United
       Football Cltib Ltd. for their General Safety Certificates.

    Dear



      Enclosed with this letter is a photostat of my     ticket    for
last Saturday's semi-final at Hillsborough. You will notice that
it is for the Leppings Lane End terrace.    You will    also    notice
that   like  thousands of other tickets it is untorn.    I am one of
the luckier ones: I'm sitting here writing this instead of       being
dead: I didn't lose anybody: I didn't stand in the middle section
of the terraces. Having said that, maybe I'm not so lucky because
every   two  minutes  or  so my head gets filled with images that
nobody should have to live with in peacetime.
      I consider  the  photocopy  to   be  evidence   enough    of my
credentials   for writing this.  Hy other credentials are 22 years
of watching football; 19 years of watching Liverpool.     Saturday's
game was my ninth FA Cup semi-final and my third at Hillsborough.
Initially   I just didn't feel like talking about what happened at
all, but as the   buck-passing process seems to be accelerating my
anger and disgust has hit the level where I'm not going      to   keep
quiet about it.
      I went   to Hillsborough   on   Saturday with my father and a
friend.   The much publicised reason for the FA     and  the    police
choosing Hillsborough    to stage the match was that the Liverpool
fans would arrive from the west and the Nottingham      Forest    fans
would   arrive from the south and thus could easily be kept apart.
This was based on the assumption that every Liverpool     fan would
use   the A628   to travel to the ground.   In fact we,   along with
several thousand others decided to use the A57 , a less congested
route. This meant that we parked in the same area as all the N o t ­
tingham fans. When I walked about a mile to the ground at 2.0 0 pm




                                                                         2

                                                                                     3
  I would guess that there would have been roughly two Forest fans
 to every one Liverpool fan in the streets on the          south    side     of
 the ground.
      There    was no sign of any aggressive atmosphere,         no hint of
 violence,    simply good natured singing     and   banter.     Anyone    who
 knows anything about the game could tell you that there is no a n ­
 tipathy between the two clubs, and that the chance of trouble was
minimal.     Despite this there was a massive police presence in the
 streets;    clusters of officers on every corner,        threatening mil-
 tary looking vans,     none of them smiling or making any attempt to
be helpful as they watched and waited for trouble.
      When we arrived at the Leppings Lane        End   having    literally
been   sent    round   the houses   by police seperating us from the
Forest fans who we'd just walked the best part of a mile with, it
was imediately clear that there were difficulties.
      This was at approximately 2.25.      There was a mob swaying and
surging to try and get to the eight turnstiles.          There has been a
lot of talk about sixteen turnstiles       which     simply isn't      true:
there   were eight gates for the seats and eight for the terraces.
The chaos came as absolutely no surprise because it was              exactly
the   same last year when it took me 50 minutes to get through the
turnstiles and to my seat       in the stand    above     the   terracing.
Everybody was talking about this,       nobody could believe that the
police had done nothing to improve the        situation.      Despite    the
hundreds of very visible police all over Sheffield, the only ones
in evidence outside the turnstiles were three mounted policemen.
The situation had obviously been going on for some time, and many
fans who had purposely turned up early were         getting un d e r s ta n d ­
ably   livid.    We were quickly sucked into the centre of the crowd
     there was no doubt that it was     no   normal     crush.    X   simply
decided    to   get out.   Having been in many a similar situation it
was clear from the pitch of the screams and shouts from those              at
the front that the situation was deteriorating fast. I managed to
get   out   of   the main    crush to the side by some railings,         and
shouted for my friend to do the same.       We decided to      wait    there
whilst    the   situation   eased.  At  this point one of the mounted
policemen completely lost his cool and barged his way out to             the
back of the crowd.      I don't know if the fans in his way were able
to get their feet out of the way, but I doubt it. I don't know if
he did anything constructive when he got out of the crush, but I
 doubt it.    Everyone was   yelling  at him.     and   I accept        that
everyone    is human,   but his shouted response of " You can all go
crush youselves for all I care!" is something that he will              have
to learn to live with.
       At   this   point many fans began to climb the gates in order
to get out of the crush.     Almost all of them were showing tickets
to   police   waiting   on the other side.   The crush wasn't getting
markedly worse as kick off time approached, for the simple reason
that the area around the turnstiles was as crowded as conceivably
possible.    I find the stories of last minute     arrivals   of wild,
drunken   thugs so far fetched that they are quite c o n t e m p t i b l e .At
this point a small gate was opened in a side wall        and  before         I
knew anything I had been pushed through with about fifty or sixty
others after which they managed to close it.        Straight ahead was
a tunnel leading into the ground.     My friend    suggested    that        we
went   in   and   stood  behind  the  goals.   The    area   within the
perimeter of the ground was oddly     quiet   and   there was       hardly
anyone going in through the tunnel.
      I told him      that  I had once stood there before in a semi­
final against Arsenal years previously and remembered that it was
a bit packed and the view wasn't great.      And so it was that I was
one   of  the    ones who made their way to the edge.      Five minutes
later even our part of the ground had filled up very fast and the
incoming fans told of how a big gate had been       opened   or     kicked
down. And the rest is history.

I would like to make the following points v.ery clear.

1. There    WAS a very major problem outside the Leppings Lane End
last year any anyone who claims otherwise is simply not    telling
the truth.
2.  Everyone   who  saw the numbers of policemen who came onto the
pitch,  and for the most part stood aimlessly about as   the  d is ­
aster unfolded could simply not believe why so few had been all o ­
cated to steer 10,000 fans through 8 turnstiles which were fenced
in on three sides by an area little bigger than an infant school
playground.   ( Having said that,  everybody also  noted  the   few
policemen who unhesitatingly jumped into the middle of the crush
and showed extraordinary courage.)
3.   The stories that are now being brought out about massive n u m ­
bers of riotous,        drunken fans causing the crush are     gross e xa g ­
gerations, which seem to be desparate attemmt to shift the blame.
4. Standard policy at other similar occassions is always to break
down the crowd slowly,to mass the majority in a wide           open    space
like a street,       check their tickets and split them into a smaller
bunch,    then form them into queues which move quickly through the
turnstiles.      Above    all  the most important thing is to have the
policemen doing the job showing         patience,   smiling   and TELLING
people    what    is    happening.   Had there been one articulate voice
talking through one efficient         loudhailer   outside   the Leppings
Lane    End   on Saturday      there   may well have been 94 more people
alive today than there are.
        This in my opinion is where the root causes of the problems
that led to the horror of the weekend are to be found. I am 28, a
graduate and a company director,         and like most people in England
    I'm     generally treated with politeness and courtesy.         That is
until I go to a soccer match.         Once I an identified    as   football
fan      I am     immediately     considered   to  be little more than an
animal.     If I have a scarf out of my car window on        route   to   an
away match the police will stop me and search me.            When I get to
the game I get herded around by absurdly           aggressive    policemen,
pushed    and    shoved with never a word of apology until I,          along
with the rest of the animals,         are safely    locked   away   in   our
cage,    under    the    scrutiny of both video cameras and hundreds of
policemen. Of course there are troublemakers at football matches,
lots of them.       Anyone who claims otherwise is an      idiot.   But   to
 treat    two million football fans as if they were all a danger to
 society is absurd.       And now we are being branded as     outcasts    to
 the extent      w e 're going to be forced to carry an ID card when we
 go to see a game.       Even convicted murderers out on parole      aren't
 required to do this.
       If you distrust people to this extent, and insist on pushing
 them round     like cattle is it really any surprise that they don't
 behave like perfect Edwardian Gentlemen?         A standing joke amongst
 Liverpool fans when they are pushed         into  a particularly      tight
 space is for them to start mooing at the top of their voices.
       I am     convinced       that it was this ludicrous attitude that
 more than anything else led to the tragedy          of    Leppings    Lane.
 Whoever was running the show obviously felt that 98% of his
      resources needed to be deployed to stop fightincr in the streets.
    A   crush    at the turnstiles?  Their problem.   That was why nobody
    told us what was happening as if they assumed       that we  were  so
    thick that we wouldn't understand. That is why we are all haunted
    by   the    sight of policemen beating desperate fans off the fences
    when everyone but     them  knew  that  there   was   a very  serious
    probl e m .                                                        .

                           The cows are transferred from wagon t o p e n t o ^
    r i n g w i t h the minimum of harshness.   Were they treated or herded
    around in remotely the same way that we fans are shoved around by
    the police on a Saturday afternoon the RSPCA would have        a great
    deal     to    say  about it.  Which puts me in mind of the words of a
    young poet called Wilfred Owen who 60 years         ago  wrote   a poem
    called       " Anthem for doomed youth.*' Its first line suddenly after
    all these years seems horribly topical,

         "What passing bells for those who die like cattle."




                                     Yours sincerely,

    Dear



      Enclosed with this letter is a photostat of my            ticket     for
last Saturday's semi-final at Hillsborough.           You will notice that
it is for the Leppings Lane End terrace.        You     will   also    notice
that   like   thousands of other tickets it is untorn.          I am one of
the luckier ones: I'm sitting here writing this instead of              being
dead: I didn't lose anybody: I didn't stand in the middle section
of the terraces. Having said that, maybe I'm not so lucky because
every   two   minutes     or  so my head gets filled with images that
nobody should have to live with in p e a c e t i m e .
      I consider     the   photocopy  to   be evidence       enough    of   my
credentials    for writing this.     My other credentials are 22 years
of watching football; 19 years of watching Liverpool.            Saturday's
game was my ninth FA Cup semi-final and my third at Hillsborough.
Initially    I just didn't feel like talking about what happened at
all, but as the      buck-passing process seems to be accelerating my
anger and disgust has hit the level where I'm not going             to    keep
quiet about it.
      I went     to      Hillsborough   on Saturday with my father and a
friend.   The much      publicised reason for the FA       and the     police
choosing    Hillsborough     to stage the match was that the Liverpool
fans would arrive from the west and the Nottingham Forest                 fans
would   arrive from the south and thus could easily be kept apart.
This was based on the assumption that every Liverpool            fan would
use   the   A628    to travel to the ground.     In fact we,     along with
several thousand others decided to use the A57 , a less congested
route. This meant       that we parked in the same area as all the N o t ­
tingham fans. When I walked about a mile tothe ground at 2.00 pm




                                                                             10

 I would guess that there would have been roughly two Forest fans
to every one Liverpool fan in the streets on the          south    side       of
the ground.
      There    was no sign of any aggressive atmosphere,        no hint of
violence,     simply good natured singing     and   banter.    Anyone       who
knows anything about the game could tell you that there is no a n ­
tipathy between the two clubs, and that the chance of trouble was
minimal.    Despite this there was a massive police presence in the
streets;    clusters of officers on every corner,        threatening mil-
tary looking vans,     none of them smiling or making any attempt to
be helpful as they watched and waited for trouble.
      When we arrived at the Leppings Lane        End   having   literally
been   sent    round  the   houses  by police seperating us from the
Forest fans who we'd just walked the      best part of a mile with, it
was imediately clear that there were difficulties.
      This was at approximately 2.25.      There was a mob swaying and
surging to try and get to the eight turnstiles.          There has been a
lot of talk about sixteen turnstiles        which    simply isn't        true:
there   were eight gates for the seats and eight for the terraces.
The chaos came as absolutely no surprise because it was             exactly
the   same last year when it took me 5 0 minutes to get through the
turnstiles and to my seat      in  the  stand     above   the   terracing.
Everybody     was talking about this,   nobody could believe that the
police had done nothing to improve      the    situation.     Despite        the
hundreds of very visible police all over Sheffield, the only ones
in evidence outside the turnstiles were three mounted policemen.
The situation had obviously been going on for some time, and many
fans who had purposely turned up early were         getting    und e r s t a nd ­
ably   livid.    We were quickly sucked into the centre of the crowd
and there was no doubt that it was      no    normal    crush.   I simply
decided    to   get out.   Having been in many a similar situation it
was clear from the pitch of the screams and shouts from those                 at
the front that the situation was deteriorating fast. I managed to
get   out   of   the main    crush to the side by some railings,             and
shouted for my friend to do the same.        We decided to wait          there
whilst    the   situation   eased.  At  this point one of the mounted
policemen completely lost his cool and barged his way out to                 the
back of the crowd.      I don't know if the fans in his way were able
to get their feet out of the way, but I doubt it. I d o n ’t know if
he did anything constructive when he got out of the crush, but I
 doubt it.    Everyone was    yelling  at   him.   and    I accept      that
everyone   is human,    but his shouted response of " You can all go
crush youselves for all I care!" is something that he will              have
to learn to live with.
      At   this    point many fans began to climb the gates in order
to get out of the crush.      Almost all of them were showing tickets
to police     waiting   on the other side.    The crush wasn't getting
markedly worse as kick off time approached, for the simple reason
that the area around the turnstiles was as crowded as conceivably
possible.   I find the stories of last minute        arrivals    of wild,
drunken   thugs so far fetched that they are quite c o n t e m p t i b l e .At
this point a small gate was opened in a side wall          and   before      I
knew anything I had been pushed through with about fifty or sixty
others after which they managed to close it.          Straight ahead was
a tunnel leading into the ground.      My friend     suggested    that      we
went  in   and    stood   behind  the  goals.    The    area   within the
perimeter of the ground was oddly      quiet and       there was hardly
anyone going in through the tunnel.
     I told      him   that I had once stood there before in a semi­
final against Arsenal years previously and remembered that it was
a bit packed and the view w a s n ’t great.   And so it was that I was
one  of   the    ones   who made their way to the     edge.   Five minutes
later even our part of the ground had filled up very fast and the
incoming fans told of how a big gate had been          opened   or kicked
down. And the rest is history.

I would like to make the following points v.ery clear.

1.  There   WAS a very major problem outside the Leppings Lane End
last year any anyone who claims otherwise is simply   not   telling
the truth.
2.  Everyone   who  saw the numbers of policemen who came onto the
pitch,  and for the most part stood aimlessly about as    the  dis­
aster unfolded could simply not believe why so few had been a l l o ­
cated to steer 10,000 fans through 8 turnstiles which were fenced
in  on three sides by an area little bigger than an infant school
playground.   ( Having said that,  everybody also  noted   the  few
policemen   who unhesitatingly jumped into the middle of the crush
and showed extraordinary courage.)
3.   The stories that are now being brought out about massive n u m ­
bers of riotous,       drunken fans causing the crush are    gross ex a g ­
gerations, which seem to be desparate attemmt to shift the blame.
4. Standard policy at other similar occassions is always to break
down the crowd slowly,to mass the majority in a wide         open    space
like a street,       check their tickets and split them into a smaller
bunch,   then form them into queues which move quickly through the
turnstiles.     Above    all  the most important thing is to have the
policemen doing the job showing       patience,   smiling   and   TELLING
people what      is    happening.  Had there been one articulate voice
talking through one efficient       loudhailer   outside   the   Leppings
Lane End     on    Saturday   there may well have been 94 more people
alive today than there are.
       This in my opinion is where the root causes of the problems
that led to the horror of the weekend are to be found. I am 28, a
graduate and a company director,       and like most people in England
, I'm     generally treated with politeness and courtesy.         That is
until I go to a soccer match.       Once I an identified    as   football
fan     I am     immediately    considered   to  be little more than an
animal.   If I have a scarf out of my car window on        route   to   an
away   match the police will stop me and search me.        When I get to
the game I get herded around by       absurdly   aggressive    policemen,
pushed   and    shoved    with never a word of apology until I,      along
with the rest of the animals,       are safely    locked   away   in   our
cage,   under    the    scrutiny of both video cameras and hundreds of
policemen. Of course there are troublemakers at football matches,
lots of them.      Anyone who claims otherwise is an     idiot.   But   to
treat    two million football fans as if they were all a danger to
society is absurd.       And now we are being branded as    outcasts    to
the extent      w e ’re going to be forced to carry an ID card when we
go to see a game.       Even convicted murderers out on parole     aren't
required to do this.
      If you distrust people to this extent* and insist on pushing
them round    like cattle is it really any surprise that they don't
behave like perfect Edwardian Gentlemen?        A standing joke amongst
Liverpool fans when they are pushed        into  a particularly      tight
space is for them to start mooing at the top of their voices.
      I am    convinced       that it was this ludicrous attitude that
more than anything else led to the tragedy        of     Leppings    Lane.
Whoever was running the show obviously felt that 98% of his
tr




        resources needed to be deployed to stop fighting in the streets.
       A crush     at the turnstiles?  Their problem.   That was why nobody
       told us what was happening as if they assumed      that we  were  so
       thick that we wouldn't understand. That is why we are all haunted
       by  the    sight of policemen beating desperate fans off the fences
       when everyone but    them  knew  that  there   was   a very  serious
       proble m .

                           The cows are transferred from wagon t o p e n t o
       ring   with, the minimum of harshness.  Were they treated or herded
       around in remotely the same way that we fans are shoved around by
       the police on a Saturday afternoon the RSPCA would have     a great
       deal   to  say   about it.  Which puts me in mind of the words of a
       young poet called Wilfred Owen who 6 0 years    ago  wrote   a poem
       called     Anthem for doomed youth." Its first line suddenly after
       all these years seems horribly topical,

                  "What passing bells for those who die like cattle."




                                            Yours sincerely,

Secretary to the Inquiry
Inquiry into the Hillsborough Stadium Disaster-

We spoke about your letter of 15 September when I explained that
we do not have the information that you need here.
I understand that most US stadia are p r i v a t e l y owned and that the
owner negotiates with team owners and e v e n t organisers for the
use of his stadium. A wide r a n g e of activities take place - from
baseball and American football, soccer and lacrosse to pop
concerts. Indoor arenas cater for a wide range too including ice
hockey, basketball, even motorcycling. I t is m o r e common for the
owner of the indoor stadium to own the sports team which plays
there, but again this is not typical.         The Skydome in Toronto,
complete with its roof which closes in h hour, is acknowledged as
the state of the art stadium in Canada and the US. You may be
interested in the enclosed brochure about it.
 I have discussed your letter with Peter Palmer and he is
 helpfully approaching posts in the US, Canada and Europe to
 secure as much     i n     as he can on the issues you need o
                          f o   r m   a   t i o   n


 know about.

I am a Technician employed by the Directorate of Telecommunications working on
South Yorkshire Police radio installations.

On 5th May 1989 a series of tests were carried out on the radio equipment
installed at Hillsborough Football Ground by Home Office Technicians J. Cutler
and N. Hancock.  PC Claxton (South Yorkshire Police) was in attendance.

1.     MAIN W15U CONTROL STATION

          This was checked using a Marconi 2955 test set and all parameters were
          found to be within the specified limits.

2.     COVERAGE TESTS

          Tests were then carried out between the Control  Station and personal
          radios  to check the coverage in an around Hillsborough Football Ground
          particular attention was paid to the Leppings Lane end of the   ground,
          particularly the areas in an around Gangways 2, 3 and 4.    These tests
          were conducted both with and without the 'talk through'  mode  in use.
          No problems were experienced at any time.

3.     STAND-BY W15U

       This  was  tested as in 1.  and identical coverage checks done as in 2.
       Again no problems were encountered.

4.     TALK-THROUGH TESTS

       Further tests were then carried out to show that with the      Control
       Station on   'talk through' any transmissions by a personal radio will
       over-ride the Controller should he be trying to transmit via       the
       hand-held microphone.

CONCLUSIONS

The  radio equipment checks and the subsequent coverage tests did not show up
any apparent problems with the radio scheme.

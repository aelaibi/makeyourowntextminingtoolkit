                              states:      I    am     33      years    old,    born on

21.10.55 and         am a leading ambulance man with                    the SYMAS.          I

am    based       atRotherham    ambulance           station.            I     joined in

January 1981 as an ambulance man.



I am a qualified leading ambulance man, and I work shifts.

On Saturday 15th April 1989 I commenced my tour of duty at

Rotherham at 1400.



It    is    standard     procedure    to       check      my    ambulance       and   the

equipment         that   itcarries,     plus     personal         equipment.          The

checks were carried out , and were satisfactory.



I    went    on     standby   and    remained        on     standby     waiting       for

instructions from control.



I noticed on the television a broadcast from Hillsborough, I

think it was about 1505 when I saw what I took to be crowd

trouble from the match.



Soon after the telephone rang and I took the call.                                I was

told by Control to report to Hillsborough and that there was

trouble.



I    drove    the    ambulance      with       the   blue       light   flashing       to

Sheffield.        I approached the ground from Herries Road and I

noticed crowds of people and               Police on traffic control.                  My
      vehicle directed against the traffic signs, on to Penistone

      Road, North bound.



8.    The vehicle was directed into the perimeter of the ground by

      the    second entrance        by the    Police.         One    of   our officers

      Superintendent Dale, sent me in towards the gymnasium.



9.    Casualties in the immediate vacinity were being tended by

      Police, ambulance men and members of the public.                       I got out

      of    the   ambulance    and    told                    that    we    would    work

      together.



10.   We tried to assess those casualties                 in need of immediate

      treatment.         I    was    tending    a     patient        with    breathing

      difficulties when I was grabbed on the shoulder by a man.

      He asked me to go and look at his friend.                           I told him I

      would go as soon as I could and he seemed to accept that.



11.   Another man who         seemed to have medical            knowledge said he

      would take care of the first patient I was treating.                      I went

      to a second patient, who appeared not to be in danger.



12.   I noticed that attempts were being made to put casualties on

      my    ambulance.         I    shouted    that     the    ambulance       was    my

      responsibility.        I did not want those casualties with minor

      injuries in the ambulance when it was needed for seriously

      injured people.




                                                3?
13.   A     police   officer   came    over    and   asked    us     to    look   at    two

      patients with fractured femurs, which are serious injuries.

      I went to those casualties and found one was in great pain.

      It transpired that he had a broken ankle.                      I tried to get

      him     alternative      transport      to   hospital     in    a    police      van,

      because        other   casualties       were   in   greater          need   of     my

      ambulance.




14.   We were then approached by a woman who said a doctor needed

      a stretcher for a seriously ill casualty and we therefore

      took a stretcher off the ambulance and went with the woman

      under the stand into the gym.



15.   Inside the gym I saw a number of bodies which were covered.

      We went over to the doctor, who attracted our attention.                          He

      was    treating    a young      man.     We used     an   airway       to   assist

      breathing and the doctor requested us to take the patient at

      once to hospital.



16.   The casualty was placed on a stretcher and put on to the

      ambulance.        A second patient with crush injuries was also

      put    on   the   ambulance,      to    utilise     fully      the    facilities

      available.
     17.     We reversed out of the ground into Penistone Road and set

             off    to   Northern    General    Hospital.        At      the    roundabout      a

             police officer stopped us and asked me to look at a patient

             he had with him.          The officer appeared concerned so I got

             out and had a quick look at the patient he did not seem

             desperately ill.        I told the policeman this and went back to

             my ambulance.



40   1 8 -   With an escort I went to the Northern General hospital and

             the police did an excellent job getting us there.                          At the

             casualty     department      I handed    the    casualties         over    to    the

             hospital staff, giving a brief explanation of treatment and

             injuries.



     19.     The radio was very busy and we proceeded back to the ground

             without     waiting    for    instructions.            On   arrival       we    were

             directed    to join a line of ambulances waiting to collect

             casualties from inside the ground.



     20.     I asked if I could help inside the ground but was told there

             were   sufficient      doctors    at   that    time.        My    attention was

             drawn to a colleague who said he was alone with an ambulance

             which was loaded with three stretcher patients on drips.                           I

             am qualified to take care of such patients so I left word

             for               and     accompanied         the   three        casualties      to

             hospital.     We went to the Hallamshire with an escort,                        and
      travelled without difficulty.




21.   I was     able to contact control             and was      told to report     to

      Herries      Road    bus   depot      where   I   would    be   given    further

      orders.      I joined a number of other ambulances on standby at

      the depot.



22.   I did not experience any real difficulty with pedestrians or

      traffic at Hillsborough.              The radio contact, accepting that

      the radio was very busy,              was good until we got             into the

      ground, when there was difficulty for some reason.



23.   I   did     not    have    any   contact       with   St.Johns      Ambulance

      personnel.



24.   I do know that there is a plan for a major incident and I am

      acquainted with my duties according to that plan.



25.   Being familiar with Hillsborough and the incident that took

      place on 15th April 1989 I do consider that the emergency

      services did a very good job,                 including the police,         fire

      service and the ambulance services.



26.   After the incident was over a small de-briefing session was

      held   at    the    ground.      We   were    told    to   return   to    normal

      duties.

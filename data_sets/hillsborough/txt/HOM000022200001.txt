Dear Sir,

Re:   Hilsborough Disaster

We write to confirm our telephone conversation with you earlier this afternoon,
that we have been instructed to apply to you on behalf of the Police Federation
of England & Wales for leave that their interests should be represented at the
Public Inquiry starting in Sheffield on Monday.

We are aware, of course, that the preliminary hearing that dealt with representa­
tion was some time ago but the Federation have been considering their position
carefully and have decided, regretably late in the day, that they feel it
important that they should be represented.

The Police Federation of England & Wales represents Officers of the rank of
Constable, Sergeant, Inspector and Chief Inspector and also Police Cadets. The
South Yorkshire Branch Board of the Police Federation represents the Officers
of those ranks in the South Yorkshire Police.

The Police Federation has the responsibility to represent its members in all
matters relating to safety and welfare of its members.  It will be appreciated
that Officers of Federation rank are at the operational forefront of policing
the Public and it is members of the Police Federation who inevitably take prime
responsibility for crowd control and safety in any public order situation.
It is perhaps not surprising that over 200 members of the South Yorkshire Force
have received and still require counselling to enable them to deal with the
incidents with which they were involved at Hilsborough.

The Police Federation will be able to make a significant contribution to the
matters to be dealt with at the Public Inquiry which is wholly separate from
the issues which are likely to be addressed by Counsel representing the South
Yorkshire Police. The safety and welfare of Police Officers who have to patrol
Football Grounds as well as the members of the public with whom they come into
contact is surely a matter of vital importance which the Public Inquiry will
have an opportunity to address.

'   It may be that Mr. Justice Taylor will require a more detailed submission on
    the request of the Police Federation to be represented and it is hoped that
    this can be prepared by Counsel over the weekend. We are aware of course, that
    the Public Inquiry starts on Monday and it may be that it would be impossible
    for a decision to be made before Monday on this late request. We would welcome
    the opportunity to address the Inquiry through Counsel at an appropriate early
    stage in the proceedings on the question of representation of the Police
    Federation.

    A Representative of this Firm will be in attendance at the Inquiry on Monday
    and will take the opportunity of making contact with you there.

    Yours faithfully,

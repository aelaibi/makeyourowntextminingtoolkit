bottom       of    the       steps.           There          would          be    two    serials           at    the       bottom         of

the    steps.           The       other       serial          Sergeant             was       PS    1829     France,          th e       third

While       stood       at    the       bottom          of    the       steps       we       saw    on e    or       two    football

orderly.

The    Public          House       directly             adjacent             to    the       Railway        Station          n am e       not

PC    260    Shipman,             we    were       instructed                to     go over         to     speak       to D 3         162

                                  He    expressed             concern             about       supporters              who    wanted              to

go    in    the    ’p u b ’ .          He    requested             Police          attendance              to    supervise              but

there       were       no    problems             existing             at    this       time       and     told       h i m we        would

return       if    required             to    do    so.           We    went       back       to    the     bottom          of    the

steps,       present          at       this       time       parked          in a       car       some     100 y a r d s         up     from

our    position             was    a British             Transport                Police          vehicle        containing              a

Police       Sergeant             1682       or    1672.           He       informed          me    that        only       4/5    of      his

officers          would       be       travelling             with          the    Liverpool             supporters              on     the

train       and    he       believed          there          would          be a    total          of    some        450    travelling

supporters             from       Liverpool.                 There          would       also       be    one     dog       man    from

By    this    time          several          small       groups             of    Liverpool             supporters           were        makirg

drink.        We     told          them       the       best     way       was    to     make       their        way     down       to       the

Supermarket             on     a    side          road       about        400 yards           from     our       position.                  The

general       message              was       ’P r o b l e m s    with          supporters           - drinking            on       the

All    quiet       on     arrival,                but    a    la rge       amount-       of    Liverpool              supporters              in

the    excess        of      150        sat       on    the     grass          banking        outside        shops        drinking

from    the    ca ns,          they          were       noisy,        but       caused        no    real     problems.                  We    then

returned       to       ou r       position             at    th e    Station.            Whilst          walking         down          the

road    with       PC     C a m m o c k , we            were     approached              by    a    group        of     Liverpool

supporters           three          adults             one    of w h i c h w a s         wearing          a Glasgow            Rangers

shirt.        With        them          was       one    small        boy.        They        were     carrying           a    fold          up

stool.        We     advised             them          that     they       would        probably          not      be a l l o w e d          in

with    this       stool.               They       said       they        had    only     taken        this        to    the       game       so

the    little        l ad      could          see       onto     the 'pitch,             and       they     agreed        to       take       it

back    to    their          motor           vehicle.

By    this    time        I saw          large          numbers           of L i v e r p o o l      supporters           making              their

way    down    the        main          r oad,         carrying           packs     of    beer       and     lager.            They were

very    boisterous                 shouting             and     singing.

I noticed          one       youth           in    particular              about        18-19       years        about    5*9"              tall,

heavily       built          wearing              Un i o n Jack           shorts,        was       singing         louder          than

anyone       around          him.            He    definitely              appeared           worse       for      drink.           His

mates       appeared           to       be    telling           him       to    keep     quiet.           They        then moved              on
                                                                                                                                     PAGE

down    the    main        road.

I then     heard         a message           over        the     radio         'Assistance               required           outside

At    approximately             S.OQ        pm    the     train         carrying            th e    supporters,            arrived.

On    1eaving       station           arrangements               made        to    hold      them        together           outside

the    public       house       (name        no t      known).           The       supporters             al l      age     groups,

both    sexes,       were       very        well       behaved.              No    singing          or    chanting,             no

evidence       of    drink,           made       their        way      from       off    the       Platform          down       the

steps.        We    we re then           joined          by    two      mounted          officers,             I believe             from

South     Yorkshire.

The    supporters          were        held       fo r    approximately                  5 minutes             in the          small

triangular          area     outside             the     public         house.

1 noticed          that     two       men    at     the       re a r    of     th e     supporters             were       carrying          te

urns.     We       were     then       instructed              to      escort         the    supporters              to     the

football       ground.            This       was       cont r a r y      to       the    order          and    also       it w a s

rather    unusual          considering                 the     supporters               were       so    quiet      and        well

behaved              •

We    escorted       the     supporters                down      th e   main          road,        arriving          outside          the

Leppings       Lane       entrance           at     approximately                  2.15      pm.         No    problems

experienced              with     t he      supporters              from       leaving         the       station          to a r r i v i n g

outside       the    ground.

They    then       made    their         way      to     the    queues            that      were        forming        outside         the

turnstile          area,     outside           Leppings             Lane.

Already       there       was     a   large        amount           of s u p p o r t e r s o u t s i d e the          ground          but

this    was    not       unusual         considering                it w a s      a Semi Final.                     I was

approached          by    several           supporters              at different,              times          and   asked a

              We    were       receiving           feedback             that        tickets           were       being      sold           outside          a     pub

size    of    the    crowds             gathering            and    the      slowness             in    being        dealt        with

entering       at    th e      turnstiles.

One    middle       aged       Liverpool              supporter             came       up    to me        and    mentioned           in

relation       to    the       crowd          gathering            that      they        had      the     same       attendance

every    week       at       Liverpool           and       manage        much       better.             In     reply     to       this    I

pointed       out    that          they       don't        arrive        all      at     the      same        t ime.

The    time    now       about          2.50     pm.         I was       surprised             to      se e    a large        amount

of    supporters             climbing           onto       the     wall      above          the     turnstiles.               I

mentioned       this          to    PC     Cammock,           and      also       that       they       seemed         to w a i t

several       seconds          before           jumping          off     the      wall       into       the     ground.

A    Police    Officer             X believe            an    Inspector             then       appeared           on    the       wall,

the    climbing          ceased          but     he     was      lifting          small        children           from       the

developing          crush          to    safety.

Again    myself          and       PC    Cammock           went     to      give       what       assistance            we    could,

and    I myself          could          feel     th e      force       of     the      crowd        and       I withdrew

further       back       towards           the       road.

I    seemed    to    recollect                earlier         hearing          a radio            message         requesting

Public       transport             to    be     stopped          from       travelling              along       Leppings           Lane

but    I saw    th e         buses       were        still       moving        through            the     crowd,        forcing

them    over    towards             th e      turnstiles            in      the     bottleneck                area     outside

Leppings       Lane.

On    this    occasion             we    kept        the     crowds         back       outside          the     metal        railings

etc.         Also       there      seemed          to    tie a         general         lack          of     i n fo r m a t i o n         coming

from     within            the    ground       from          ground          control            via       the       radio       or       the

The    mood        of      the    crowd       by    this          time       was      growing             more       v o l a t i 1e but                no

evidence           of      violence          towards           us,      b ut      they were               continuing                to       pu sh.          A

Land     Rover          containing            a P.C.           w h i c h was          parked           to      the       extreme             l ef t     of

 the    turnstile            area       began       to       edge       in     slowly           in a n         attempt          to       slow          down

 the    movement            of    the    c ro w d .          He    then        had     to       stop        because            of    the          sheer

weight        of      numbers.           He    then          left       the       position              in the           ca b a n d          standing

 on    the    step         was    shouting          loudly             for     t he    supporters                   to    stop       pushing,

 but    the     crowd        appeared          not       to       hear       this,         or    take          no    notice.

 Inspector            Ellis       then       appeared             with       a megaphone/hailer                           and       began          to

 shout       ’L i v e r p o o l    supporters,                 please          stop        pushing*             this       was       repeated

 several        ti me s .

At     this     stage        1 d i d n ’t se e           anything              to     indicate              the      impending

 disaster          even      though          there       was       a    large         crowd          but       this       is    usual             for

'big    games.

 11    would       be      about     this       time         I heard           over        my    personal                radio       some body

making        reference            to    a    'c a t a s t r o p h e ' . I had                  no     idea         whose       voice             or

whose        c al l     sign      it w a s .        We       were       still         receiving                nothing          from          Match

Control,           it      seemed       strange.

I was        then approached                  by a n o t h e r          Liverpool               supporter                who    produced                a

ticket        to      me    and    enquired             the       location            of    the        North         Stand.              I

indicated             the    general          direction                of    t he     North          Stand          and    saw       that          a

large        double         blue    gate       to       th e      extreme           left        of     the      turnstile                area

open,        about         3-4    feet.        People             were       not      rushing             in,       it    seemed             as    if

someone        was         checking          tickets           and      using         this       as       an    extra          turnstile,

but    I was          still       surprised             to     se e     it     open.

I pointed                 ou t    this        to    the       enquiring               Liverpool             supporter             and       he

started              to w a 2 k o v e r .

At    this           time        I heard           from       other           officers          that        the       game       had    been

delayed              until        3.15        pm.        I told           approaching                 supporters             ’D o n ’t rush,

the        start          now     delayed".                  The       time       about        now 3 . 0 0         pm.       I t nen            heard a

loud        cheer          or     roar        likened             to     a goal         scoring         chance.              A    group          of

supporters                  close-by              said       ’W h a t ’s t h a t          t h e n ’ , I replied:                  ’C o u l d      be     the

teams           coming           out."            I checked             my     watch         thinking            t h a t ’s u n u s u a l ,           they

usually              come        out    ten minutes                    before         start.           One       Liverpool             supporter

made        a    comment              that        the    start           had      not     been        delayed          and       that       I was

lying.               There        were        still          odd       supporters-             asking        for       spare       tickets.

I saw           PC    Rose        having           problems             with        one      youth,         apparently             he       d i d n ’t

have        a    ticket           and       was     just          making          a general            nuisance           of      himself.

1 then           saw       that        th e       large       blue        gate        t ha t    had     been          opened       earlier             wa s

now        closed.               Then       about        eight          minutes           past        three        I received               a    radio

message              something              to     the       effect           ’Al l     serials         or       personnel             onto       the

p i t c h ’.          No     reason           or    further              order        was      given        or    did     we      hear          the

emergency                 code        'Mr.        Meadows          urgently             required            at    th e    Police            Room.'

I then           ran       through            a    large          blue        gate      to     t he    extreme           right         of       the

turnstile                 area.         I ran           through           into        the      area     behind           the      Leppings             Lane

stand           then       to     the       right        towards              the     rear      of     the       Control          Box.           To m y

left       I could               see    terracing                 (extreme            right      hand        corner          of    Leppinga

Lane)           seemed           to    be     plenty          of       r o o m,       I could          see       no    players          on       the

pitch,          but        I couldn't               see       any       fighting.

1 then          eventually                  made        my    way       onto        the      pitch      vi a      a gangway             in       the

outside              seating           area        of    the       South          Stand.         From        this        position               I could

see    large              numbers           of     officers             on     the      pitch         and    standing             on    the

fencing              behind           the     Leppings             Lane        goa l.          I saw        several          supporters

running              on    th e       pitch.            I asked           a   steward          what         had       happened,             he    replied

’F a n s    on        the       pitch        a    bit        of    trouble'.              He     didn't           seem       really          concerned

Following            other          officers          I went          immediately                  to     the         fencing           behind        a

goal.         I couldn't              see       any       officer          who        appeared            to      lie t a k i n g        control.

1 joined           other        officers             at    t he      fencing           urging           supporters                 to    push

back:,      at     th e      same     time       waving.              At     th e      same        time          I heard           o v er     the

public        address           system.              ’W i l l     you      please           move        of f      th e     pitch*.

I can       recall           whilst        running          over          t he     pitch         to     th e      area        behind          the

goal     I met          a young           lad    from                                           t h a t ’s w h e r e          I live.            A    lad

c a l l e d ________________ ■he                 shouted             then        c a me     over        to m e         ’ I t ’s t e r r i b l e           in

there,        people           are    dying          people          are     dead.’

I    continued            to    run       to    the       fence       and        what       I saw         I ’ ll       never        forget.

Young       fans        faces        pressed          against             th e     fencing,             pleading              to    be      rescued,

but    we     couldn't              get    tc- t h e m      because              of    th e      wire        railings.

I saw       f ou r      or     five       bodies          just       piling           up    on     each          other.            It    somehow

reminded           me     of    'Belsen          victims',                faces        blue        and       they        were       being        t r od

on.      It      was      complete             and    utter          turmoil.               One       thing           that     struck          me     on

reaching           t he      fence        was    the       strong          smell           of    alcohol              coming        from        the

area     behind           that       goal.           By    this       time         the      officers              in     the       left      hand

pen    passing            the       dead       and    injured             through           to     us     on      the      perimeter

track.           One      Liverpool             supporter             a    bi g       heavy        la d      holding           his       ch e st .

He    was     in     danger          of    being          trod       on    by      the      other         supporters.                    I pulled

him    away        from        the    perimeter             track.               He was          conscious               he    appeared              to

be    okay.          I placed             him    in       the     recovery             position              and       shotted           over        to

another          couple         of    Liverpool             supporters                 ’s t a n d       by       him’.

I went        to     another          casualty            who        appeared              to    have        a    severe           leg      in j u r y .

He    was     lying          near     the       goal       posts        again          in d a n g e r            of    being        trod       on.

He    was     another           large          lad    I shouted             to y o u n g ________________to                          assist           to

take     him       away        to    safety,          over        towards             the       South        Stand.            I saw         several

fatalities              lying        in    the       goal       area       with        jerseys            or      coats        over         their

faces.

        many     Policemen              and        Policewomen                carrying.                 A     Liverpool              supporter

        lying     in       the       goal         area,       he    appeared              to       be    semi         conscious           I forced

        my     Brook       airway           into        his    mouth          bu t       he    appeared               to    force       it     out     with

        his     tongue,           clearing              the    airway.               I    found          a St.         J o h n ’s A m b u l a n c e m a n

        who     was     carrying              a    bottle          of    oxygen           I pu t         the         tube    into       the     youth's

        mouth,        he     appeared              to    come       round.               I placed             him      in    the       recovery

        position,            reassured               him,      and       he       told        me    his       name         was                  but     he

        couldn't           remember               his    surname             or    where           he    came         from        in L i v e r p o o l .

        Several         other          Liverpool              fans       came        over          to    him         and    they       said     they

        would     stay          with        him.

        By     this     time         th e     St.       John's          Ambulance              vehicle               came     round       the

        perimeter            of      th e     pitch,          we    began          moving           people,            hoarding,

        photography               equipment              off       the       perimeter              to      allow          th e    ambulance

        through,           to     give        what       assistance                they        could.

        People        were        being           put    on    hoardings                 used       as      stretchers,                and     taken

        across        to     th e      gymnasium.                  I remember                 helping            to    put        a young       girl

        onto     on e      of     these           h o a r d i n g s ,■there              was       two      or       three        young      girls      at

        one     end     of      th e    hoarding              attempting                 to    lift         or       carry.          I went       to

        their     assistance                  and       quite       unknowingly                    they       let      go     and      left     me     with

        th e    weight          of     th e       hoarding          and       the        body,          and      I    subsequently              injured

        my     back.         No      real         pain    felt          at    this        t i me.           Everybody              seemed       to     be

        in     a state          of     shock.            I was          never        made          aware         that       there        had    been

South Yorkshire Police Authority discontinue paying my legal expenses in connection
with the above 1 may have to make application to the Superintendents Association for
financial assistance.

Subject to legal advice I may seek to challenge the decision of the Police Authority by
way 0f Judicial Review but would be unable to obtain legal aid or any other financial
assistance other than paying for the review myself.

 I appreciate this is a National Executive decision and many factors have to be
 considered but I would like to give notice of my intentions and ask for guidance as to
 the information required in the submission of any formal application if this should be
 necessary.
 I have given authority to my solicitor to discuss matters with you should tins be

                   Hillsborough case to go to the High Court

                   South Yorkshire Police Authority met today to consider issues relating to the
                   funding of the defence costa of former police officers in legal proceedings
                   relating tc the Hillsborough disaster. As well a s considering various legal
                   advice, the Authority heard representations from the Hillsborough Families
                   Support Group and solicitors representing two former officers.


                   Following the meeting, Chairman of the Police Authority, Clarence Swindell
                   said:


                   ‘Questions have been raised recently about the powers of Police Authorities to
                   pay the defence costs of police officers in legal proceedings. We have taken
                   extensive legal advice on thB matter. On balance, our advisers fiave
                   concluded that Police Authorities do not have the powers and we have felt
                   obliged to support that view."


                    “However, the issue is far from clear cut. We have heard this morning from
                    several other legal advisers - including the Chief Constable's adviser - who are
                    firmly of the view that Police Authorities do have the powers.”


                    ‘’The implications of this matter go beyond South Yorkshire and could affect
                    the Police Service as a whole. W s are therefore co-operating with the Chief
                    Constable to have the true legal position determined by the court.”


                                                       -ENDS-

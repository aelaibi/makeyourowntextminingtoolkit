left      for She f f i e l d at    10.30am.       we   took     it quite        steady as Chris                  was

driving        a small    Fi e s t a and did not K n o w           the way.        I took        them through

nad the four stand t i c k e t s . The other four had left us earlier in

the      pub   in order to swop their tickets at                     the ground.,            We agreed            to

meet      them   later after        the match       in the     pub.       We walked down towards

Hi 1 Isdorough and brought                some    chips along        the way.            We wal k e d down to

the main gates            situated adjacent          to Fennistone             Road.        It was      very

crowded at this area but                  I put this     down to the fact                 that    the Forrest

team      coach haa just a r rived and was               pulling         onto    the      car    park       outside

the South Stand.             1 did not see a lot of Po l i c e m e n on the a p p r o a c h to

the      ground and       in my mind       there was a lot of Liverpool and N o t t i n g h a m

S u pporters      about.      This       is not    something       out    of the ordinary.                   I did

see a few of the male               supporters       drinking        out of      cans but not

disorderly.          It was quite a friendly a t mosphere all                            round.      The      sun

was      shining and everyone was anticipating                      a good game.                After       the

team      coach had left,          the    crowd around the S outh Stand diminished

somewhat,        by the time we got to gate                •£*     there was         no pressure at

all.       We entered via the turnstile at gate                       TE C .     I handed my            ticket

over and was given the stub.                      We turned to our             right and was            shown by

a steward where           to go.         We went    to gangway        ’1 3 ’ and another             steward

pointed us        in the direction of row               ’N N " .    We went        to seat 22 and

Russell        was on one side of me Mark               sat on the other side as did

Grant.         We had a good seat,           we were     positioned about                 forty yards             from

the    centre      of the goal             in front        of the west Stand and about                      ten yards

to the      right      of the Police              control       box.        We    took our       seats and        sat

down at about            13..45hrs.          At that          time     the ground          looked three

quarters        full.        In fact        I made       comment         that     the Supporters           in the

S p i o n Hop end were all Liverpool                          but     I was      told that       I had     it wrong

and that        the L i v e r p o o 1 / S u p p o r t e r s         had been a l l o c a t e d      to      the west

Stand.        At about 2., gcpro it               looked            like    the c e n t r ep^n s of tWe"''WisT~N,

police      presence,              There y & r e    views       ex p r e s s e d between Russell                and

myself      about      the     policing          of the match,             p r esumably as we had been at

the    same m atch         l a s y year as         I recall           there a p p e a r e d to be more            high

profile       poIicVvio/            It was a nice afternoon,                      the    crowd ar o u n d us?          both

L iverpool        and N o t t i n g h a m Supporters?                were     very amenable and             I remarked

on the      pleasantness             of the       day.        I told                ibout the ground and how

it was a first             class       s t^TuJm for           this     event      in comparison           to others.

A r o u n d about 2 . 3 0 pm tbrere was               even more            people       piled    in£o     the    centr<

sections        of L e & p i n g/ L a n e E!n g and there was                     even S importers          cl imbint

over    the     fence                the    quarte r a n g l e s       into      the ji^ntre s e c t i o n .          I'

was    obv i o u s l y g r / e r    full.       ; I saw two or           three      lads    climb    the barriers

in the      centre       pens with their              backs         to the       pitch and then dive

backwards         onto     the heads            of the Supporters.                 At about       that     time       I saw

a young       boy of about             14 yrs,      oeing       chased by a Pol i c e m a n and

Policewoman          from the area of the West Stand                              goal area.         He    ran along

the under         track      into the           corner of the S o u t h S tand and                  ran along          the

fence     to the Police              control       box.,       The P o l i c e m a n gave        chase j m d      1 think

the young         lad got over             the    fence       to the other             side.     T h § / poli ceman

                                                                                                                                                  the

                            West S tand goal.                As    it did a p p roach          it was       very slow,         hindered          by

                            the     bodies and the            confusion and             chaos.        I think       it ran over            the    legs

                            of some dead people.                     It pulled         past    us and       I believe that            they       put

                            the other          girl    in.        The    father       of the girls was            shouting       for       us to

                            put our girl             in and as we          picked her          up the ambulance               drove     off.          The

                            father went with the ambulance.

                            We     got    hold of an              v e r t i s e m e r^t^d^rci , p u t the       girl        on it and       ran to

                            the     far    corner,      towards          the g y m nasium area.              When we got there,                  there

                            were     no ambulances.                We    put her down and             co n t inued trying          to      revive

      He    gave       he r    a    little    oxygen          and     checked      h er   eyes     with     a    torch        and

      help.

      The     grey haired man who                   had joined us on the                    pitch said?           "You are my

      team."           We     introduced ourselves                   and he said,           "You stay with me and

      we'll work              together."

      We all        ran back            to the     pitch         to the goal           m outh and      I ’m sure we tried

      one more          body who was male a * t h o u g h                    then ne was well               dead.       It seemed

      that     all      the bodies           had oeen          re moved from the               terracing area            in the

      West Stand ana were                    either       being        carried away            or on the g r a s s .

      I think we              then went       back a cross             the   field to the           gymnasiurn to see                    it

      we    could he ip in there.                    While we were              in there we had an a l t er c a t i o n

      w ith    two Liverpool               supporters           who      had some h o w aeen          let       in the

      gym n a s i u m win ch was             being       usecx as a mortuary,                   ihey said         they were

      looking          for a son or friend. 1 told them., they s h o u l d n ’t be                                      in there

      but,     as      they were alre a d y              in         there, w e / n a d    to    placate         them and            usher

      them out.               I spoke with Detective                     Ijfepector T QWE)l.L , Hammer ton Rd €1D,

      who     police          the area.          I offered him our                 services and asked                 if there

      was anything we                   could do.         Obviously          there w a s n ’t         because         it became

      an a d m i n i s t r a t i v e      t a s k , picking up the              pieces,         so we went         to locate

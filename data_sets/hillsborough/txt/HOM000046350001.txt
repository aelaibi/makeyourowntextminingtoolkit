                               Gary Church, we are prepared to make them available to your Pathologist
                               on the understanding they are not disclosed to anyone else, they are returned
                               to this office when they have served their purpose, that ownership and
                               copyright of the photographs remain with the South Yorkshire Police and,
                               therefore, should not be reproduced without authority.

                               I would draw your attention to the decision in the case, Hicks and another -
                               v- Chief Constable of the South Yorkshire Police, and would suggest that
                               there is nothing to be gained by the disclosure of the photographs and that
              ■                in any event you already have a copy of the post mortem report.

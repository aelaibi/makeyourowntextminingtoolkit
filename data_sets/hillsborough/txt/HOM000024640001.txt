 file(s), for exam ple th rough tu rn s tile s or

 It is designed to prevent overcrowding by
 warning the Controller of a sports arena,

 channels and a totaliser. It can be used to
 count people entering a defined area of any
 establishm ent through up to six “ gates” sim ultaneously. Additional instrum ents can
 monitor other defined areas at the same premises.

 DESCRIPTION
 The instrum ent can be preprogram m ed with the maximum num ber to be allowed
 through each turnstile or “ g ate” , and the m axim um num ber to be allowed into the
 ground or area or establishm ent, i.e. the “ capacity” .
 Norm ally the Gatelog displays the total number of people who have passed into the
 area. An audio-visual warning is given if the program m ed capacity is exceeded so that
 all further entry can be halted.
 At the same time, if any of the six gates adm its more than its preprogram m ed number
 the chevron appears on the display to identify the channel, the number of people
 passed through the turnstile is shown, the display flashes and the audio alarm sounds.
 Instructions can then be given for the “ gate” to be closed, thus slowing down the rate of
 flow of people into the area.
 A sensor, supplied to suit the application, is mounted at each turnstile or “ gate” .
 Normally the instrum ent is mounted in the ticket office or in the C ontroller’s office which
 can be several hundred metres from the “ gates” .
 The Gatelog runs from a 12v supply so a m ains electricity supply is not necessary.
 However 240v - 1 2 v convertors can be provided so that the instrum ent can be run from
 m ains supply.
 The maximum num ber which can be displayed on the instrum ent is four digits i.e. 9999.
 Consequently the use of this instrum ent is limited to areas where the required capacity
 is less than 10,000 and which are fed by no more than six turnstiles or “ gates” .
 However several instrum ents can be used to m onitor several areas at the same location
 providing the stated lim itations are not exceeded.
 The RDS Universal People C ounter is designed to perform the same functions without
 any limitations on the number of gates, the num ber of areas to be monitored or the total
 capacity. It can also be supplied, in som e cases where there are separate exit facilities
 to subtract the num ber of people leaving from the number of people entering. Separate
 information on this product should be requested from RDS Technology Ltd.

                      GATELOG 2 - STOP PRESS




Gatelog 2 is a variant of Gatelog 1.    Basically it exercises the

same function of counting people into an area or "pen"»



However instead of being programmable with a maximum number for

each of the turnstiles, it is programmable with a three-level

total for the "pen". The three levels might be capacity,

capacity less 10%, capacity less 20%.   As each level of capacity

is reached the alarm will sound until it is cancelled. The

Gatelog 2, like Gatelog 1 records the number passing through each

turnstile and this information is still accessible.

APPLICATION
The RDS Hi-Wire Detector is designed to
warn drivers of extendable-height vehicles or
applicances when they are close to high-
voltage overhead cables. The warning given
is visual in the first instance. It is reinforced
by an audio warning if the driver starts to
raise the appliance while still in the proxim ity
of th e ca b le . It has a w id e v a rie ty of
applications, including agricultural tipping
                                                                   O

tra ile rs , a e ria l p la tfo rm s , c ra n e s , fire
appliances etc.

DESCRIPTION
The cab unit, measuring 125 x 72 x 37 mm,
which can be mounted at the periphery of the
driver’s vision, contains a pair of red lamps
which flash alternately when the vehicle is
close to power lines. One of the lamps also
acts as a visual warning light to show that
the unit is in operation. The cab unit includes
an audible alarm which is triggered typically
by a pressure switch in the hydraulic lift line,
if the operator tries to lift the appliance while
still in the vicinity of overhead power cables.
The audible alarm is a pulsed signal which
g e ts fa s te r, i.e. m ore u rg e n t, as the
appliance gets closer to the cable.
The instrum ent is perm anently wired to the vehicle             electrical system through the
ignition key.
Signal detection is from an aerial mounted on the cab roof.

RANGE
Two variable, switched ranges enable a wide detection capability. The device is a
sensitive radio receiver and the actual detection range is dependent on the installation.
The following are approxim ate ranges for various voltage cables.
                                    240 V                  5 - 20m
                                    11,000 V               10 - 200m
                                    132K, 400K,            50 - 1000m
In a majority of installations where the continued detection of low voltage cables is not
required, the unit can be switched to detect high voltage cables only.

SENSORS
All sensors, cables etc. are included in the supply price.

 this Data Sheet.

 DESIGN FEATURES
 This range of Micro-processor based instrum ents may be used for many purposes
 which vary with the software supplied and the sensors used. The following numbered
 points give an indication of the potential
 1.   Up to six channels of information may be displayed.
 2.   The unit will accept up to 6 inputs from closing contact sensors or from low voltage
       a.c. signal sources.
 3.    Input signals are selected and processed to give the required inform ation on a
       numeric or alpha-num eric display. Display channel selection is determ ined by
       pressing a o    touch-button to move a pointer on the display.
 4.   The display is a 4 digit illuminated L.C.D.
 5.   User programmable factors can be entered to process the signal data and provide
      the output in the required form. This is done by using a com bination of touch-
       buttons on the fascia so that accidental corruption of programmed factors is
       avoided.
 6.   One or more channels can be used for totalising.
 7.   Two digital outputs are provided to activate alarm systems, operate mechanical
       actuators, shut off processes or to interface with autom atic control systems.
 8.    An internal battery is incorporated to retain status and data when power is
       removed. The battery has a typical life of ten years.

very few.           At a p p r o x i m a t e l y 3 . 1 0      pm    ( 1 5 IQ)    it was      quiet       enough         to

resume      to the S o u t h S t a n d            upper     deck.         Together        w i t h PC H U D S O N        I went

to the upper            deck an d          on e n t ering      the       stand a b o v e     the     pitch       I could           see

that    there a p p e a r e d        to have         been a pitch            invasion        in front           of Le ppi ngs

Ln terraces           and     I could see Po l i c e Officers,                       supporters          and     pressmen

massed around             that     end of the           pitch.           I could see         that a number               of

s u p p o r t e r s were      hanging           on to the goal            posts a n d       causing        the    goal        to

move    quite       violently.              On speaking            to the N o t t i n g h a m Fo r e s t

supporters,           initially,             they a p p e a r e d     to be under           the     impression           that

the    s i t u a t i o n had been            caused     by m i s b e h a v i o u r    of fans and           for    the

following          few minu t e s          there was a degree                of a n i m o s i t y    by these

supporters          that      the game           should     be held         up by the actions               of the

Liverpool          s u p p o r t e r s.     Prior      to e n t ering        the     stand     I was       not    in

contact w i t h a Po l i c e               radio,      although a gateman                 had said         to me        that

he had heard that a gate                         had been bro k e n at L e p p i n a s              Ln end.         I

re m ained        in the p o u t h S t a n d         for at        least a n o t h e r      ten m i n u t e s     du r i n g

w h i c h time       I saw a        large        number     of o f f i c e r s     come     on to the           pitch,

ini t i a l l y    lining up down the                  length        of the      pitch       in front       of    the

N o r t h S t a n d and then mo v i n g              in a      line ac r o s s        the    c en t r e of       the

pitch.        By this         time        X could see several                supporters           were     using

advertising           h o ardings          as    stretchers          and    I could see several                  people

being     given       first aid            on the      pitch.

At a p p r o x i m a t e l y ff.30 pm            (1530)     myself        an d PC H U D S O N       left    the    stand

          and mad e        our way on to the              bar area w h e r e a number                of N o t t i n g h a m

          Forest       suppo r t e r s were         leaving      the ground.           We     then made        our way

          a long     the    rear of the S o u t h stand               to the      rear       of the L e p p i n g s     Ln

          end.      Alongside             the   railings      b o rdering       the   river at that L o c ation,                   I

          could see a p p r o x i m a t l e y          twelve    peo pi e a p p a r e n t l y    d e a d , with      their

          faces      covered.             I then went       to the are a         i m m e d i a t e l y to the      rear       of

          standing,         a l t h o u g h a number        of the     supporters            were    uncooperative             with

         Police       requests and were                vociferous        in their        c o n d e m n a t i o n of P o l i c e

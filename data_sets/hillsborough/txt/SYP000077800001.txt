t h at     many     fans       haljk^trrived w i t h o u t              tickets          and        were       walking         around

saying         " An y    spares         mate?"




Soon       the     flow     of      fans      began       to    reverse           itself        till          there      were    more

leaving          the     ground         then were          heading           for       it.

The     Fox appeared            to    be a m e e t i n g        p o in t    for m a n y       groups     of    fans.

Whenever          possible          fans    were       advised        to    go    to    the    ground      early and

those       without        tickets         not    to a p p r o a c h       the    ground.           This      advice        wa s

not     taken      by a n y     t h at     I can       recall.




Numbers         arriving        were       increasing,              many    drinking          and   carrying        a supply

Several          coaches       arriving          which       ha d    been    directed          to H a l i f a x    Rd     to

of     this      group were          drinking,          but     there       were       some    without        tickets          as

they were          asking       for      any     spares       as     they    p as se d .

We    s et     off      for L e p p i n g s        Ln     turnstile          in a       hur r y.         On arrival               there

    We    carried           him    to a         clear          spot     immediately               behind       the     goal       net,       the

    was      a major         disaster             and many were                   dead     or     seriusly         in j u r e d .

                 i nj u r e d .      Many     in a       state       of    shock,          many       trying       to    find       best     friends.

                Fire      Service          personnel           appeared             on    the    terracing          and ambulancemen.

                Small        groups        of L i v e r p o o l      fans       were       sti ll      causing          problems        for P o l i c e ,

                 by     now someone           had       begun       to    clear          bodies       and    injured          from     the       pitch

                using        makeshift          stretchers               from advert             hoardings.

                On      each      return      to L e p p i n g s         Ln terrace             conf us io n was           stil l      apparent,          no

  j - V °        senior        officer        had a p p e a r e d         to    t ak e     control.           I s a w at         lea st      3

                 Inspectors           all     as    c o n f u s e d as         we    w e r e as       to w h a t    wa s      happening          next.




                By      n o w the a r e a       had      been       cleared          of    b od i es ,      only    those        who    were

                shocked and            searching            for      lost       friends          and     relatives            remained.

                Liverpool            fans     were       s t i ll    causing             problems        on the         terracing,           missiles

                must      h a ve     been     thrown.          PC R O B I N S O N         f r o m B e n t l e y was            hit on the b ac k of

                 the     head      by a n     unknown          object,          probably a             coin.



                During         all    this      I heard 3 PA announcements                               -- 1.      Early        on a n a p p e a l

                 fo r    calm.        2.    Kenny DALGLISH.                     3.       Late    on    to    can c el          the game.          T h e n at

                 last     we      got a n     order       f r o m S u p t.          to    fall    back a nd         form a          line     then

                 gently        usher       everyone         off      the       pitch and          terracing             out    of    the     ground.




                Met      up w i t h    other        officers             from A3 Sub D i v i s i o n               but     only      one     from my

                 serial        PC 2 0 9 1     HIGHTON.
                                                                                                                                  PAGE     7
                                                                                                                                  S2206

             By    now    it wa s      apparent       many      lives          had    been    lost     either       on the

             terracing       or at       the     turnstiles.




             I do    recall,        whilst       serial        33    on    its w a y       to L e p p i n g s     Ln,    that a

             request       was   made        over   the    r a d io       to    open a       gate and       that        request    wa s

             granted,       I believe          that     came        from       the P o l i c e   Control          and was    due    to a

             crush       outside       the    g r o u n d at L e p p i n g s         Ln.

        R e s u s c i t a t i o n was           at^rempted          by the       officer          and myself.                 I gave          hi m

        mouth       to moutlh r e s u s c i t a t i o n w h i l s t                  the    other       officer           g a ve    external

        heart       massage.               I could           see    that       the    mouth       to m o u t h       r e s u s c i t a t i o n was

        inflating             his       chest        and     carried          on for       some    five        to    te n m i n u t e s        with

        t he    other         officer.               After        that    time       there    was       no     response            to    the

        resuscitation,                    no    pulse        could       be    found       either       at     his w r i s t        or    neck a nd

        there       was       no    reaction            to    l i gh t    from       the    pupils        of    his       eyes      or    to

        touching             his    eyes        with my           fingersy/'i             therefore          could        only assume                t ha t

        th e    p e r s o n was           dead and           to    facilitate             future     identification                      I wrote

        my     collar         n u m b e r 2 5 7 6 on t h / back                 of    the    person's           rig h t       h a n d , along

        with      the        c ol l a r    number          ojr the       other       officer,       which           I cannot            remember

        at     th i s    time.




        As     I covered            the        body with           its    clothing,          I noticed money                   had       fallen

        from      one        of    the     pockets           of    the    trousers.           I replaced              this         into       the

        trousers             and    returned with                  the    other       officer        to      the     s am e    p en at         the

        rear      of     the L e p p i n g s           L n g oal.




Tofft   There,          another           person was              handed       out    of    the    p e n , through             the       gate,        to

        myself          and       the     other        officer.           This       time    I can o n l y           describe            t h at

        p e r s o n as        being a white                  male    b etween 20 and               30 years           of a g e,           I can

        offer       no       further           d e s c r i p t i o n at       this    time.        T hi s      person was               taken        o nt o

        the     p i t c h to a s p ot                very     cl ose      to w h e r e      I dealt          with     the      first

        casualty.                 Again attempts                  were    made       to    resuscitate              the    p e r s on.         I gave

        mouth       to m o u t h          resuscitation and                    the    other       officer           gave      external

        heart      massage.                This        continued          for    probably a shorter                       length         of    time

        than      the        first        casualty.               It was       obvious       that       our     efforts            were       having

        no e f f e c t .           There        was     no    signs       of a n y        pulse    or     reaction            to    the       eyes

        either          by    lig h t      or     by    being       touched.              I then abandoned any                      further

                   casualties           were,       had     been      cleared and           no    further         assistance             could        be

                   g i v e n as all          casualties           were     either        considered             dead    or w e r e       receiving

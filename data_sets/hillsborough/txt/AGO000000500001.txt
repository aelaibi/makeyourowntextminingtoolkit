 The Attorney General has asked me to examine in detail your application made under section
  13 of the Coroners Act 1988 for authority to apply to the High Court for an order directing
 a fresh inquest in relation to your son, Kevin. This is in accordance with s.l(l)(c) of the Law
 Officers Act 1944.


 May I extend my deepest sympathy at your tragic loss which has caused so much anguish.
 As a parent myself I understand only too well how you feel.


 Section 13 of the Coroners Act 1988 applies when an inquest has been held and "by reason
 o f fraud. rejection o f evidence, irregularity o f proceedings, insufficiency o f enquiry, the
 discovery o f new facts or otherwise, it is necessary or desirable in the interests ofjustice that
 another inquest should be held".


 I have given careful consideration to your application including the material submitted with
 your Memorial and the representations made in your letter. However, I regret that I have
  come to the conclusion that there is nothing in the new evidence submitted which would
 justify the authorising of any further application to the High Court for a new inquest. I have
 made my decision on the grounds that the application would have no reasonable prospect of
  establishing that it was necessary or desirable in the interests of justice for a fresh inquest to
 be held. I recognise and admire your relentless and persistent search for the truth, and I took
into account, and recognise the importance of, your wish to have the fullest possible
information about the precise circumstances of Kevin’s death.     I must, however, consider
these matters in the context of the statutory framework within which coroners are required
to work and the questions which the law requires to be answered. An application cannot be
authorised under s. 13 in the hope that further information may be elicited unless it could
possibly have a bearing on the legal issues to be considered by any further inquest.   I fear
that I have reached the conclusion that the new evidence you have submitted will not have
such a bearing on the legal issues.


I realise that this decision will be extremely disappointing to you but I can assure you that
your request has been considered with the greatest of care.

 The Attorney General has asked me to examine in detail the application made under s. 13 of
 the Coroners Act 1988 for authority to apply to the High Court for an order directing a fresh
 inquest in relation to Kevin Williams. This is in accordance with s. 1(1 )(c) of the Law
 Officers Act 1944.


  I am sorry that this decision has taken longer than I would have wished but the application
  has been thoroughly reviewed and considered in view of its importance and the
  representations made by Mr and Mrs Williams. Section 13 of the Coroners Act 1988 applies
  when an inquest has been held and "by reason offraud, rejection o f evidence, irregularity o f
 proceedings, insufficient o f enquiry, the discovery o f new facts or otherwise, it is necessary
  or desirable in the interests o f justice that another inquest should be held".


  I have considered this matter in detail and with great care but have come to the conclusion
  that there is nothing in the new evidence presented to me which would justify the authorising
  of an application to the High Court for a new inquest in the case of Kevin Williams. This
  decision has been made on the grounds that the application would have no reasonable
  prospect of establishing that it was necessary or desirable in the interests of justice for a fresh
  inquest to be held.
In making this decision I have taken into account the new and further evidence presented in
the Memorial by Mr and Mrs Williams. I can understand Mrs Williams’ wish to establish
the full facts of her son’s tragic death and have them recorded in a formal inquest. I have
considered these issues carefully but I have to consider them in the context of the statutory
framework within which coroners are required to work and the questions which must be
answered on the inquisition. I am unable to authorise an application to the High Court under
s. 13 unless it could be said, with reasonable confidence, that further information is likely to
be elicited which would have a bearing on the issues to be considered at any such further
inquest. In my opinion this is not the case in the present application.


I realise that this will be extremely disappointing to Kevin Williams’ parents but can only
assure them that I have considered this matter in detail and with the utmost sympathy.


I can only reiterate my very deepest sympathies for the Williams’ tragic loss.

In making this decision I have taken into account the new and further evidence presented in
the Memorial by Mr and Mrs Williams. I can understand Mrs Williams’ wish to establish
the full facts of her son’s tragic death and have thqm recorded in a formal inquest. I have
considered these issues carefully but I have to consider them in the context of the statutory
framework within which coroners are required to work and the questions which must be
answered on the inquisition. I am unable to authorise an application to the High Court under
s. 13 unless it could be said, with reasonable confidence, that further information is likely to
be elicited which would have a bearing on the issues to be considered at any such further
inquest. In my opinion this is not the case iry the present application.


I realise that this will be extremely disappointing to Kevin Williams’ parents but can only
assure them that I have considered this matter in detail and with the utmost sympathy.


I can only reiterate my very deepest sympathies for the Williams’ tragic loss.

              Further     to my q ue st io nn ai re which         I completed earlier           this year         I wish

               to add some       further     details.



              On entering        the ground on the match day               I first went        into P e n 4 on the

              Leppings Lane          terrace.      In this Pen         I was   crushed and had d ifficulty

               in breathing.           I was    t errified but because of the                crush    I could not

               get out of the area.              I could not        identify any       person a r o u nd me who

               was     injured or dead because          of the      crowd.     I could not         identify any

               person ar o un d me who was         injured or dead because my face was                      pushed

               against    the back      of the    person head        in front       of me,   all     I could do was

               look up towards         the sky.



               After    some    time   the   crush started to ease and               people were       climbing        out
                                                                                                                          PAGE        2
                                                                                                                          S3487

               of the       pen into       the    pitch and also              over    the fence       into    pen 5

               climbed over          the fence        into      pen 5 and walked onto the                    pitch.



               1 had entered           pen 4 with

                                 but    due      to the     crush I          had     lost      contact w ith him and did

               not    see      him a ga in until after                   the game had         been a b a n d on e d and      Iwas

               leaving         the grc5und w hen           I met him again.



               when    I got to the           pitch I rushed ar ou nd trying                    to find                but    could

               not    find him.



               I saw other          fans    placing       people         on w oo d en hoardings and they were

               being       carried across           the   p i t z jn ,       I joined       in and started       to help

               carry the       people on the h o / L r d i A i j / j f f «      I think       I helped to       carry five or

               six    people across           the    pitch arnd dropped them on the far end of the

               pitch near       to the Ko p .             At this         point the St Johns            people were

               a ssisting wit h the              injured      I think that the               people    I helped       carry

               I think       it was about           twenty to four            time     (1540)     by now and all          the

               dead and injured had been                    cleared from the                pitch.      The    pens 3 and 4

               were almost          clear     by now and I spotted my friends who                            I had t ravelled

               be with them.               These     friends were

not    involved     in the    crush       in Leppings Lane.



After meeting my friends we all                    left   the ground of our own accord,             we

did not go out         the tunnel         at the    rear of the Leppi ng s Lane          terrace       but

a ro u nd   the side    of the stand where we met                                   .     He told me

that    he had been      pulled up into the West S tand and was                 not      injured.



We made      our way back      to our       car and made      our way home,     stopping      on the

way to      phone   home.



On the next day         I realised that            I had s c rap              n on my      left shin

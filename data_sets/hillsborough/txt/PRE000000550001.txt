   could hardly be classed as a heavyweight.
        That is, until you see the picture quality.
        This machine, features our unique Super DA-8 head
   system. Using two sets of 4 video heads it produces
   unsurpassed picture quality in standard play and long play
  recording and playback.
        Where most systems can only manage 250 lines of
  horizontal      resolution,        the       GR-S77      provides   up   to
  400       lines on playback
  in S-VHS mode.
                                                                                                                              /

      You can also transferfrom S-VHS to VHS and getthe best
possible VHS recording. (As you might expectfrom the people
who invented VHS, you can use your normal VHS-C tapes in
this machine as well.)

     While to get closer to those all-important details there's
an 8 x zoom lens with a 2-speed power control and a macro
position.

     Although the visual images may take your breath away,
you'll not be lost for words. The JVC GR-S77 has a 3 page
digital superimposer so you can create your own titles or
graphics in any of 8 colours.

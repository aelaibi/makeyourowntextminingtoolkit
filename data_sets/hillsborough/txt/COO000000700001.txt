FOOTBALL SPECTATORS BILL

I am writing to record the outcome of today's meeting a t which the Lord President
discussed with the Home Secretary, the Secretary of S tate for the Environment, the
Lord Privy Seal, the Chief Whip, the Captain of the G entiemen-at-Arm s, the Minister
for Housing and the Minister for Sport, whether any action should be taken following the
Home S e c re tary 's meeting with Lord Ju stice Taylor recorded in your le tt e r of 26 April
to Alan Ring.

It was decided that, as the timing of any reports or interim recommendations from Lord
Justice Taylor was uncertain while the inquiry was a t such a preliminary stage, nothing
needed to be done for 2 or 3 weeks, a fte r which the Home Secretary should m eet Lord
Justice Taylor again. In the meantime th ere should be no public references to the
timing of Lord Justice Taylor's recommendations.

I am copying this le tte r to the Private Secretaries of those present, to Andrew Turnbull
and to Trevor Woolley.

                     On Saturday 15 April         1989 (130489)      I went to the FA Cup Semi Final

                                              He is on the phone but I obv not know it.

                     We travelled fr        Manchester to Sheffield by t r a i m         Je arrived at

                     Sheffield at about 1 5 ^ 3 ^ hrs <1235).            We we re put on a bus by the

                     Police and taken to the gr ou n d.            We then went to the chip shop and

                     walked around for aboutx^-3 minutes.                I did not see many people

                     drinking in the streets.            l\id

not much of\a queue          and we     more or less went straight        in, We went     in

through the t u r ^ g t ^ es and I handeeNjjiy ticket in.           I did not see

anyone      climbing over the walls to get i\ and I did not see any of the

big gates open.       There were some Police O f r s            by the turnstiles and

I was searched but         it seemed to be low profile        policing.     I do not

remember seeing any stewards outside.

Once inside the ground I saw a sign for section B which was over the

tun ne 1.     I had been     to the    ground on a number of occasions previously

and I knew I had to          go down    the tunnel.   I did not see any Police

Officers or stewards by the entrance to the tunnel.                    I did not see any

drurvks inside the ground and I did not see anyone fighting.

I w ent dowTt-'4jie tunnel,       I did not have any problems going down it

A>^tjough it struck me as being very narrow,

I went irfio Pen 4.         It was a bit packed by. the tunnel erH^tance but
                                                                                    Pm U

pushed forward.       I could not do anything about           it.    The pressure was

getting worse as I was being pushed forward.                 I did not see anything

of the game alttHLugh I did know that it had started because of the

reaction of the crowcfx.         I was pushed forward until         I was almost down

to the f r ont fe n c e .    I ha\seen      people climbing over the fence onto

the pitch.         had become separated from                  When I was near the

fence at the front          I was going to try and get out over the fence.                I

grabbed hold of the fence to try and pull myself up but my legs were

caught and I could not move them.              1 turned around a bit to ask

someone to help me up.           As I    looked to my left I saw people being

crushed and asking for help.              I saw a white male a couple of feet away

from me.       I thought he was dead when I looked at him.               He was very

    pale and his face was expressionless.                         He did not seem to be

    breathing.         I would say he was in his late g Q ’s or early 3 0 ’s I can

wy- not   remember          anything else about him.           As I looked around to my right

    I saw in the            crowd a white        male about      late 40' s to early 50* s . He

^   again looked as the other one did expressionless and not breathing,                                              he

    was about a yard away from me.                       At that time           I thought that at least

    two people had died.                     ^

    I eventually managed to lever m^-ske IV out of the crush and up over the

    fence and on            to the pitch.I walked slowly towards the corner of the

    pitch by Pen            7.   The   players were just going off at this time.                              1 sat

    down by the corner.                I was exhausted and shocked.                        A Police Officer

p   came over to me to see if I was alright.                                 He was rubbi ng my ba c k .

    Then 2 friends of mine who were                      in the North Stand saw me came down to

    where I was and took me into the stand with them.

    I sat in the stand for about                  10 minutes until               I felt a bit better then

    I went down on to the pitch to see if 1 could find                                            ,   As I was

    getting to the pitch I could see him walking about.                                         I went over to

    him and brought him back over to the stand and we sat down on the

    gravel     path by the front of the stand.                       He sat there for about 20

    minutes.       During this time           I could see people being carried off on

    stretchers and advertising hoardings.                         They were being taken down to

    the other end of the ground.                     I knew that there were dead people being

    ca r r ie d a w a y .                                                                   X

    We then got up and went into the stand and out of the g r o u n d .                                      We

    caught the bus back to the station.                       It would be about 3.40 pm (1540)

    when we ler'Kthe ground.

    I was not p h y s i c ^ l y        iijp-u^ed.-       I did not go to the doctors or to

    hospi tal

    I think that a factor               in the deaths and injuries that were                           caused was
                                       A             c          4                                        .
    the slow reaction of the Police and\tr)er emergency services to the

         tragedy that was happenri           I also think that the narrowness of the

         tunnel and the area outside >%he turnstiles also where a contributory

         cause of death and injuries.        Another factor   is the size and shape of

         the front fence which hinders people trying to get over it.            Also the

         lack of exit gates was another       contributory factor.    Also the lack of

         cutting equipment needed to open the fence.

         I did not witness anything     I consider to be a criminal offence.

         While    I was sitting by the North Stand a Police Officer said to me,

         "I t’s no use going in there.       You will all have to go back where you

         came f r o m . I   thought under the circumstances that this was a bit of

         an insensitive vh^ng to say.

         The Liverpool fans shotted pave had a larger allocation of tickets and

         been given the     larger Hop end of the ground.

         It seemed to be a long time before the first ambulance          came on to the

         pitch.     By rfci-at time the fans had taken their own initiative and were

         carrying people ^hff on the advertising hoardings,          There was a general

         disorganisation with all the emergency services.

HILLSBOROUGH FOOTBALL DISASTER - TONY EDWARDS

 ve spoke briefly over the telephone about a letter which Lord Justice Stuart-Smith has
received from Tony Edwards, who was at the time of the Hillsborough disaster an
ambulanceman with the South Yorkshire Ambulance Service. I attach a copy.

2.      Mr Edwards was in an ambulance which drove onto the pitch at about 1535 on the
afternoon of the disaster. He maintains, in effect, that information about this was suppressed
at the inquest on Kevin Williams in order to discredit Mr Bruder, an off-duty Liverpool PC
who was trying to resuscitate him (Kevin Williams) at that time and mentioned the
ambulance in his statement. The thesis, advanced as you know in the Cook Report, is that Mr
Binder’s evidence contradicted the Coroner’s assertion that everybody who died was dead by
1515. (In fact the Coroner made no such assertion).

3.     There is nothing new to us in Mr Edwards’s letter except for what he says about the
role of Inspectors Layton and Sawers. He says that they were well aware of the timing of
his ambulance, but that despite this they did not mention it when talking to PC Bruder at a
meeting at his home or when giving evidence at the Inquest.

4.      We would be grateful for any comment that Mr Layton or Mr Sawers might have on
this. In particular, did they go to see Mr Edwards as described in this letter? Did they show
him timed videos of his ambulance? Why was the ambulance not mentioned when Mr
Sawers gave evidence at the Inquest?

 5.     I look forward to hearing from you (and/or Mr Layton and Mr Sawers). If either or
 both of them would like to meet Lord Justice Stuart-Smith to discuss this, perhaps you could
 let me know.

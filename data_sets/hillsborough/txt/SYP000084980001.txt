a young          man who           I would       s a y was        between          25 and 30 years                      of age.          He

was     lyin g      with       his    back       down      onto      t h is      pile       of    bodies           facing       upwards

and aga in without                   even       having       to    touch         the    man       or      try      to a s s i s t      him,

knew     he was          dead.        At    t his      stage       the       only      thought            t h at    came      into       my

After       some     time,       I heard          it    announced             o ve r       the       tanoy          that     the     match

situation          was     very       frightening             to    say       the       least,            because          at     t h at     stage

I anticipated              that       the     Liverpool            f a ns      in the           stands             above     would         xn v a a e

the    match       would        be    abandoned             the    c r ow d       seemed            to    leav e       with       little        or

I would          estimate        that        this      time       it was          approximately                     4,30    to 5 . 0 0        p.m..

After       some     t im e we        were      instructed              to    return            back          to    our    positions            on

asking       what        had    happened         and        what    to       do    regarding                  friends       and

            beer     and      were       obviously            now    very       dr un k .        In fact,         it     I remember

            correctly             these     youths          were     in f a ct       playing         c a rd s    and     drinking.            I

            arrived          at    our     pre--match          positions           and      basically           controlled         the    flow

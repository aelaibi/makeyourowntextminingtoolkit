 TRAGEDY SHOULD HAVE BEEN MADE CLEAR.

 2)     THE FIRE BRIGADE P E R F U M E D WELL.

 3)     THE POLICE AND THE AMBULAfoCEBERVICES DID N’T SEEM TO GRASP WHAT HAD

 HAPPENED.         MANY OF THEM APPEARED TO BE UNAWARE THAT PEOPLE HAD DIED.

 IS THERE ANYTHING THAT YQU WISH TO ADD WHICH YOU FEEL IS VITAL TO THIS

 JUDICIAL INQUIRY?

 I ATTENDED THE SAME MATCH LAST Y£l*R, WHEN POLICE CONTROL OUTSIDE THE GROUND

 WAS MUCH STRICTER.         CARS HAD BEEN SEARCHED FOR ALCOHOL AND THERE WAS A POLICE

 CORDON AROUND THE GROUND, THROUGH WHICH ONLY TICKET HOLDERS WERE ALLOWED

 T^pPASS.

 I HAVE HEARD THAT MANY LIVERPOOL SUPPORTERS DID NOT HAVE TICKETS.           I ONLY

 HEARD ONE SUPPORTER ASKING FOR A TICKET.           MY IMPRESSION WAS THAT MOST

 PEOPLE DID HAVE TICKETS.

 THIS YEAR THE MOUNTED POLICE WERE IN THE AREA BETWEEN THE TURNSTILES AND THE

 TURNSTILE GATE.         I THOUGHT ^REY WERE INEFFECTIVE THERE SHOULD HAVE BEEN

 OUTSIDE THE GATES.                      x      ,
                                            A-    C£iT7a5&5'
 J.HE FA WERE WRONG TO ALLOCATE THE Wf^ST |STAND TO LIVERPOOL SUPPORTERS, THE

 MAJORITY OF WHOM LIKE TO STAND.          NOTTINGHAM FOREST FANS PREFER TO SIT.      I

 D O N ’T SEE WHY IT COULD NOT HAVE BEEN ARRANGED FOR LIVERPOOL SUPPORTERS TO TAKE

 tI    P s PION KOP.    I DON'T SEE THAT IT WOULD HAVE CAUSED PROBLEMS OUTSIDE THE

 GROUND.         I FOUND IT HARD TO ACCEPT THAT THERE WERE ONLY SEVEN TURNSTILES

 SERVING THE WEST STAND STANDING AREA.           I WAS THAT SURPRISED I ACTUALLY

 COUNTED THEM.         THEY ARE ALL BUNCHED CLOSE TOGETHER AND THIS LEADS TO A

 "FUNNELLING" EFFECT, WHICH IS DANGEROUS.

 ALTHOUGH THE CRUSH OUTSIDE THE GROUND WAS BAD,          I HAVE BEEN IN FAR WORSE,

 PARTICULARLY AT WEMBLY, WHERE I THINK THERE COULD ALSO BE DEATHS OUTSIDE THE

 GROUND.         I WOULD LIKE TO SEE THE PROBLEM ERADICATED COMPLETELY

 IS THERE ANYTHING THAT YOU WISH TO ADD WHICH YOU FEEL IS VITAL TO THIS

 JUDICIAL INQUIRY?

 1)    I FEEL THAT LIVERPOOL FANS WERE ALLOCATED THE WRONG END OF THE GROUND -

 ESPECIALLY AS LIVERPOOL F.C. HAVE A FAR HIGHER AVERAGE GATE.

       THE ORGANISATION BY SHEFFIELD WEDNESDAY WAS NOT             SUFFICIENT -THE

 LABELLING OF TURNSTILES AND GANGWAYS WAS UNCLEAR.

 3)    THERE WERE TOO MANY POLICE POSTED AWAY FROM THE             GROUND AND NOT AT THE

 ENTRANCE.

DID YOU WITNESS ANY CROWD CRUSH?

YES, PEOPLE WERE LIKE SARDINES IN THE MIDDLE TWO PENS AND THE

OTHER PENS WERE EMPTY.

Q44

WERE YOU INVOLVED IN ANY CROWD CRUSH,        IF SO CAN YOU SAY

WHAT TIME THIS         HAPPENED?

NO,    I W A S N ’T INVOLVED, BUT I COULD SEE IT WAS OVERPACKED IN

PENS 3 & 4 FROM 5 TO 3 (1455)

Q45

DID YOU WITNESS ANY CROWD SURGED IF SO, DO YOU KNOW WHAT

      lSED   IT? (BRIEFLY)

YES,     I SAW THE SURGE A COj/PLE OF TIMES IN THE PENS BUT I D O N ’T

KNOW WHAT CAUSED IT




Q46

WERE YOU INJURED,        IF SO DID YOU ATTEND HOSPITAL IN

SHEFFIELD?

NO

G47

       YOU WITNESS ANY DEATHS?

YES,    I SAW A MAN LYING ON THE PITCH WITH A POLICEMAN AND A FAN

PUMPING HIS CHEST, THEN THEY LEFT        HIM AND YOU COULD TELL HE

WAS DEAD



DID YOU ASSIST ANYONE WHO WAS DEAEy OR INJURED

BRIEFLY EXPLAIN

 DID YOU WITNESS ANYTHING THAT YOU CONSIDER WAS A FACTOR

 IN THE DEATHS OR INJURIES TO ANY PERSON?

 YES. THE WAY IT TOOK SO LONG FOR THE POLIC     TO jjiH-ACT, THEY JUST

 STOOD THERE LOOKING,     AND EVEN AFTER IT HA BENED THEY WERE STILL

 WALKING ABOUT NOT HELPING.

 GSO

 WHAT TIME DID YOU LEAVE THE FOOTBALL GROUND?

 1603/1610 HRS

 Q51

 DID YOU LEAVE ON THE DIRECTION OF EITHER A POLICE OFF ICER, A

       WARD, A LOUD SPEAKER ANNOUNCEMENT OR OF YOUR OWN

 ACCORD?

 OF MY OWN ACCORD TO LOOK FOR MY SISTER.


Q15

 GS2

 DID YOU WITNESS ANYTHING THAT YOU CONSIDER TO BE A

 CRIMINAL OFFENCE?

 NO

 Q53

 Dj^YOU HAVE ANY VIEWS OR OBSERVATIONS ON THE WAY THE

 INCIDENT WAS HANDLED, AFTER THE MATCH WAS STOPPED?

 IT TOOK A LONG TIME FOR ANYONE TO DO ANYTHING CONSTRUCTIVE

 TO HELP THE INJURED AND THE DEAD.    IT WAS ALSO VERY

 INADEGUATLY ORGANISED WITH REGARD TO MEDICAL AID.

 ALSO I THINK SOME OF THE POLICE WHO WERE THERE DIDN’T KNOW

 THE AREA AT ALL AND COULDN’T TELL ME HOW TO GET TO ANOTHER

 PART OF THE GROUND TO FIND MY SISTER.

 IS THERE ANYTHING THAT YOU WISH TO ADD WHICH      YOU FEEL IS

 VITAL TO THIS JUDICIAL INQUIRY?

 I NEVER SAW ANY DRUNKENESS THAT HAS BEEN REPORTED, EVERYONE

 WAS JUST HAPPY BECAUSE IT WAS A SEMI-FINAL AND UNTIL THE

 TRAGEDY EVERYONE WAS VERY HAPPY.     I THINK TO PREVENT THE TRAGEDY

 THERE SHOULD HAVE BEEN A FILTERING SYSTEM INTO THE TURNSTILES

 AND WE SHOULD NEVER HAVE BEEN GIVEN THE WEST      END FORALL THE

 SUPPORTERS WE HAVE, THAT GOES FOR ALL TEAMS.

 055

 DID YOU GO TO THE MATCH LAST YEAR,

 Y^|.

 I WOULD LIKE TO ADD IF ALL THE PEOPLE TRYING TO GET IN HAD HAD I.D CARDS

 WE WOULD NEVER HAVE GOT IN, SO I THINK THE Y ’RE A VERY BAD IDEA.

 HAD THEY HAD MORE POLICE OUTSIDE BY THE TURNSTILES & MAIN GATES INSTEAD

 OF' THEM ALL BEING INSIDE IT WOULD NOT HAVf?HAPPENED.     O tT     /V£yiC.(gJ^ v g _

 DO YOU HAVE ANY VIEWS OR OSBhRVA IIONS ON iHt WAY   iHfc. J.NC J.DEN i WAS

 HANDLED, AFTER THE MATCH WAS STOPPED?

 ONLY THAT IF THEY COULD HAVE GOT THE FENCES DOWN QUICKER, THEY WOULD HAVE

 SAVED MORE PEOPLE,

 Q54

 IS THERE ANYTHING THAT YOU WISH TO ADD WHICH YOU FEEL IS VITAL TO THIS

 JUDICIAL INQUIRY?

 IN MY OPINION, THERE WEREN'T THAT MANY FANS WITHOUT TICKETS.         ONCE I GOT NEAR

 TO THE GROUND, PEOPLE STOPPED ASKING FOR SPARE TICKETS.         THERE WEREN’T

 ENOUGH POLICE OR STEWARDS, OUTSIDE THE GROUND, LAST YEAR THERE WERE POLICE

 TRYING TO GET O U T , I SAW ONE POLICEMAN PUSHING \ F A N ^ACK INSIDE INSTEAD OF

 ALLOWING HIM TO STAY ON THE PITCH.      I THINK THIS WKS WRONG IN VIEW OF WHAT WAS

 H^ENING,                                                               f\,

 Q54

 IS

 JUDICIAL INQUIRY?

 I BELIEVE THE MATCH WAS BADLY ORGANISEX BOTH INSIDE AND OUTSIDE THE GROUND,

 I HAVE BEEN TO THE SAME GROUND ABOUT 5 TlMfeS AND THE FANS ALWAYS GO DOWN THE

 TUNNEL AND PACK THE TWO CENTRE SECTIONS OF THE TERRACING.       THERE ARE NO SIGNS

 DIRECTING FANS TO EITHi^R LEFT OR RIGHT OF THE TUNNEL SO PEOPLE AUTOMATICALLY

G Q D O W N THE TUNNEL.   I *Vt'^LWAYS BEEN IN THE TERRACING BEHIND THE GOAL BUT

 THIS YEAR I DECIDED TO GO IN THE STANDS FOR COMFORT AND SAFETY.

 I ALSO BLAME THE    FOOTBALL ASSOCIATION FOR NOT GIVING THE LIVERPOOL FANS THE

PROPER— AMOUNT OF    TICKET
                        -   ALLOCATION^.\ 1\ ALSO QUESTION THE DECISION TO PUT   THE

LIVERPOOL FANS IN THE SMALLER END OF      THE GROUND WHEN IT WAS OBVIOUS TO

EVERYONE IN FOOTBALL THAT FAR MORE PEOPLE ATTEND LIVERPOOL MATCHES THAN

NOTTINGHAM FOREST.

 I BELIEVE SOMETHING SHOULD HAVE BEEN ARRANGED BETWEEN THE POLICE AND

SHEFFIELD WEDNESDAY AUTHORITIES TO ALLOCATE LIVERPOOL THE LARGER SECTION AT
                                                                     PAGE

 (343

 DID YOU WITNESS ANY CROWD CRUSH?

 YES I SAW A CROWD CRUSH TO MY RIGHT AND BELOW IN PENS 3 AND 4 BUT YOU COULD

 ACTUALLY SEE A P E N , AS SUCH .   JUST A MASS OF PEOPLE.

 (344

 WERE YOU INVOLVED IN ANY CROWD CRUSH,       IF SO, CAN YOU SAY WHAT TIME

 THIS HAPPENED?

 NO.

 hc4!3

 D0f YOU     WITNESS ANY CROWD SURGE,   IF SO, DO YOU KNOW WHAT CAUSED IT?

 (BRIEFLY)

 NO.




 (34t>

 WERE YOU INJURED,     IF SO, DID YOU ATTEND HOSPITAL IN SHEFFIELD?

 NO.

 Q47

 DID YOU WITNESS ANY DEATHS?

 N0      CLOSE TO ME BUT I SAW PEOPLE WHO APPARENTLY HAD DIED ON THE PITCH

 AND PEOPLE BEING PASSED OVER THE BARRIERS FROM THE PENS TO THE PITCH.

 (348

 DID YOU ASSIST ANYONE WHO WAS DEAD OR INJURED,       IF SO, BRIEFLY EXPLAIN.

 NO, BUT I WASN'T IN A POSITION TO DO SO ANYWAY.


Q17




 DID YOU WITNESS ANYTHING THAT YOU CONSIDER WAS A FACTOR IN THE DEATHS,

 OR THE INJURIES TO ANY PERSON?

WITHOUT ANY DOUBT IN MY MIND, THAT SECOND OCCASION, WHEN THE GATE WAS
 CAME THROUGH , JUST LIKE.’ c a t t l e ? WHICH ONLY ADDED TO IHE CRUSH IN THE PENS.

 330

 WHAI   IIME DID YOU LEAVE iHE r 00BALL. GROUND?

 ABOUT 4„30„

 GS1

 DID YOU LEAVE ON THE DIRECTION OF EITHER A POLICE OFFICER, A STEWARD, A LOUD

 SPEAKER ANNOUNCEMENT OR OF YOUR OWN ACCORD?

 LEFT ON OUR OWN ACCORD.


<318

 0 0

 DID YOU WITNESS ANYTHING THAT YOU CONSIDER TO BE A CRIMINAL OFFENCE?

 THE ONLY THING I SAW WAS CAMERA MEN, PHOTOGRAPHING THE BODIES, AND

 SUPPORTERS BEGAN HITTING THEM TO STOP THEM, BUT NOTHING ACTUALLY CRIMINAL.

 Q33

 DO YOU HAVE ANY VIEWS OR OBSERVATIONS ON THE WAY THE INCIDENT WAS HANDLED,

 AFTER THE MATCH WAS STOPPED?

 THERE HAD BEEN SOME TAUNTING BY THE NOTTS FANS AND THE POLICE FORMED A LINE

 ACROSS THE PITCH, BUT EVEN SO, THEY SHOULD HAVE BEEN HELPING OUT WITH

 F^p^LE TRYING TO GET OUT AND GIVING MOUTH TO MOUTH.        THERE WERE BODIES ON

 THE PITCH AND THE POLICE WERE STILL PUSHING PEOPLE BACK IN THE PENS AS

 THEY WERE TRYING TO GET O U T „   I DON'T THINK EVEN THEN THAT THEY REALISED

 WHAT WAS HAPPENING BUT iHERE SHOULD HAVE BEEN Bfc.I iEIR COMMUNlCAi ION.


Q 19

 034

 IS THERE ANYTHING THAT YOU WISH TO ADD WHICH YOU FEEL IS VITAL TO THIS

 JUDICIAL INQUIRY?

 AFTER THAT GATE HAD BEEN OPENED THE FIRST TIME AND SHUT AGAIN,         I SAW WHAT

 WAS OBVIOUSLY AN ARGUMENT BETWEEN A STEWARD AND SOME POLICE OFFICERS.
                                                                          PAGE    9
                                                                          GSL246 7

THEN A POLICEMAN OPENED THE GATES AND THAT IS WHEN THEY ALL POURED IN.

I WOULD SAY TO RELIEVE THE PRESSURE OF THE CROWD OUTSIDE THE TURNSTILES,

BUT IT DEFINITELY CONTRIBUTED TO THE CRUSH IN THE PENS WHERE THE PEOPLE

DIED-   I SAY THIS MAN WAS A STEWARD BECAUSE TO THE BEST OF MY MEMORY HE WAS

WEARING A STEWARD’S YELLOW BIB OR JACKET.

 To: The Inspector, Hilsboro’ Inquiry:


Sir
                 HILLSBORO* FOOTBALL INQUIRY


As a trained and experienced radio officer and operator,
and a member of RAYNET~(Radio Amateur Emergency Network)
it seems very pertinent to ask of the competent officer
responsible for emergency communication and crowd control
the following questions:

1. Were police radios ’netted1 to a radior control room,
either in the police station or room at the football
grund ? Was tt$pre a controller of the police radio system ?
Ii not, what on earth are police radios for on these
occasions ?

2. What use was made of the closed-circuit-television
facilities provided at the ground and shown on T.V. ?
Why was there (because apparently there was not) no
crowd control/safety officer, talking to the crowd (and
where, necessary, the police)
                                    aJr'
It was apparent from news reports        the time, and T.V.
pictures I have seen on national TV, that an officer,*versed
in ele>ptary psychology and applying it in speaking to the
crowd, could have prevented or at the very least, greatly
reduced casualties.

3. Why was there no trained, competent and effective P. A-
announcer on duty ?

These are not intended as carping questions. I have had some
experience during the war, both in Europe and India in crowd
control and the fact that no thing?'of .this “nature was in existence
in this incident was deplorable to the extent of being criminal.
I hope this letters may be helpful.

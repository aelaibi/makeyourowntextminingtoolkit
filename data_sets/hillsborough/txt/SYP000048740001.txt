Dear


HILLSBOROUGH INQUEST


On behalf of H M Coroner, Doctor POPPER, I would like to thank you for your
letter of 10th January, 1991.

I understand the extreme emotional effect the tragedy at Hillsborough must have
had upon you, and your reason for not wishing to disclose your experience at the
match until now.

I have discussed the contents of your letter with Doctor POPPER, and he is of the
opinion that you will not be required to give evidence at the Inquest.  His
decision was based on the fact that numerous witnesses have already given similar
evidence.

Thank you for your assistance in this Inquiry.

Yours sincerely,




S. BEECHEY
Detective Superintendent

                                                   Cheshire

Dear Sir/Madam

I write with regard to the Hillsborough Stadium disaster in Sheffield on April
15th 1989.


Recently I have been reading reports of the enquiry in the Liverpool Echo and
I have begun to have guilty feelings about this as I attended the match and I
have never disclosed my story to anyone.


At the time and as now I was a Season Ticket Holder for the Spion Kop, under
the terms of the ticket allocation I was granted one terrace ticket for the
Leppings Lane Terrace, Entrance D.


I travelled to the match with a friend on a Barnes Travel Standard Coach from
Priory Road in Anfield.   As you probably know the coaches assembled in
Sheffield on an industrial estate near the railway bridge.


On the day of the match I was decked out in a Liverpool Scarf and a Liverpool
shirt.


Upon leaving the coach we proceeded back down the road from whence we came and
for the first time the ground come into sight.


As previously advertised the Liverpool coaches would park nearest to their end
of the ground, so me and my friend progressed to the nearest end of the
ground.
The time was now about 1.50 pm.   As we proceeded down towards the ground we
come to a roundabout and not knowing where to go we proceeded down the dual
carriageway (which I later found out was Penistone Road).


We proceeded   down the road past many constables and arrived atthe ground       only
to find that   this was the Kop end of Hillsborough.


On arrival at this end and realising we could be in considerable danger being
surrounded by Nottingham fans and wearing full Liverpool colours I decided to
ask a policeman for directions to the Leppings Lane end.


He told me to cut through one of the side streets.     I tried this and was
stopped on all the side streets by policemen and barriers.     At no time did
they question why we were in the Nottingham Forest area.


We then proceeded back to the roundabout and were redirected by a road sign
previously hidden by people.


On arrival at the Leppings Lane terrace we entered through Gate D, the person
in front of me was searched before and after entering the ground.      Also my
friend was searched before entering which delayed our passage inside.


When inside I noticed that whatever gate you entered through, access to the
middle tunnel was possible.    After a short stop at a lavatory we proceeded
through the tunnel to the lefthand pen behind the goal.


We proceeded   down the steps to the front fence walked ten yards across   and
then proceeded back until about 20 foot away from the rear wall and ten foot
in from the tunnel.   The time was now 2.15 pm and the terrace was also about
3/4 full.


As time passed the pressure built up and as we were positioned in front of a
crush barrier we were forced back against it.
The rest of the events are known to you,   except that I left the ground shortly
before 5 pm and returned to the coach.


All I sustained through this tragedy was   a bruised back   and sore right arm
which become trapped between two people in front of me,     the pressure was that
great.


I know it has taken a long time to reveal this but as you might understand the
emotional effects are still there and only now am I coming to terms with it.


I will never forget the screams for help and the screams of agony nor will I
forget the dead bodies on the pitch less than 20 foot in front of me, knowing
that I couldn't do anything.


I hope this information is helpful and I would be grateful if you could pass
this on to the appropriate authorities in Sheffield.


If necessary don't hesitate to contact me for more information.


Yours faithfully

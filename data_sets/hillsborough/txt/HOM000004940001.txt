Dear Mr. Taylor,

I refer to our meeting on the 10th May and thank you most
sincerely for agreeing to meet Tony and myself.   I promised to
let you have a note of outstanding points which you could take
up with your colleagues and I hope the following will be
helpful.

1.   Bournemouth v Leeds

     I told you that we were having a meeting with the
     Association of Chief Police Officers.    That has now been
     held and criteria agreed for the preparation of the Fixture
     List for 1990/91 and a modus operandi for dealing with
     police requests for changes of fixtures.    What we agreed
     around the table needed to go to the appropriate ACPO
     committee and as soon as I have confirmation from them I
     will be writing to the Home Secretary.    I will see that
     you get a copy.

2.   Football Licensing Authority

     I confirm that we are keen to see the Football Licensing
     Authority set up as soon as possible so that we can begin
     discussions on how the F.L.A. is going to work and how it
     is going to exercise its discretion in implementing the
     Taylor recommendations.   We need to have some
     clarification quickly since some clubs are anxious to get
     on during this closed season with some of the work and we
     are anxious that it should not prove to be abortive once

      the F.L.A. has got down to determining its own criteria.
      If the Taylor timetable is adhered to strictly and
      capacities are reduced in order to comply with the
      recommendations of the Taylor Report without any timetable
      flexibility, there would be,in the short term, more sell­
      out matches and people without tickets would create
      problems outside the grounds.   We  would prefer each club
      to be able to submit their own realistic timetable for
      i mp r o ve m e n t s .

3.    Ticket Touts

      If all of our e f f o r t s r e g a r d i n g all ticket m a t c h e s and
      s e g r e g a t i o n are to have any chance of b eing achi ev ed , then
      the tic ke t touts nee d to be banned.              We w o u l d hope that
      y o u w o u l d be able to take this on b oard fa i r l y quickly.

4.    Government Steering Group

      It w o u l d be m o s t h e l p f u l if an i n f o r m a l S t e e r i n g G r o u p

•     c o u l d be esta b l i s h e d , i n c l u d i n g o f f i c i a l s f r o m all the
      d e p a r t m e n t s c o n c e r n e d for the i m p l e m e n t a t i o n of the Tay l o r
      Report.             I see the se p r i m a r i l y as bei ng Hom e Office,
      D e p a r t m e n t of the E n v i r o n m e n t and T r easury.             It w o u l d
      c e r t a i n l y save me time in not h a v i n g to tell the same story
      seve ra l times over but mor e imp o r t a n t l y , I t hink it w o u l d
      h e l p ensur e that we get a c o n s t a n t an d lo gical a p p r o a c h in
      an area w h e r e it is onl y too e asy to have f r a g m e n t a t i o n .


If y o u c ould h elp w i t h any of the a bove m a t ters,                 I shou ld be
mo st gr ateful.

   POLICING FOOTBALL


   I have read with interest Mr Smith's note of his attendance at
   a recent police conference on Division 2 football matches.  It
    aises one or two points which are of interest to us and which

  « ave cropped up in our discussions with national sporting
    bodies.

   2.   The first is stewarding.   I think we must ensure that we
   give consistent advice on this.   My belief is that we should
   be encouraging clubs to provide fit competent stewards.
   Stewarding is a club responsibility; the police are employed
   to maintain public order.  The distinction may not always be
   clear, but the statement of intent should indicate who is
   responsible for what.  Indeed, that is its primary purpose.    I
   hope you agree.

   3.   A related point which cropped up in recent discussions
   with the Rugby League was that in some cases (Greater
   Manchester was quoted) the police, it is claimed, are
   insisting on the presence within the ground of more pol-ice
   officers than the clubs themselves consider necessary and
   requiring that they should be paid for together .with the cost
   of reserves who remain outside the ground.  There was clearly
   an element of hard Yorkshire purse-watching about this, but
   the league officials were also concerned that there is a point
   at which the presence of too many police officers can itself
   cause ill feeling in the crowd and encourage bad behaviour.    I
   am sure that you will want to take the line that the level of
   policing, even outside the ground, is a matter for local
   discretion but I do think the point should be watched.

   4.   One point which has come up from time to time is that the
   police and the fire service sometimes impose requirements on
   clubs outside the forum of the advisory group set up by the
   local authority for safety certificate purposes.  It is of
   course extremely important that any change in the physical or
   organisational arrangements at a sportsground is considered by
   all the experts concerned to ensure that it does not have
   implications for safety.  I have in mind that we should stress
   this in the Home Office Circular which will be necessary when
   we republish the Green Guide on safety in sports grounds.
5.   Do you think that there is a need for a Home Office input
to the police training courses to explain the status and
purpose of safety certificates?  I am sure that we would be
prepared to consider making such a contribution if it was
thought useful.

 NUMBER OF TOUTS.

 BUT ON SOME OCCASIONS THERE IS PROBLEMS.        IT IS BETTER WHEN THERE IS

 A HEAVY POLICE PRESENCE.

 THAT TUNNEL, THE POLICE SHOULD HA^e^REALISED THAT THE CENTRE PENS WERE FULL

 AND WHEN THEY OPENED THE GAyjjJS    PREVENTED THE FANS FROM     RUNNING DOWN THE

 T^pJEL AND DIRECTED THEM ROUND TO THE SIDES.

 THE MATCH SHOULD HAVE BEEN DELAYED TO ALLOW EVERYONE TO GET INTO THE

 GROUND WITH EASE.      LIVERPOOL SHOULD HAVE BEEN ALLOCATED THE SPION K O P ,

 BECAUSE THEY HAD THE LARGER CROWD.

 THE POLICE PRIOR TO THE MATCH PUSHED US TOWARDS THE GROUND, HURRYING US TO

 GET IN THIS ADDED TO THE DIFFICULTIES IN THE LEPPINGS LANE END.

DO YOU HAVE ANY VIEWS OR OBSERVATIONS ON THE WAY THE INCIDENT WAS,

HANDLED, AFTER THE MATCH WAS STOPPED?

MY FIRST REALISATION OF THE DISASTER, WAS WHEN I SAW A FAN Cl/I MB

OVER THE FENCING BEHIND THE GOAL, HE WAS ONE OF THE FIRST OVER THE FENCE,

AND WAS OBVIOUSLY INJURED BECAUSE HE WAS CLUTCHING HIS MIDDLE.                    A

POLICEMAN PUT HIM IN AN ARM LOCK,             I DIDN’T SEE WHAT HAPPENED TO HIM THEN

       I THOUGHT THE POLICEMAN ACTED INSENSITIVELY TOWARDS THIS MAN.                  BY NOW

MORE PEOPLE WERE CLIMBING OUT OF THE PENS AND BEIN(y LIFTED INTO THE WEST

STAND.      THERE APPEARED TO BE A LOT OF POLICE OFFICERS STANDING AROUND

DOING NOTHING,          I SAW TWO FANS GO TO THE LIVERPOOL GOAL-KEEPER (GROBBLAAR) AND

THEN HE APPROACHED A POLICE OFFICER.                   GROBBLAijlR WAS GESTURING TO THIS OFFICER

AND WAS OBVIOUSLY UPSET,            I BELIEVE AT HIS INS/IGATION A GATE WAS OPENED

TO ALLOW PEOPLE OUT.            AT THIS POINT THE P L I E R S WERE TAKEN OFF THE PITCH

AND FANS/POLICEMEN WERE TRYING TO TEAR DOWNf THE FENCING.                   THERE WAS NO

LEADERSHIP OR ORGANISATION IN THE RESPONSE^ TO THE RESCUING OF INJURED OR

DYING SUPPORTERS, FANS/POLICEMEN SEEMED TfQ BE ACTING OFF THEIR OWN

       IATIVE.         THE POLICE ORGANISATION THAT I DID SEE, WAS THAT A CORDON

OF ABOUT 100 PLUS POLICE OFFICERS MARChfED ONTO THE PITCH AND FORMED A LINE

ON THE HALFWAY POINT, THIS SEEMED TO HE TO BE A TOTAL WASTE OF POLICE

MANPOWER.

Q54

IS THERE ANYTHING THAT YOU WISH TO fhDD WHICH YOU FEEL IS VITAL TO THIS

JUDICIAL INQUIRY?

GROUND AND KNEW NOTHING OF THOSfif EVENTS OUTSIDE THE GROUND IS THAT THE LACK

OF ORGANISATION AND FfcN DISTRIBUTION IN THE LEPPINGS LN END WAS A PROBLEM

 UPSET,    I BELIEVE AT HIS INSTIGATION A GATE WAS OPENED TO ALLOW PEOPLE OUT.

 AT THIS POINT THE PLAYERS WERE TAKEN OFF THE PITCH AND FANS/POLICEMEN WERE

 TRYING TO TEAR DOWN THE FENCING.     THERE WAS NO LEADERSHIP OR ORGANISATION IN

 THE RESPONSE TO THE RESCUING OF INJURED OR DYING SUPPORTERS, FANS/POLICEMEN

 SEEMED TO BE ACTING OFF THEIR OWN INITIATIVE.     THE POLICE ORGANISATION THAT

 JUDICIAL INQUIRY?

  I WENT TO THE SAME MATCH LAST YEAR AND EXPERIENCED SIMILAR PROBLEMS THATS WHY

 I HAD A STAND TICKET THIS YEAR.

 AS I DROVE PAST THE KOP END ALLOCATED TO THE FOREST FANS IT SEEMED MUCH EASIER

 TO ORGANISE QUEUING MORE EASY TO POLICE AND MUCH EASIER TO GET ACCESS TO THE

 TERRACES.                                                    WHEN I GOT TO LEPPINGS LANE AREA IT SEEMED TOTAL CONFUSION.                             THE

 OTHER END                                                HAD OBVIOUSLY BEEN MODERNISED TO CATER FOR MODERN DAY CROWDS THE

 M                     R END                              WAS VICTORIAN.

 I CAN SAY                                                THAT AT THE FOREST SIDE AS SUPPORTERS WERE MAKING TOWARDS THE                               GROUND

 THEY WERE                                                GOING INTO THE GROUND WHEREAS AT LEPPINGS LANE LIVERPOOL FANS                               WERE       .

D ID YOU WITNESS ANYTHING THAT YOU CONSIDER TO BE A C R IM IN A L OFFENCE?

NO

Q33

DO YOU HAVE ANY VIEWS OR OBSERVATIONS ON THE WAY THE INCIDENT WAS HANDLED,

AFTER THE MATCH WAS STOPPED?           ^

I D O N ’T THINK THERE WAS ANY NEED FOR THE POLICE TO FORM A CORDON ACROSS THE

PITCH.

I THINK THE POLICE AND STEWARDS SHOULD HAVE BEEN HELPING A LOT MORE.

I THINK THE GATES ON THE PITCH WERE INADEQUATE IN BOTH NUMBERS AND THE WAY

THEY WERE UNMANNED.



IS THERE ANYTHING THAT YOU WISH TO ADD WHICH YOU FEEL IS VITAL TO THIS

JUDICIAL INQUIRY?

I FEEL THAT THE WEST STAND IN HILLSBOROUGH IS ONE OF THE WORST IN THE FOOTBALL

LEAGUE IT IS CONSTANTLY OVERCROWDED.    I HAVE BEEN WATCHING FOOTBALL MATCHES

OVER 21 YEARS AND ITS THE SAME IN LEAGUE MATCHES AS WELL AS CUP MATCHES.

I ALSO BELIEVE THERE WAS NO NEED FOR THE STAND TO BE PENNED OFF ESPECIALLY

WHEN THE WHOLE STAND IS TAKEN AND ALLOCATED TO ONE SET OF SUPPORTERS.

I WOULDN’T BLAME THE MAN WHO OPENED THE GATES I ’VE EVERY SYMPATHY FOR HIM.

I ALSO FEEL THERE SHOULD HAVE BEEN S;OME SORT OF CHANNELLING TO THE

T®siSTILES.                                 «
                                            V
I FEEL THAT THE GATES LEADING FROM LEPPltfGS LANE TO THE TURNSTILE AREA SHOULD

HAVE BEEN CLOSED WHEN THE CROWD INSIDE THE AREA GOT TOO MUCH TO ALLOW THE

CROWD TO DIE DOWN AND THEN OPEN THEM AGAIN SO IT WOULD BE A KIND OF FILTERING

 G33

 DO YOU HAVE ANY VIEWS OR OBSERVATIONS ON THE WAY THE

 INCIDENT WAS HANDLED, AFTER THE MATCH WAS STOPPED?

 I ^ T H E R E SEEMING TO BE TOTAL CONFUSION.

 2) ONE LIVERPOOL FAN RAN THE LENGTH OF, THE PITCH TOWARDS THE SPION KOP, WHICH

 I THOUGHT WAS WRONG. HE CAME BACK DOWN THE PITCH AND WAS RUGBY TACKLED BY A

 PC. THE POLICE THEN PUT A CORDON ACROSS THE PITCH. THESE SHOULD HAVE BEEN USED

 TO HELP .

3) THERE APPEARED TO BE NO ONE CONTROLLING THE INCIDENT.         C O M M I T "

4) THE AMBULANCE WENT DOWN THE PITCH AND PARKED BEHIND THE GOAL. THIS HAMPERED

 THINGS;   IT SHOULD HAVE BEEN IN FRONT.

5) TOTAL LACK OF COMMUNICATION RE THE SPEAKER ANNOUNCEMENTS.

6) THERE WAS NO ORGANISATION BETWEEN THE POLICE.

 7) POLICE OFFICERS WERE      SAT OUTSIDE THE GROUND IN CARS & VANS DOING NOTHING,

 NOT HELPING PEOPLE AWAY      FROM THE GROUND.

 8) IT WAS TOTAL MIS-MANAGEMENT ON BEHALF OF THE POLICE. THERE WERE ENOUGH

 POLICE THERE TO CONTROL THE SITUATION.


<319

 <354

 IS THERE      ANYTHING THAT YOU WISH TO ADD WHICH YOU FEEL IS

 VITAL TO      THIS JUDICIAL INQUIRY?

 1) TOO FEW TURNSTILES AT HILLSBOROUGH, POOR DESIGN OF GROUND.

 2) THERE      SHOULD HAVE BEEN A FILTER SYSTEM OF ALLOWING PEOPLE TO   GODOWN    THE

^ j ^ D S IN   QUEUES AND NOT ALLOWING 20,000 FANS TO GET THROUGH ASMALL ENTRANCE.

 3) SHOULD BE PRE-MATCH ENTERTAINMENT WHICH WOULD ENCOURAGE FANS TO ARRIVE

 EARLIER AND BE INSIDE THE GROUND AND NOT CAUSING PROBLEMS OUTSIDE.

 4) BELIEVE FA, LEAGUE &      SPORTS MINISTERS SHOULD GO AND QUEUE AND SEE EXACTLY

 WHAT GOES ON OUTSIDE THESE GROUNDS.

TO THE BARRIER BREAKING I FELL TO THE GROUND, MY LEFT SIDE OF MY FACE WAS

AGAINST THE CONCRETE TERRACE AND MY LEFT ARM WAS UP IN THE AIR TRAPPED

BETWEEN TWO PEOPLE.    I COULD NOT MOVE BECAUSE PEOPLE HAD FALLEN ON TOP OF ME.
                                                                              PAGE      6

BEFORE THE BARRIER BROKE I WAS IN PAIN BECAUSE OF THE CRUSH AND THERE WAS A

YOUTH ABOUT MY AGE ON MY LEFT WHO WAS SCREAMING AND SHOUTING WITH PAIN.          I

CANNOT REMEMBER WHAT HE WAS DRESSED IN AND WOULD NOT RECOGNISE HIM AGAIN,

ONCE I HAD FALLEN OVER I DID NOT SEE THIS YOUTH AGAIN.       BEFORE THE BARRIER

BROKE A MAN WHO WAS STANDING IN FRONT OF THE BARRIER TRIED TO PUSH ME BACK

AWAY FROM THE BARRIER TO EASE MY PAIN, BUT IT WAS SO CROWDED HE COULD NOT

PUSH ME AWAY.     I KNOW AT THIS TIME THE PLAYERS WERE OUT ON THE FIELD BUT I

DID NOT SEE ANY OF THE PLAY I DO NOT THINK THE GAME HAD STARTED WHEN THE

BARRIER BROKE BECAUSE I DID NOT SEE ANY PLAY.       ONCE I HAD FALLEN OVER I

COULD NOT GET UP I REMEMBER GRABBING SOMEONES JEANS AND SOMEONES ANKLE BUT

THE CROWD HAD SURGED OVER THE TOP OF US WHEN IT BROKE.       I DID NOT PASS OUT

eR -   IT WAS VERY HARD TO BREATH.    THE BARRIER WAS AGAINST MY LEGS WHICH WERE

BEING CRUSHED AGAINST IT, AND AS I FELL I FELT MY SHOES COME O F F , AFTER THIS

I COULD NOT SEE ANYTHING.     I DO NOT KNOW HOW LONG I WAS LYING TRAPPED IT

SEEMED LIKE HOURS, MY LEFT ARM HAD GONE COMPLETELY NUMB BY NOW. I WAS SHOUTING

AND SCREAMING AS WERE OTHER PEOPLE AROUND.       I GRABBED A BACK POCKET OF

SOMEONES JEANS WITH MY RIGHT ARM TO TRY AND GET UP BUT I COULDN'T SO I JUST

PUT IT DOWN AGAIN.     IT WAS VERY HOT AND DARK AND I COULD NOT HEAR ANYTHING,

I REMEMBER SOMEONES FOOT STICKING IN MY THROAT.       AFTER A WHILE I SAW SOME

LIGHT BUT MY HEAD WAS BY PEOPLES FEET.       THERE WERE PEOPLE ON TOP OF ME AND

f ^ S STARTED MOVING THESE PEOPLE.      I STILL COULD NOT MOVE BUT THEN I HEARD

SOMEONE SAY GIVE ME YOUR ARM.        I DON'T KNOW WHAT SIDE OR ARM HE GRABBED I

COULD NOT FEEL ANYTHING IN MY LEFT ARM BUT HE GOT ME UP AND SAT ME ON THE

TERRACE.    WHILE I SAT THERE I SAW PEOPLE LYING ALL AROUND, SOME HAD BLUE

FACES AND LOOKED DEAD.     I SAW A BARE CHESTED MAN IN FRONT OF ME JUST TO MY

LEFT HE LOOKED DEAD BUT     SOMEONE WAS TRYING TO GIVE HIM THE KISS OF LIFE.         HE

WAS ABOUT 25-30 YRS WEARING JEANS, HE HAD A MOUSTACHE.       THE MAN GIVING HIM

THE KISS OF LIFE WAS UPSET AND SAYING "NO, NO".       LATER I WAS CARRIED OUT

THROUGH THE TUNNEL AT THE REAR BY SOME POLICEMAN AND SAT ON THE GROUND AT THE

REAR OF THE STAND.     A WOMAN WAS LOOKING AFTER ME AND TOOK ME TO AN AMBULANCE.

 INJURIES TO ANY PERSON?

 i t h A L L Y THERE WAS NOT ANY ORGANISATION BY THE POLICE,   I ONLY SAW THREE

MOUNTED POLICEMEN, NO STEWARDS.     THE PROBLEM OF THE AMOUNT OF PEOPLE WAS

APPARENT ON MY ARRIVAL,     IT WAS OBVIOUS THEN BECAUSE I SAW YOUNG CHILDREN

BEING LIFTED UP AT THE FRONT,     THERE WAS A CONSTANT STREAM OF PEOPLE CLIMBING

OVER THE TURNSTILES.

 NO

 G53

 DO YOU HAVE ANY VIEWS OR OBSERVATIONS ON THE WAY THE INCIDENT WAS HANDLED

 AFTER THE MATCH WAS STOPPED?

 THE REPONSE WAS VERY SLOW WITH A COMPLETE LACK OF INFORMATION.               THERE WAS NO

 rA    e ST   FOR A DOCTOR MADE OVER THE T ANNOY.     IT SEEMED EXTRAORDINARY THAT

 BILLBOARDS HAD TO BE USED AS STRETCHERS AFTER SUCH A LONG TIME, AND THEN ONLY

 A FEW,       I THOUGHT THE CROWD BEHAVED MAGNIFICENTLY AFTER THEY REALISED WHAT

 HAPPENED.       THERE WAS A VAST AMOUNT OF THE POLICEMEN ON THE PITCH WHO APPEARED

 TO BE PREVENTING A CROWD INVASION OF THE PITCH, ON THE CENTRE LINE, AND NOT

 GETTING INVOLVED WITH THE ORGANISATION OF HELPING THE INJURED.

 IS THERE ANYTHING THAT YOU WISH TO ADD WHICH YOU FEEL IS VITAL TO THIS

M      CIAL INQUIRY?                         ______

AT THE SAME MATCH LAST YEAR OUTSIDE THE GROUND THERE WAS A SIMILAR PROBLEM,THE

DECISION TO OPEN THE GATES WAS THE ONLY ONE THAT COULD BE MADE GIVEN THE

AMOUNT OF PEOPLE AT THE FRONT.        I DIDN'T SEE ANY DRUNKEN FAN.           I THINK THE

ORGANISATION OF THE POLICE IN SHEFFIELD WAS PATHETIC.            IT WAS SIMILAR LAST

YEAR .

THE COMMUNICATION OF THE POLICE WAS VERY POOR, THEY SEEMED BEMUSED.

 THERE WAS A LACK OF CROWD CONTROL OUTSIDE THE GROUND AND PEOPLE WERE ALLOWED

 TO GET TOO CLOSE AS IT WAS A FREE FOR ALL IN THE END.

 THE MAIN CAUSE FOR WHAT HAPPENED WAS THE ALLOCATION OF TICKETS FOR THE FANS

 AND WHAT END EACH TEAM HAD. LIVERPOOL HAD THE BIGGEST FOLLOWING, BUT WERE

 GIVEN THE SMALLEST END. THERE WAS A CRUSH AT THAT END OF THE GROUND AT LAST

 YEAR'S GAME AND ALSO LIVERPOOL’S LEAGUE GAME THIS SEASON, SO THEY SHOULD HAVE

 KNOWN WHAT WAS GOING TO HAPPEN.

           We all travelled to Sheffield in                                car.   I was picked up here in

           Manchester at about 1200-1230 hours,

             After leaving Manchester we did not stop on route to Sheffield at all

             and we were not subjected to any travel delays.

             We parked the car on the Leppings Ln end of the ground on the car park

             On the walk down to the ground I saw a number of Liverpool fans

             drinking from cans near to Lepairtgs Ln.     Some of them were stopped by

             the Police and they were to La to drink up, which they did.



             I did not see or receive any Police directions on the walk to the

             ground.    I did not witness any disorder, fighting or drunkenness

             between my arrival point and the ground.         I would say that we got to

             the entranee to the ground, that being the Leppings Ln end at about
S o .   £.   1445 hours.

             Outside the turnstiles there were no orderly queues.           It was just a

             mass of people.     I did not see any stewards outside the turnstiles,           I

             just saw one Policeman on a horse but I don’t know what directions he

 L -\ L—     was giving,   if any, because he was too far away.



             I did not have any di ff i culty finding which turnstile to use to gain

             entry.    All the turnstiles were clearly marked.      There was great

             difficulty entering the ground because of the amount of people pushing

             and shoving outside the turnstiles.



             Outside the turnstiles I was standing near to some blue barriers to

             the right of the terrace turnstiles.      A Policeman on foot told us the
                                                                                  PAGE      3
                                                                                  S2699

G^rj^         gate had been opened to the right of the terrace turnstiles, so people
  O           just went through the gate. I did not enter through a turnstile,      I did
CeorvlD
              not witness who opened this gate, but obviously knew it had been

              opened.   I did witness unauthorised entry into the ground.

 o v r        I saw people climbing over the wall and gate situated between the
 w w r r r    terrace and West Stand turnstiles and also the people who had entered
  £ w n 2 y
              through the open gate.



              I did not hand my ticket in but during the crush in the Pen,    I lost it

              on the terraces.


  m           Once inside the ground,
                                           O V T ”   ' D i ^ e C T i C W ^ lC p /3
                                        I did not see any signs directing you to your

              match viewing point but I had been told not to use the middle two pens

              beyond the tunnel.   Me and         who I eventually stood with on the te

              therefore to start with went to the left round the back of the West

              Stand but we saw no signs directing you to the side terraces, so we

              made our way back to the tunnel.



 C A T        At the entrance to the tunnel there were no Police Officers or
'TUMa ^ C     Stewards giving directions.    My passage along the tunnel wasn't too

S^Nj)         bad, you had movement of your upper body.



              Between my entry into the ground and taking up my first match viewing

              point, as indicated on the grid as position One (marked PAM/1)(Exhibit

              No          ), I witnessed no disorder or other incidents at all.     I

              took up my first match viewing point with          ljust before kick off,

              as the players were already out on the pitch,



              ye stood in Pen four.     I did not see or was not near the barrier that

              broke in Pen three.

                 * As soon as we entered Pen four, after leaving the tunnel, you had very

                    restricted movement of your upper body and arms.                It was obvious that

                    there was already too many people on the terraces in these middle two

                    pens.



                    I experienced crowd crush as soon as I got onto the terraces.

 c   3 g >»x d
 ietCvC             At around kick off or not long after, there was a strong surge which

                    caused people to move forward but there was no movement back.                    I don’t

                    know what caused this surge.



                    After taking up our first match viewing position, we had not been

                    really standing still at any one point.             We were always being pushed

                    forwards.



axuTofe.            Just in front of me at about the position marked with a cross on the

                      id, there was a white mart in his fifties stood in front of me.                    He

                            ^ack to the pitch and was facing the West Stand.              He was

                    trapped in front of a barrier.          I, with others, tried to pull him off
To
                    the barrier but he died in our arms.            I was then pushed

                    forwards with a surge of people.           I let go of this man and the force

                    of the crowd moved me away from him.            I did not see him again.

                    As already stated,     he was a white male in his fifties.             He had grey

                    hair which was balding at the front.            He was not wearing glasses and

                    he did not have a. beard.        I can’t remember if he had a moustache.

                    He was wearing a red ’V ’ necked jumper with a red and white shirt

                    underneath.     I don’t know what kind of trousers or footwear he had on,

                    There is nothing more that I can describe which would make him stand

                    out any more.     I don’t think I would recognise him again.

         I remained in the position as indicated on the grid as No 2 for what

         seemed to me to be a long time before the crowd relaxed.     Me and

                 eventually got out of the Pen by climbing over the fencing to

         the left of Pen four.     We left the ground at about 1630 hours of our

         own accord.



         During the incident I did not witness anything that I consider to be a

         cr im ina1 offence.



         I would consider that the fences to the front of the terracing was a

         factor in the deaths and injuries to people.     As the fencing is angled

         back towards the crowd at the top, this hindered people getting out of
                             Ca t t G r? rr£ £ > A T 'P e u 2_im
         the Pens quickly.  Also the gates at the front of the pens are too

         small and there is not enough of them.     I was not injured at all

         during the tragedy.



         In relation to my views on how the incident was handled after the

         match was stopped,    I don’t think enough was done to get people out of

         the front of the pens.     The emergency services had a lack of equipment

         and there seemed to be a lack of co-ordination between them.      I could

CC?MH£ffl5not see the point of why a line of Police Officers was put across the

         centre of the pitch.     These Officers should have been used to get

         people out of the pens and help people on the pitch.



         The front fencing had to be pulled away by hand.     I was surprised that

         no equipment was available to cut away the fencing if the wire mesh

         was removed straight away with cutting equipment, then people would

         have been able to get out of the pens quicker.




                                                                      3?

         Liverpool fans should have been given the larger Spion Hop end of the

         ground and the allocation of tickets is wrong.



         if the gate outside the ground by the turnstiles had not have

         been opened people would have definitely have died outside the

 IS THERE ANYTHING THAT YOU WISH TO ADD WHICH YOU FEEL IS VITAL TO THIS

 JUDICIAL INQUIRY?

 1. TICKET ALLOCATION WAS WRONG,    IE LIVERPOOL SUPPORTERS WERE GIVEN THE

 SMALLEST PART OF THE GROUND.     (SHOULD HAVE HAD KOP END)

 2. NOT ENOUGH POLICE/STEWARD PRESENCE OUTSIDE THE GROUND TO CONTROL FANS AT

 TURNSTILES.

 3. THE USE OF THE AMOUNTED OFFICER TO REGAIN ORDER WAS TOTALLY INADEQUATE &

 THE WRONG TACTIC AT THAT STAGE.

 4. ALL FENCES ON TERRACING (FRONT & SIDE) DID NOT ALLOW ANY AVENUE OF ESCAPE

 FOR THE FANS WHO WERE IN DISTRESS.

 5. THE POLICE SUPERVISION INSIDE THE GROUND, ONCE THE SERIOUSNESS OF THE

 I N D E N T WAS OBVIOUS,^WAS VERY POOR,   IE THE LINES OF POLICE ON THE PITCH

 DOING NOTHING TQ ASSIST THE INJURED OR THE EVACUATION OF THE LEPPINGS LANE

 END.   ONE UNIFORMED OFFICER IN THE LINE TOOK IT UPON HIMSELF TO BREAK FROM

 THE LINE & RUN TO THE LEPPINGS LANE END TO ASSIST.

 6. THERE SEEMED TO BE A GREATER POLICE PRESENCE AWAY FROM THE GROUND

 CONTROLLING TRAFFIC & BLOCKING OFF SIDE ROADS THAN ACTUALLY AROUND THE GROUND

 CONTROLLING THE FANS WAITING TO GET INTO THE GROUND.

 7. A LACK OF MEDICAL ASSISTANCE ON HAND AT THE GROUND WAS OBVIOUS.

 8. WHERE FENCES ARE PRESENT THERE SHOULD BE LARGER GATES ALLOWING FANS THROUGH

 I ^ A S E S WHERE EVACUATION IS NECESSARY.

 9. UPDATED OR MODERNISED STADIUMS WITH A GREATER CONSIDERATION FOR SUPPORTERS

 SHOULD BE USED FOR IMPORTANT MATCHES.

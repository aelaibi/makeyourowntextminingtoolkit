RE: TRANSCRIPTS OF THE HILLSBOROUGH INQUESTS

I refer to your telephone request made to Ken Greenway on Friday 19 September 1997, for
South Yorkshire Police to provide the Hillsborough Scrutiny with a copy of the transcripts of both
the Hillsborough mini inquests and the main inquests.

The transcripts of the mini inquests which we supplied to you on Wednesday
24 September 1997, when you visited South Yorkshire were copied from documents held in the
Hillsborough Enquiry Document Store here at Heeley, Sheffield and are yours to retain.
The transcripts of the main inquests which we supplied at the same time were borrowed from
Her Majesty's Coroner for South Yorkshire (West), Mr Christopher Dorries, in order to save the
inordinate amount of time it would have taken to photocopy them.

The Coroner does not have any other copy of the transcripts and he has asked me to ensure that
they are returned to him when the Hillsborough Scrutiny has finished with them. I would be
pleased if you would confirm your intention to return the transcripts of the main inquests to
Mr Dorries at the Medico Legal Centre, Watery Street, Sheffield S3 7ET.

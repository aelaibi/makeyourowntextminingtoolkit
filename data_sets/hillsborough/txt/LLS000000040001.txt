  D ear Mr Fraser,

  I am w r i t i n g in the hope of being able to arrange a meeting between yo urself
  and the above named project.

  The H il l sborough Project is funded by Liverpool City Council and has been
  set up in order to research into all aspects and effects of the
  H i l l s b o r o u g h Disaster. Part of our research will involve m o n i t o r i n g
  the inquests of victims.            We have extensive knowledge and ex p e rience
  of Coroners Courts and Inquest Procedure and it in this respect
  that we feel we can be of assistance to the bereaved families.

  Dr Phil S e r m o n (the Project Director) and m y self would very much
  appreciate a m ee t i n g with you in order to explain more^fullythe work
  we are u n d e r t a k i n g and also to ascertain the p r e s en t situation
  w i t h regards to the inquests.

  Yours sincerely,




  S h eila Coleman
